             Thinking like a Transactional Lawyer

         Welcome to Contracts. While a year ago you might have thought that a "tort"
was a kind of fruity pastry, most students enter law school with some idea of what a
contract is. If we asked you to close your eyes and imagine a contract, what would you
see? Maybe you would imagine an old, musty document like the one the dwarves
persuaded Bilbo Baggins to sign in the movie, The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey.
You might think of a stack of "closing" papers signed by corporate executives
completing a multi-billion dollar merger. Or maybe you are reminded of an apartment
lease, your internet service provider agreement, or that document the plumber had
you sign before fixing your sink.

         Promises the Law Will Enforce. As you will discover in this course, a contract
need not be a written document at all.1 Oral contracts are not only enforceable but
are in fact ubiquitous. If there is a written document, is that piece of paper the
contract? Or is it just evidence that a contract was made? And what's the difference
between those concepts? If the contract is not necessarily the piece of paper, what is
it? On second thought, are you confident that you know what a contract is? We had
better fix that.

         One common definition of a contract is that it is (1) a promise (or a set of
promises) that (2) the law (3) will enforce.2 To "enforce" the contract means to
compel the person making the promise (the "promisor") to either perform it or to pay
damages for failing to do so. Enforcement by "the law" means that it will be done by
duly authorized agencies of the government through the court system,3 and not by

          1 Except when, for certain reasons in certain cases, the law requires a writing. At this point
you should start getting used to the idea that there are very few flat statements about contract law
that do not have exceptions. And, sometimes, the exceptions have exceptions.

          2 See, e.g., RESTATEMENT (SECOND) OF CONTRACTS § 1 (1981).

          3 Actually, enforcement can be a little more complicated in that it isn't only through the court
system. Sometimes parties contractually agree to have a private arbitrator decide their dispute.
Parties also sometimes have "self-help" means of enforcement. We will frequently refer to what
"courts" and "the court system" do with regard to contracts, but we don't mean to exclude other players
in a complex legal system. We've just read so many judicial opinions over the years that we sometimes
can't stop ourselves from talking about courts. (Note: We are only the first unit, and you already should
be figuring out that almost every general statement about contract law requires qualification. That,

hired Corleone family thugs4 or angry mobs with torches.5 The really complex part of
this definition is what kind of promises will the law enforce? It is fair to say that
perhaps half of the first-year Contracts course involves aspects of this single
question--and professors will routinely complain that they do not have enough time
to teach it as thoroughly as they like.

         Contracts in Transactional Foresight. An old joke about the traditional law
school Contracts course is that students could get through an entire casebook's worth
of material without seeing an actual contract. We don't want that to happen to you.
While the bulk of the course is necessarily made up of legal materials--typically
statutes and cases from appellate courts--the contract is always central to the
questions involved.

         While much of the contract law you will learn in this course will come from
cases, most parties don't anticipate a lawsuit at the time they enter into an
agreement. Transactional lawyers have gotten a rap, often unfairly, as being the
people who say "no" to a deal getting done. That is because transactional lawyering
is forward-thinking. It requires understanding the known situation of the parties, but
also considering the many potential unknown futures that might lie ahead. What
happens if the deal doesn't work out as wonderfully as the parties expect? The
foresight of a good transactional lawyer can sometimes prevent a future conflict or
else put the client in a better situation if a conflict does arise.

         Transactional lawyers must thus deal with a contract in the absence of a legal
case. We want you to do start the course by doing the same thing. Accordingly, our
jumping-off point will be for you to read and consider the transactional agreement in
this unit. Along with that document, we have added some comment boxes to provide
additional information as you read. After the agreement, you'll find a series of
Questions for Discussion that you should (surprise!) be thoroughly prepared to
discuss in class. After the questions, you will find a Problem that your professor may
ask you work or even to turn in. If the goal of law school is to teach you how to "think
like a lawyer," then one of the many goals of this Contracts course is to teach you how
to think like a transactional lawyer--that is, as someone who has the foresight and
practical wisdom to create and draft contracts, not merely to sue over them after they
are broken. The questions and problem at the end of this unit are the beginning of
our process of learning how to think transactionally.

         Without further ado, let us begin Contracts with a very formal-looking and
lawyer-drafted document entitled "Surrogate Parenting Agreement." Read it through
carefully. Note that it never once uses the term "contract." Is it a contract?

for better or for worse, is part of how lawyers earn their keep. If this stuff were simple, everyone would
do it.).

fourth (4th) month of pregnancy and said child does not survive, the Surrogate shall
receive $ 1,000.00 in lieu of the compensation enumerated in paragraph 4(A). In the
event of a miscarriage or stillbirth as described above, this Agreement shall terminate
and neither MARY BETH WHITEHEAD, Surrogate, nor WILLIAM STERN, Natural
Father, shall be under any further obligation under this Agreement.

         11. MARY BETH WHITEHEAD, Surrogate, and WILLIAM STERN, Natural
Father, shall have undergone complete physical and genetic evaluation, under the
direction and supervision of a licensed physician, to determine whether the physical
health and well-being of each is satisfactory. Said physical examination shall include
testing for venereal diseases, specifically including but not limited to, syphilis, herpes
and gonorrhea. Said venereal diseases testing shall be done prior to, but not limited
to, each series of inseminations.

         12. In the event that pregnancy has not occurred within a reasonable time, in
the opinion of WILLIAM STERN, Natural Father, this Agreement shall terminate by
written notice to MARY BETH WHITEHEAD, Surrogate, at the residence provided
to the ICNY by the Surrogate, from ICNY, as representative of WILLIAM STERN,
Natural Father.

         13. MARY BETH WHITEHEAD, Surrogate, agrees that she will not abort the
children conceived except, if in the professional medical opinion of the inseminating
physician, such action is necessary for the physical health of MARY BETH

WHITEHEAD or the child has been determined by said physician to be
physiologically abnormal. MARY BETH WHITEHEAD further agrees, upon the
request of said physician to undergo amniocentesis (see Exhibit "D") or similar tests
to detect genetic and congenital defects. In the event said test reveals that the fetus
is genetically or congenitally abnormal, MARY BETH WHITEHEAD, Surrogate,
agrees to abort the fetus upon demand of WILLIAM STERN, Natural Father, in
which event, the fee paid to the Surrogate will be in accordance to Paragraph 10. If
MARY BETH WHITEHEAD refuses to abort the fetus upon demand of WILLIAM
STERN, his obligations as stated in this Agreement shall cease forthwith, except as
to obligation of paternity imposed by statute.

         14. Despite the provisions of Paragraph 13, WILLIAM STERN, Natural
Father, recognizes that some genetic and congenital abnormalities may not be
detected by amniocentesis or other tests, and therefore, if proven to be the biological
father of the child, assumes the legal responsibility for any child who may possess
genetic or congenital abnormalities. (See Exhibits "E" and "F").

         15. MARY BETH WHITEHEAD, Surrogate, further agrees to adhere to all
medical instructions given to her by the inseminating physician as well as her
independent obstetrician. MARY BETH WHITEHEAD also agrees not to smoke
cigarettes, drink alcoholic beverages, use illegal drugs, or take non-prescription
medications or prescribed medications without written consent from her physician.
MARY BETH WHITEHEAD agrees to follow a prenatal medical examination
schedule to consist of no fewer visits than: one visit per month during the first seven
(7) months of pregnancy, two visits (each to occur at two-week intervals) during the
eighth and ninth month of pregnancy.

         16. MARY BETH WHITEHEAD, Surrogate, agrees to cause RICHARD
WHITEHEAD, her husband, to execute a refusal of consent form as annexed hereto
as Exhibit "G".

         17. Each party acknowledges that he or she fully understands this Agreement
and its legal effect, and that they are signing the same freely and voluntarily and
that neither party has any reason to believe that the other(s) did not freely and
voluntarily execute said Agreement.

18. In the event any of the provisions of this Agreement are deemed to be

invalid or unenforceable, the same shall be deemed severable from the remainder of

this Agreement and shall not cause the invalidity or unenforceability of the

10                      CHAPTER I: INTRODUCTION TO CONTRACT LAW
                          Questions for Discussion

         1. This Surrogate Parenting Agreement certainly looks like a contract. Is
it? Is there any difference between an "agreement" and a "contract"?

         2. This agreement includes three specific people as parties. Why these
three? Why is Richard Whitehead here, but not William Stern's wife (who is
referenced, but never by name)? You might want to look at paragraph 2 as you think
about this question.

         3. Re-read the words of agreement paragraph. What does this
paragraph state that one or more of the parties might argue about later?

         4. You may somewhere have heard the phrase freedom of contract, an
important concept in American law. But should Mary Beth Whitehead be free to agree
to terms like those in paragraph 1? More importantly, should the law enforce what
she agreed to here?

         5. Consider paragraph 3. Does it matter that the parties specify artificial
insemination? After all, it might be easier and cheaper to take care of this matter the
"natural" way. Can you think of any reasons why this term might affect the legal
enforceability of the agreement?

         6. Why exactly does the phrase "best interests of the child" keep
showing up in this document? Is someone intended to read that phrase and be affected
by it?

         7. The header to paragraph 4 states that the payment to Mary Beth
Whitehead is not "to be construed as a fee for termination of parental rights or a
payment in exchange for a consent to surrender the child for adoption." Who exactly
isn't supposed to be construing it that way? And what would happen if that person
(or persons) did construe it that way?

         8. Imagine that the price term in paragraph 4(A) was one dollar. Should
that affect the enforceability of this agreement? How about if the term were $1
million? Should the parties be free to bargain for any price term?

         9. In the top part of paragraph 4(C), the parties use the term,
"expenses...pursuant to her pregnancy." The parties then elaborate further on these
expenses in the four subparagraphs that follow. Isn't "expenses...pursuant to her
pregnancy" specific enough? Read through the various items in this four-paragraph
list and try to determine why those terms made it into the contract. Who benefits or
is protected by each term in this list?

______________________________________________________________________________

UNIT 1: THINKING LIKE A TRANSACTIONAL LAWYER  11
         10. Consider paragraph 5. Should the Whiteheads really be able to agree to
the "risk of death" for Mary Beth? Come to think of it, have you signed a document
agreeing to the "risk of death"?

         11. Why on earth would the psychiatric evaluations for the Whiteheads in
paragraph 6 be part of the agreement?

         12. Paragraph 9 provides that, in the event of William Stern's death, the
Whiteheads agree that the child will be placed in the custody of Stern's wife. Do the
parties have a right to agree to this term? Can Mrs. Stern, who is not a party to the
contract, sue to compel performance if the Whiteheads fail to comply?

         13. Notice that both paragraphs 13 and 15 involve Mary Beth Whitehead
limiting her right to act in certain ways in the future. Should the legal system, in
your view, enforce one, both, or neither of these two paragraphs? If you find one to be
enforceable and one not, what kind of a legal rule would you craft that would support
your conclusion?

         14. Can the parties really, as paragraph 18 provides, sever "any of the
provisions" from the agreement and enforce the remainder? Try omitting all of
paragraph 4, for example. What provisions could the parties reasonably drop and still
retain the benefit of their bargain?

                                          ______________________

Problem 1.1
         Suppose that you represent either Mary Beth Whitehead or William Stern

(your professor may assign you to one party or the other). Think about your client's
position and interests. Draft a list of changes to the Surrogate Parenting
Agreement--at least five of them--that you, as the attorney would want made on
your client's behalf to improve your client's situation.

         Beside each of your proposals, include two numbers: (1) the likely importance
to your client of your proposed change on a one-to-ten scale (with ten being the most
important), and (2) the percentage you would estimate your chances are of persuading
the other party to accept your proposal in a negotiation of the terms.

             INTRODUCTION TO CONTRACT LAW

                                           Part Two

               Thinking Like a Contract Litigator

                                           FOCUS OF THIS UNIT

         In the previous unit, we considered an agreement from the perspective of a
forward-thinking transactional lawyer, seeking to understand what the agreement
means and what its legal implications are. Transactional lawyers don't work in a legal
vacuum, however. Even the newest contract is affected by the legal environment in
which it comes into existence. A twenty-first century practitioner of American
contract law must, accordingly, consider that which has come before--cases, statutes,
and even the brooding presence of centuries-old English common law. The underlying
analytical skills for both a litigator and a transactional lawyer necessarily have a
great deal of overlap. Both are working in an environment of pre-existing law.

         Looking Backwards. As our ultimate goal is for you to be a well-rounded
lawyer, we will now undertake the task set out in this unit--evaluating a transaction
after the fact. The Surrogate Parenting Agreement from the previous unit did indeed
end up in a lawsuit. Two opinions resulting from that litigation follow in this unit
and will be instructive to us in understanding the basic issues and outline of the law
of contracts. While transactional lawyers are generally forward-looking in their focus,
we mustn't lose sight of the fact that thinking about the future requires a solid
understanding in what came before. The traditional law school case method of
instruction, whatever its faults may be, excels in training lawyers to deconstruct the
past.

         Just Enough Procedure to Be Dangerous. We think that your Civil Procedure
professor is a better source of information about civil procedure than we are.
Nonetheless, we'll make some occasional brief diversions into civil procedure when
we think it helpful to your understanding of how courts are grappling with matters
of contract law (which is a far more interesting subject, in our unbiased opinion).1
Here is one such diversion.

          1 Don't tell your Civil Procedure professor we said that. We don't want to cause trouble unless
we have a really good reason to do so. An old lawyer's maxim is "Never offend anyone unintentionally."

______________________________________________________________________________

UNIT 2: THINKING LIKE A CONTRACT LITIGATOR  13
         The two court opinions that follow arise from the agreement we considered in
the previous unit. The first opinion is from a trial-level court that considered evidence
presented by the parties in a bench trial. When we imagine a trial, we usually
envision a judge who resolves questions of law while an empaneled jury deliberates
and decides disputed facts. In a bench trial, the judge fills both roles and no jury is
involved. In this trial court opinion, the judge heard testimony from fact witnesses
with personal knowledge of the case--such as the parties to the agreement--as well
as from expert witnesses, like psychologists who could opine on matters calling for
expertise outside of the law. After the parties have presented their cases in a bench
trial, a judge will typically report findings of fact (resolving factual issues) and
conclusions of law (resolving legal issues). Based on those findings and conclusions,
a court will render its final judgment. While the parties may file various post-trial
motions, the final judgment is the point at which parties unhappy with the trial court
decision are able to appeal based on alleged error by the lower court.

         The second court opinion in this unit is the appeal of the trial court's decision
in the first opinion. Most cases you read in law school are appellate opinions, and the
second opinion is one of these, a decision by the New Jersey Supreme Court. As an
appellate court, a state supreme court has no ability to engage in its own fact finding.
In a sense, the higher court (much like the parties, for that matter) is stuck with the
factual determinations by the lower court. An appellate court can, however, fully
review the conclusions of law and the methods by which the trial court reached its
factual conclusions.

         As you read these two opinions arising from the same trial and same dispute
by the parties, consider the legal bases by which the courts reach their decisions. We
especially want you to focus on the role of contract law in the two opinions, including
the role that contract law plays in relation to other bodies of law, such as family law
and criminal law. Because trial court opinions are less common in law school, we have
taken the liberty of adding a few box annotations to help you through it. For the
appellate opinion, however, you are on your own. Good luck!

         The primary issue to be determined by this litigation is what are the best
interests of a child until now called "Baby M." All other concerns raised by counsel
constitute commentary.

         That commentary includes the need to determine      Pay close attention to the

         Thus, it is pursuant to N.J. Ct. R. 5:2-1, which defines actions cognizable in the
Superior Court, Chancery Division, Family Part, that this court, as the present day
successor to a part of that historic legacy of equity jurisdiction, applies said
jurisdiction to the issues herein presented; to wit, the best interest of a child and
contractual rights, if any, of the litigating parties.

        Venue is a concept of place--in this this context, where should a lawsuit be

the State of Florida. At the time of the institution of this

suit, Mr. and Mrs. Stern believed they had the right to have the child returned to

them in Bergen County. They believed "Baby M" was a resident of Bergen County;

hence, Mr. and Mrs. Stern began their action here. R.5:2-1 provides that an action

involving status of children should be brought in the county of domicile. There never

was a challenge to this placement of venue. This court concludes that venue is

properly in Bergen County.

Procedural History

        This litigation began on May 5, 1986, when Mr. and Mrs. William Stern filed

began dating in 1969. The couple was married in East Lansing, Michigan, on July 27,

1974, by a minister friend of the family. By now each had earned a Ph.D.--Mr. Stern

in bio-chemistry and Mrs. Stern in human genetics.

         The Sterns had discussed having children prior to and after their marriage but
mutually concluded that until Mrs. Stern's pediatric residency was completed, her
time to devote to family would be inadequate and thus unfair to the child. It was also
concluded that post-residency earnings would make the family more economically
secure.

         In 1972 and 1978, Mrs. Stern had experienced several episodes of numbness
in her fingers and toes and some leg weakness. [Mrs. Stern ultimately was diagnosed
with multiple sclerosis, which made the possibility of a pregnancy dangerous to her
health.]

         The Sterns explored the possibility of adoption but were discouraged in their
inquiries. They learned that because they were of different religions and they were
an "older couple," adoption of a newborn infant would be extremely difficult. Indeed,
the multi-year wait would have them in their very late 30's to early 40's if a child
were to become available. Moreover, following the death of William Stern's mother in
1983, the desirability of having his own biological offspring became compelling to
William Stern, thus making adoption a less desirable alternative

         In 1984, Mr. Stern read an ad from the Infertility Center of New York
(hereinafter ICNY) and with the consent of Mrs. Stern, they decided to pursue
surrogate parenting. ICNY is an agency that provides surrogate mother candidates
to applicants seeking a child through an alternative means of reproduction.

         Mary Beth Whitehead is presently 29 years old. [She and Richard Whitehead
met and were married in 1973, when she was 16 and he was 24.]

         Their first child, Ryan, was born on July 7, 1974. The Whiteheads had their
second child, whom they named Tuesday, on January 27, 1976.3 Within several
months after their daughter's birth, Richard and Mary Beth Whitehead decided that
they did not want to have any more children, that they were "content" with the two
children and thought they had the "perfect family." There was mutual agreement that
Mr. Whitehead should have a vasectomy to prevent further impregnation of Mrs.
Whitehead. The Whiteheads had created their family and wanted no further children.

         In or about August or September 1984, Mr. and Mrs. Stern made inquiries into
several surrogate parenting programs throughout the United States. Initially, they
had hoped to find a woman who would function as a gestational surrogate only; that
is, a woman who would be implanted with an egg of Mrs. Stern fertilized by the sperm
of Mr. Stern. At that time, however, in vitro fertilization was largely experimental
and not a generally available option.

    Mr. and Mrs. Stern contacted the Infertility Center of New York and were sent

a brochure. The brochure explained in general terms the surrogate parenting

procedure and the services which ICNY offered, including the screening of potential

surrogate candidates. On December 3, 1984, Mr. Stern      The agreement referenced here

They were eventually told of a potential surrogate enrolled in the program who had

been unsuccessful working with another couple for approximately eight months. The

woman was described as being very dedicated and anxious to work with another

couple. The candidate was Mary Beth Whitehead.

         Mrs. Whitehead was enrolled in the ICNY surrogate program since the spring
1984. Mrs. Whitehead testified she was motivated to join the program in the hopes of
"giving the most loving gift of happiness to an unfortunate couple." Mrs. Whitehead
also felt that the surrogate's fee would assist her in providing for her children's long
range educational goals. Her signed application also reveals these reasons.

         Mrs. Whitehead had learned of surrogate parenting through an advertisement
in The Asbury Park Press. Mrs. Whitehead spoke of her interest in the surrogacy
program to no one other than Mr. Whitehead over the next week. Although Mr.
Whitehead was initially opposed to Mrs. Whitehead's involvement in the surrogate
program, he ultimately deferred to his wife's wishes. Mrs. Whitehead contacted ICNY
and was provided with an application form which she filled out and submitted to the
center.

18  CHAPTER I: INTRODUCTION TO CONTRACT LAW
         In or about April 1984 Mrs. Whitehead submitted to a psychological evaluation
to determine her suitability as a potential surrogate. She was evaluated by interview
and testing. The examiner reported that although Mrs. Whitehead expected to have
strong feelings about giving up the baby at birth, she was sincere in her plan to
become a surrogate mother and has thought extensively about the plan. Although the
examiner noted that it would be important to explore with Mrs. Whitehead in more
depth whether she would be able to relinquish the child in final analysis, Mrs.
Whitehead was recommended as an appropriate candidate for a surrogate volunteer.
This report was made for ICNY prior to Mrs. Whitehead working for her first childless
couple. It was this fact of prior evaluation that the Sterns relied on. Mrs. Whitehead
testified to receiving two counseling sessions at ICNY.

        In or about May 1984 ICNY matched Mrs. Whitehead with a married couple

(not Mr. and Mrs. Stern) who sought to engage Mrs. Whitehead as a surrogate. The

prospective surrogate was presented with a proposed form of surrogate parenting

agreement. The proposed agreement was almost identical to the agreement Mrs.

Whitehead would later sign with Mr. Stern. As required by the center, she consulted

independent counsel on May 24, 1984, who after

spending several hours discussing the possible legal Provisions of a formally-drafted

Her effort for this couple was unsuccessful. She was then introduced to Mr. and Mrs.

Stern.

         Mr. and Mrs. Stern met with Mr. and Mrs. Whitehead in January 1985 in New
Brunswick, New Jersey. The site was chosen because it is approximately mid-way
between the respective residences. The parties discussed the proposed surrogacy
arrangement and other elements of their contemplated relationship, including Mrs.
Whitehead's duty to relinquish custody of the child to Mr. and Mrs. Stern. Mrs.
Whitehead made it clear she would not appear on the Sterns' doorstep. All she wanted
was an annual picture and letter report of progress. At the conclusion of the meeting,
it was agreed that Mrs. Whitehead would be the surrogate mother of a child to be
born for Mr. and Mrs. Stern.

         On February 6, 1986 Mr. Stern and Mr. and Mrs. Whitehead signed the
surrogate parenting agreement. It was in all material respects the same contract that
Mrs. Whitehead signed the spring of 1984. At that time, Mr. and Mrs. Whitehead had
consulted with an attorney. As already noted, he read and explained the contract to
them. Several minor changes were negotiated. Mrs. Whitehead believed the second
contract to be as the first and thus, although able to do so, chose not to seek legal
advice prior to signing the subject agreement. It is noted with more than passing
importance that Mrs. Stern was not a signatory to the agreement.

1985, Mrs. Whitehead was inseminated with the seminal fluid of Mr. Stern nine
times. Finally, in July 1985 she conceived

birth, she and her husband took the child and fled with their family to Florida, later
defying a New Jersey court order. Baby "M" ultimately was taken into custody by
Florida authorities on July 31, and returned to New Jersey for the litigation.]

    A total of 38 witnesses testified at this trial, 23 fact witnesses and 15 experts.

to the suitability of the parties as parents and the best interest of the child.]

sought to bring into existence a child by conscious pre-arrangement which, as far as

biologically possible, would be genetically their own. The surrogate consciously chose

to bear a child for another couple with the understanding that she would not contest

but would consent to their adoption of it.

    Concerns have been expressed about the efficacy of surrogate arrangements.

They are: (1) that the child will not be protected; (2) the potential for exploitation of

the surrogate mother; (3) the alleged denigration of human dignity by recognizing

any agreement in which a child is produced for money; (4) surrogacy is invalid

because it is contrary to adoption statutes and other child benefit laws such as

statutes establishing standards for termination of

parental rights; (5) it will undermine traditional notions Pay attention to the policy

with protection to the child, with its own guardian and experts retained to aid the
court in its best interests determination.

         The second argument against surrogacy is that the surrogate mother will be
exploited. To the contrary. It is the private adoption that has that great potential for,
if not actual, exploitation of the mother. In the private adoption, the woman is already
pregnant. The biological father may be unknown or at best uninterested in his
obligations. The woman may want to keep the child but cannot do so for financial
reasons. There is the risk of illegal consideration being paid to the mother. In
surrogacy, none of these "downside" elements appear. The arrangement is made when
the desire and intention to have a family exist on the couple's part. The surrogate has
an opportunity to consult, take advice and consider her act and is not forced into the
relationship. She is not yet pregnant.

The third argument is that to produce or deal with a child for money denigrates

human dignity. With that premise, this court urgently agrees. The 13th Amendment

to the United States Constitution is still valid law. The law of adoption in New Jersey

does prohibit the exchange of any consideration for obtaining a child. The fact is,

however, that the money to be paid to the surrogate is not being paid for the surrender

of the child to the father. And that is just the point--at      "Neither slavery nor involuntary
birth, mother and father have equal rights to the child         servitude, except as a
absent any other agreement. The biological father pays          punishment for crime whereof
the surrogate for her willingness to be impregnated and         the party shall have been duly

carry his child to term. At birth, the father does not          convicted, shall exist within the
purchase the child. It is his own biological genetically        United States, or any place
related child. He cannot purchase what is already his.          subject to their jurisdiction." U.S.
                                                                CONST. AMEND. XIII (ratified 1865).

The fourth argument against surrogacy is that it

is a concept running contrary to the laws of adoption in New Jersey. It is in this

court's view that the laws of adoption in this State do not apply to surrogacy contracts.

Surrogacy was not a viable procreation alternative and was unknown when the laws

of adoption were passed. The same rationale must attach to laws dealing with

termination of parental rights. Indeed, it is held that the only concept of law that can

presently attach to surrogacy arrangements are contract law principles and parens

patriae concepts for the benefit of the child. These are the only pole stars available

for this court to chart its course on the issues of surrogacy.

         The fifth argument against surrogacy is that it will undermine traditional
notions of family. How can that be when the childless husband and wife so very much
want a child? They seek to make a family. They intend to have a family. The surrogate
mother could not make a valid contract without her husband's consent to her act. This
statement should not be construed as antifeminist. It means that if the surrogate is
married, her husband will, in all probability, have to sign the contract to establish
his non-paternity pursuant to the New Jersey Parentage Law. Both sides of the
equation must agree.

______________________________________________________________________________

UNIT 2: THINKING LIKE A CONTRACT LITIGATOR                      21
         The sixth and final argument suggests that an elite upper economic group of
people will use the lower economic group of woman to "make their babies." This
argument is insensitive and offensive to the intense drive to procreate naturally and
when that is impossible, to use what lawful means are possible to gain a child. This
intense desire to propagate the species is fundamental. It is within the soul of all men
and women regardless of economic status.

         During the course of the testimony offered by the principals to this writing, the
court was told on several occasions that a writing was executed by them. Indeed, that
writing was marked into evidence. The court was further told by the parties that they
all understood their obligations under the contract. Specifically, it was understood by
all that Mr. Stern's sperm would be used to artificially inseminate Mrs. Whitehead.
Upon conception, Mrs. Whitehead would carry the child and when she gave birth, she
would then surrender the infant to the biological father and his wife. Mrs. Whitehead
would also voluntarily renounce her parental rights to permit Mrs. Stern to adopt the
infant. Mrs. Stern, it must be noted, is not a party to the contract. This was to avoid
any possible inference that there is a violation of N.J. STAT. ANN. § 9:3-54 (which
prohibits giving a consideration to obtain an adoptable child). Mr. Whitehead signed
a certification pursuant to Id. § 9:17-44 establishing his non-paternity. Mr. Stern
agreed to pay Mrs. Whitehead $10,000 for conceiving and bearing his child.

         Fundamentally, when there were no time constraints, when Mrs. Whitehead
was not pregnant, when each party had the opportunity to obtain advice (legal,
medical and/or psychological), the parties expressed their respective offers and
acceptances to each other and reduced their understanding to a writing. If the mutual
promises were not sufficient to establish a valid consideration, then certainly there
was consideration when there was conception. The male gave his sperm; the female
gave her egg in their pre-planned effort to create a child--thus, thus, a contract.

         For the past year, there has been a child in being. She is alive and well. She is
tangible proof of that which the Whiteheads and Mr. Stern in concert agreed to do.
The child was conceived with a mutual understanding by the parties of her future
life. Except now, Mrs. Whitehead has failed to perform one of her last promises, which
was to surrender the child and renounce parental rights. She has otherwise
performed the personal service that she had undertaken--conception and carrying
the child to term. The terms of the contract have been executed but for the surrender.

         A person who has promised is entitled to rely on the concomitant promise of
the other promisor. This court holds therefore that in New Jersey, although the
surrogacy contract is signed, the surrogate may nevertheless renounce and terminate
the contract until the time of conception. She may be subject then for such monetary
damages as may be proven. Specific performance to compel the promised conception,
gestation, and birth shall not be available to the male promisor. However, once
conception has occurred the parties' rights are fixed, the terms of the contract are
firm and performance will be anticipated with the joy that only a newborn can bring.

______________________________________________________________________________

22  CHAPTER I: INTRODUCTION TO CONTRACT LAW
It is argued that the contract in this case is one of adhesion. It was a writing

printed by and supplied by ICNY. That its terms were not immutable is shown by the

testimony of the attorney, Saul Radow, who by deposition reported negotiating

changes to the written contract; albeit, minor changes. By definition, a contract of

adhesion is one in which one party has no alternative but to accept or reject the other

party's terms and there are no options by which the party may obtain the product or

service. Here, neither party has a superior bargaining position. Each had what the

other wanted. A price for the service each was to perform was struck and a bargain

reached. One did not force the other. Neither had expertise that left the other at a

disadvantage. Neither had disproportionate bargaining power. Although the contract

was a form, there is no proof that it was absolute and At this point, the court begins to

could not be altered. Defendant offered no proof to this consider various defenses to

end. Mrs. Whitehead, acknowledged that minor changes      contract enforcement raised by
were bargained for. There is no evidence of an absence    the Whiteheads. We will revisit
of good faith or fair dealing. This is not a contract of  several of these defenses during
adhesion. Henningsen v. Bloomfield Motors, Inc., 32 N.J.  the course.

358 (1960).

         Defendants argue unconscionability. They claim the terms are manifestly
unfair or oppressive. These terms were known to Mrs. Whitehead from her earlier
surrogate contracting experience. She read the second contract, albeit briefly, prior
to signing it. She was aware of her compensation. She had been pregnant before and
had to be aware of the risks of pregnancy. Her obligation included physical
examination for her own welfare as well as the welfare of the fetus. Mrs. Whitehead
says that Mr. Stern undertook no risks. To compare the risk of pregnancy in a woman
to the donation of sperm by the man would be unconscionable. This, however, is the
bargain Mrs. Whitehead sought and obtained. Mr. Stern did take a risk, however,
whether the child would be normal or abnormal, whether accepted or rejected he
would have a lifetime obligation and responsibility to the child as its natural and
biological father.

         To the issue of unconscionability, defendants fail to show proof of overreaching
or disproportionate bargaining that result in an unfair contract. Mrs. Whitehead was
anxious to contract. At the New Brunswick meeting, she pressed for a definitive
statement by the Sterns. She knew just what she was bargaining for. This court finds
that she has changed her mind, reneged on her promise and now seeks to avoid her
obligations. Unconscionability claims arise, more often than not, in consumer
contracts for products or services. The seller is in the dominant position and the buyer
must comply or there is no deal. Not so here--either party could have walked away
from the other. Either party would then have continued on ICNY's roster of available
surrogates and childless families seeking a surrogate. They chose not to do so. The
bargain here was one for totally personal service. It was a very scarce service Mrs.
Whitehead was providing. Indeed, it might even be said she had the dominant
bargaining position for without her Mr. Stern had no other immediate source
available. Each party sought each other to fulfill their needs.

______________________________________________________________________________

UNIT 2: THINKING LIKE A CONTRACT LITIGATOR                                             23
         It is argued by amicus that the $ 10,000 to be paid Mrs. Whitehead is so low
as to be unconscionable. In counterpoint, it is stated that not all services can be
compensated by money. Millions of men and women work for each other in their
marital relationship. There may even be mutual inequality in the value of the work
performed but the benefits obtained from the relationship serve to reject the concept
of equating societal acts to a monetary balancing. Perhaps the risk was great for the
money to be paid but the risk was what Mrs. Whitehead chose to assume and at the
agreed upon fee. And it is assumed she received other intangible benefits and
satisfaction from doing what she did. Her original application set forth her highly
altruistic purpose. Notwithstanding amicus' position, all in this world cannot be
equated to money.

         It is defendants' claim of unconscionability. They must show such unfairness,
overreaching, bargaining disparity or patent unfairness that no reasonable person
acting without duress would accept the contract terms. Toker v. Westerman, 113 N.J.
Super. 452, 454 (Cty. D. Ct.1970). This, defendants have failed to do.

         Defendants next claim relief from the contract because the Whiteheads had no
attorney at the time they entered the contract. It is hornbook law that any person
who possesses legal capacity may be bound by a contract even when it is entered
without representation unless there is fraud, overreaching or undue influence which
caused the party to enter the contract.

         It was Dr. Vetter, one of defendants' own psychiatrists, who testified
unequivocally that the Whiteheads had legal capacity to contract. There were no
mental disabilities. They understood what they were doing. They understood the
contract terms. That there was capacity to contract was proven by a preponderance
of the credible evidence. Furthermore, Mr. Whitehead testified they signed the
contract at their New Jersey home because they did not wish to travel to New York.
Their prior counsel was available to them. They chose not to call him. It is well settled
that disparity of education or sophistication is not considered grounds for avoidance
of a contract. Dundee Chemical Works v. Connor, 46 N.J. Eq. 576 (E. & A.1890). In
Dundee, the adversaries were a homemaker-executrix and an attorney. The Court
held it would not weigh the disparate skills to void a contract. This leaves just fraud,
undue influence or illegality. As to the latter two factors this court says no evidence
has been shown of illegality or undue influence. This court has a sense that Mrs.
Whitehead would be a very difficult person to unduly influence once her mind is made
up.

         As to the claim of fraud, defendants allege they may rescind the contract
because of the fraud perpetrated by plaintiffs. The court first defines the terms with
which we are to treat. Legal fraud has four elements: (1) a material misrepresentation
of a fact; (2) known to be false; (3) upon which a party relied; and (4) to its damage.
Equitable fraud eliminates the element of knowledge. Thus, even if the promisor did
not know of the fact being false, it would be inequitable to permit contractual recovery
and the injured party should be allowed the option to sustain the contract or rescind.
Jewish Center of Sussex County v. Whale, 86 N.J. 619 (1981).

______________________________________________________________________________

24  CHAPTER I: INTRODUCTION TO CONTRACT LAW
[The court concludes that no false statements were made.]

         There is no fraud, legal or equitable, that would allow Mr. and Mrs. Whitehead
to rescind their contract.

         It is further argued that the contract is illusory; that is to say, that only one of
the parties has an obligation, the other only benefits, that there is no mutuality of
obligation. This does not mean equality of obligation. See Friedmann v. Tappan
Development Corp., 22 N.J. 523 (1956); SAMUEL WILLISTON, THE LAW OF CONTRACTS,
§ 105A at 421. Such is not the case. Mr. Stern gave his sperm; Mrs. Whitehead gave
her egg. Together the miracle of a new life was obtained. Mrs. Whitehead argues Mr.
Stern does not have to take the child under certain circumstances which have not
happened and are not before this court. She is arguing, hypothetically, "if." It is
suggested again that this court is dealing with the facts before it. Even assuming
arguendo, that the court were to address the issue of the illusory contract as stated
by defendants, the conclusion would be the same. The Whiteheads argue that Mr.
Stern does not have to take the baby if it is imperfect; but the fact is the contract does
provide that there is an obligation and responsibility, that there is a life long
responsibility by Mr. Stern for the child's support and welfare. The contract is not
illusory.

         [The court analyzes the question whether there is a right to assisted
reproduction under the U.S. Constitution.]

         For the foregoing reasons, this court concludes and holds that the surrogate-
parenting agreement is a valid and enforceable contract pursuant to the laws of New
Jersey. . . . This court further finds that Mrs. Whitehead has breached her contract
in two ways: (1) by failing to surrender to Mr. Stern the child born to her and Mr.
Stern and (2) by failing to renounce her parental rights to that child.

         What are the remedies available to the plaintiff? The remedies that exist for
breach of a contract are an award of money damages or specific enforcement of the
terms of the contract. There are, of course, other remedies but they are neither
relevant nor applicable here. Monetary damages cannot possibly compensate plaintiff
for the loss of his bargain because of defendant's breach. The singular subject of the
contract further mitigates against an award of damages.

Plaintiff acknowledges that before the remedy of specific performance can be

used it must be shown that the contract was entered into with understanding and

free will. Dr. Vetter, the Whitehead psychiatric expert, testified that the Whiteheads

were competent when the contract was signed and they understood the terms. It must

also be shown that the contract was entered in good faith, without fraud and is not

unenforceable because of public policy. By reason of the    Remedies will be another
findings heretofore made, to wit: there is no evidence of   significant issue in our study of
fraud and the parties voluntarily entered the agreement,    contract law. Legal rights arising
indeed they were all very anxious to do so, such contracts  from a contract breach are not

are not contrary to public policy. Indeed New Jersey has    terribly useful unless the law
                                                            provides a remedy for the

                                                            breach.

why this court should not order specific performance.        numbered item list at this point,

parties' conduct was fair and reasonable. Will the relief    errors.

afforded by the remedy be unreasonable? If specific performance is ordered, the result

will be just what the parties bargained for and the contract contemplated. Mr. Stern

wanted progeny, a child. Mrs. Whitehead wanted to give the child she would bear to

a childless couple. His sperm fertilized her egg. A child was born. Until the child was

placed in his home he never knew the stress and bliss, the responsibilities and

rewards of a child. The Whiteheads have two children. They did not want any more.

Theirs was the perfect family, Mr. Whitehead testified. The Whiteheads agreed that

Mr. Whitehead should get a vasectomy to prevent further conception. It is suggested

that Mrs. Whitehead wanted a baby, now that she is older than when her first two

children were born, to experience and fulfill herself again as a woman. She found the

opportunity in a newspaper advertisement. She received her fulfillment. Mr. Stern

did not.

         At this point the court would enter its order for specific performance, but an
additional inquiry is necessary. Since we here deal with a human life of only one year,
since we treat with, as the guardian ad litem has said "the most precious and unique
thing on this earth, a small vulnerable and lovable child," inquiry must be made to
determine if the result of such an order for specific performance would be in the child's
best interest. This court holds that whether there will be specific performance of this
surrogacy contract depends on whether doing so is in the child's best interest. . . .

         [The court extensively reviews the evidence and concludes that the child's best
interest is to be with the Sterns.]

    This court enters judgment in favor of plaintiffs as follows:

         (1) The surrogate parenting agreement of February 6, 1985, will be specifically
enforced.

         (2) The prior order of the court giving temporary custody to Mr. Stern is
herewith made permanent. Prior orders of visitation are vacated.

    (3) The parental rights of defendant Mary Beth Whitehead are terminated.

    (4) Mr. Stern is formally adjudged the father of Melissa Stern.

         (5) The New Jersey Department of Health, Bureau of Vital Statistics and its
ancillary and/or subordinate state or county agencies are directed to amend all
records of birth to reflect the paternity and name of the child to be Melissa Stern.

         Review Question 1. The trial court states that it "was further told by the
parties that they all understood their obligations under the contract." Why can't we
just end the inquiry there? What, based on this opinion, do you now understand to be
the elements of an enforceable contract?

         Review Question 2. The court notes that "Mr. and Mrs. Whitehead had
consulted with an attorney" when they signed the 1984 agreement with a prior
couple. Why does that matter? Can't parties enter into contracts without attorneys
being involved? What value--if any--can attorneys add to the process of contracting?

         Review Question 3. The court observes that the "remedies that exist for breach
of a contract are an award of money damages or specific enforcement of the terms of
the contract." Which type of remedy does the trial court enforce and why?

UNIT 2: THINKING LIKE A CONTRACT LITIGATOR  27
                IN RE BABY M
       Supreme Court of New Jersey
    537 A.2d 1227, 109 N.J. 396 (1988)

WILENTZ, C.J., delivered the opinion of the Court:

         In this matter the Court is asked to determine the validity of a contract that
purports to provide a new way of bringing children into a family. For a fee of $10,000,
a woman agrees to be artificially inseminated with the semen of another woman's
husband; she is to conceive a child, carry it to term, and after its birth surrender it to
the natural father and his wife. The intent of the contract is that the child's natural
mother will thereafter be forever separated from her child. The wife is to adopt the
child, and she and the natural father are to be regarded as its parents for all purposes.
The contract providing for this is called a "surrogacy contract," the natural mother
inappropriately called the "surrogate mother."

         We invalidate the surrogacy contract because it conflicts with the law and
public policy of this State. While we recognize the depth of the yearning of infertile
couples to have their own children, we find the payment of money to a "surrogate"
mother illegal, perhaps criminal, and potentially degrading to women. Although in
this case we grant custody to the natural father, the evidence having clearly proved
such custody to be in the best interests of the infant, we void both the termination of
the surrogate mother's parental rights and the adoption of the child by the
wife/stepparent. We thus restore the "surrogate" as the mother of the child. We
remand the issue of the natural mother's visitation rights to the trial court, since that
issue was not reached below and the record before us is not sufficient to permit us to
decide it de novo.

         We find no offense to our present laws where a woman voluntarily and without
payment agrees to act as a "surrogate" mother, provided that she is not subject to a
binding agreement to surrender her child. Moreover, our holding today does not
preclude the Legislature from altering the current statutory scheme, within
constitutional limits, so as to permit surrogacy contracts. Under current law,
however, the surrogacy agreement before us is illegal and invalid.

         [The court recites some of the facts stated in the trial court opinion above.]

         The Sterns claim that the surrogacy contract is valid and should be enforced,
largely for the reasons given by the trial court.

         We have concluded that this surrogacy contract is invalid. Our conclusion has
two bases: direct conflict with existing statutes and conflict with the public policies of
this State, as expressed in its statutory and decisional law.

Conflict With Statutory Provisions

         One of the surrogacy contract's basic purposes, to achieve the adoption of a
child through private placement, though permitted in New Jersey "is very much
disfavored." Sees v. Baber, 377 A.2d 628 (N.J. 1977). Its use of money for this

______________________________________________________________________________

28  CHAPTER I: INTRODUCTION TO CONTRACT LAW
purpose--and we have no doubt whatsoever that the money is being paid to obtain
an adoption and not, as the Sterns argue, for the personal services of Mary Beth
Whitehead--is illegal and perhaps criminal. N.J. Stat. Ann. § 9:3-54.4 In addition to
the inducement of money, there is the coercion of contract: the natural mother's
irrevocable agreement, prior to birth, even prior to conception, to surrender the child
to the adoptive couple. Such an agreement is totally unenforceable in private
placement adoption.

         Integral to these invalid provisions of the surrogacy contract is the related
agreement, equally invalid, on the part of the natural mother to cooperate with, and
not to contest, proceedings to terminate her parental rights, as well as her contractual
concession, in aid of the adoption, that the child's best interests would be served by
awarding custody to the natural father and his wife--all of this before she has even
conceived, and, in some cases, before she has the slightest idea of what the natural
father and adoptive mother are like.

         The surrogacy contract conflicts with: (1) laws prohibiting the use of money in
connection with adoptions; (2) laws requiring proof of parental unfitness or
abandonment before termination of parental rights is ordered or an adoption is
granted; and (3) laws that make surrender of custody and consent to adoption
revocable in private placement adoptions.

         (1) Our law prohibits paying or accepting money in connection with any
placement of a child for adoption. Violation is a high misdemeanor. Excepted are fees
of an approved agency (which must be a non-profit entity) and certain expenses in
connection with childbirth.

         Considerable care was taken in this case to structure the surrogacy
arrangement so as not to violate this prohibition. The arrangement was structured
as follows: the adopting parent, Mrs. Stern, was not a party to the surrogacy contract;
the money paid to Mrs. Whitehead was stated to be for her services--not for the

4 [By the court] N.J. STAT. ANN. § 9:3-54 reads as follows:
         a. No person, firm, partnership, corporation, association or agency shall make,

offer to make or assist or participate in any placement for adoption and in connection
therewith

                   (1) Pay, give or agree to give any money or any valuable consideration,
         or assume or discharge any financial obligation; or

                   (2) Take, receive, accept or agree to accept any money or any valuable
         consideration.
         b. The prohibition of subsection a. shall not apply to the fees or services of any
approved agency in connection with a placement for adoption, nor shall such
prohibition apply to the payment or reimbursement of medical, hospital or other
similar expenses incurred in connection with the birth or any illness of the child, or to
the acceptance of such reimbursement by a parent of the child.
         c. Any person, firm, partnership, corporation, association or agency violating
this section shall be guilty of a high misdemeanor.

UNIT 2: THINKING LIKE A CONTRACT LITIGATOR  29
adoption; the sole purpose of the contract was stated as being that "of giving a child
to William Stern, its natural and biological father"; the money was purported to be
"compensation for services and expenses and in no way . . . a fee for termination of
parental rights or a payment in exchange for consent to surrender a child for
adoption"; the fee to the Infertility Center ($7,500) was stated to be for legal
representation, advice, administrative work, and other "services." Nevertheless, it
seems clear that the money was paid and accepted in connection with an adoption.

         The Infertility Center's major role was first as a "finder" of the surrogate
mother whose child was to be adopted, and second as the arranger of all proceedings
that led to the adoption. Its role as adoption finder is demonstrated by the provision
requiring Mr. Stern to pay another $7,500 if he uses Mary Beth Whitehead again as
a surrogate, and by ICNY's agreement to "coordinate arrangements for the adoption
of the child by the wife." The surrogacy agreement requires Mrs. Whitehead to
surrender Baby M for the purposes of adoption. The agreement notes that Mr. and
Mrs. Stern wanted to have a child, and provides that the child be "placed" with Mrs.
Stern in the event Mr. Stern dies before the child is born. The payment of the $10,000
occurs only on surrender of custody of the child and "completion of the duties and
obligations" of Mrs. Whitehead, including termination of her parental rights to
facilitate adoption by Mrs. Stern. As for the contention that the Sterns are paying
only for services and not for an adoption, we need note only that they would pay
nothing in the event the child died before the fourth month of pregnancy, and only
$1,000 if the child were stillborn, even though the "services" had been fully rendered.
Additionally, one of Mrs. Whitehead's estimated costs, to be assumed by Mr. Stern,
was an "Adoption Fee," presumably for Mrs. Whitehead's incidental costs in
connection with the adoption.

         Mr. Stern knew he was paying for the adoption of a child; Mrs. Whitehead
knew she was accepting money so that a child might be adopted; the Infertility Center
knew that it was being paid for assisting in the adoption of a child.

         The prohibition of our statute is strong. Violation constitutes a high
misdemeanor, a third-degree crime, carrying a penalty of three to five years
imprisonment.

         (2) The termination of Mrs. Whitehead's parental rights, called for by the
surrogacy contract and actually ordered by the court, fails to comply with the
stringent requirements of New Jersey law. [The court notes that under the law a birth
mother's rights can be terminated only upon surrender to a State-designated agency
after certain procedural steps are followed, or upon a showing that the parent is
manifestly unfit and would actually be a danger to the child. As the surrender was
made in a contract and not to a State-designated agency, and Mrs. Whitehead had
not been found unfit, her parental rights had not been validly terminated despite the
contract.]

         Since the termination was invalid, it follows, as noted above, that adoption of
Melissa by Mrs. Stern could not properly be granted.

______________________________________________________________________________

30  CHAPTER I: INTRODUCTION TO CONTRACT LAW
         The trial court required a "best interests" showing as a condition to granting
specific performance of the surrogacy contract. Having decided the "best interests"
issue in favor of the Sterns, that court's order included, among other things, specific
performance of this agreement to surrender custody and terminate all parental
rights.

         The trial court's award of specific performance therefore reflects its view that
the consent to surrender the child was irrevocable. We accept the trial court's
construction of the contract; indeed it appears quite clear that this was the parties'
intent. Such a provision, however, making irrevocable the natural mother's consent
to surrender custody of her child in a private placement adoption, clearly conflicts
with New Jersey law.

         Contractual surrender of parental rights is [prohibited] in our statutes as now
written. [The court at this point describes the prohibition contained in the New Jersey
Parentage Act in more detail.]

Public Policy Considerations

         The surrogacy contract's invalidity, resulting from its direct conflict with the
above statutory provisions, is further underlined when its goals and means are
measured against New Jersey's public policy. The contract's basic premise, that the
natural parents can decide in advance of birth which one is to have custody of the
child, bears no relationship to the settled law that the child's best interests shall
determine custody. The fact that the trial court remedied that aspect of the contract
through the "best interests" phase does not make the contractual provision any less
offensive to the public policy of this State.

         The surrogacy contract guarantees permanent separation of the child from one
of its natural parents. Our policy, however, has long been that to the extent possible,
children should remain with and be brought up by both of their natural parents. That
was the first stated purpose of the previous adoption act: "it is necessary and
desirable to protect the child from unnecessary separation from his natural parents."
While not so stated in the present adoption law, this purpose remains part of the
public policy of this State. This is not simply some theoretical ideal that in practice
has no meaning. The impact of failure to follow that policy is nowhere better shown
than in the results of this surrogacy contract. A child, instead of starting off its life
with as much peace and security as possible, finds itself immediately in a tug-of-war
between contending mother and father.5

          5 [By the court] And the impact on the natural parents, Mr. Stern and Mrs. Whitehead, is
severe and dramatic. The depth of their conflict about Baby M, about custody, visitation, about the
goodness or badness of each of them, comes through in their telephone conversations, in which each
tried to persuade the other to give up the child. The potential adverse consequences of surrogacy are
poignantly captured here -- Mrs. Whitehead threatening to kill herself and the baby, Mr. Stern begging
her not to, each blaming the other. The dashed hopes of the Sterns, the agony of Mrs. Whitehead, their
suffering, their hatred--all were caused by the unraveling of this arrangement.

______________________________________________________________________________

UNIT 2: THINKING LIKE A CONTRACT LITIGATOR  31
         The surrogacy contract violates the policy of this State that the rights of
natural parents are equal concerning their child, the father's right no greater than
the mother's. `The parent and child relationship extends equally to every child and to
every parent, regardless of the marital status of the parents." N.J. STAT. ANN. § 9:17-
40. The whole purpose and effect of the surrogacy contract was to give the father the
exclusive right to the child by destroying the rights of the mother.

         The policies expressed in our comprehensive laws governing consent to the
surrender of a child, stand in stark contrast to the surrogacy contract and what it
implies. Here there is no counseling, independent or otherwise, of the natural mother,
no evaluation, no warning.

         The only legal advice Mary Beth Whitehead received regarding the surrogacy
contract was provided in connection with the contract that she previously entered
into with another couple. Mrs. Whitehead's lawyer was referred to her by the
Infertility Center, with which he had an agreement to act as counsel for surrogate
candidates. His services consisted of spending one hour going through the contract
with the Whiteheads, section by section, and answering their questions. Mrs.
Whitehead received no further legal advice prior to signing the contract with the
Sterns.

         Mrs. Whitehead was examined and psychologically evaluated, but if it was for
her benefit, the record does not disclose that fact. The Sterns regarded the evaluation
as important, particularly in connection with the question of whether she would
change her mind. Yet they never asked to see it, and were content with the
assumption that the Infertility Center had made an evaluation and had concluded
that there was no danger that the surrogate mother would change her mind. From
Mrs. Whitehead's point of view, all that she learned from the evaluation was that
"she had passed." It is apparent that the profit motive got the better of the Infertility
Center. Although the evaluation was made, it was not put to any use, and
understandably so, for the psychologist warned that Mrs. Whitehead demonstrated
certain traits that might make surrender of the child difficult and that there should
be further inquiry into this issue in connection with her surrogacy. To inquire further,
however, might have jeopardized the Infertility Center's fee. The record indicates that
neither Mrs. Whitehead nor the Sterns were ever told of this fact, a fact that might
have ended their surrogacy arrangement.

         Under the contract, the natural mother is irrevocably committed before she
knows the strength of her bond with her child. She never makes a totally voluntary,
informed decision, for quite clearly any decision prior to the baby's birth is, in the
most important sense, uninformed, and any decision after that, compelled by a pre-
existing contractual commitment, the threat of a lawsuit, and the inducement of a $
10,000 payment, is less than totally voluntary. Her interests are of little concern to
those who controlled this transaction.

         Although the interest of the natural father and adoptive mother is certainly
the predominant interest, realistically the only interest served, even they are left

______________________________________________________________________________

32  CHAPTER I: INTRODUCTION TO CONTRACT LAW
with less than what public policy requires. They know little about the natural mother,
her genetic makeup, and her psychological and medical history. Moreover, not even
a superficial attempt is made to determine their awareness of their responsibilities
as parents.

         Worst of all, however, is the contract's total disregard of the best interests of
the child. There is not the slightest suggestion that any inquiry will be made at any
time to determine the fitness of the Sterns as custodial parents, of Mrs. Stern as an
adoptive parent, their superiority to Mrs. Whitehead, or the effect on the child of not
living with her natural mother.

         This is the sale of a child, or, at the very least, the sale of a mother's right to
her child, the only mitigating factor being that one of the purchasers is the father.
Almost every evil that prompted the prohibition on the payment of money in
connection with adoptions exists here.

         Review Question 4. Compare the first paragraph of the supreme court's
opinion with the story told in the trial court's findings of fact. To what extent does
the way the story is framed impact the way you think about the case? Do judges have
an audience for which they are writing, and if so, who is it?

         Review Question 5. Under the heading "Public Policy Considerations," the
New Jersey Supreme Court articulates reasons not to enforce the parties' agreement.
How do these policy concerns differ from those stated by the trial court? What
explains the fact that two trained and experienced opinion-writing judges reached
such different results based on the exact same facts? Is "public policy" just another
way of saying "in my opinion"?

         Donald Donor is a single, 29-year-old former factory assembly-line worker with
a high school education and no children. He has been out of work for just over a year
since the factory where he was employed closed and moved overseas. Patricia
Poorhealth is a 46-year old vice president with an area technology company who has
become a millionaire during the past decade. Patricia is, however, suffering from a
kidney disease that, absent a transplant, is likely (roughly 80% statistical
probability) to be fatal within the next three years. Patricia has two children with her
49-year old husband Harold--daughter Alicia, age 8, and son Barney, age 5.

         Donald has been selling plasma at a local blood bank to make ends meet.
During a recent visit, he agreed, in exchange for a $20 bonus, to be tested for organ
donor compatibility. As it happens, Donald has two healthy kidneys and his
physiology is compatible with Patricia for purposes of a transplant. Accordingly,
Patricia has contacted Donald and offered to pay him $100,000 plus all medical
expenses in exchange for donating a kidney to her. Though he has a few misgivings
about surgery, Donald is pleased at the prospect of earning this money, more than he
has seen in one place his entire life. For her part, Patricia can't restrain herself from
tears of joy at the prospect of living long enough to raise her children to adulthood.

Problem 2.1

         If the opinion of the New Jersey trial court in the Baby M case represents
controlling law in your jurisdiction, would the contract be contemplated by Donald
and Patricia be enforceable? Why or why not? How, if at all, would your answer
change if the New Jersey Supreme Court's Baby M opinion is the controlling law of
your jurisdiction?

Problem 2.2

         Regardless of your answers to Problem 2.1, assume now that Donald and
Patricia's agreement is an enforceable contract. If, one month after signing the
contract, one of the parties decides to breach, what would the remedy be for the non-
breaching party? Consider the discussion of remedies in both of the Baby M opinions
as you formulate your answer.

                      CONTRACT FORMATION

         Did the Parties Consent? A contract is, put simply, an agreement between two
or more private parties creating obligations that the law will enforce. Unlike
obligations imposed under criminal law and tort law--which generally do not depend
on whether you have agreed to be bound to the rules--the obligations in contract law
are, at least in theory, voluntary. That is, you are bound to do a certain thing not
because the law makes everyone to do it, but because you personally have promised
another person to do it. Thus, it is usually important in analyzing contract questions
to determine what the parties agreed to do for each other. That agreement becomes
consent to be bound. Most of the time, this isn't much of a problem. When you hit the
"buy" button on a screen or hand over money to a cashier, one could easily to assume
that you are intending to buy some sort particular good or service, that the seller
intends you to have it, and that both of you expect to be bound. Generally the
transaction goes on perfectly well. Similarly, in a real estate purchase, there are
extensive written documents that are signed by both parties, often with legal counsel
involved. When two parties have signed "on the dotted line" to the same piece of
paper, it is not hard to find agreement.

         Transactions are, however, sometimes not that simple or that formal.
Sometimes the alleged contract has been formed through the exchange of
communications, but there is no one single moment when both parties seem to be
agreeing on exactly the same thing at exactly the same time. In the modern world,
such situations occur with some frequency. We therefore need some way to determine
if the communications exchanged by the parties demonstrate sufficient agreement
that will (if supported by consideration) create an enforceable contract. This part of
contract law is often called "formation" or "offer and acceptance."

                            Mutual Assent

         In a dispute alleging breach of contract, sometimes the parties do not agree
that there was any agreement at all. Such claims can arise from the fact that
language, while usually reliable, is not always a perfect means of communication.
Conduct intended to indicate one thing may be taken to indicate something very
different. People negotiating a transaction may come from different backgrounds,
possess different information, have different understandings, or use words in
different ways. Anyone who has ever been compelled in a discussion to exclaim, "But
that's not what I meant!" can understand this problem.

         Subjective or Objective Understanding? But the problem in using "agree" or
"consent" is that human beings in general (and judges and juries in particular) are
not good at reading minds. As in ordinary affairs, they usually try to determine what
someone intended by looking at what they said and did.1 The earliest American
contract cases, for example, seemed completely uninterested in what parties
themselves thought about the transaction. In cases like Murray v. Bethune, 1 Wend.
191 (N.Y. 1828), courts held that a party's subjective understanding of the deal was
actually irrelevant to the question whether he had reached an agreement. Indeed, a
party was not even permitted to testify at trial as to what he understood a contract
to mean. "The mere understanding of one of the parties to the agreement," said the
Murray court, "without such understanding having been communicated or assented
to by the other party, could not be given in evidence in order to make out the contract
or agreement between them."

         Continental European Influence. This refusal to consider what the parties
actually thought might seem harsh. If contracts are to be voluntary obligations,
shouldn't it be relevant that a party really did not understand that had agreed to a

a revolver, yelling "Good riddance, sucker!"--and then reloads before firing six more shots at B, we

in order to reach our conclusion.--Eds.]

particular obligation? In Europe, influenced particularly by French jurisprudence,
the answer began to be (at least sometimes) "yes." And just as French philosophy had
influenced America's founding generation, French legal thinkers--particularly

Robert Joseph Pothier2--began to influence American law with what came to be
called the "will" theory of contract. The will theory (the term itself is a later invention,
but it is accurate enough) held that obligations had to be knowingly and voluntarily
assumed before they were binding. Some early signs of this appear when some
American courts, such as the New York judges in Mactier's Administrators v. Frith,
6 Wend. 103 (N.Y. 1830), introduce the idea of a necessary "meeting of the minds" of
the two parties.

        The Peerless British Influence. American developments were pushed farther
down this road by changes brewing on the other side of the Atlantic. In the 19th
century, Great Britain was the world's greatest commercial empire, and London was
the legal center of the commercial world. Notwithstanding the American Revolution
and independence of the United States, British cases remained highly influential in
American courts for well over a century due to the two countries' shared common-law
heritage. Toward the end of the American Civil War, the British Court of Exchequer
announced its decision in a case called Raffles v. Wichelhaus, 159 Eng. Rep. 375
(Exch. 1864), which had enormous impact on both sides of the Atlantic.

         In Raffles, a cotton buyer in England contracted with a seller in India to
purchase a load of cotton. The contract provided that the cotton would shipped "ex
Peerless"--that is, in the terminology of the day, aboard a ship called the Peerless. In
one of the strangest coincidences in legal history--most likely unknown to the parties
at a time before telegraph communication was available--it turned out that there
were two ships called Peerless in India, both of which were going to be carrying cotton
to England, one sailing from India in October and one sailing in December. When the
December Peerless arrived, the seller tried to deliver the cotton it carried to the buyer,
but the buyer refused to take it, claiming he had meant the cotton on the October
Peerless. Since the buyer had never communicated to the seller which Peerless he
meant, a rule like the one in Murray v. Bethune presumably would have made the
buyer's testimony irrelevant. But the British court held otherwise. Where the parties
had differing interpretations of such an important matter, decided the court, and
neither knew of the other's interpretation, there was simply no contract. The buyer
was not liable to take the goods. The Peerless case was cited with approval by many
treatise writers in Britain and the United States, and it began to make its way into
American law.

         While the amount in controversy is small, the principle involved is important.
The facts are practically undisputed.

         The plaintiff being desirous of purchasing a lot as a site for a dwelling, a
mutual acquaintance of the parties pointed out to plaintiff a lot which he said
defendant had for sale. The lot thus pointed out fronted east on Third Avenue south,
being the second lot north from Franklin Avenue, in Minneapolis. The party was
mistaken. The lot which defendant had for sale (as agent for the owner) was the one
directly opposite on the other side of Third Avenue, being the side "Judge Jones' house
is on." This lot fronted west. It was also the second lot north from Franklin Avenue,
but, as already stated, on the opposite side of Third Avenue from the one pointed out
to plaintiff. Thereupon plaintiff went to see defendant. The precise words by which
he opened negotiations do not clearly appear, but their substance was that plaintiff
either asked defendant if he had for sale a lot on Third Avenue south, or stated that
a lot had been pointed out to him by this mutual acquaintance as one that defendant
had for sale, and inquired the price. The evidence is undisputed that defendant told
plaintiff that he had for sale the lot on Third Avenue south, being the second lot north
of Franklin Avenue, and "on the same side of the street that Judge Jones' house was
on." Nothing was said as to whether the lot fronted east or west. It is undisputed that
Judge Jones' house is on the east side of Third Avenue, and hence that a lot on that
side would front west.

         Without defendant's giving any further or more definite description of the lot,
and without plaintiff making any further inquiry as to its description and location,
the plaintiff proceeded to negotiate as to price. The result was a verbal bargain of sale
and purchase for $2,500, of which plaintiff paid down $100, the balance to be paid
when the title was ascertained to be satisfactory, and upon defendant's procuring the
proper deed. Very soon afterwards, plaintiff discovered that the lot described in it was
not the lot which had been pointed out to him, and which he supposed he was buying.
He then informed the defendant of his mistake, and demanded back his $100, which
defendant refused to pay, but tendered a deed which plaintiff refused to accept, and
then brought this action to recover back the $100.

UNIT 3: MUTUAL ASSENT                                   39
         The evidence is undisputed that plaintiff was laboring under an honest
mistake, and supposed he was buying the lot which had been pointed out to him. It
is also undisputed that defendant was equally honest in supposing he was selling the
lot on the other side of the street, and that he had no notice of plaintiff's mistake. It
will be observed that the description of the two lots was the same, except the reference
to the "side of the street that Judge Jones' house was on," which was applicable to the
lot defendant had for sale, but inapplicable to the one which plaintiff supposed he was
buying. It is familiar law that an honest mistake of one of the parties may be good
ground for refusing specific performance, and leaving the other party to his action for
damages, while it would be no ground for a rescission of the contract. But the question
here is whether, upon the facts, plaintiff is entitled to a rescission, for that is, in effect,
what he is asking for in seeking to recover the $ 100.

         Undoubtedly, in order to create a contract, the minds of the parties must meet
and agree upon the expressed terms of the contract. Thus, in Rupley v. Daggett, 74
Ill. 351, one party offered to sell a horse for $165; the other party understood him to
say $65. It was held that there was no contract. To the same head may be referred
cases where a person, by mistake, enters into a different kind of agreement from that
which he intended to make or supposed he was making; as where he signed a bond
supposing it to be a mere petition, or which he supposed he was signing merely as a
witness. To the same general principle may be referred those cases where, after the
parties have apparently agreed to the terms of a contract, it is made to appear that
there was a latent ambiguity in an essential word, by which one of the parties meant
one thing, and the other a different thing, the essential word being applicable to both.
See Raffles v. Wichelhaus, 159 Eng. Rep. 375 (Exch. 1864); 3 Kyle v. Kavanagh, 103
Mass. 356 (1869).

         Had the parties, in their contract, deliberately agreed on a formal description
of its subject-matter, the mere fact that plaintiff was mistaken as to the lot to which
that description applied, and had in mind another lot of a different description, would
be no ground for a rescission. But in this case, while the description given by the
defendant was probably sufficient in law to identify the property, it was an unusual
and exceedingly informal one, and one very liable to be misunderstood. It was in one
sense incomplete, for on its face it did not appear on which side of the street Judge
Jones' house was, which was the only thing contained in the description to distinguish
the one lot from the other. The other elements of the description being common to
both lots, and the plaintiff naturally assuming that the lot referred to was the one
that had been pointed out to him, the reference to Judge Jones' house was not
calculated to make any particular impression on his mind, as being a material part

    3 [Wait a minute, isn't Raffles v. Wichelhaus the influential old English case that we mentioned

of the description. Again, the description given by the defendant was never expressly
agreed to by the plaintiff. So far as it could be said to have been assented to at all, it
was so only impliedly, by plaintiff's proceeding to negotiate as to price, which he
evidently did supposing that the lot to which defendant alluded was the one which
had been pointed out to him on the ground. Therefore, under the particular facts of
this case, it may be fairly said that the minds of the parties never really met or agreed
on the words or the terms of the contract, and hence that there never was any binding
agreement.

                     United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit

                                        417 F.2d 43 (2d Cir. 1969)
MOORE, Circuit Judge:

         Dr. Oswald, a coin collector from Switzerland, was interested in Mrs. Allen's
collection of Swiss coins. In April of 1964 Dr. Oswald was in the United States and
arranged to see Mrs. Allen's coins. The parties drove to the Newburgh Savings Bank
of Newburgh, New York, where two of her collections referred to as the Swiss Coin
Collection and the Rarity Coin Collection were located in separate vault boxes. "After
examining and taking notes on the coins in the Swiss Coin Collection, Dr. Oswald
was shown several valuable Swiss coins from the Rarity Coin Collection. He also took
notes on these coins and later testified that he did not know that they were in a
separate "collection." The evidence showed that each collection had a different key
number and was housed in labeled cigar boxes.

         On the return to New York City, Dr. Oswald sat in the front seat of the car
while Mrs. Allen sat in the back with Dr. Oswald's brother, Mr. Victor Oswald, and
Mr. Cantarella of the Chase Manhattan Bank's Money Museum, who had helped
arrange the meeting and served as Dr. Oswald's agent. Dr. Oswald could speak
practically no English and so depended on his brother to conduct the transaction.

UNIT 3: MUTUAL ASSENT                                                       41
After some negotiation a price of $50,000 was agreed upon. Apparently the parties
never realized that the references to "Swiss coins" and the "Swiss Coin Collection"
were ambiguous. The trial judge found that Dr. Oswald thought the offer he had
authorized his brother to make was for all of the Swiss coins, while Mrs. Allen thought
she was selling only the Swiss Coin Collection and not the Swiss coins in the Rarity
Coin Collection.

         On April 8, 1964, Dr. Oswald wrote to Mrs. Allen to "confirm my purchase of
all your Swiss coins (gold, silver and copper) at the price of $50,000." The letter
mentioned delivery arrangements through Mr. Cantarella. In response Mrs. Allen
wrote on April 15, 1964, that "Mr. Cantarella and I have arranged to go to Newburgh
Friday, April 24." This letter does not otherwise mention the alleged contract of sale
or the quantity of coins sold. On April 20, realizing that her original estimation of the
number of coins in the Swiss Coin Collection was erroneous, Mrs. Allen offered to
permit a reexamination and to undertake not to sell to anyone else. Dr. Oswald cabled
from Switzerland to Mr. Alfred Barth of the Chase Manhattan Bank, giving
instruction to proceed with the transaction. Upon receiving the cable, Barth wrote a
letter to Mrs. Allen stating Dr. Oswald's understanding of the agreement and
requesting her signature on a copy of the letter as a "mere formality." Mrs. Allen did
not sign and return this letter. On April 24, Mrs. Allen's husband told Barth that his
wife did not wish to proceed with the sale because her children did not wish her to do
so.

         Appellant attacks the conclusion of the Court below that a contract did not
exist since the minds of the parties had not met. The opinion below states:

                  Plaintiff believed that he had offered to buy all Swiss coins owned
         by the defendant while defendant reasonably understood the offer which
         she accepted to relate to those of her Swiss coins as had been segregated
         in the particular collection denominated by her as the "Swiss Coin
         Collection."

285 F. Supp. 488, 492 (S.D.N.Y. 1968). The trial judge based his decision upon his
evaluation of the credibility of the witnesses, the records of the defendant, the values
of the coins involved, the circumstances of the transaction and the reasonable
probabilities. Such findings of fact are not to be set aside unless "clearly erroneous."
Fed. R. Civ. P. 52(a). There was ample evidence upon which the trial judge could rely
in reaching this decision.

         In such a factual situation the law is settled that no contract exists. The
Restatement of Contracts in section 71(a) adopts the rule of Raffles v. Wichelhaus,4
159 Eng. Rep. 375 (Ex. 1864). Professor Young states that rule as follows:

    4 [Look, it's that case about the two ships named Peerless, again. We were not lying when we

called it influential. This unit really does have a pattern to it that you can figure out you if you pay

attention. By the way, don't think we're always going to be this helpful in pointing out this sort of stuff

42  CHAPTER II: CONTRACT FORMATION
         When any of the terms used to express an agreement is ambivalent, and
         the parties understand it in different ways, there cannot be a contract
         unless one of them should have been aware of the other's understanding.

William Young, Equivocation in Agreements, 64 COLUM. L. REV. 619, 621 (1964). Even
though the mental assent of the parties is not requisite for the formation of a contract
(see Comment to Restatement of Contracts § 71 (1932)), the facts found by the trial
judge clearly place this case within the small group of exceptional cases in which
there is "no sensible basis for choosing between conflicting understandings." Young,
supra, 64 COLUM. L. REV. at 647. The rule of Raffles v. Wichelhaus is applicable here.

         Affirmed.

         Review Question 3. Oswald refers to section 71 of the original (sometimes
later called "First") Restatement of Contracts. The Restatement (Second) of Contracts
phrases things a little differently in its section 20. Review that provision. Assume
that it governs the facts in both Stong and Oswald. How would you analyze these
cases under section 20? What results would you get from each case and why? You

                                   196 Va. 493; 84 S.E.2d 516 (1954)

BUCHANAN, J., delivered the opinion of the court.

         This suit was instituted by W.O. Lucy and J.C. Lucy, complainants, against
A.H. Zehmer and Ida S. Zehmer, his wife, defendants, to have specific performance of
a contract by which it was alleged the Zehmers had sold to W.O. Lucy a tract of land
owned by A.H. Zehmer in Dinwiddie county containing 471.6 acres, more or less,
known as the Ferguson farm, for $50,000. J.C. Lucy, the other complainant, is a
brother of W.O. Lucy, to whom W.O. Lucy transferred a half interest in his alleged
purchase.

         The instrument sought to be enforced was written by A.H. Zehmer on
December 20, 1952, in these words: "We hereby agree to sell to W.O. Lucy the
Ferguson Farm complete for $50,000.00, title satisfactory to buyer," and signed by
the defendants, A.H. Zehmer and Ida S. Zehmer.

         The answer of A.H. Zehmer admitted that at the time mentioned W.O. Lucy
offered him $50,000 cash for the farm, but that he, Zehmer, considered that the offer
was made in jest; that so thinking, and both he and Lucy having had several drinks,
he wrote out "the memorandum" quoted above and induced his wife to sign it; that he
did not deliver the memorandum to Lucy, but that Lucy picked it up, read it, put it
in his pocket, attempted to offer Zehmer $5 to bind the bargain, which Zehmer refused
to accept, and realizing for the first time that Lucy was serious, Zehmer assured him
that he had no intention of selling the farm and that the whole matter was a joke.
Lucy left the premises insisting that he had purchased the farm.

         Depositions were taken and the decree appealed from was entered holding that
the complainants had failed to establish their right to specific performance, and
dismissing their bill. The assignment of error is to this action of the court.

         W.O. Lucy, a lumberman and farmer, thus testified in substance: He had
known Zehmer for fifteen or twenty years and had been familiar with the Ferguson
farm for ten years. Seven or eight years ago he had offered Zehmer $20,000 for the
farm which Zehmer had accepted, but the agreement was verbal and Zehmer backed
out. On the night of December 20, 1952, around eight o'clock, he took an employee to
McKenney, where Zehmer lived and operated a restaurant, filling station and motor
court. While there he decided to see Zehmer and again try to buy the Ferguson farm.
He entered the restaurant and talked to Mrs. Zehmer until Zehmer came in. He asked
Zehmer if he had sold the Ferguson farm. Zehmer replied that he had not. Lucy said,
"I bet you wouldn't take $50,000 for that place." Zehmer replied, "Yes, I would too;
you wouldn't give fifty." Lucy said he would and told Zehmer to write up an agreement
to that effect. Zehmer took a restaurant check and wrote on the back of it, "I do hereby
agree to sell to W.O. Lucy the Ferguson Farm for $50,000 complete." Lucy told him
he had better change it to "We" because Mrs. Zehmer would have to sign it too.
Zehmer then tore up what he had written, wrote the agreement quoted above and
asked Mrs. Zehmer, who was at the other end of the counter ten or twelve feet away,
to sign it. Mrs. Zehmer said she would for $50,000 and signed it. Zehmer brought it
back and gave it to Lucy, who offered him $5 which Zehmer refused, saying, "You
don't need to give me any money, you got the agreement there signed by both of us."

         The discussion leading to the signing of the agreement, said Lucy, lasted thirty
or forty minutes, during which Zehmer seemed to doubt that Lucy could raise
$50,000. Lucy suggested the provision for having the title examined and Zehmer
made the suggestion that he would sell it "complete, everything there," and stated
that all he had on the farm was three heifers.

         Lucy took a partly filled bottle of whiskey into the restaurant with him for the
purpose of giving Zehmer a drink if he wanted it. Zehmer did, and he and Lucy had
one or two drinks together. Lucy said that while he felt the drinks he took he was not
intoxicated, and from the way Zehmer handled the transaction he did not think he
was either.

______________________________________________________________________________

44  CHAPTER II: CONTRACT FORMATION
         December 20 was on Saturday. Next day Lucy telephoned to J.C. Lucy and
arranged with the latter to take a half interest in the purchase and pay half of the
consideration. On Monday he engaged an attorney to examine the title. The attorney
reported favorably on December 31 and on January 2 Lucy wrote Zehmer stating that
the title was satisfactory, that he was ready to pay the purchase price in cash and
asking when Zehmer would be ready to close the deal. Zehmer replied by letter,
mailed on January 13, asserting that he had never agreed or intended to sell.

         Mr. and Mrs. Zehmer were called by the complainants as adverse witnesses.
Zehmer testified in substance as follows:

         He bought this farm more than ten years ago for $11,000. He had had twenty-
five offers, more or less, to buy it, including several from Lucy, who had never offered
any specific sum of money. He had given them all the same answer, that he was not
interested in selling it. On this Saturday night before Christmas it looked like
everybody and his brother came by there to have a drink. He took a good many drinks
during the afternoon and had a pint of his own. When he entered the restaurant
around eight-thirty Lucy was there and he could see that he was "pretty high." He
said to Lucy, "Boy, you got some good liquor, drinking, ain't you?" Lucy then offered
him a drink. "I was already high as a Georgia pine, and didn't have any more better
sense than to pour another great big slug out and gulp it down, and he took one too."

         After they had talked a while Lucy asked whether he still had the Ferguson
farm. He replied that he had not sold it and Lucy said, "I bet you wouldn't take
$50,000.00 for it." Zehmer asked him if he would give $50,000 and Lucy said yes.
Zehmer replied, "You haven't got $50,000 in cash." Lucy said he did and Zehmer
replied that he did not believe it. They argued "pro and con for a long time," mainly
about "whether he had $50,000 in cash that he could put up right then and buy that
farm." Finally, said Zehmer, Lucy told him if he didn't believe he had $50,000, "you
sign that piece of paper here and say you will take $50,000.00 for the farm." He,
Zehmer, "just grabbed the back off of a guest check there" and wrote on the back of
it. At that point in his testimony Zehmer asked to see what he had written to "see if
I recognize my own handwriting." He examined the paper and exclaimed, "Great balls
of fire, I got `Firgerson' for Ferguson. I have got satisfactory spelled wrong. I don't
recognize that writing if I would see it, wouldn't know it was mine."

         After Zehmer had, as he described it, "scribbled this thing off," Lucy said, "Get
your wife to sign it." Zehmer walked over to where she was and she at first refused to
sign but did so after he told her that he "was just needling him [Lucy], and didn't
mean a thing in the world, that I was not selling the farm." Zehmer then "took it back
over there and I was still looking at the dern thing. I had the drink right there by my
hand, and I reached over to get a drink, and he said, `Let me see it.' He reached and
picked it up, and when I looked back again he had it in his pocket and he dropped a
five dollar bill over there, and he said, `Here is five dollars payment on it.' I said, `Hell

_____________________________________________________________________________________________

UNIT 3: MUTUAL ASSENT  45
no, that is beer and liquor talking. I am not going to sell you the farm. I have told you
that too many times before.'"

         Mrs. Zehmer testified that when Lucy came into the restaurant he looked as if
he had had a drink. When Zehmer came in he took a drink out of a bottle that Lucy
handed him. She went back to help the waitress who was getting things ready for
next day. Lucy and Zehmer were talking but she did not pay too much attention to
what they were saying. She heard Lucy ask Zehmer if he had sold the Ferguson farm,
and Zehmer replied that he had not and did not want to sell it. Lucy said, "I bet you
wouldn't take $50,000 cash for that farm," and Zehmer replied, "You haven't got
$50,000 cash." Lucy said, "I can get it." Zehmer said he might form a company and
get it, "but you haven't got $50,000.00 cash to pay me tonight." Lucy asked him if he
would put it in writing that he would sell him this farm. Zehmer then wrote on the
back of a pad, "I agree to sell the Ferguson Place to W.O. Lucy for $50,000.00 cash."
Lucy said, "All right, get your wife to sign it." Zehmer came back to where she was
standing and said, "You want to put your name to this?" She said "No," but he said in
an undertone, "It is nothing but a joke," and she signed it.

         On examination by her own counsel she said that her husband laid this piece
of paper down after it was signed; that Lucy said to let him see it, took it, folded it
and put it in his wallet, then said to Zehmer, "Let me give you $5.00," but Zehmer
said, "No, this is liquor talking. I don't want to sell the farm, I have told you that I
want my son to have it. This is all a joke." Lucy then said at least twice, "Zehmer, you
have sold your farm," wheeled around and started for the door. He paused at the door
and said, "I will bring you $50,000 tomorrow. * * * No, tomorrow is Sunday. I will
bring it to you Monday." She said you could tell definitely that he was drinking and
she said to her husband, "You should have taken him home," but he said, "Well, I am
just about as bad off as he is."

         The defendants insist that the evidence was ample to support their contention
that the writing sought to be enforced was prepared as a bluff or dare to force Lucy
to admit that he did not have $50,000; that the whole matter was a joke; that the
writing was not delivered to Lucy and no binding contract was ever made between
the parties.

         It is an unusual, if not bizarre, defense. When made to the writing admittedly
prepared by one of the defendants and signed by both, clear evidence is required to
sustain it.

    In his testimony Zehmer claimed that he "was high as a Georgia pine," and

that the transaction "was just a bunch of two doggoned drunks bluffing to see who

could talk the biggest and say the most." That claim is inconsistent with his attempt

to testify in great detail as to what was said and what was done. It is contradicted by

other evidence as to the condition of both parties, and rendered of no weight by the

testimony of his wife that when Lucy left the restaurant she suggested that Zehmer

drive him home. The record is convincing that Zehmer was not intoxicated to the

______________________________________________________________________________

46  CHAPTER II: CONTRACT FORMATION
extent of being unable to comprehend the nature and consequences of the instrument
he executed, and hence that instrument is not to be invalidated on that ground. 17
C.J.S., Contracts, § 133b at 483; Taliaferro v. Emery,98 S.E. 627 (Va. 1919). It was in
fact conceded by defendants' counsel in oral argument that under the evidence
Zehmer was not too drunk to make a valid contract.

         The evidence is convincing also that Zehmer wrote two agreements, the first
one beginning "I hereby agree to sell." Zehmer first said he could not remember about
that, then that "I don't think I wrote but one out." Mrs. Zehmer said that what he
wrote was "I hereby agree," but that the "I" was changed to "We" after that night. The
agreement that was written and signed is in the record and indicates no such change.
Neither are the mistakes in spelling that Zehmer sought to point out readily
apparent.

         The appearance of the contract, the fact that it was under discussion for forty
minutes or more before it was signed; Lucy's objection to the first draft because it was
written in the singular, and he wanted Mrs. Zehmer to sign it also; the rewriting to
meet that objection and the signing by Mrs. Zehmer; the discussion of what was to be
included in the sale, the provision for the examination of the title, the completeness
of the instrument that was executed, the taking possession of it by Lucy with no
request or suggestion by either of the defendants that he give it back, are facts which
furnish persuasive evidence that the execution of the contract was a serious business
transaction rather than a casual, jesting matter as defendants now contend.

         On Sunday, the day after the instrument was signed on Saturday night, there
was a social gathering in a home in the town of McKenney at which there were
general comments that the sale had been made. Mrs. Zehmer testified that on that
occasion as she passed by a group of people, including Lucy, who were talking about
the transaction, $50,000 was mentioned, whereupon she stepped up and said, "Well,
with the high-price whiskey you were drinking last night you should have paid more.
That was cheap." Lucy testified that at that time Zehmer told him that he did not
want to "stick" him or hold him to the agreement because he, Lucy, was too tight and
didn't know what he was doing, to which Lucy replied that he was not too tight; that
he had been stuck before and was going through with it. Zehmer's version was that
he said to Lucy: "I am not trying to claim it wasn't a deal on account of the fact the
price was too low. If I had wanted to sell $50,000.00 would be a good price, in fact I
think you would get stuck at $50,000.00." A disinterested witness testified that what
Zehmer said to Lucy was that "he was going to let him up off the deal, because he
thought he was too tight, didn't know what he was doing. Lucy said something to the
effect that `I have been stuck before and I will go through with it.'"

         If it be assumed, contrary to what we think the evidence shows, that Zehmer
was jesting about selling his farm to Lucy and that the transaction was intended by
him to be a joke, nevertheless the evidence shows that Lucy did not so understand it
but considered it to be a serious business transaction and the contract to be binding

_____________________________________________________________________________________________

UNIT 3: MUTUAL ASSENT  47
on the Zehmers as well as on himself. The very next day he arranged with his brother
to put up half the money and take a half interest in the land. The day after that he
employed an attorney to examine the title. The next night, Tuesday, he was back at
Zehmer's place and there Zehmer told him for the first time, Lucy said, that he wasn't
going to sell and he told Zehmer, "You know you sold that place fair and square."
After receiving the report from his attorney that the title was good he wrote to Zehmer
that he was ready to close the deal.

         Not only did Lucy actually believe, but the evidence shows he was warranted
in believing, that the contract represented a serious business transaction and a good
faith sale and purchase of the farm.

         In the field of contracts, as generally elsewhere, "We must look to the outward
expression of a person as manifesting his intention rather than to his secret and
unexpressed intention. `The law imputes to a person an intention corresponding to
the reasonable meaning of his words and acts.'" First National Exchange Bank v.
Roanoke Oil Co., 192 S.E. 764, 770 (Va. 1934).

         At no time prior to the execution of the contract had Zehmer indicated to Lucy
by word or act that he was not in earnest about selling the farm. They had argued
about it and discussed its terms, as Zehmer admitted, for a long time. Lucy testified
that if there was any jesting it was about paying $50,000 that night. The contract and
the evidence show that he was not expected to pay the money that night. Zehmer said
that after the writing was signed he laid it down on the counter in front of Lucy. Lucy
said Zehmer handed it to him. In any event there had been what appeared to be a
good faith offer and a good faith acceptance, followed by the execution and apparent
delivery of a written contract. Both said that Lucy put the writing in his pocket and
then offered Zehmer $5 to seal the bargain. Not until then, even under the defendants'
evidence, was anything said or done to indicate that the matter was a joke. Both of
the Zehmers testified that when Zehmer asked his wife to sign he whispered that it
was a joke so Lucy wouldn't hear and that it was not intended that he should hear.

         The mental assent of the parties is not requisite for the formation of a contract.
If the words or other acts of one of the parties have but one reasonable meaning, his
undisclosed intention is immaterial except when an unreasonable meaning which he
attaches to his manifestations is known to the other party. Restatement of the Law
of Contracts § 71 (1932). The law, therefore, judges of an agreement between two
persons exclusively from those expressions of their intentions which are
communicated between them. WILLIAM L. CLARK, LAW OF CONTRACTS § 3 at 4 (1931).

         An agreement or mutual assent is of course essential to a valid contract but
the law imputes to a person an intention corresponding to the reasonable meaning of
his words and acts. If his words and acts, judged by a reasonable standard, manifest
an intention to agree, it is immaterial what may be the real but unexpressed state of
his mind. 17 C.J.S., Contracts § 32 at 361; 12 AM. JUR., Contracts § 19 at 515. So a

______________________________________________________________________________

48  CHAPTER II: CONTRACT FORMATION
person cannot set up that he was merely jesting when his conduct and words would
warrant a reasonable person in believing that he intended a real agreement.

         Whether the writing signed by the defendants and now sought to be enforced
by the complainants was the result of a serious offer by Lucy and a serious acceptance
by the defendants, or was a serious offer by Lucy and an acceptance in secret jest by
the defendants, in either event it constituted a binding contract of sale between the
parties.

         The complainants are entitled to have specific performance of the contracts
sued on. The decree appealed from is therefore reversed and the cause is remanded
for the entry of a proper decree requiring the defendants to perform the contract in
accordance with the prayer of the bill.

         Reversed and remanded.

                                         AUGSTEIN v. LESLIE
            United States District Court for the Southern District of New York
       11 Civ. 7512 (HB), 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 149517 (S.D.N.Y. Oct. 17, 2012)

HAROLD BAER, JR., U.S.D.J.

         Armin Augstein brought this action to collect a reward from Ryan Leslie upon
the return of Leslie's stolen laptop computer. The laptop was stolen and recovered in
Germany and returned to Leslie in New York.

Leslie is a musician. While on tour in Germany, Leslie's laptop computer,

external hard drive, and certain other belongings were stolen. The laptop contained

valuable intellectual property, including music and videos related to Leslie's records

and performances. In videos, news articles, and online postings, Leslie stated that he

would pay $20,000--later increased to $1 million--to anyone who returned his

property. After Augstein returned the laptop and hard drive, Leslie refused to pay

the reward because, Leslie alleges, the intellectual property for which he valued the

laptop was not present on the hard drive when it was returned. Leslie claims that he

and several staff members tried to access the data on the hard drive but were unable

to do so. Leslie sent the hard drive to the manufacturer, Avastor, which ultimately

deleted the information prior to sending Leslie a replacement. Augstein now argues

the Court should grant him summary judgment on the issues of the validity of the

_____________________________________________________________________________________________

UNIT 3: MUTUAL ASSENT       49
offer and of the reward and its subsequent acceptance and performance by Augstein
when he returned the laptop to the police in Germany.

         Augstein argues that Leslie made an offer of a reward for the return of his
property and that Augstein accepted and fully performed when he presented the
property to the police in Germany. Leslie responds that a reasonable person would
not have understood the mention of the reward to be an offer of a unilateral contract,
but instead would have understood it to be an advertisement--in essence, an
invitation to negotiate. And even if it was an offer, Leslie continues, Augstein did not
perform because he did not return the intellectual property, only the physical
property. Whether or not the external hard drive, which was subsequently destroyed
by Avastor, contained Leslie's intellectual property is a heavily disputed issue in this
case.

         A district court may not grant summary judgment if there exists a genuine
issue of material fact. For summary judgment purposes, a genuine issue exists where
the evidence is such that a reasonable jury could decide in the non-moving party's
favor. "An offer is the manifestation of willingness to enter into a bargain, so made
as to justify another person in understanding that his assent to that bargain is invited
and will conclude it." Restatement (Second) of Contracts § 24 (1981). To evaluate the
legitimacy of this offer, the court should consider "what an objective, reasonable
person would have understood [Leslie's conduct] to convey." Leonard v. PepsiCo, Inc.,
88 F. Supp. 2d 116, 127 (S.D.N.Y. 1999).

Leslie mentioned the $20,000 reward for the return of his property in a YouTube
video on October 24, 2010. In the video, Leslie says, "I am offering a reward of
$20,000." See also "Ryan Leslie Gets His Laptop Stolen in Germany! Offering $20,000
Reward," YouTube (Oct. 26, 2010):

    [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvVPjZ-wvkE].

         He also implied that the lost property was worth much more than $20,000. On
November 6, 2010, a video was posted increasing the reward to $1,000,000. At the
end of the video, a message reads, "In the interest of retrieving the invaluable
intellectual property contained on his laptop & hard drive, Mr. Leslie has increased
the reward offer from $20,000 to $1,000,000 USD." RyanLeslieTV, "Ryan Leslie--
European Tour and Reward Announcement," YouTube (Nov. 6, 2010):

    [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8Jf0huEyNU].

The increase of the reward was publicized on Leslie's Facebook and Twitter accounts,
including a post on Twitter which read, "I'm absolutely continuing my Euro tour + I
raised the reward for my intellectual property to $1mm" and included a link to the
video on YouTube. News organizations also published reports on Leslie's reward offer,
both in print and online. Finally, Leslie was interviewed on MTV on November 11,
2010, and reiterated the $1,000,000 reward, saying "I got a million dollar reward for
anybody that can return all my intellectual property to me."

______________________________________________________________________________

50  CHAPTER II: CONTRACT FORMATION
         Leslie's videos and other activities together are best characterized as an offer
for a reward. Leslie "sought to induce performance, unlike an invitation to negotiate
[often an advertisement], which seeks a reciprocal promise." Leonard, 88 F. Supp. 2d
at 125 (discussing Carlill v. Carbolic Smoke Ball Co., [1892] 1 Q.B. 256 (Eng.)). Offers
of reward are "intended to induce a potential offeree to perform a specific action." Id.
at 126. A reasonable person viewing the video would understand that Leslie was
seeking the return of his property and that by returning it, the bargain would be
concluded. The increase of the reward from $20,000 to $1,000,000, the value of the
property lost (in particular the unreleased album) and the news reports regarding
the reward offer would lead a reasonable person to believe that Leslie was making an
offer. As such, the video constitutes a valid offer and summary judgment is granted
as to that issue. "[I]f a person chooses to make extravagant promises . . . he probably
does so because it pays him to make them, and, if he has made them, the extravagance
of the promises is no reason in law why he should not be bound by them." Id. at 125
(quoting Carbolic Smoke Ball, 1 Q.B. at 268 (Bowen, L.J.)).

         Leslie attempts to persuade the court that the video is not an offer but an
advertisement. Because advertisements, Leslie argues, are not generally considered
offers, there is no contract. He cites Leonard v. PepsiCo, where the court did find an
advertisement rather than an offer, to support that argument.1 However, unlike the
television commercial in Leonard, Leslie's conduct in this case was meant to induce
performance. Leslie was not seeking a promise from an individual who would return
his belongings, rather he was seeking performance--the actual return of his property.
In addition, his videos and other commentary cannot be reasonably understood as an
invitation to negotiate because, similarly, Leslie was not soliciting help in finding his
property, but the actual return itself. Leslie also relies on the fact that the offer was
conveyed over YouTube (a website where many advertisements and promotional
videos are shared, along with any number of other types of video) to undermine the
legitimacy of the offer. I do not find this reasoning persuasive. The forum for
conveying the offer is not determinative, but rather, the question is whether a
reasonable person would have understood that Leslie made an offer of a reward. I
conclude that they would.

         Augstein's motion for summary judgment is GRANTED insofar as he seeks a
declaration that the reward was an offer.

                                          ______________________

         Review Question 5. The Augstein court uses the term "unilateral contract."
What does that mean and how does it differ from a "bilateral contract"? Look up both
terms and make sure you would be able to explain their meanings to a classmate or

your professor. You will come across one or both of these terms in many contracts
cases, so you might as well know what the courts are talking about.

         Review Question 6. The first three cases in this unit (Stong, Oswald, and
Lucy) all involve situations in which the parties seem to have reached at least some
kind of agreement about something. Is that the issue in Augstein? Did the parties
argue that they were mistaken about what they agreed to, or that they never agreed
at all?

Problem 3.1

         Tyson is a major American producer of fresh frozen chicken. Männliches Huhn
GmbH (MHG) is a German supplier of chicken to restaurants and fast-food
establishments in Europe. After some telephone discussions between Tyson's offices
in Little Rock and MHG's offices in Frankfurt, MHG orally agrees to buy 100,000 lbs.
of fresh frozen chicken from Tyson, to be packed in cryovac and delivered to MHG in
Germany. Tyson sends a memorandum of the offer to MHG as an invoice describing
the product as "US Fresh Frozen Chicken, Grade A, Government Inspected,
Eviscerated, each chicken individually wrapped in Cryovac, packed suitable for
export." When the chicken arrived at MHG, however, the company rejected it, saying
that the chickens delivered were cheap "stewing chickens"--that is, chickens suitable
only for things like soup and pot pies--rather than more expensive "frying" chickens
which are suitable for cooking and barbecuing in restaurants. The chicken as
delivered was useless to MHG. Tyson sued, claiming that it had a contract to deliver
"chicken," and that the birds delivered were, in fact, "chickens."

         Is there a contract between the parties? If so, is it for stewing chickens or frying
chickens? Based on what you have learned in this unit, what would you expect the
arguments for both sides to be?

Problem 3.2

         Jay the owner of an automobile body shop, has a 1962 Chevrolet Corvette
convertible, all original and beautifully restored. His neighbor, Zeke, a very well-to-
do investment banker, has long coveted the car and over the years has repeatedly
asked Jay if he would sell. Jay has always refused. In early March Jay learns that
his wife, Vera, has been having an affair with Zeke. Jay does not want a divorce, but
he wants revenge. Jay purchases a rather beat-up 1994 Corvette for $3,500.
Pretending that he is ignorant of the affair, Jay has a conversation with Zeke.

______________________________________________________________________________

52  CHAPTER II: CONTRACT FORMATION
         "You know, Zeke," he says, "I'm really torn about the Corvette."

         "What about it?" says Zeke.

         "Well," says Jay, "business has been off at the shop with this recession, and a
lot of my investments are down. You know, the economy and everything."

         "Of course," says Zeke. "Things are tough."

         "They sure are. Fact is, though, much as I don't want to, I've got a Corvette I
don't need, and some ready cash would be very helpful."

         "You mean, you want to sell your Corvette?"

         "I don't really want to. But you know how it is."

         "Sure," says Zeke, who really doesn't, since his investment bank paid him a
hefty bonus this year. But he says, "How much are you asking?"

         Jay hesitates. "I hadn't really decided on it."

         "Well, if it will help you out I'll give you $65,000 for it, right now," says Zeke.

         Jay shakes his head. "Thanks. I appreciate that. But I'm not sure I really want
to sell. The cash is tempting, but . . . . " He breaks off.

         "But what?"

         "I want to think it over. It's a tough decision."

         "Tell you what," says Zeke. "I'll give you $70,000 right now." He pulls out a
checkbook. "Right now," he repeats. "That's a very good offer, you know."

         "I know." Jay hesitates again. "Actually, I feel like I'm taking advantage of you
at that price."

         Zeke waves a hand. "Don't worry about me. I can afford it. The investment
banking business is still going strong." He grins and takes out a pen. "I can write the
check right now. It's good. You can get the cash tomorrow morning."

         Jay agrees. Zeke writes the check. Jay insists on filling out a bill of sale,
specifying the price and a Vehicle Identification Number of 299492033218. He tells
Zeke that the Corvette (and the title document) is down at Jay's shop, getting a new
wax polishing, and that Zeke can pick it up tomorrow.

         The next day Zeke goes to Jay's shop and is handed the keys and the signed
title to the freshly polished but still rather battered 1994 Corvette. He is furious. He
charges into Jay's office, but Jay just laughs at him. Jay had cashed the check first
thing in the morning and has already pocketed the proceeds. Zeke threatens all sorts
of dire things.

         "You bought a Corvette," says Jay. He picks up the bill of sale. "You got a
Corvette. It's VIN 299492033218, exactly what it says on the bill of sale and on the

_____________________________________________________________________________________________

UNIT 3: MUTUAL ASSENT  53
car title you're holding there. It's not my problem if you don't look at what you sign."
Jay grins happily. "I think maybe you paid a little too much for it," he says, "But as
you said, you can afford it. I'm sure Vera is worth it. Have a really nice day, Zeke."

         Zeke subsequently sues Jay, demanding the 1962 Corvette or a refund of his
money. Is there a contract between the parties? If so, is it for the 1962 Corvette or the
1994 Corvette? Be prepared to make arguments on behalf of both Zeke and Jay when
considering this problem.

Problem 3.3
         Walker is the owner of Rose, a registered purebred polled Angus descended

from a long line of highly regarded stock. He buys her for breeding purposes, for which
purpose she is worth about $10,000. After a few years and various veterinary
examinations, Walker determines that Rose is infertile. Accordingly, he sells Rose,
whom he believes is barren, to Sherwood for $500--essentially her value as meat.
They sign a contract that Walker will deliver Rose this coming Thursday. On the
morning set for delivery, Walker discovers that Rose is, in fact, with calf. He refuses
to deliver her, claiming that neither party intended this to be a transaction for a
breeding cow. Sherwood demands Rose.

         When Walker continues to refuse, Sherwood sues. Did the parties have a
contract or not? What would you expect the two sides to argue regarding that issue?

         Formation in Steps or All at Once? How are contracts formed? Historically,
most of them tended to be made in one of three ways: a face-to-face agreement
followed by a handshake, a meeting at which a contract document that had been
prepared in advance was signed by the parties, or an exchange of correspondence
through physical mail--"snail mail" as many of you might know it--or (later)
telegrams.

         In the handshake and contemporaneous-signature situations, the questions of
who first proposed the exchange and who said what during the discussion are largely
irrelevant. The important facts are the substance of the final terms agreed to by the
parties. Using modern terminology, we can think of these as "synchronous"
transactions, because the creation of the agreement takes place in real time with the
contracting parties having a largely simultaneous experience.

         The Place of Offer and Acceptance. In the third situation, however, where
the parties are sending communications back and forth in an "asynchronous"
transaction, a potential problem arises. Suppose A sent a letter proposing to sell
Blackacre to B for $500,000, and B sent a letter in response. We have to put the two
together and see if there is an agreement. In this case we would ask whether A made
an offer in his letter, and whether B's letter in return accepted the offer. To answer
that question we would have to define what an "offer" and an "acceptance" are for
purposes of contract law. If A's letter is not an "offer" in the legal sense, then there is
no contract no matter what B wrote. If A's letter is an offer, but B's response is not
an "acceptance" in the legal sense, there is (again) no contract. In this kind of
asynchronous transaction we need, legally speaking, an offer and an acceptance. In
this analysis, A (the person making the offer) is called the offeror, and B (the recipient
of the offer) is the offeree.

______________________________________________________________________________

UNIT 4: OFFERS TO CONTRACT  55
In the modern world, the question of who made the offer and who made the
acceptance is often irrelevant because the existence of mutual assent is so clear.
When you carry the goods to the checkout counter, or click the "buy" button on a web
site, or buy a burger at a fast-food window, or haggle with your friend about buying
her car, the question of whether you are the offeror or offeree in such transactions
makes little difference. Yet while issues of offer-and-acceptance are relatively
unimportant in some transactions, they are critical in others--especially in a world
in which parties deal with each other at great distances. You need think back only to
Augsberg v. Leslie, in the last unit, to recall the argument that Ryan Leslie's internet
pleas were not offers.

         Asynchronous Contracts. The issue of contracts entered into by exchanges of
communications at a distance is a comparatively new thing in the many centuries of
the common law. Until there were reliable means of exchanging communications (the
post and the telegraph) and recipients who could actually read, contracts were rarely
formed at a distance. In the rapidly industrializing 19th century, however, such
contracts began appearing with some frequency. One obvious question was how the
minds of two parties can meet if they are not acting at the same time. As commerce
in England was more advanced than that in the young United States, English courts
often dealt with these issues before their American counterparts, and their decisions
had a substantial impact.

         Another important point addressed in Augsberg v. Leslie is the idea that a
public offer of a reward is (in the legal sense) an offer--as Mr. Leslie discovered. This
rule was settled in important English cases like Williams v Carwardine, 10 E.R. 590
(K.B. 1833). That the mere fact that the reward seems extravagant does not
necessarily let the offeror off the hook, as another English court held in Carlill v.
Carbolic Smoke Ball Co., 1 Q.B. 256 (C.A. 1892), which also held that a newspaper
advertisement could be an offer. "If a person chooses to make extravagant promises,"
wrote Lord Justice Bowen, "he probably does so because it pays him to make them,
and, if he has made them, the extravagance of the promises is no reason in law why
he should not be bound by them." You will meet Carbolic Smoke Ball again in the
cases below.1

         Offer Inviting Acceptance. We now start with the idea of the "offer." What
kinds of statements qualify as "offers" for purposes of contract law? As you will see,
there are no magic words--everything depends on wording of the communication and

    1 [The infamous advertisement--which you can easily find online--stated that a £100 "reward

will be paid by the Carbolic Smoke Ball Company to any person who contracts the increasing epidemic

influenza, colds, or any disease caused by taking cold, after having used the ball three times daily for

two weeks, according to the printed directions supplied with each ball." 1 Q.B. at 257. Mrs. Louisa

Elizabeth Carlill used the vapor-emitting ball in her nose three times daily for about two months before

she contracted the flu. Upon Carlill's demand for £100--equivalent to about $30,000 as these materials

are written--Carbolic refused to pay, claiming, among other things, that the advertisement was not

an offer. They lost. - Eds.]

guidelines which the following cases are designed to help you uncover. You may want
to review sections 22, 24, 26, and 29 of the Restatement (Second) of Contracts in
connection with this unit.

         If you would like to get an idea of the bigger picture for offer and acceptance,
note that the Restatement devotes a whopping 47 sections to specific rules regarding
offers (§§ 24-49), and acceptances (§§ 50-70). Spending some time skimming over
these sections--do not bother reading them intently quite yet--will give you some
context for the issues you are likely to run across in this and the remaining units on
contract formation.

                        LEONARD v. PEPSICO, INC.
United States District Court for the Southern District of New York

                      88 F. Supp. 2d 116 (S.D.N.Y. 1999)

WOOD, U.S.D.J.:

         Plaintiff brought this action seeking, among other things, specific performance
of an alleged offer of a Harrier Jet, featured in a television advertisement for
defendant's "Pepsi Stuff" promotion. Defendant has moved for summary judgment
pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56. For the reasons stated below,
defendant's motion is granted.

                                                  Background

         Because whether the television commercial constituted an offer is the central
question in this case, the Court will describe the commercial in detail. The
commercial opens upon an idyllic, suburban morning, where the chirping of birds in
sun-dappled trees welcomes a paperboy on his morning route. As the newspaper hits
the stoop of a conventional two-story house, the tattoo of a military drum introduces
the subtitle, "MONDAY 7:58 AM." The stirring strains of a martial air mark the
appearance of a well-coiffed teenager preparing to leave for school, dressed in a shirt
emblazoned with the Pepsi logo, a red-white-and-blue ball. While the teenager
confidently preens, the military drumroll again sounds as the subtitle "T-SHIRT 75
PEPSI POINTS" scrolls across the screen. Bursting from his room, the teenager
strides down the hallway wearing a leather jacket. The drumroll sounds again, as the
subtitle "LEATHER JACKET 1450 PEPSI POINTS" appears. The teenager opens the
door of his house and, unfazed by the glare of the early morning sunshine, puts on a

______________________________________________________________________________

UNIT 4: OFFERS TO CONTRACT                                          57
pair of sunglasses. The drumroll then accompanies the subtitle "SHADES 175 PEPSI
POINTS." A voiceover then intones, "Introducing the new Pepsi Stuff catalog," as the
camera focuses on the cover of the catalog.

         The scene then shifts to three young boys sitting in front of a high school
building. The boy in the middle is intent on his Pepsi Stuff Catalog, while the boys on
either side are each drinking Pepsi. The three boys gaze in awe at an object rushing
overhead, as the military march builds to a crescendo. The Harrier Jet is not yet
visible, but the observer senses the presence of a mighty plane as the extreme winds
generated by its flight create a paper maelstrom in a classroom devoted to an
otherwise dull physics lesson. Finally, the Harrier Jet swings into view and lands by
the side of the school building, next to a bicycle rack. Several students run for cover,
and the velocity of the wind strips one hapless faculty member down to his
underwear. While the faculty member is being deprived of his dignity, the voiceover
announces: "Now the more Pepsi you drink, the more great stuff you're gonna get."

         The teenager opens the cockpit of the fighter and can be seen, helmetless,
holding a Pepsi. "Looking very pleased with himself," the teenager exclaims, "Sure
beats the bus," and chortles. The military drumroll sounds a final time, as the
following words appear: "HARRIER FIGHTER 7,000,000 PEPSI POINTS." A few
seconds later, the following appears in more stylized script: "Drink Pepsi--Get Stuff."
With that message, the music and the commercial end with a triumphant flourish.

         Inspired by this commercial, plaintiff set out to obtain a Harrier Jet. Plaintiff
explains that he is "typical of the `Pepsi Generation' . . . he is young, has an
adventurous spirit, and the notion of obtaining a Harrier Jet appealed to him
enormously." Plaintiff consulted the Pepsi Stuff Catalog. The Catalog features youths
dressed in Pepsi Stuff regalia or enjoying Pepsi Stuff accessories, such as "Blue
Shades" ("As if you need another reason to look forward to sunny days."), "Pepsi Tees"
("Live in 'em. Laugh in 'em. Get in 'em."), "Bag of Balls" ("Three balls. One bag. No
rules."), and "Pepsi Phone Card" ("Call your mom!"). The Catalog specifies the
number of Pepsi Points required to obtain promotional merchandise. The Catalog
includes an Order Form which lists, on one side, fifty-three items of Pepsi Stuff
merchandise redeemable for Pepsi Points. Conspicuously absent from the Order Form
is any entry or description of a Harrier Jet. The amount of Pepsi Points required to
obtain the listed merchandise ranges from 15 (for a "Jacket Tattoo" ("Sew `em on your
jacket, not your arm.")) to 3300 (for a "Fila Mountain Bike" ("Rugged. All-terrain.
Exclusively for Pepsi.")). It should be noted that plaintiff objects to the implication
that because an item was not shown in the Catalog, it was unavailable.

         The rear foldout pages of the Catalog contain directions for redeeming Pepsi
Points for merchandise. These directions note that merchandise may be ordered
"only" with the original Order Form. The Catalog notes that in the event that a
consumer lacks enough Pepsi Points to obtain a desired item, additional Pepsi Points

58  CHAPTER II: CONTRACT FORMATION
may be purchased for ten cents each; however, at least fifteen original Pepsi Points
must accompany each order.

         Although plaintiff initially set out to collect 7,000,000 Pepsi Points by
consuming Pepsi products, it soon became clear to him that he "would not be able to
buy (let alone drink) enough Pepsi to collect the necessary Pepsi Points fast enough."
Reevaluating his strategy, plaintiff "focused for the first time on the packaging
materials in the Pepsi Stuff promotion," and realized that buying Pepsi Points would
be a more promising option. Through acquaintances, plaintiff ultimately raised about
$700,000.

         On or about March 27, 1996, plaintiff submitted an Order Form, fifteen
original Pepsi Points, and a check for $700,008.50. Plaintiff appears to have been
represented by counsel at the time he mailed his check; the check is drawn on an
account of plaintiff's first set of attorneys. At the bottom of the Order Form, plaintiff
wrote in "1 Harrier Jet" in the "Item" column and "7,000,000" in the "Total Points"
column. In a letter accompanying his submission, plaintiff stated that the check was
to purchase additional Pepsi Points "expressly for obtaining a new Harrier jet as
advertised in your Pepsi Stuff commercial."

         On or about May 7, 1996, defendant's fulfillment house rejected plaintiff's
submission and returned the check, explaining that:

         The item that you have requested is not part of the Pepsi Stuff collection.
It is not included in the catalogue or on the order form, and only catalogue
merchandise can be redeemed under this program.

         The Harrier jet in the Pepsi commercial is fanciful and is simply
included to create a humorous and entertaining ad. We apologize for any
misunderstanding or confusion that you may have experienced and are
enclosing some free product coupons for your use.

         Plaintiff's previous counsel responded on or about May 14, 1996, as follows:

         Your letter of May 7, 1996 is totally unacceptable. We have reviewed the
         video tape of the Pepsi Stuff commercial and it clearly offers the new
         Harrier jet for 7,000,000 Pepsi Points. Our client followed your rules
         explicitly.

         This is a formal demand that you honor your commitment and make
         immediate arrangements to transfer the new Harrier jet to our client. If
         we do not receive transfer instructions within ten (10) business days of
         the date of this letter you will leave us no choice but to file an
         appropriate action against Pepsi.

______________________________________________________________________________

UNIT 4: OFFERS TO CONTRACT  59
         This letter was apparently sent onward to the advertising company responsible
for the actual commercial, BBDO New York. In a letter dated May 30, 1996, BBDO
Vice President Raymond E. McGovern, Jr., explained to plaintiff that:

         I find it hard to believe that you are of the opinion that the Pepsi Stuff
         commercial ("Commercial") really offers a new Harrier Jet. The use of
         the Jet was clearly a joke that was meant to make the Commercial more
         humorous and entertaining. In my opinion, no reasonable person would
         agree with your analysis of the Commercial.

         On or about June 17, 1996, plaintiff mailed a similar demand letter to
defendant.

         The question of whether or not a contract was formed is appropriate for
resolution on summary judgment. As the Second Circuit has recently noted,
"Summary judgment is proper when the words and actions that allegedly formed a
contract [are] so clear themselves that reasonable people could not differ over their
meaning." Krumme v. Westpoint Stevens, Inc., 143 F.3d 71, 83 (2d Cir. 1998)

                                        Defendant's Advertisement
                                               Was Not an Offer

         The general rule is that an advertisement does not constitute an offer.
Restatement (Second) of Contracts § 26, comment b, explains that:

         Advertisements of goods by display, sign, handbill, newspaper, radio or
television are not ordinarily intended or understood as offers to sell. The same
is true of catalogues, price lists and circulars, even though the terms of
suggested bargains may be stated in some detail. It is of course possible to
make an offer by an advertisement directed to the general public (see § 29), but
there must ordinarily be some language of commitment or some invitation to
take action without further communication.

         Similarly, a leading treatise notes that:

         It is quite possible to make a definite and operative offer to buy or sell
         goods by advertisement, in a newspaper, by a handbill, a catalog or
         circular or on a placard in a store window. It is not customary to do this,
         however; and the presumption is the other way. . . . Such advertisements
         are understood to be mere requests to consider and examine and
         negotiate; and no one can reasonably regard them as otherwise unless
         the circumstances are exceptional and the words used are very plain and
         clear.

17 (rev. ed. 1993).

______________________________________________________________________________

60  CHAPTER II: CONTRACT FORMATION
         In Mesaros v. United States, 845 F.2d 1576 (Fed. Cir. 1988), the plaintiffs sued
the United States Mint for failure to deliver a number of Statue of Liberty
commemorative coins that they had ordered. When demand for the coins proved
unexpectedly robust, a number of individuals who had sent in their orders in a timely
fashion were left empty-handed. The court began by noting the "well-established" rule
that advertisements and order forms are "mere notices and solicitations for offers
which create no power of acceptance in the recipient." The spurned coin collectors
could not maintain a breach of contract action because no contract would be formed
until the advertiser accepted the order form and processed payment. Under these
principles, plaintiff's letter of March 27, 1996, with the Order Form and the
appropriate number of Pepsi Points, constituted the offer.

         The exception to the rule that advertisements do not create any power of
acceptance in potential offerees is where the advertisement is "clear, definite, and
explicit, and leaves nothing open for negotiation," in that circumstance, "it constitutes
an offer, acceptance of which will complete the contract." Lefkowitz v. Great
Minneapolis Surplus Store, 86 N.W.2d 689, 691 (Minn. 1957). In Lefkowitz, the court
ruled that because plaintiff had fulfilled all of the terms of the advertisement2 and
the advertisement was specific and left nothing open for negotiation, a contract had
been formed.

         The present case is distinguishable from Lefkowitz. First, the [Pepsi]
commercial cannot be regarded in itself as sufficiently definite, because it specifically
reserved the details of the offer to a separate writing, the Catalog. Second, even if the
Catalog had included a Harrier Jet among the items that could be obtained by
redemption of Pepsi Points, the advertisement of a Harrier Jet by both television
commercial and catalog would still not constitute an offer. As the Mesaros court
explained, the absence of any words of limitation such as "first come, first served,"
renders the alleged offer sufficiently indefinite that no contract could be formed.

         The Court finds, in sum, that the Harrier Jet commercial was merely an
advertisement. The Court now turns to the line of cases upon which plaintiff rests
much of his argument.

         In opposing the present motion, plaintiff largely relies on a different species of
unilateral offer, involving public offers of a reward for performance of a specified act.

          2 [In relevant part, the advertisement published in a Minneapolis newspaper in Lefkowitz
stated:

1 Black Lapin Stole Beautiful, worth $139.50 ... $1.00
First Come First Served.

Lefkowitz, 86 N.W.2d at 690. The Great Minneapolis Surplus Store had "refused to sell the

merchandise to the plaintiff" because of a "`house rule" not stated in the ad that "the offer was intended

for women only and sales would not be made to men." Id. - Eds.]

______________________________________________________________________________

UNIT 4: OFFERS TO CONTRACT                                       61
Because these cases generally involve public declarations regarding the efficacy or
trustworthiness of specific products, one court has aptly characterized these
authorities as "prove me wrong" cases. The most venerable of these precedents is the
case of Carlill v. Carbolic Smoke Ball Co., 1 Q.B. 256 (Court of Appeal, 1892), a quote
from which heads plaintiff's memorandum of law.

         Other "reward" cases underscore the distinction between typical
advertisements, in which the alleged offer is merely an invitation to negotiate for
purchase of commercial goods, and promises of reward, in which the alleged offer is
intended to induce a potential offeree to perform a specific action, often for
noncommercial reasons. James v. Turilli, 473 S.W.2d 757 (Mo. Ct. App. 1971), arose
from a boast by defendant that the "notorious Missouri desperado" Jesse James had
not been killed in 1882, as portrayed in song and legend, but had lived under the alias
"J. Frank Dalton" at the "Jesse James Museum" operated by none other than
defendant. Defendant offered $10,000 "to anyone who could prove me wrong." The
widow of the outlaw's son demonstrated, at trial, that the outlaw had in fact been
killed in 1882. On appeal, the court held that defendant should be liable to pay the
amount offered.

         In the present case, the Harrier Jet commercial did not direct that anyone who
appeared at Pepsi headquarters with 7,000,000 Pepsi Points on the Fourth of July
would receive a Harrier Jet. Instead, the commercial urged consumers to accumulate
Pepsi Points and to refer to the Catalog to determine how they could redeem their
Pepsi Points. Plaintiff's understanding of the commercial as an offer must also be
rejected because the Court finds that no objective person could reasonably have
concluded that the commercial actually offered consumers a Harrier Jet.

                            An Objective, Reasonable Person Would Not
                              Have Considered the Commercial an Offer

         In evaluating the commercial, the Court must not consider defendant's
subjective intent in making the commercial, or plaintiff's subjective view of what the
commercial offered, but what an objective, reasonable person would have understood
the commercial to convey. See Kay-R Elec. Corp. v. Stone & Weber Constr. Co., 23 F.3d
55, 57 (2d Cir. 1994) ("We are not concerned with what was going through the heads
of the parties at the time [of the alleged contract]. Rather, we are talking about the
objective principles of contract law.")

         If it is clear that an offer was not serious, then no offer has been made:

         What kind of act creates a power of acceptance and is therefore an offer?
         It must be an expression of will or intention. It must be an act that leads
         the offeree reasonably to conclude that a power to create a contract is
         conferred. This applies to the content of the power as well as to the fact
         of its existence. It is on this ground that we must exclude invitations to

______________________________________________________________________________

62  CHAPTER II: CONTRACT FORMATION
deal or acts of mere preliminary negotiation, and acts evidently done in
jest or without intent to create legal relations.

CORBIN ON CONTRACTS § 1.11 at 30 (emphasis added). An obvious joke, of course,
would not give rise to a contract. See, e.g., Graves v. Northern N.Y. Pub. Co., 22
N.Y.S.2d 537 (App. Div. 1940) (dismissing claim to offer of $ 1000, which appeared in
the "joke column" of the newspaper, to any person who could provide a commonly
available phone number). On the other hand, if there is no indication that the offer is
"evidently in jest," and that an objective, reasonable person would find that the offer
was serious, then there may be a valid offer. See Lucy v. Zehmer, 84 S.E.2d 516, 518,
520 (Va. 1954) (ordering specific performance of a contract to purchase a farm despite
defendant's protestation that the transaction was done in jest as "just a bunch of two
doggoned drunks bluffing").

         Plaintiff's insistence that the commercial appears to be a serious offer requires
the Court to explain why the commercial is funny. Explaining why a joke is funny is
a daunting task; as the essayist E.B. White has remarked, "Humor can be dissected,
as a frog can, but the thing dies in the process." The commercial is the embodiment
of what defendant appropriately characterizes as "zany humor."

         First, the commercial suggests, as commercials often do, that use of the
advertised product will transform what, for most youth, can be a fairly routine and
ordinary experience. The military tattoo and stirring martial music, as well as the
use of subtitles in a Courier font that scroll terse messages across the screen, such as
"MONDAY 7:58 AM," evoke military and espionage thrillers. The implication of the
commercial is that Pepsi Stuff merchandise will inject drama and moment into
hitherto unexceptional lives. The commercial in this case thus makes the exaggerated
claims similar to those of many television advertisements: that by consuming the
featured clothing, car, beer, or potato chips, one will become attractive, stylish,
desirable, and admired by all. A reasonable viewer would understand such
advertisements as mere puffery, not as statements of fact and refrain from
interpreting the promises of the commercial as being literally true.

         Second, the callow youth featured in the commercial is a highly improbable
pilot, one who could barely be trusted with the keys to his parents' car, much less the
prize aircraft of the United States Marine Corps. Rather than checking the fuel
gauges on his aircraft, the teenager spends his precious preflight minutes preening.
The youth's concern for his coiffure appears to extend to his flying without a helmet.
Finally, the teenager's comment that flying a Harrier Jet to school "sure beats the
bus" evinces an improbably insouciant attitude toward the relative difficulty and
danger of piloting a fighter plane in a residential area, as opposed to taking public
transportation.

Third, the notion of traveling to school in a Harrier Jet is an exaggerated

adolescent fantasy. In this commercial, the fantasy is underscored by how the

______________________________________________________________________________

UNIT 4: OFFERS TO CONTRACT                                                63
teenager's schoolmates gape in admiration, ignoring their physics lesson. The force
of the wind generated by the Harrier Jet blows off one teacher's clothes, literally
defrocking an authority figure. As if to emphasize the fantastic quality of having a
Harrier Jet arrive at school, the Jet lands next to a plebeian bike rack. This fantasy
is, of course, extremely unrealistic. No school would provide landing space for a
student's fighter jet, or condone the disruption the jet's use would cause.

         Fourth, the primary mission of a Harrier Jet, according to the United States
Marine Corps, is to "attack and destroy surface targets under day and night visual
conditions." Manufactured by McDonnell Douglas, the Harrier Jet played a
significant role in the air offensive of Operation Desert Storm in 1991. The jet is
designed to carry a considerable armament load, including Sidewinder and Maverick
missiles. As one news report has noted, "Fully loaded, the Harrier can float like a
butterfly and sting like a bee-albeit a roaring 14-ton butterfly and a bee with 9,200
pounds of bombs and missiles." In light of the Harrier Jet's well-documented function
in attacking and destroying surface and air targets, armed reconnaissance and air
interdiction, and offensive and defensive anti-aircraft warfare, depiction of such a jet
as a way to get to school in the morning is clearly not serious even if, as plaintiff
contends, the jet is capable of being acquired "in a form that eliminates [its] potential
for military use."

         Fifth, the number of Pepsi Points the commercial mentions as required to
"purchase" the jet is 7,000,000. To amass that number of points, one would have to
drink 7,000,000 Pepsis (or roughly 190 Pepsis a day for the next hundred years--an
unlikely possibility), or one would have to purchase approximately $700,000 worth of
Pepsi Points. The cost of a Harrier Jet is roughly $23 million dollars, a fact of which
plaintiff was aware when he set out to gather the amount he believed necessary to
accept the alleged offer. Even if an objective, reasonable person were not aware of
this fact, he would conclude that purchasing a fighter plane for $700,000 is a deal too
good to be true.

         Plaintiff argues that a reasonable, objective person would have understood the
commercial to make a serious offer of a Harrier Jet because there was "absolutely no
distinction in the manner" in which the items in the commercial were presented.
Plaintiff also relies upon a press release highlighting the promotional campaign,
issued by defendant, in which "no mention is made by [defendant] of humor, or
anything of the sort." These arguments suggest merely that the humor of the
promotional campaign was tongue in cheek. Humor is not limited to what Justice
Cardozo called "the rough and boisterous joke . . . [that] evokes its own guffaws." In
light of the obvious absurdity of the commercial, the Court rejects plaintiff's argument
that the commercial was not clearly in jest.

         Plaintiff argues that additional discovery is necessary on the issues of whether
and how defendant reacted to plaintiff's "acceptance" of their "offer"; how defendant
and its employees understood the commercial would be viewed, based on test-

______________________________________________________________________________

64  CHAPTER II: CONTRACT FORMATION
marketing the commercial or on their own opinions; and how other individuals
actually responded to the commercial when it was aired.

         Plaintiff argues that additional discovery is necessary as to how defendant
reacted to his "acceptance," suggesting that it is significant that defendant twice
changed the commercial, the first time to increase the number of Pepsi Points
required to purchase a Harrier Jet to 700,000,000, and then again to amend the
commercial to state the 700,000,000 amount and add "(Just Kidding)." Plaintiff
concludes that, "Obviously, if PepsiCo truly believed that no one could take seriously
the offer contained in the original ad that I saw, this change would have been totally
unnecessary and superfluous." The record does not suggest that the change in the
amount of points is probative of the seriousness of the offer. The increase in the
number of points needed to acquire a Harrier Jet may have been prompted less by
the fear that reasonable people would demand Harrier Jets and more by the concern
that unreasonable people would threaten frivolous litigation.

         Finally, plaintiff's assertion that he should be afforded an opportunity to
determine whether other individuals also tried to accumulate enough Pepsi Points to
"purchase" a Harrier Jet is unavailing. The possibility that there were other people
who interpreted the commercial as an "offer" of a Harrier Jet does not render that
belief any more or less reasonable. The alleged offer must be evaluated on its own
terms. Having made the evaluation, the Court concludes that summary judgment is
appropriate on the ground that no reasonable, objective person would have
understood the commercial to be an offer.

         For the reasons stated above, the Court grants defendant's motion for
summary judgment. The Clerk of Court is instructed to close these cases. Any
pending motions are moot.

                                          ______________________

         Review Question 1. The Leonard court shoots down the plaintiff on two
distinct grounds. You should be prepared to articulate the difference between the two.

         Review Question 2. The plaintiff here sought additional time from the court
to engage in discovery on how other people--especially the "Pepsi Generation" targets
of the ad--interpreted it. Judge Kimba Wood was a 55-year-old graduate of the
London School of Economics and Harvard Law School who had been a highly regarded
antitrust partner at a Wall Street law firm. Was she the sort of person Pepsi expected
would collect its Points? Why didn't she think it relevant to take evidence on how the
actual targets of the commercial interpreted it?

HOBSON, J.

         On April 20, 1895, appellee [Crunden-Martin] wrote appellant [Fairmount] the
following letter:

                                                      St. Louis, Mo., April 20, 1895.

         Gentlemen:

         Please advise us the lowest price you can make us on our
         order for ten car loads of Mason green jars, complete,
         with caps, packed one dozen in case, either delivered
         here, or f.o.b. cars your place, as you prefer. State
         terms and cash discount.

         Very truly,

         Crunden-Martin W. W. Co.

To this letter appellant answered as follows:
         Fairmount, Ind., April 23, 1895.

         Crunden-Martin Wooden Ware Co.,
         St. Louis, Mo.

         Gentlemen:

         Replying to your favor of April 20th, we quote you Mason
         fruit jars, complete, in one-dozen boxes, delivered in
         East St. Louis, Ill.: Pints, $4.50; quarts, $5.00; half
         gallons, $6.50 per gross, for immediate acceptance, and
         shipment not later than May 15, 1895; sixty days'
         acceptance, or 2 off, cash in ten days.

         Yours truly,
         Fairmount Glass Works.

______________________________________________________________________________

66  CHAPTER II: CONTRACT FORMATION
Please note that we make all quotations and contracts
subject to the contingencies of agencies or
transportation, delays or accidents beyond our control.

For reply thereto, appellee sent the following telegram on April 24, 1895:
         Fairmount Glass Works, Fairmount, Ind.:
         Your letter twenty-third received. Enter order ten car
         loads as per your quotation. Specifications mailed.
         Crunden-Martin W. W. Co.

In response to this telegram, appellant sent the following:

         Fairmount, Ind., April 24, 1895.

         Crunden-Martin W. W. Co., St. Louis, Mo.

         Impossible to book your order. Output all sold. See
         letter.

         Fairmount Glass Works.

         Appellee insists that, by its telegram sent in answer to the letter of April 23,
the contract was closed for the purchase of ten car loads of Mason fruit jars. Appellant
insists that the contract was not closed by this telegram, and that it had the right to
decline to fill the order at the time it sent its telegram of April 24th. This is the chief
question in the case. The court below gave judgment in favor of appellee, and
appellant has appealed, earnestly insisting that the judgment is erroneous.

         We are referred to a number of authorities holding that a quotation of prices is
not an offer to sell, in the sense that a completed contract will arise out of the giving
of an order for merchandise in accordance with the proposed terms. There are a
number of cases holding that the transaction is not completed until the order so made
is accepted. Smith v. Gowdy, 90 Mass. 566 (1864); Beaupre v. Pacific & Atlantic
Telegraph Co., 21 Minn. 155 (1874).

         But each case must turn largely upon the language there used. In this case we
think there was more than a quotation of prices, although appellant's letter uses the
word "quote" in stating the prices given. The true meaning of the correspondence
must be determined by reading it as a whole. Appellee's letter of April 20th, which
began the transaction, did not ask for a quotation of prices. It reads: "Please advise
us the lowest price you can make us on our order for ten car loads of Mason green
jars. . . . State terms and cash discount." From this appellant could not fail to
understand that appellee wanted to know at what price it would sell it ten car loads
of these jars; so when, in answer, it wrote: "We quote you Mason fruit jars . . . pints
$4.50, quarts $5.00, half gallons $6.50 per gross, for immediate acceptance; . . . 2 off,

______________________________________________________________________________

UNIT 4: OFFERS TO CONTRACT                                                  67
cash in ten days," it must be deemed as intending to give appellee the information it
had asked for. We can hardly understand what was meant by the words "for
immediate acceptance," unless the latter was intended as a proposition to sell at these
prices if accepted immediately. In construing every contract, the aim of the court is
to arrive at the intention of the parties. In none of the cases to which we have been
referred on behalf of appellant was there on the face of the correspondence any such
expression of intention to make an offer to sell on the terms indicated.

         In Fitzhugh v. Jones, 20 Va. 83 (1818), the use of the expression that the buyer
should reply as soon as possible, in case he was disposed to accede to the terms
offered, was held sufficient to show that there was a definite proposition, which was
closed by the buyer's acceptance. The expression in appellant [Fairmount's] letter,
"for immediate acceptance," taken in connection with appellee's letter, in effect, at
what price it would sell it the goods, is, it seems to us, much stronger evidence of a
present offer, which, when accepted immediately closed the contract. Appellee's letter
was plainly an inquiry for the price and terms on which appellant would sell it the
goods, and appellant's answer to it was not a quotation of prices, but a definite offer
to sell on the terms indicated, and could not be withdrawn after the terms had been
accepted.

always get things right, you know.) As the court infers, a price "quote" is often
considered to be more like preliminary negotiation or maybe a limited-purpose
advertisement rather than an offer. Fairmount specifically said "we quote you" rather
than "we offer you"--so wouldn't the more predictable and merchant-friendly result
be to hold that Fairmount's statement was not an offer?

         Review Question 5. Older contract formation cases, like Fairmount Glass,
come from the world of letters and telegrams. Does the pervasiveness of e-mail and
other instantaneous electronic communications render moot the problems with
determining whether an offer occurred? Consider whether the next case suggests that
the digital world may not be that different from the earlier age.

68  CHAPTER II: CONTRACT FORMATION
 KLOIAN v. DOMINO'S PIZZA, L.L.C.
         Court of Appeals of Michigan

273 Mich. App. 449, 733 N.W.2d 766 (2006)

PER CURIAM

         On August 18, 1994, plaintiff J. Edward Kloian, doing business as Arbor
Management Company, entered into a lease agreement with defendant Domino's
Pizza, L.L.C. On May 14, 2003, plaintiff, the lessor, initiated this action against
defendant, the lessee, alleging that defendant had breached the lease by failing to
pay certain amounts owing for rent, holdover rent, taxes, insurance, maintenance
and repair costs, late fees, and other damages related to the removal of equipment.

         In March 2005, shortly before the trial date scheduled in this matter, the
parties engaged in settlement discussions through their attorneys. Through a series
of e-mail messages exchanged between plaintiff's attorney and defendant's attorney,
the attorneys agreed that defendant would pay plaintiff $48,000 to settle the lawsuit
in exchange for a release of all possible claims. On March 18, 2005, plaintiff's attorney
sent an e-mail to defendant's attorney, stating: "I confirmed with Mr. Kloian that he
will accept the payment of $48,000 in exchange for a dismissal with prejudice of all
claims and a release of all possible claims." In response, also on March 18, 2005,
defendant's attorney wrote: "Domino's accepts your settlement offer."

         Documents reflecting the agreement were prepared by defendant's attorney
and sent to plaintiff's attorney for his review. After review of these documents, on
March 21, 2005, plaintiff's attorney sent an e-mail to defendant's attorney stating: "I
reviewed your documents and find them to be in order. However, Mr. Kloian would
like the protection of a mutual release." On March 28, 2005, defendant's attorney sent
a response stating: "I have the check and Domino's agreement to a mutual release. I
need to revise the prior release and get it to you."

         [Plaintiff Kloian subsequently refused to sign the settlement agreement.]

         The trial court found that the parties had entered into a binding settlement
agreement on March 18, 2005. The trial court issued an order enforcing the
settlement agreement and dismissing plaintiff's claims with prejudice.

         Plaintiff first contends on appeal that the trial court erred in enforcing the
settlement agreement because the parties had not reached an agreement on essential
terms. We disagree.

         The existence and interpretation of a contract are questions of law reviewed de
novo. "An agreement to settle a pending lawsuit is a contract and is to be governed
by the legal principles applicable to the construction and interpretation of contracts."
Walbridge Aldinger Co. v. Walcon Corp., 525 N.W.2d 489 (Mich. Ct. App. 1994).

UNIT 4: OFFERS TO CONTRACT                 69
"Before a contract can be completed, there must be an offer and acceptance. Unless
an acceptance is unambiguous and in strict conformance with the offer, no contract
is formed." Pakideh v. Franklin Commercial Mortgage Group, Inc.,540 N.W.2d 777
(Mich Ct. App. 1995). Further, a contract requires mutual assent or a meeting of the
minds on all the essential terms. Burkhardt v. Bailey, 680 N.W.2d 453 (Mich. Ct. App.
2004).

         On March 18, 2005, plaintiff's attorney sent an e-mail to defendant's attorney
stating that plaintiff would "accept the payment of $48,000 in change [sic] for a
dismissal with prejudice of all claims and a release as [sic] all possible claims." An
attorney has the apparent authority3 to settle a lawsuit on behalf of his or her client.
Nelson v. Consumers Power Co., 497 N.W.2d 205 (Mich. Ct. App. 1993). The e-mail
from plaintiff's attorney constituted a settlement offer. "An offer is defined as `the
manifestation of willingness to enter into a bargain, so made as to justify another
person in understanding that his assent to that bargain is invited and will conclude
it.'" Eerdmans v. Maki, 573 N.W.2d 329 (Mich. Ct. App. 1997). In response,
defendant's attorney sent the following e-mail to plaintiff's attorney:

             Domino's accepts your settlement offer contained in the message
    below. I spoke with the court, advised it of the settlement and confirmed
    that we need not appear in court in connection with the settlement. I
    have ordered a settlement draft from Domino's in the amount of $48,000,
    made payable jointly to Mr. Kloian and your firm. I will forward a
    stipulation and order for dismissal with prejudice and a release for
    approval by you and Mr. Kloian respectively. You should have them in
    the next few days. Please call with any questions. I'm pleased we were
    able to resolve this matter without trial. - Neil

         The e-mail from defendant's attorney constituted an acceptance of plaintiff's
settlement offer. There clearly was a meeting of the minds on the essential terms of
the agreement.

    Affirmed.

EVER-TITE ROOFING CORP. v. GREEN
Court of Appeal of Louisiana, Second Circuit

                 83 So. 2d 449 (1955)

AYRES, J.

         Defendants executed and signed an instrument June 10, 1953, for the purpose
of obtaining the services of plaintiff in re-roofing their residence situated in Webster
Parish, Louisiana. The document set out in detail the work to be done and the price
therefor to be paid in monthly installments. This instrument was likewise signed by
plaintiff's sale representative, who, however, was without authority to accept the
contract for and on behalf of the plaintiff. This alleged contract contained these
provisions:

         This agreement shall become binding only upon written
         acceptance hereof, by the principal or authorized
         officer of the Contractor, or upon commencing
         performance of the work. * * * This written agreement is
         the only and entire contract covering the subject matter
         hereof and no other representations have been made unto
         Owner except these herein contained. No guarantee on
         repair work, partial roof jobs, or paint jobs.

         Inasmuch as this work was to be performed entirely on credit, it was necessary
for plaintiff to obtain credit reports and approval from the lending institution which
was to finance said contract. With this procedure defendants were more or less
familiar and knew their credit rating would have to be checked and a report made.
On receipt of the proposed contract in plaintiff's office on the day following its
execution, plaintiff requested a credit report, which was made after investigation and
which was received in due course and submitted by plaintiff to the lending agency.
Additional information was requested by this institution, which was likewise in due
course transmitted to the institution, which then gave its approval.

         The day immediately following this approval, which was either June 18 or 19,
1953, plaintiff engaged its workmen and two trucks, loaded the trucks with the
necessary roofing materials and proceeded from Shreveport to defendants' residence

______________________________________________________________________________

UNIT 4: OFFERS TO CONTRACT                    71
for the purpose of doing the work and performing the services allegedly contracted
for the defendants. Upon their arrival at defendants' residence, the workmen found
others in the performance of the work which plaintiff had contracted to do.
Defendants notified plaintiff's workmen that the work had been contracted to other
parties two days before and forbade them to do the work.

         Formal acceptance of the contract was not made under the signature and
approval of an agent of plaintiff. It was, however, the intention of plaintiff to accept
the contract by commencing the work, which was one of the ways provided for in the
instrument for its acceptance, as will be shown by reference to the extract from the
contract quoted hereinabove.

         The basis of the judgment appealed was that defendants had timely notified
plaintiff before "commencing performance of work." The trial court held that notice
to plaintiff's workmen upon their arrival with the materials that defendants did not
desire them to commence the actual work was sufficient and timely to signify their
intention to withdraw from the contract. With this conclusion we find ourselves
unable to agree.

         Defendants' attempt to justify their delay in thus notifying plaintiff for the
reason they did not know where or how to contact plaintiff is without merit. The
contract itself, a copy of which was left with them, conspicuously displayed plaintiff's
name, address and telephone number. Be that as it may, defendants at no time, from
June 10, 1953, until plaintiff's workmen arrived for the purpose of commencing the
work, notified or attempted to notify plaintiff of their intention to abrogate, terminate
or cancel the contract.

         Defendants evidently knew this work was to be processed through plaintiff's
Shreveport office. The record discloses no unreasonable delay on plaintiff's part in
receiving, processing or accepting the contract or in commencing the work contracted
to be done. No time limit was specified in the contract within which it was to be
accepted or within which the work was to be begun. It was nevertheless understood
between the parties that some delay would ensue before the acceptance of the contract
and the commencement of the work, due to the necessity of compliance with the
requirements relative to financing the job through a lending agency. The evidence as
referred to hereinabove shows that plaintiff proceeded with due diligence.

         The general rule of law is that an offer proposed may be withdrawn before its
acceptance and that no obligation is incurred thereby. This is, however, not without
exceptions. For instance, Restatement of the Law of Contracts [section 40]4 stated:

    4 [The court here is citing the first Restatement of Contracts. See section 41 of the Restatement

(Second) of Contracts for the updated version of the quoted section. - Eds.]

______________________________________________________________________________

72  CHAPTER II: CONTRACT FORMATION
         (1) The power to create a contract by acceptance of an offer terminates
         at the time specified in the offer, or, if no time is specified, at the end of
         a reasonable time.

         [(2)] What is a reasonable time is a question of fact depending on the
         nature of the contract proposed, the usages of business and other
         circumstances of the case which the offeree at the time of his acceptance
         either knows or has reason to know.

         Therefore, since the contract did not specify the time within which it was to be
accepted or within which the work was to have been commenced, a reasonable time
must be allowed therefor in accordance with the facts and circumstances and the
evident intention of the parties. A reasonable time is contemplated where no time is
expressed. What is a reasonable time depends more or less upon the circumstances
surrounding each particular case. The delays to process defendants' application were
not unusual. The contract was accepted by plaintiff by the commencement of the
performance of the work contracted to be done. This commencement began with the
loading of the trucks with the necessary materials in Shreveport and transporting
such materials and the workmen to defendants' residence. Actual commencement or
performance of the work therefore began before any notice of dissent by defendants
was given plaintiff. The proposition and its acceptance thus became a completed
contract.

         By their aforesaid acts defendants breached the contract. They employed
others to do the work contracted to be done by plaintiff and forbade plaintiff's
workmen to engage upon that undertaking. By this breach defendants are legally
bound to respond to plaintiff in damages. . . .

         For the reasons assigned, the judgment appealed is annulled, avoided,
reversed and set aside and there is now judgment in favor of plaintiff, Ever-Tite
Roofing Corporation, against the defendants, G. T. Green and Mrs. Jessie Fay Green,
for the full sum of $ 311.37, with 5 per cent per annum interest thereon from judicial
demand until paid, and for all costs.

         Reversed and rendered.

Problem 4.1

         A vending machine in the student lounge carries several types of beverages.
Leonard wants a beverage. On the front of the machine is a large button that says
"Pepsi Cola $1.00." Leonard inserts the dollar and presses the button. The machine
flashes a light that says "sold out" and does not deliver the Pepsi Cola. Instead, it
returns Leonard's $1 bill. Who--if anyone--is the offeror in this transaction and who
is the offeree? Was a contract formed between the parties? If so, was the contract
breached?

Problem 4.2

         Sheldon saw the same commercial that Leonard saw in Leonard v. Pepsico, Inc.
He wanted the Pepsi leather jacket for 1,450 Pepsi points--which he could earn by
purchasing 1,450 individual Pepsi bottles or 725 six-packs of cans. He accumulated
the points and submitted them to Pepsi. Pepsi subsequently notified him that they
rejected his offer for the leather jacket and returned the Pepsi Points to him. When
he complained, Pepsi informed him that neither its television commercial nor its
catalogue was an "offer" and therefore no contract was ever formed. Does Sheldon
have any contractual rights against Pepsi? Why or why not?

Problem 4.3
         Kershaw, a salt dealer in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, sent an e-mail message to

__________________________________________________________________

Problems With Offers

                                           FOCUS OF THIS UNIT

         We now know--see Restatement (Second) of Contracts § 24--that an offer is a
statement of willingness to enter into a bargain that is made in such a way that the
offeree reasonably understands that if she accepts the offer, a contract will be formed.
Thus, a statement that "I hereby offer to sell you my 1988 Ford Crown Victoria for
$2,500," would clearly be an offer.

         But how long does that offer stay open? Remember that the offer creates a
power in the offeree to make a binding contract. Once the offer is made, the offeror is
to some extent at the mercy of the offeree. And most of us do not want to be on the
hook indefinitely. Most of us understand this inherently. If someone offered to sell
you a house in Los Angeles for $10,000 in 1957, could you wait until 2017 to accept?

         Nothing Lasts Forever. As we will see, offers--like milk-- eventually spoil at
some point. Offers can be terminated in several ways. A rejection of the offer
terminates it, as does a counter-offer. Thus:

         THELMA: I'll sell you my 1988 Ford Crown Victoria for $2,500.

         LOUISE: No, thanks.

         THELMA: Okay.

         LOUISE: No, wait. I changed my mind. Yes.

Here, the statement "No, thanks" is, in legal terminology, a rejection. An offer ends
when it is rejected. At this point there is no contract. (Of course, Thelma would be
free to treat Louise's last statement as a new offer that she might accept.) Similarly:

         THELMA: I'll sell you my 1988 Ford Crown Victoria for $2,500.

         LOUISE: No, but I'll give you $2,000.

______________________________________________________________________________

UNIT 5: PROBLEMS WITH OFFERS  77
Here, we have a counter-offer. The counter-offer also terminates the first offer. If
Thelma doesn't accept the $2,000, there is no contract. Of course, if Thelma says,
"You've got a deal!" there is a contract because Thelma accepted Louise's counter-
offer. These are simple examples; as you will see from the cases below, things can get
more complicated.

         "Master of the Offer." Note that it is the offeror who gets to control the content
of the offer, to specify exactly what is wanted. We thus frequently say that the offeror
is "master of the offer." What does that mean? It means that the offeror gets to specify
exactly when and how the offeree must go about accepting the offer. (The issue of
what constitutes acceptance is the subject of the next unit.) Thus, if an offer specifies
a time that it will remain open or a time it will end, it terminates at precisely that
time--assuming it hasn't terminated earlier for some reason. As you can see from the
following, there are several other ways that an offer can be cut off.

         In connection with this unit, you may find it helpful to read--or at least skim
over--sections 30, 32, 36, 38-43, and 48 of the Restatement (Second) of Contracts.

                           1998 Minn. App. LEXIS 243 (March 3, 1998)

WILLIS, J.

         Respondents Kathy and Mark Thorson and the decedent, Helen Severtson,
were neighbors for approximately 14 years, during which time they became good
friends. After Severtson's husband died in 1993, the Thorsons spent substantial time
with Severtson. Kathy Thorson visited with her almost daily when she took Severtson
her mail. Mark Thorson did odd jobs for Severtson when needed.

         The Thorsons had told both Severtson and her husband on several occasions
that they would be interested in purchasing the Severtsons' property if they ever
wanted to sell it. On February 16, 1996, Severtson and the Thorsons signed a typed
document that provides:

         I, Helen Severtson, give Mark and Kathy Thorson first
         option to purchase my farmsite, all buildings, including
         the quonset home, rock quarry, including any leased
         quarry rights, and adjoining farm land. * * * *

______________________________________________________________________________

78  CHAPTER II: CONTRACT FORMATION
Purchase price agreed upon is $100,000, to be paid to
Helen Severtson if living or to the Estate of Helen
Severtson if she is deceased or incapacitated to deal
with sale of above listed property.

Any persons occupying the quonset home will vacate and
leave property in good repair before or upon closure
date on above property.

There is a hand-written addendum, initialed by the parties, that provides:

In the event that Helen Severtson should die suddenly, persons in the quonset home
will be given three months to vacate all premises and to leave them in good repair,
otherwise under any other conditions the above will apply.

         Myron Danielson, another of Severtson's neighbors, testified that he drafted
the typewritten portion of the document but was not actually present when the
Thorsons or Severtson signed it. Danielson also testified that he drafted the document
for Severtson so "that there would be some legal document that her wishes would be
carried out" and so there would not be litigation over the matter.

         Severtson died on August 4, 1996. The Thorsons recorded the document with
the Dodge County Recorder in September 1996 as an option contract. On October 17,
1996, the Thorsons notified Inez Breiter, the personal representative of Helen
Severtson's estate, of their intent to purchase Severtson's property. When the estate's
representative disallowed their claim, the Thorsons petitioned the district court for
relief.

         After a hearing, the district court rejected the Thorsons' argument that the
document signed by Severtson and the Thorsons is an option to purchase property,
concluding that there was no consideration separate and distinct from a promise to
pay the purchase price. But the court found that a bilateral contract for the purchase
of land was created because (1) Severtson offered to sell her property; (2) the offer to
sell survived her death; and (3) the Thorsons accepted the offer by notifying the
estate's representative of their intent to purchase. The Thorsons and the estate's
representative both moved the court for amended findings, and the court issued its
amended findings of fact, conclusions of law, order, and judgment on June 30, 1997.
The court concluded that "the Thorsons were entitled to possession [of the property]
within 90 days of [Severtson's] death or their acceptance of the offer." Because both
of those dates had already passed, the court ordered that Thorsons were entitled to
possession of the property within 90 days after the date of its order. This appeal
followed.

         "The construction and effect of a contract are questions of law for the court."
Turner v. Alpha Phi Sorority House, 276 N.W.2d 63, 66 (Minn. 1979). "The court's
role in interpreting a contract is to ascertain and give effect to the intention of the

parties." Metropolitan Sports Facilities Comm'n v. General Mills, Inc., 470 N.W.2d
118, 122-23 (Minn. 1991). But the court may only give effect to the parties' intent if
that can be done consistently with established legal principles. Republic Nat'l Life
Ins. Co. v. Lorraine Realty Corp., 279 N.W.2d 349, 354 (Minn. 1979).

         The estate's representative argues that the district court erred in concluding
that Severtson offered to sell her property to the Thorsons, based on the fact that the
document they signed gives the Thorsons a "first option to purchase" the Severtson
property. An offer is conduct that empowers an offeree to create a contract by his or
her acceptance. League General Ins. Co. v. Tvedt, 317 N.W.2d 40, 43 (Minn. 1982).
Where we can ascertain the parties' intent from the written contract, we do not
"remake the contract" by construing it differently. Art Goebel, Inc. v. North Suburban
Agencies, Inc., 567 N.W.2d 511, 516 (Minn. 1997). The document signed by Severtson
and the Thorsons recites no conditions precedent to the exercise of the Thorsons' "first
option to purchase"; it unambiguously manifests Severtson's intent to sell her
property to the Thorsons. The district court, therefore, did not err in concluding that
Severtson offered to sell her property to the Thorsons.

         The estate's representative argues that if Severtson did offer to sell her
property, the district court erred in finding that the offer did not terminate on
Severtson's death. The district court relied on the Restatement (Second) of Contracts
§ 36 (1981), which provides:

         (1) An offeree's power of acceptance may be terminated by

                  [(a) rejection or counter-offer by the offeree, or

                  (b) lapse of time, or

                  (c) revocation by the offeror, or]

                  (d) death or incapacity of the offeror or offeree.

         [(2) In addition, an offeree's power of acceptance is terminated by the
         non-occurrence of any condition of acceptance under the terms of the
         offer.]

See also Cooke v. Belzer, 413 N.W.2d 623, 627 (Minn. App. 1987) (citing section 36 of
the Restatement). Noting that section 36 states that an offeror's death may terminate
an offeree's power to accept, the district court concluded that an offeror's death does
not automatically terminate an offer. The court found that the offer did not terminate
here because Severtson intended her offer to remain open even if she died before it
was accepted. But section 36 of the Restatement simply lists alternative methods by
which an offeree's power to accept is terminated, while sections 36-49 discuss the
specific circumstances under which each method applies. Rest. 2d § 36, cmt. a. Section
48 provides that

______________________________________________________________________________

80  CHAPTER II: CONTRACT FORMATION
         an offeree's power of acceptance is terminated when the offeree or offeror
         dies or is deprived of legal capacity to enter into the proposed contract.

See also Heideman v. Northwestern Nat'l Life Ins. Co., 546 N.W.2d 760, 764 (Minn.
App. 1996) (adopting section 48 of the restatement).

         The basis for the rule is described by Professor Williston in his treatise on
contracts:

         Assuming that the formation of a contract requires mutual mental
         assent of the parties, and offer and acceptance [are] merely evidence of
         such assent, it would be obviously impossible that a contract should be
         formed where either party to the transaction died before this assent was
         obtained. That such assent was formerly thought necessary seems
         probable, and as to death, this theory is still maintained. Accordingly, it
         is generally held that the death of the offeror terminates the offer.

1 SAMUEL WILLISTON, A TREATISE ON THE LAW OF CONTRACTS § 62 (3d ed. 1957).
Although Severtson may have intended for her offer to survive her death, we cannot
harmonize that intent with the established legal principle that an offer terminates
on the death of the offeror.

         The Thorsons cite, as did the district court, Frederick v. Peoples State Bank of
Madison Lake, 385 N.W.2d 11 (Minn. App. 1986). The court in Frederick, in turn,
cites the New Jersey Superior Court for the proposition that

         where the owner of real property enters into a contract of sale and then
         dies before executing a deed * * *, the other party may enforce the
         contract against the owner's estate, the theory being that equitable title
         to the property vests in the vendee as soon as the contract was executed,
         subject, however, to a lien in favor of the vendor for the unpaid purchase
         price. * * * Such contracts, therefore, are enforceable, even though one
         of the parties thereto may die before performance is had.

Id. at 15. But because the Thorsons did not accept Severtson's offer before she died,
there was no contract for sale at the time of Severtson's death. The issue is not
whether a contract for sale survives Severtson's death, but whether her offer to enter
into a contract for sale survives her death. Because the document signed by Severtson
and the Thorsons is properly characterized as an offer to sell, the Thorsons' power to
accept the offer terminated when Severtson died.

         The Thorsons argue that the document should be treated as an option to
purchase. But the district court found that it is not an option, and because the
Thorsons did not raise this issue in a notice of review, it is not properly before this

court. See Minn. R. Civ. App. P. 106 (explaining respondent's right to obtain review).1
Nevertheless, we note that the record supports the district court's determination that
there was no legal consideration here separate and distinct from the promise to pay
the purchase price. And the district court correctly concluded that without such
consideration, the document is not an option to purchase. See Country Club Oil Co. v.
Lee, 58 N.W.2d 247, 250 (Minn. 1953).

         Because the document at issue was an offer to sell that terminated on
Severtson's death, the district court erred in finding that a bilateral contract for the
purchase of real estate was created when the Thorsons gave the personal
representative of Severtson's estate notice of their intent to purchase the Severtson
property.

                                          ______________________

         Review Question 1. The Severtson court notes that the document signed by
Helen was not an "option" to purchase the property. Why not? What would have made
this an enforceable option contract? You should consider section 25 of the
Restatement (Second) of Contracts--even though you may not find it to be as
enlightening as you might wish.

     PETTERSON v. PATTBERG
      Court of Appeals of New York
    248 N.Y. 86, 161 N.E. 428 (1928)

KELLOGG, J.

         [Pattberg held a mortgage of $5,450 on Petterson's home at 5301 Sixth Ave.,
Brooklyn, N.Y., which had five years left to run. Pattberg wrote to Petterson saying
that if "said mortgage [was] paid" by Petterson "on or before May 31, 1924," Pattberg
would allow Petterson to pay $780 less than the amount owed.]

         Subsequently, on a day in the latter part of May, 1924, Petterson presented
himself at the defendant's home, and knocked at the door. The defendant demanded
the name of his caller. Petterson replied: "It is Mr. Petterson. I have come to pay off
the mortgage." The defendant answered that he had sold the mortgage [to someone
else]. Petterson stated that he would like to talk with the defendant, so the defendant
partly opened the door. Thereupon Petterson exhibited the cash and said he was

    1 [By the court] The Thorsons argue that Restatement (Second) of Contracts § 37 applies to

the document. Section 37 provides that under an option contract, the right to accept "is not . . .

terminated . . . by death . . . of the offeror, unless the requirements are met for the discharge of a

contractual duty." Because the document is not an option contract, section 37 does not apply.

______________________________________________________________________________

82  CHAPTER II: CONTRACT FORMATION
ready to pay off the mortgage according to the agreement. The defendant refused to
take the money. It, therefore, became necessary for Petterson to pay to [the new
mortgagor] the full amount of the bond and mortgage. It is claimed that he thereby
sustained a loss of $780, the sum which the defendant agreed to allow upon the bond
and mortgage if payment in full of principal, less that sum, was made on or before
May 31st, 1924. The plaintiff has had a recovery for the sum thus claimed, with
interest.

         Clearly the defendant's letter proposed to Petterson the making of a unilateral
contract, the gift of a promise in exchange for the performance of an act. The thing
conditionally promised by the defendant was the reduction of the mortgage debt. The
act requested to be done, in consideration of the offered promise, was payment in full
of the reduced principal of the debt prior to the due date thereof. "If an act is
requested, that very act and no other must be given." SAMUEL WILLISTON, THE LAW
OF CONTRACTS § 73 (1927). It is elementary that any offer to enter into a unilateral
contract may be withdrawn before the act requested to be done has been performed.
A bidder at a sheriff's sale may revoke his bid at any time before the property is struck
down to him. The offer of a reward in consideration of an act to be performed is
revocable before the very act requested has been done. So, also, an offer to pay a
broker commissions, upon a sale of land for the offeror, is revocable at any time before
the land is sold, although prior to revocation the broker performs services in an effort
to effectuate a sale.

         An interesting question arises when, as here, the offeree approaches the offeror
with the intention of proffering performance and, before actual tender is made, the
offer is withdrawn. Of such a case Williston says: "The offeror may see the approach
of the offeree and know that an acceptance is contemplated. If the offeror can say `I
revoke' before the offeree accepts, however brief the interval of time between the two
acts, there is no escape from the conclusion that the offer is terminated." WILLISTON,
supra, § 60-b. In this instance Petterson, standing at the door of the defendant's
house, stated to the defendant that he had come to pay off the mortgage. Before a
tender of the necessary moneys had been made the defendant informed Petterson
that he had sold the mortgage. That was a definite notice to Petterson that the
defendant could not perform his offered promise and that a tender to the defendant,
who was no longer the creditor, would be ineffective to satisfy the debt. "An offer to
sell property may be withdrawn before acceptance without any formal notice to the
person to whom the offer is made. It is sufficient if that person has actual knowledge
that the person who made the offer has done some act inconsistent with the
continuance of the offer, such as selling the property to a third person." Dickinson v.
Dodds, [1876] 2 Ch. Div. 463. To the same effect is Coleman v. Applegarth, 68 Md. 21
(1887).

______________________________________________________________________________

UNIT 5: PROBLEMS WITH OFFERS  83
         Thus, it clearly appears that the defendant's offer was withdrawn before its
acceptance had been tendered. It is unnecessary to determine, therefore, what the
legal situation might have been had tender been made before withdrawal. It is the
individual view of the writer that the same result would follow. This would be so, for
the act requested to be performed was the completed act of payment, a thing
incapable of performance unless assented to by the person to be paid. WILLISTON,
supra, § 60-b. Clearly an offering party has the right to name the precise act
performance of which would convert his offer into a binding promise. Whatever the
act may be until it is performed the offer must be revocable. However, the supposed
case is not before us for decision. We think that in this particular instance the offer
of the defendant was withdrawn before it became a binding promise, and, therefore,
that no contract was ever made for the breach of which the plaintiff may claim
damages.

         The judgment of the Appellate Division and that of the Trial Term should be
reversed and the complaint dismissed, with costs in all courts.

LEHMAN, J. (dissenting).

         The promise made by the defendant was not made as a gift or mere gratuity to
the plaintiff. It was made for the purpose of obtaining from the defendant something
which the plaintiff desired. It constituted an offer which was to become binding
whenever the plaintiff should give, in return for the defendant's promise, exactly the
consideration which the defendant requested.

         Here the defendant requested no counter promise from the plaintiff. The
consideration requested by the defendant for his promise to accept payment was, I
agree, some act to be performed by the plaintiff. Until the act requested was
performed, the defendant might undoubtedly revoke his offer. Our problem is to
determine from the words of the letter read in the light of surrounding circumstances
what act the defendant requested as consideration for his promise.

         The defendant undoubtedly made his offer as an inducement to the plaintiff to
"pay" the mortgage before it was due. Therefore, it is said, that "the act requested to
be performed was the completed act of payment, a thing incapable of performance
unless assented to by the person to be paid." In unmistakable terms the defendant
agreed to accept payment, yet we are told that the defendant intended, and the
plaintiff should have understood, that the act requested by the defendant, as
consideration for his promise to accept payment, included performance by the
defendant himself of the very promise for which the act was to be consideration. The
defendant's promise was to become binding only when fully performed; and part of
the consideration to be furnished by the plaintiff for the defendant's promise was to
be the performance of that promise by the defendant. So construed, the defendant's
promise or offer, though intended to induce action by the plaintiff, is but a snare and
delusion. The plaintiff could not reasonably suppose that the defendant was asking

______________________________________________________________________________

84  CHAPTER II: CONTRACT FORMATION
him to procure the performance by the defendant of the very act which the defendant
promised to do, yet we are told that even after the plaintiff done all else which the
defendant requested, the defendant's promise was still not binding because the
defendant chose not to perform.

         I cannot believe that a result so extraordinary could have been intended when
the defendant wrote the letter. "The thought behind the phrase proclaims itself
misread when the outcome of the reading is injustice or absurdity." Surace v. Danna,
161 N.E. 315 (N.Y. 1928) (Cardozo, C.J.). If the defendant intended to induce payment
by the plaintiff and yet reserve the right to refuse payment when offered he should
have used a phrase better calculated to express his meaning than the words: "I agree
to accept." A promise to accept payment, by its very terms, must necessarily become
binding, if at all, not later than when a present offer to pay is made.

         Under a fair construction of the words of the letter I think the plaintiff had
done the act which the defendant requested as consideration for his promise. The
plaintiff offered to pay with present intention and ability to make that payment.

         The judgment should be affirmed.

                                          ______________________

         Review Question 2. The majority and the dissent in Petterson v. Pattberg do
not appear to disagree about the underlying rules on revocation of an offer, yet they
have very different characterizations of what the facts of the case actually mean for
purposes of applying those rules. See Restatement (Second) of Contracts §§ 35, 42.
Whose reading of the facts and their legal meaning do you find more persuasive,
Judge Kellogg's majority opinion or Judge Lehman's dissent? Why?

          CONFEDERATE MOTORS, INC. v. TERNY
United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts

                  831 F. Supp. 2d 414 (D. Mass. 2011)

JUDITH GAIL DEIN , U.S.M.J.

         This matter is before the court on Confederate Motors, Inc.'s "Motion to Enforce
Settlement." By this motion, Confederate contends that it reached a settlement
agreement with the defendant, Francois-Xavier Terny, through attorney emails.
Terny denies that a settlement had been reached.

[Confederate Motors was an American custom motorcycle manufacturer,

whose chair was Herbert Chambers. Francois-Xavier Terny, a financier, invested in

Confederate, was named to its board, and signed a consulting agreement to help it

______________________________________________________________________________

with distribution. The parties ultimately fell out in an acrimonious dispute. Although
the agreement with Terny contained a forum selection clause requiring all litigation
among the parties to be brought in Massachusetts, Confederate ultimately sued
Terny for claimed breach of contract in Alabama. Terny moved to transfer the
litigation to Massachusetts.]

         On December 13, 2010, Terny, through his counsel Laurence McDuff, filed a
Motion to Enforce Forum Section Clause seeking to have the Alabama case dismissed,
with leave to have Confederate refile it in Massachusetts. On December 15, 2010 the
motion was scheduled for oral argument on January 21, 2011. Meanwhile, counsel
for both parties had begun to explore a possible settlement. In a December 9, 2010
email, Chance Turner (attorney for Confederate) proposed the following:

    We feel a reasonable solution for all parties is the mutual release of all
    existing claims, the return of the consulting shares (505,000) to the
    corporation, and one hundred and fifty thousand dollars for fees,
    expenses and compensatory damages. I believe my client would be
    interested in accepting all corporate shares now in your client's
    possession in lieu of a cash payment. Please respond to this offer within
    two weeks.

         Laurence McDuff (attorney for Terny) replied six days later, on December 15,
with a "counteroffer" in which Terny "will agree to return the 505,000 shares, and
execute mutual releases, but he is not willing to pay the monetary component of your
offer." He concluded with "[h]opefully we can work something out along these lines."
Attorney Turner responded one week later, on December 22, 2010. In his email he
wrote:

    I spoke with my client regarding your counteroffer. In the interest of
    settlement, we can reduce the monetary component to one hundred
    thousand. Let me know what your client thinks.

Attorney McDuff replied six days later, on December 28. In his email he wrote:

    Francois still is willing to return the 505,000 shares and execute mutual
    releases, but he declines to pay you any monetary component.

Attorney Turner did not reply.

         The litigation proceeded. Oral argument was heard on January 21, 2011 in the
Alabama District Court. Confederate opposed the motion to enforce the forum
selection clause. At the hearing, the court denied the request that the action be
dismissed, but granted the alternative relief that the case be transferred to
Massachusetts. This was confirmed by a written order on January 24, 2011.

         On January 24, 2011, nearly four weeks after Attorney McDuff's last email
regarding a possible settlement, Attorney Turner sent Attorney McDuff the following
email:

______________________________________________________________________________

86                              CHAPTER II: CONTRACT FORMATION
         After lengthy discussions with my client, we are prepared to accept your
last offer of settlement under the terms set forth in your last email. Please give
me a call or e-mail tomorrow to discuss this issue. Thanks.

         This was apparently in response to Attorney McDuff's December 28th
communication quoted above. Attorney McDuff responded on January 25, 2011,
writing that he had "forwarded this to Francois [Terny] and will get back with you
when I have his response." On January 26, 2011, Attorney McDuff followed up with
an email to Attorney Turner stating:

         Chance, now that the case is being transferred, my client has asked me
         to let Eric Galler handle any further settlement discussions. Eric is
         aware of your last offer.

Attorney McDuff then provided Attorney Galler's contact information. Attorney
Turner did not object to the characterization of his January 24th communication as
an "offer," nor did he indicate that there was no need for further "settlement
discussions" since a deal had been struck. Rather, on February 3, 2011, he sent the
following email to Attorney Galler:

         I apologize for not contacting you sooner. I've been in trial this week. I
         just wanted to touch base before the case was transferred to Boston. At
         this time, we accept the last offer on 12/28/10 from Mr. Terny. There has
         been no retraction of that written offer, so I am under the impression
         that offer is still valid. Please let me know your position as soon as
         possible. We are experiencing a winter storm here, so I may be unable
         to get to the office tomorrow.

No further settlement discussions took place and no draft documents were exchanged.
Rather, on February 22, 2011, Terny filed claims against Confederate and Chambers
in this court, including claims for breach of fiduciary duty, violation of the Blue Sky
laws, fraud, and negligent misrepresentation. In addition to seeking monetary
damages, Terny is seeking a declaration that he is the owner of 805,000 shares of
Confederate. On March 14, 2011, Confederate filed the instant motion to enforce the
settlement agreement.

         In the formation of a contract, an offer must be matched by an acceptance. A
counteroffer proposing a term that is materially different from that contained in the
original offer constitutes a rejection of the offer and negates any agreement.
Moreover, it is hornbook law that an offeree's power of acceptance vanishes "at the
time specified in the offer, and if no deadline is prescribed, at the end of a reasonable
time." Mathewson, 827 F.2d at 853. See also Restatement (Second) of Contracts §
41(1) (1981) ("An offeree's power of acceptance is terminated at the time specified in
the offer, or, if no time is specified, at the end of a reasonable time"). Finally, in order
for an enforceable contract to exist, the parties must have reached an agreement on

______________________________________________________________________________

UNIT 5: PROBLEMS WITH OFFERS  87
all essential terms. See, e.g., Situation Mgmt. Sys., Inc. v. Malouf, Inc., 724 N.E.2d
699, 703 (Mass. 2000) ("It is axiomatic that to create an enforceable contract, there
must be agreement between the parties on the material terms of that contract, and
the parties must have a present intention to be bound by that agreement."); Sagamore
Ins. Co. v. Sudduth, 45 So.3d 1286, 1290 (Ala. Ct. Civ. App. 2010) ("settlement
agreements, like other agreements, are not valid when there has been no meeting of
the minds with regard to the final terms of the agreement"). Application of these
principles to the instant case compels the conclusion that there is no enforceable
settlement agreement.

         Assuming, arguendo, that Attorney McDuff's email of December 28th was a
firm offer, it had expired before Confederate responded a month later, on January
24th. Under the circumstances of these parties' interactions, the response was not
made within a reasonable time.

         In its initial offer, Confederate made it clear that negotiations were to proceed
at a fairly rapid pace: thus in his December 9th email, Attorney Turner requested a
response "within two weeks." Thereafter, the parties responded to each other in no
more than a week, with Attorney McDuff responding on December 15, 2010, Attorney
Turner responding on December 22, 2010 and then Attorney McDuff replying on
December 28, 2010. Thus, the parties clearly intended that any response would be
made promptly. There is no basis in the record for Confederate to have assumed that
an offer would remain open for a month. See Crellin Techs., Inc. v. Equipmentlease
Corp., 18 F.3d 1, 9 (1st Cir. 1994) ("four months is an unreasonably long time for a
financing offer to remain open" given "rapidly fluctuating interest rates" so "it would
have been thoroughly unreasonable for appellant to believe that a sale/leaseback
proposal made in November and not then accepted would linger on the table until the
following March").

         Moreover, there are "no objective facts to suggest" that Confederate believed
that the "offer" of December 28th remained open as of the time of the hearing. For
example, on January 18, 2011 Confederate affirmatively filed a response to the
pending motion to enforce the forum selection clause, without indicating that the
parties were engaged in settlement negotiations. At the oral argument on January
21, 2011, Confederate again did not represent to the court that it was engaged in
settlement discussions but, rather, addressed the motion on the merits. In fact, at no
time during the period between December 28th and January 21st did Attorney
Turner indicate that his client was considering the "offer." Even after the ruling
adverse to Confederate on January 21, 2011, Attorney Turner contends that he asked
if "that offer [was] still open" because his client might "reconsider its position" as a
result of the transfer of the case to Massachusetts. Such conduct makes it clear that
Confederate's attorney knew that there was no outstanding offer for Confederate to
accept at the time of the Alabama court's ruling.

lease "[i]n the event you build within the next five years . . . an addition to your
warehouse" remained open for about three-and-a-half years, ending when the
landlord died. In Confederate Motors, however, the offer from December 28, 2010
didn't even survive a full month, given that Attorney Turner's January 24, 2011
acceptance correspondence did not create a contract. How can both of these opinions
be right? What traits did the offer in Confederate Motors have that caused it to have
such a short lifespan? Why, in contrast, could the offer in New Headley Tobacco
remain open for well over three years?

[Mr. Miller of Brunswick to Poel & Arnold, January 7, 1911.

             We beg herewith to advise you that within the past few weeks
    there has come to our attention through a statement made to us for the
    first time by Mr. Rogers, information as to certain transactions had by
    him with you in the past, and especially as to a transaction in April last
    relating to 12 tons of crude rubber. Mr. Rogers had no authority to effect
    any such transaction on our account, nor had we any notice or knowledge
    of his action until he made a voluntary statement disclosing the facts
    within the past few weeks.

             In order that you may not be put to any unnecessary
    inconvenience, we feel bound to give you notice at the earliest
    opportunity after investigating the facts, that we shall not recognize
    these transactions or any others that may have been entered into with
    Mr. Rogers which were without our knowledge or authority.

    The first letter is of no legal significance, and only the other three need be

considered. The fundamental question in this case is whether these writings

______________________________________________________________________________

90                  CHAPTER II: CONTRACT FORMATION
constitute a contract between the parties. An analysis of their provisions will show
that they do not constitute a contract. The plaintiffs' letter of April 4th is a mere offer
or proposal by the plaintiffs that the defendant should accept the proposed contract
enclosed which is said to embody an oral order that the defendant had that day given
the plaintiffs. The letter of the defendant of April 6th did not accept this offer. If the
intention of the defendant had been to accept the offer made in the plaintiffs' letter
of April 4th, it would have been a simple matter for the defendant to have indorsed
its acceptance upon the proposed contract which the plaintiffs' letter of April 4th had
enclosed. Instead of adopting this simple and obvious method of indicating an intent
to accept the contract proposed by the plaintiffs the defendant submitted its own
proposal and specified the terms and conditions upon which it should be accepted.
The defendant's letter of April 6th was not an acceptance of this offer made by the
plaintiffs in their letter of April 4th. It was a counter-offer or proposition for a
contract. Its provisions make it perfectly clear that the defendant (1) asked the
plaintiffs to deliver rubber of a certain quality and quantity at the price specified in
designated shipments; (2) it specified that the order therein given was conditional
upon the receipt of its order being promptly acknowledged, and (3) upon the further
condition that the plaintiffs would guarantee delivery within the time specified. The
plaintiffs did not acknowledge the receipt of this order and the proposal remained
unaccepted.

         As the party making this offer deemed this provision material and as the offer
was made subject to compliance with it by the plaintiffs it is not for the court to say
that it is immaterial. When the plaintiffs submitted this offer in their letter of April
4th to the defendant only one of two courses of action was open to the defendant. It
could accept the offer made and thus manifest that assent which was essential to the
creation of a contract or it could reject the offer. There was no middle course. If it did
not accept the offer proposed it necessarily rejected it. A proposal to accept the offer
if modified or an acceptance subject to other terms and conditions was equivalent to
an absolute rejection of the offer made by the plaintiffs. Mactier's Administrators v.
Frith, 6 Wend. 103 (N.Y. 1830); Vassar v. Camp, 11 N.Y. 441 (1854); Chicago & G. E.
Ry. Co. v. Dane, 43 N.Y. 240 (1870); Mahar v. Compton, 45 N.Y.S. 1126 (Sup. Ct. App.
Div. 1897); Barrow Steamship Co. v. Mexican Central Ry. Co., 31 N.E. 261 (N.Y.
1892).

         The respondent and the courts below, while recognizing this principle of the
law of contracts, failed to give it effect upon the theory that the conditions expressed
in the defendant's order of April 6th were not a part of the defendant's offer. In
reference to these conditions printed upon the offer of the defendant of April 6th the
learned trial justice held that "it was never the intention that the printed matter had
any bearing whatsoever upon the transactions." The learned justice writing for the
Appellate Division said that the clause embodying this condition "was not intended

______________________________________________________________________________

UNIT 5: PROBLEMS WITH OFFERS  91
to call for an acceptance particularly in view of the former transaction between the
parties."

         The view of the trial justice that the printed matter was not intended to be a
part of the contract rests upon his inference as to the intention of the parties. In the
present case the printed clauses must be deemed to be a part of the order and cannot
be eliminated therefrom by the court upon an inference as to the intention of the
parties which is not reflected in the order or in any evidence that was received upon
the trial. The clause requiring a prompt acknowledgment by the plaintiffs of the
defendant's offer as a condition to its acceptance was not in conflict with any of the
provisions expressed in that offer either written or printed and must, therefore, be
given effect. When the defendant's letter of April 6th is so considered it becomes
evident that it did not constitute an acceptance of the offer of the plaintiffs, but was
a new proposition for a contract upon the terms therein proposed.

         The judgment appealed from should be reversed and a new trial granted, with
costs to abide the event.

         Review Question 4. Which of the pieces of correspondence described in this
case qualified as offers? Why those and not any of the others? Defendant-buyer
Brunswick's letter of April 6 seems, in many respects, like an acceptance of the deal
proposed by plaintiff-seller Poel & Arnold on April 4. What specific language in the
April 6 letter turns it into a counteroffer rather than an acceptance?

         Review Question 5. Over the years, the Poel case has been criticized by many
legal scholars. Why might they be concerned about the outcome of the case and the
rules announced by the court? Can you see any possibility of abuse?

         Review Question 6. As it happens, the outcome in Poel would likely be very
different today because of changes made by the Uniform Commercial Code. You will
run into the relevant provision, UCC § 2-207 later in these materials, but you might
want to look at it now. What would change in the outcome?

                                Problems

Problem 5.1

         Aunt Mary is a 90-year-old woman who lives in New Hampshire. Although she
is still active, most of her friends are dead and she has very little family left. She is
often lonely. She is visited by her great-nephew Earle, a college freshman who lives
in Los Angeles. She likes Earle a great deal and they get along very well. During the
course of his stay, just before he is to return home, she says, "Earle, I don't have many
people left, and there won't be hardly anyone at my funeral. I'd like it if you'd be
there. You're my only family."

         "Oh, you're not going to die for a long time, Aunt Mary," says Earle.

         "Not for a while, child," she says, "but the Lord takes all of us. I want you to be
there."

         "Aunt Mary, I refuse to talk about such morbid stuff. You're going to outlive
me."

         She laughs and shakes her head. "Here's what I want to tell you. If you come
to my funeral, I'll pay for your ticket to get here, and all your expenses, and I'll give
you $1,000."

         "Now Aunt--"

         "Don't interrupt me. You don't have to answer now. Just be there. If you come,
wherever I am, I'll know it. "

         Three years later, Earle is notified of Aunt Mary's death. Although it is the
middle of the semester and very inconvenient, he remembers how much it meant to
her, flies to New Hampshire for the funeral. The cost of the ticket and the hotel are
substantial, and strain his credit to the maximum. After the funeral, he asks the
executor of her will for the payment, claiming there is a contract. The executor
refuses. There is no mention of this in Aunt Mary's will, which leaves all of her meager
wealth to a local animal shelter.

         If Earle sues Aunt Mary's estate, what result? Why?

Problem 5.2

         Antique Dealer has a mint condition, in-the-box, never opened Stinky Pete the
Prospector doll from the popular 1950s television show, Woody's Roundup. Collector,
who is a big fan of the show, contacts Dealer to inquire about buying the doll. The two
negotiate by telephone, but do not come to an agreement. The next day--Tuesday--
Dealer sends the following signed message to Collector: "I offer to sell you the Stinky
Pete doll for $3,750 cash. I will leave this offer open until Friday." Collector gets the
message. On Wednesday, Collector calls Dealer to accept, but before he can do more

UNIT 5: PROBLEMS WITH OFFERS  93
than identify himself, Dealer says, "Sorry, I sold the Stinky Pete doll yesterday. I
don't have it any more, so I can't sell it to you." Collector is unhappy and hangs up.

         The next morning, however, Collector learns that Dealer had not in fact sold
the doll, and still has it. Dealer had simply decided not to sell because he heard that
the wealthy Konishi Toy Museum in Tokyo might be interested. When he learns this
fact Collector calls Dealer. When Dealer answers, Collector says, "I'm calling to accept
your offer. I know you still have it, and you promised the offer would be open until
tomorrow. I'm buying it." Dealer refuses to sell, however, and ultimately sells the doll
to Konishi for $10,000. Collector sues to enforce what he claims is an enforceable
contract to buy Stinky Pete. What will both sides argue? What result and why?

Problem 5.3

         Truong is a supplier of fresh fish and other seafood to supermarkets in the Gulf
of Mexico region. On a Tuesday in late July, he sends a truckload shipment of fresh
jumbo Gulf shrimp from his facility in Corpus Christi, Texas, to United Stores in El
Paso. When the truck reaches El Paso--where the temperature is 110 degrees
Fahrenheit--United refuses to accept the shipment, saying that it had not placed the
order. As the truck sits at the United loading dock, its refrigeration units stop
working. The driver calls Truong, who realizes that he has a truckload of fresh shrimp
that will soon become boiled shrimp in the El Paso heat. He tries to call Vera, a
competitor of United, on her cell phone, but gets her voicemail. He leaves her a quick
message, saying "I've got 5,000 pounds of fresh jumbo shrimp--the kind you usually
buy from me--on a truck there in El Paso. I don't want to have to bring it back, so I
can let you have the whole load for $5,000. That's half price, just because I've already
got it there, and this deal is for you because you're a great customer. I've got to know
soon, though." He then sends Vera a text message repeating essentially what he said
on the phone. Unknown to Truong, however, Vera is on a plane inbound to El Paso
and her phone is set to airplane mode.

         Truong does not hear back from Vera for 45 minutes. Worried that the shrimp
will spoil, he calls Bernie, another buyer. Bernie answers, Truong makes the same
offer, which Bernie accepts immediately. Truong calls his driver, who immediately
sets off for Bernie's warehouse. Five minutes later, Vera's plane lands and she turns
on her phone. Getting Truong's message, she immediately texts an acceptance. She
subsequently learns that Truong sold the shrimp to her competitor, Bernie.

         Vera claims that her text in response to Truong's offer created a contract. If
she sues, what result and why? Consider both sides' arguments on this question.

                                           FOCUS OF THIS UNIT

         You should now know what qualifies as an offer and when an offer terminates.
The next question in contract formation is whether an open offer as been accepted.
So what exactly do we mean when we talk about contractual "acceptance"?

         Offer Controls Acceptance. When we say that the offeror is "master of the
offer," we mean that the offeror gets to define how the offer must be accepted. For
example, suppose the authors approached you and said, "We will pay you $20 if you
will stand up on one leg in the middle of your Property class, flap your arms like a
bird, and recite the first paragraph of the Preamble to the Communist Manifesto. We
don't want your promise; we'll pay you only if you actually do it."1 Based on that offer,
then the only way you can accept it is by doing exactly what we said. If you say, "I
accept," you haven't, in fact, acceptance, because we clearly told you that we didn't
want your acceptance. There is no contract. You are not obliged to do anything at that
point, and we are free to revoke our offer. If, in fact, you stand on both legs, or you
recite the Preamble to the United States Constitution, you have not accepted the
offer. Being "master of the offer" simply means that the offeror has the power to
specify exactly how an offer can be accepted.

         Notice that while our definition of an "offer" does take into account whether
the offeree reasonably believes there is an offer, we do not concern ourselves with
whether he believes he has accepted. Instead, to accomplish the latter, the offeree
must do what the offeror says. Intent is not usually the key. This point may seem
obvious, but problems arise from the fact that in the real world--the world in which
contract law must actually operate--people are not necessarily precise about what
they want or what they are doing. Ordinary people rarely recite, "I hereby accept your

you from suing us for twenty dollars after you embarrass yourself and annoy your Property professor.

But see Leonard v. PepsiCo (holding that an over-the-top joke did not constitute an offer) - Eds.]

UNIT 6: ACCEPTANCE                                                                                  95
offer." More often, they nod, shake hands, exchange emails, or simply start doing
what the offeror asked. They also don't necessarily say the word "accept" while
functionally accepting an offer. The fact that regular human beings don't necessarily
do what lawyers (or law students) would do leads to the question of when a particular
communication counts as an "acceptance."

         Keep in mind that the existence or non-existence of an "acceptance" can have
important legal consequences for an analysis of whether a contract exists under the
common law. If an offeree's response actually qualifies as an "acceptance," then we
may have an enforceable contract (subject, of course, to a host of other issues we are
covering in this course). If the offeree's response to an offer is anything other than an
"acceptance," then no contract has been formed.

         Under the common law of contracts, acceptance must match the offer. The
match must be so complete that the concept is sometimes referred to as the "mirror
image rule." Acceptance does not, however, require the offeree to recite a magic
formula, like "I hereby accept the offer as stated," as that would throw a wrench into
business transactions and make contracting so hyper-technical as to be nearly useless
for real life. A mirror-image acceptance can happen in any number of ways. This unit
deals with a few situations that have caused particular difficulties in analyzing
whether an offer-and-acceptance has occurred.

         Three Problems to Watch. The first arises from the fact that some situations
are entirely clear as to who is offeror and who is offeree. You have seen that an
advertisement is (usually) not an offer, and that it is the buyer who technically is the
offeror even where the seller's advertisement is the initial solicitation to enter a
contract. Thus, doing something that the average non-lawyer might consider as
acceptance of an offer, such as ordering merchandise from a catalog, is actually the
offer itself. Exactly who is who in certain transactions can actually be complicated.

         A second problem occurs when what the offeror is seeking is not entirely clear.
Is the offeror asking a party to do something (such as performing a task), or to say
something in the form of a promise? The distinction becomes important in what
traditionally are called unilateral and bilateral contracts. You have seen those terms
before by now, but make sure in the readings below that you can understand both the
difference and the consequence of that difference for purposes of contract formation.
You should also be aware that the Restatement (Second) of Contracts dropped the
unilateral-bilateral distinction and terminology--see, e.g., section 30--though it lives
on in many cases, treatises, and bar exam questions.

         A third area of confusion is the issue of acceptance by silence. Could, for
example, an offeror say, "I offer to sell you my car for $5,500, and unless I receive a
written rejection from you within 24 hours, you will have accepted my offer."?
(Actually, we know the offeror could say such a thing, so our real concern is whether
that offer could form a contract by the offeree's inaction.) In other words, are there

______________________________________________________________________________

96  CHAPTER II: CONTRACT FORMATION
situations in which mere silence on the part of the offeree is enough to create a
contract?

         Of Mailboxes and Inboxes. Another twist that we should highlight here
briefly--if only because it has been the bane of law students for generations--is the
so-called mailbox rule. You will come across the mailbox rule in the case of United
States Life Insurance Co. v. Wilson, later in this unit. For the moment, just know that
it is an important variant of when an acceptance is effective to create a contract. You
will learn more when you read the Wilson case.

         One additional note: In the following materials we are considering the common
law of contracts as generally observed in the United States. Later, you will see that
these rules may or may not be the same when specific kinds of contracts governed by
statutes and treaties.

THE COURT IN BANK.

         [Rupert and Blanche Whitehead were a wealthy California couple without
children. Caro Davis was Blanche's niece, and was very close to the Whiteheads, often
being treated as their "daughter." Caro had lived with them until her marriage to
Frank Davis--which was held in the Whitehead home--in 1913. The Davises moved
to Canada, but stayed very close. In 1930 Blanche became very ill, and Rupert's
financial affairs were made precarious by the onset of the depression. By 1931 Rupert
needed help with his hospitalized wife and with his deteriorating finances. In late
March and April, 1931, he wrote letters to Caro and Frank, pleading for them to come
and stay with him and help him. Then, on April 12, he wrote again, noting that
Blanche "cannot last much longer," and that his affairs were "not as bad as I supposed
at first." He listed various properties and estimated that $150,000 could be "saved
from the wreck." He continued:

[M]y trouble was caused by my friends taking advantage of my illness
and my position to skin me. Now if Frank could come out here and be
with me, and look after my affairs, we could easily save the balance I
mentioned, provided I don't get into another panic and do some more
foolish things.

         The next attack will be my end, I am 65 and my health has been bad for
         years, so, the Drs. don't give me much longer to live. So if you can come,
         Caro will inherit everything and you will make our lives happier and see
         Blanche is provided for to the end.

         My eyesight has gone back on me. I can't read only for a few lines at a
         time. I am at the house alone with Stanley [the chauffeur] who does
         everything for me and is a fine fellow. Now, what I want is someone who
         will take charge of my affairs and see I don't lose any more. Frank can
         do it, if he will and cut out the booze.

         Will you let me hear from you as soon as possible, I know it will be a
         sacrifice but times are still bad and likely to be, so by settling down you
         can help me and Blanche and gain in the end. If I had you here my mind
         would get better and my courage return, and we could work things out.

Frank immediately wrote back saying that he accepted Rupert's proposition and that
he and Caro would come to California and be there on April 25. Rupert acknowledged
the letter. Before they left Canada, however, Rupert killed himself on April 22. The
Davises nevertheless came to California and cared for Blanche until her own death
on May 30. It turned out that Rupert had left his wife only a life estate in the property,
had not provided for the Davises, and had instead left the entire estate to his own
nephews. The Davises sued, claiming that the promise that "Caro Davis would inherit
everything" was a contractual offer which they had accepted by mail, and that Caro
was therefore entitled to the estate. The trial court ruled against them.]

         The theory of the trial court and of respondents on this appeal is that the letter
of April 12th was an offer to contract, but that such offer could only be accepted by
performance and could not be accepted by a promise to perform, and that said offer
was revoked by the death of Mr. Whitehead before performance. In other words, it is
contended that the offer was an offer to enter into a unilateral contract, and that the
purported acceptance of April 14th was of no legal effect.

         (1) The distinction between unilateral and bilateral contracts is well settled in
the law. It is well stated in section 12 of the American [Law] Institute's Restatement
of the Law of Contracts2 as follows:

         A unilateral contract is one in which no promisor receives a promise as
         consideration for his promise. A bilateral contract is one in which there
         are mutual promises between two parties to the contract; each party
         being both a promisor and a promisee.

          2 [This is a reference the first Restatement, published in 1932, which maintained use of the
bilateral-unilateral terminology. - Eds.]

______________________________________________________________________________

98  CHAPTER II: CONTRACT FORMATION
This definition is in accord with the law of California. Christman v. Southern Cal.
Edison Co., 256 P. 618 (Cal. Ct. App. 1927).

         In the case of unilateral contracts no notice of acceptance by performance is
required. Section 1584 of the Civil Code provides, "Performance of the conditions of a
proposal, . . . is an acceptance of the proposal." See Cuthill v. Peabody, 125 P. 926
(Cal. Ct. App. 1912); Los Angeles Traction Co. v. Wilshire, 67 P. 1086 (Cal. 1902).

         (2) Although the legal distinction between unilateral and bilateral contracts is
thus well settled, the difficulty in any particular case is to determine whether the
particular offer is one to enter into a bilateral or unilateral contract. Some cases are
quite clear cut. Thus an offer to sell which is accepted is clearly a bilateral contract,
while an offer of a reward is a clear-cut offer of a unilateral contract which cannot be
accepted by a promise to perform, but only by performance. Berthiaume v. Doe, 133
P. 515 (Cal. Ct. App. 1913). Between these two extremes is a vague field where the
particular contract may be unilateral or bilateral depending upon the intent of the
offeror and the facts and circumstances of each case. The offer to contract involved in
this case falls within this category. By the provisions of the Restatement of the Law
of Contracts it is expressly provided that there is a presumption that the offer is to
enter into a bilateral contract. Section 31 provides:

         In a case of doubt it is presumed that an offer invites the formation of a
         bilateral contract by an acceptance amounting in effect to a promise by
         the offeree to perform what the offer requests, rather than the formation
         of one or more unilateral contracts by actual performance on the part of
         the offeree.

         Professor Williston in his Treatise on Contracts, volume 1, section 60, also
takes the position that a presumption in favor of bilateral contracts exists.

         In the comment following section 31 of the Restatement the reason for such
presumption is stated as follows:

         It is not always easy to determine whether an offeror requests an act or
         a promise to do the act. As a bilateral contract immediately and fully
         protects both parties, the interpretation is favored that a bilateral
         contract is proposed.

While the California cases have never expressly held that a presumption in favor of
bilateral contracts exists, the cases clearly indicate a tendency to treat offers as offers
of bilateral rather than of unilateral contracts.

         (3) Keeping these principles in mind we are of the opinion that the offer of April
12th was an offer to enter into a bilateral as distinguished from a unilateral contract.
Respondents argue that Mr. Whitehead had the right as offeror to designate his offer
as either unilateral or bilateral. That is undoubtedly the law. It is then argued that

______________________________________________________________________________

UNIT 6: ACCEPTANCE  99
from all the facts and circumstances it must be implied that what Whitehead wanted
was performance and not a mere promise to perform. We think this is a non sequitur,
in fact the surrounding circumstances lead to just the opposite conclusion. These
parties were not dealing at arm's length. Not only were they related, but a very close
and intimate friendship existed between them. The record indisputably demonstrates
that Mr. Whitehead had confidence in Mr. and Mrs. Davis, in fact that he had lost all
confidence in everyone else. The record amply shows that by an accumulation of
occurrences Mr. Whitehead had become desperate, and that what he wanted was the
promise of appellants that he could look to them for assistance. He knew from his
past relationship with appellants that if they gave their promise to perform he could
rely upon them. The correspondence between them indicates how desperately he
desired this assurance. Under these circumstances he wrote his offer of April 12th,
above quoted, in which he stated, after disclosing his desperate mental and physical
condition, and after setting forth the terms of his offer: "Will you let me hear from
you as soon as possible--I know it will be a sacrifice but times are still bad and likely
to be, so by settling down you can help me and Blanche and gain in the end." By thus
specifically requesting an immediate reply Whitehead expressly indicated the nature
of the acceptance desired by him--namely, appellants' promise that they would come
to California and do the things requested by him. This promise was immediately sent
by appellants upon receipt of the offer, and was received by Whitehead. It is
elementary that when an offer has indicated the mode and means of acceptance, an
acceptance in accordance with that mode or means is binding on the offeror.

         Another factor which indicates that Whitehead must have contemplated a
bilateral rather than a unilateral contract, is that the contract required Mr. and Mrs.
Davis to perform services until the death of both Mr. and Mrs. Whitehead. It is
obvious that if Mr. Whitehead died first some of these services were to be performed
after his death, so that he would have to rely on the promise of appellants to perform
these services. It is also of some evidentiary force that Whitehead received the letter
of acceptance and acquiesced in that means of acceptance.

         (4) For the foregoing reasons we are of the opinion that the offer of April 12,
1931, was an offer to enter into a bilateral contract which was accepted by the letter
of April 14, 1931. Subsequently appellants fully performed their part of the contract.
Under such circumstances it is well settled that damages are insufficient and specific
performance will be granted.

         For the foregoing reasons the judgment appealed from is reversed.

together, and see if you notice the concepts of unilateral and bilateral contracts,
despite the fact that those terms are not used.

         Review Question 2. Pretend that you are the judge for a case with the exact
same facts as Davis v. Jacoby, except that your jurisdiction has adopted the rules
contained in sections 30 and 32 of the Restatement (Second) of Contracts. How would
you decide that case? Would reaching a decision be harder or easier than it was for
the Davis court following the first Restatement?

                                  HENDRICKS v. BEHEE
                    Court of Appeals of Missouri, Southern District

                            786 S.W.2d 610 (Mo. Ct. App. 1990)

FLANIGAN, J.

         After Behee, as prospective buyer [of a home owned by the Smiths], and the
Smiths, as prospective sellers, had engaged in unproductive negotiations, Behee, on
March 2, 1987, made a written offer of $42,500 for the real estate and $250 for a
dinner bell and flower pots. On March 3 that offer was mailed to the Smiths, who
lived in Mississippi, by their real estate agent.

         On March 4 the Smiths signed the proposed agreement in Mississippi. Before
Behee was notified that the Smiths had accepted the offer, Behee withdrew the offer
by notifying the real estate agent of the withdrawal. That paramount fact is conceded
by this statement in the Smiths' brief: "On either March 5, 6 or 7, 1987, Behee
contacted [the Smiths' real estate agent] and advised her that he desired to withdraw
his offer to purchase the real estate. Prior to this communication, Behee had received
no notice that his offer had been accepted by the Smiths."

         There is no contract until acceptance of an offer is communicated to the offeror.
ACF Industries, Inc. v. Industrial Commission, 320 S.W.2d 484, 492 (Mo. en banc
1959); 17 AM. JUR. 2d Contracts § 43, p. 380; 17 C.J.S. Contracts § 45, p. 690.

         An uncommunicated intention to accept an offer is not an acceptance. When
an offer calls for a promise, as distinguished from an act, on the part of the offeree,
notice of acceptance is always essential. A mere private act of the offeree does not
constitute an acceptance. Communication of acceptance of a contract to an agent of
the offeree is not sufficient and does not bind the offeror.

Unless the offer is supported by consideration, an offeror may withdraw his

offer at any time "before acceptance and communication of that fact to him." To be

effective, revocation of an offer must be communicated to the offeree before he has

accepted.

         Notice to the agent, within the scope of the agent's authority, is notice to the
principal, and the agent's knowledge is binding on the principal.

         Before Behee was notified that the Smiths had accepted his offer, Behee
notified the agent of the Smiths that Behee was withdrawing the offer. The notice to
the agent, being within the scope of her authority, was binding upon the Smiths.
Behee's offer was not supported by consideration and his withdrawal of it was proper.

         The judgment is affirmed.

                                          ______________________

         Review Question 3. We told you previously that the offeror is master of the
offer. Imagine you represent a client who just received an offer to sell her a piece of
real estate, and she is interested but not yet sure. Based on Hendricks, what sort of
things would you look for in the text of the offer so that you can advise your client on
what she must do to ensure the formation of a contract?

         Review Question 4. Was the offeror in Hendricks seeking a return promise, a
performance, or either? If the offeror sought a promise, consider this language from
section 50(3) of the Restatement (Second) of Contracts: "Acceptance by a promise
requires that the offeree complete every act essential to the making of the promise."
Does that definition support the court's conclusion? Why or why not?

     UNITED STATES LIFE INSURANCE CO. v. WILSON
                   Court of Special Appeals of Maryland
                   198 Md. App. 452, 18 A.3d 110 (2011)

DEBORAH S. EYLER, J.

         The principal issue in this case is whether a policy of insurance on the life of
John G. Griffith, M.D., was in force the day he died. We hold that it was. In the Circuit
Court for Baltimore City, Elizabeth Wilson, Dr. Griffith's widow and the appellee,
filed a breach of contract action against the United States Life Insurance Company,
and AMA Insurance Agency, Inc. ("AMAIA"), the appellants, claiming they had failed
to pay the death benefit and accidental death benefit on a policy insuring Dr.
Griffith's life ("the Policy"). The appellants maintained that the Policy no longer was
in force when Dr. Griffith died. Ms. Wilson acknowledged that the Policy had lapsed
but maintained that it had been reinstated before Dr. Griffith died. The court agreed
with Ms. Wilson and granted summary judgment in her favor.

         Effective November 15, 1998, Dr. Griffith purchased an "American Medical
Association-Sponsored Group Level Term Life Insurance Policy," Certificate Number
9500108167, which was underwritten by US Life. The Policy was for a 10-year term.

______________________________________________________________________________

102                   CHAPTER II: CONTRACT FORMATION
Dr. Griffith was the owner of the Policy and was the named insured. Ms. Wilson was
the primary beneficiary. Under the Policy, if Dr. Griffith died "while this [life]
insurance is in force," then, upon presentation of proof of his death to US Life, US
Life would pay the beneficiary the scheduled benefit. The scheduled benefit for death
was $400,000, with an additional accidental death benefit of $250,000.

         Dr. Griffith purchased the Policy through AMAIA, a subsidiary of the
American Medical Association. AMAIA acted as the third-party administrator for US
Life, meaning that, with respect to US Life policies, including this Policy, it was
responsible for, among other things, billing and collecting premiums. AMAIA was
authorized to receive premium payments on the Policy.

         The Policy contained the following PREMIUM PAYMENTS provision:

                  Premiums will be due annually, or at another agreed upon
         frequency, as long as you remain eligible for insurance. Payment can be
         made to United States Life at United States Life's Home Office or to our
         authorized agent. Payment of any premium will not maintain insurance
         in force past the next premium due date, except as provided in the Grace
         Period provision.

The Policy GRACE PERIOD provision, as referenced in the PREMIUM PAYMENTS
clause, read as follows:

                  Each premium, after the first, may be paid up to 31 days after its
         due date. This period is the grace period. The insurance provided by the
         group policy will stay in effect during this period. If the premium is not
         paid by the end of this period, such insurance will end at that time.

                  United States Life may extend the grace period by written notice.
         Such notice will state the date insurance will end if the premium
         remains unpaid.

         Premiums must be paid for a grace period and any extension of such
         period.

The Policy further contained a REINSTATEMENT clause detailing how coverage
could be reinstated after a lapse:

                  If the coverage ceases as provided in the Grace Period provision,
         you may reinstate it. Reinstatement must be made within 90 days after
         the due date of the first unpaid premium.

                  Such reinstatement is subject to:

                  1. Payment of all overdue premiums; and

______________________________________________________________________________

UNIT 6: ACCEPTANCE  103
                  2. Written approval by United States Life of the required evidence
         of insurability. However, such evidence will not be required within 31
         days after the end of the Grace Period.

         Dr. Griffith made his semi-annual premium payments from 1998 through
2006. Before his May 15, 2007 premium came due, AMAIA sent him an undated BILL
NOTICE reminding him of the upcoming payment due date. During that period of
time, Dr. Griffith was obtaining quotes from other life insurance companies for
similar coverage, with the apparent purpose of changing insurers. Dr. Griffith failed
to pay the May 15, 2007 Policy premium. After he missed the payment, AMAIA sent
him an undated REMINDER NOTICE, stating: "To assure active coverage, full
payment of the premium must be received no later than 60 days from the due date."
The due date was again listed as May 15, 2007.

         Until Monday, July 23, 2007, Dr. Griffith still had not taken any steps to pay
the overdue May 15, 2007 premium. That day, he accessed by computer his on-line
bank account with Bank of America and electronically directed that a premium
payment of $369.46 be made to AMAIA. Bank of America documents in the summary
judgment record show that a check for that amount "was sent to AMA Insurance
Agency on [Wednesday] 07/25/07 and delivered on [Monday] 07/30/07."

         On Saturday, July 28, 2007, Dr. Griffith, Ms. Wilson, and their children were
on vacation in Bethany Beach, Delaware. Dr. Griffith went on an early morning bike
ride. He was kneeling beside his bicycle on the shoulder of State Route 1 at 7:40 a.m.
when he was struck and killed by a car that drifted off the road when its driver fell
asleep at the wheel. Dr. Griffith was 44 years old when he died.

         AMAIA received Dr. Griffith's premium check on July 30, 2007. On August 2,
2007, AMAIA rejected the payment and returned the check enclosed in a letter
advising that, because Dr. Griffith's "payment was received after the closing of the
30-day grace period," he no longer could renew his insurance coverage simply by
making the premium payment. Instead, he could apply for reinstatement of coverage
by completing and returning an APPLICATION FOR REINSTATEMENT OF
COVERAGE, although approval was not guaranteed. When the August 2, 2007 letter
was sent, AMAIA had no information that Dr. Griffith had died.

         On September 28, 2007, Ms. Wilson, through counsel, submitted a claim to
AMAIA for the death benefit and accidental death benefit under the Policy. AMAIA
denied her claim by letter of April 14, 2008, stating that the Policy had lapsed on May
15, 2007, and therefore was not in force when Dr. Griffith died.

         [The court examines the various documents and communications involved. It
concludes that US Life had extended the grace period to 60 days, which meant it had
expired on July 14. The court held that Dr. Griffith had 30 days from that date (not
later than August 13) to, in effect, accept US Life's offer to reinstate the policy, and
he had to be alive at the time of acceptance. Ms. Walker argued that the offer was

______________________________________________________________________________

104  CHAPTER II: CONTRACT FORMATION
accepted as of the date the check was sent (July 25), while US Life argued that it was
not accepted, if at all, until at least July 30, when the check arrived. Dr. Griffith died
on July 28.]

         The language of the Policy itself, not the language in the notices, controlled the
means to effect reinstatement. The relevant language of the REINSTATEMENT
clause is, "reinstatement is subject to: 1. Payment of all overdue premiums."

         Insurance contracts initially are formed when an insurer unconditionally
accepts an insured's application, which constitutes an offer, for coverage. Martin v.
Government Employees Ins. Co., 206 Ill. App. 3d 1031, 1039-40, 565 N.E.2d 197 (Ill.
App. Ct. 1990). From then on, the life insurance policy operates as a unilateral
contract, 29 APPLEMAN ON INSURANCE 2D § 179.03, AT 230 (JEFFREY E. THOMAS ED.
2006), i.e., one that is formed by performance. See 1 WILLISTON ON CONTRACTS § 4:8,
AT 462 (4TH ED., RICHARD A. LORD, 2007) (observing that a unilateral contract is one
in which one party makes a promise and the other party renders an act or
forbearance). "The periodic payment of premiums is the mechanism by which the
insured opts to keep the insurance policy in force." APPLEMAN, supra, § 179.0-3, at
230. Failure to pay the premiums will result in coverage lapsing.

         Under the policy, when the relevant time frame for reinstatement is "within
31 days after the end of the Grace Period" (as it is here), the REINSTATEMENT
clause is a promise by the insurer to reinstate coverage upon performance by the
insured of a single act--payment of the overdue premium. In that situation, the
insurer is not being asked to consider and either accept or reject an offer by the
insured to enter into a life insurance contract. Thus, the plain language of the
REINSTATEMENT clause of the Policy establishes that, upon payment by the
insured of the overdue premium within 31 days after the end of the grace period, the
Policy is revived. In other words, in that situation, the REINSTATEMENT clause is
an offer of a unilateral contract to revive the Policy, with the insurer promising that
revival will take place upon the insured's performing by paying the overdue premium.

         It is within the context of Dr. Griffith's acceptance by performance (that is, by
payment of the overdue premium) of US Life's offer to revive the Policy that we must
determine when payment took place. At common law, what is often called the
"mailbox rule," the "dispatch rule," or sometimes the "postal acceptance rule" is the
widely-adopted convention for pinpointing the time that an offer is accepted and a
contract is formed. Illinois, like Maryland, recognizes the rule, by which "the mailed
acceptance of an offer is effective when mailed, not when received or acknowledged."
Martin, 565 N.E.2d at 203. See also Wagner v. McClay, 138 N.E. 164 (Ill. 1923)
(recognizing that a letter of acceptance of a contract that is properly deposited in the
mail makes the acceptance binding); Cochran v. Norkunas, 919 A.2d 700 (Md. 2007)
("The well established rule is that in the absence of any limitation or provision to the

______________________________________________________________________________

UNIT 6: ACCEPTANCE  105
contrary in the offer, the acceptance of the offer is complete and the contract becomes
binding on both parties when the offeree deposits the acceptance in the post box.").

         Section 63(a) of the Restatement (Second) of Contracts (1979), while not using
any of the familiar mailbox rule nomenclature, recognizes with respect to the time
that acceptance of an offer takes effect hat, unless an offer states otherwise, "an
acceptance made in a manner and by a medium invited by the offer is operative and
completes the manifestation of mutual assent as soon as put out of the offeree's
possession, without regard to whether it ever reaches the offeror." The rationale for
the rule, as explained in comment (a) to that subsection, is, essentially, certainty and
predictability. The comment observes that, even though it may be possible under
United States postal regulations for a sender to stop delivery and reclaim a letter, it
remains the case that one to whom an offer has been made "needs a dependable basis
for his decision whether to accept," and has such a basis when he knows that, once
properly dispatched, his acceptance is binding and the offer cannot be revoked.

         In 2 WILLISTON ON CONTRACTS §6:32 (4TH ED. RICHARD A. LORD, 2007), the
author explains that the "dispatch rule" applies equally to bilateral and unilateral
contracts. If an offer for a unilateral contract calls for the performance of an act by
the offeree that can be accomplished by sending money through the mail, including
in the form of a check, "as soon as the money is sent it would become the property of
the offeror, and the offeror would become bound to perform its promise for which the
money was the consideration." Id. at 441-42. See, e.g., Hagerl v. Auto Club Group Ins.
Co., 403 N.W.2d 197 (Mich. Ct. App. 1987) (holding that an offer to renew an
automobile liability insurance policy was accepted by the insured by mailing his
check, even though the check subsequently was dishonored).

         We conclude that the long-recognized mailbox rule governing the time of
formation of a contract by written acceptance applies in the case at bar to control the
time the Policy was reinstated, that is, when coverage under the Policy was revived.
The transaction at issue here is not wholly traditional, that is, one in which a paper
document, whether a check or otherwise, is mailed by the offeree to the offeror, in
that it began electronically, as an on-line banking directive by Dr. Griffith on July 23,
2007. The Bank of America documents in the summary judgment record show,
however, that the directive was acted upon by preparation of a paper check drawn on
a JP Morgan Chase Bank, N.A. account under Dr. Griffith's name, and bearing his
"Authorized Signature"; and that the paper check then was "sent" to AMAIA on July
25, 2007, coming into AMAIA's physical possession on July 30, 2007.

         The transaction thus resembles a traditional acceptance by writing mailed to
the offeror, in that a writing (the check) was "sent" to AMAIA, even though its
creation was directed electronically and it was created not by the offeree but by his
bank. A writing thus was generated by actions taken by Dr. Griffith; the writing
complied with that which was necessary to accept the reinstatement offer; and the

______________________________________________________________________________

106  CHAPTER II: CONTRACT FORMATION
writing was "sent," which was a permissible mode of acceptance, and subsequently
was delivered to AMAIA, the proper recipient.

         Application of the mailbox rule to the undisputed material facts in this case
produces the legal conclusion that the date of payment of the overdue premium was
July 25, 2007. On July 23, 2007, Dr. Griffith electronically instructed Bank of
America, as his agent, to make payment to AMAIA. The evidence viewed most
favorably to the appellants supports a reasonable inference that Dr. Griffith could
have reinstructed Bank of America not to make the payment; therefore, as of July 23,
2007, he had set in motion the means to accept the offer of reinstatement but still had
the power to reverse course. On July 25, 2007, however, Bank of America remitted
payment to AMAIA by sending it a check, drawn on the J. P. Morgan Chase Bank,
N.A. account, for $369.46. At that point, the permissible means for acceptance was in
motion and, so far as is established by the common law mailbox rule, was beyond Dr.
Griffith's power to stop. This would be true whether Bank of America sent the check
through the United States Postal Service, a courier service, or otherwise.

         For all these reasons, we hold that the Policy was reinstated effective July 25,
2007, three days before Dr. Griffith died, and therefore was in force when he died. It
was undisputed that Dr. Griffith's death was an accident under the terms of the
Policy. The circuit court therefore properly entered judgment in favor of Ms. Wilson
against US Life for $650,000, plus pre-judgment interest.

                                          ______________________

         Review Question 5. The U.S. Life Insurance court says that, by the time of the
dispute in this case, the insurance contract was a "unilateral contract." What are the
implications for formation (or re-formation) of the contract in this case of it being
unilateral? Was Dr. Griffith's insurance policy originally a unilateral contract? Why
or why not?

         Review Question 6. In Hendricks v. Behee, which you read earlier in this unit,
the court held that acceptance had to be communicated to the offeror. Can you
reconcile that with the "mailbox rule" in this case?

         Review Question 7. In the modern world, the post office is used less and less
as a medium of communication in making contracts. Would the rationale of the
mailbox rule apply to an email, voicemail, or text response? Is it effective when it is
sent or when it is received? As you answer this question, consider section 15 of the
Uniform Electronic Transactions Act, which is entitled "Time and Place of Sending
and Receipt." How--if at all--do the mailbox rule and UETA section 15 work
together?

       HOBBS v. MASSASOIT WHIP CO.
     Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts

          158 Mass. 194, 33 N.E. 495 (1893)

         Contract, upon an account annexed for $108.50, for 2,350 eelskins sold by the
plaintiff to the defendant.

         The plaintiff testified that he delivered the skins in question to one Harding of
Lynn, on February 18, 1890, who upon the same or the following day forwarded them
to the defendant; that the skins were in good condition when received by Harding,
2,050 of them being over twenty-seven inches in length each, and the balance over
twenty-two inches in length each; that he had forwarded eelskins to the defendant
through said Harding several different times in 1888 and 1889, and received payment
therefor from the defendant; that he knew the defendant used such skins in its
business in the manufacture of whips; that the skins sent on February 18, 1890, were
for such use; that he understood that all skins sent by him were to be in good condition
and over twenty-two inches in length, and that the defendant had never ordered of
him skins less than twenty-two inches in length; and that Harding took charge of the
skins for him and that he received orders through Harding.

         Four letters were offered in evidence, three of which, dated in 1889, showed
transactions between the plaintiff and the defendant, and the fourth of which, dated
Lynn, February 18, 1890, signed by Harding and addressed to the defendant, was as
follows: "We send you to-day, for Mr. Hobbs, 2,050 eelskins at .05 and 300 at .02."

         One Pirnie, president of the defendant corporation, called by the defendant,
testified that before February 18, 1890, the plaintiff had sent eelskins four or five
times by Harding to the defendant, which were received and paid for by the
defendant; that the defendant agreed to pay five cents each for eelskins over twenty-
seven inches in length, and two cents each for eelskins over twenty-two inches in
length and less than twenty-seven inches, suitable for use in the defendant's
business; that the defendant never ordered the skins in question, and did not
purchase them in any manner, and that no officer or employee of the corporation
except himself had authority to order or purchase skins, and that he never ordered
or purchased those in question.

     The judge, among other instructions, also gave the following:

     Whether there was any prior contract or not, if skins are sent to them

     (the defendants) and they see fit, whether they have agreed to take them

     or not, to lie back and say nothing, having reason to suppose that the

     man who has sent them believes that they are taking them, since they

     say nothing about it, then, if they fail to notify, you would be warranted

     in finding for the plaintiff, on that state of things.

______________________________________________________________________________

108  CHAPTER II: CONTRACT FORMATION
The jury returned a verdict for the plaintiff; and the defendant alleged exceptions.

         O.W. HOLMES, Jr., J.: This is an action for the price of eelskins sent by the
plaintiff to the defendant, and kept by the defendant some months, until they were
destroyed. It must be taken that the plaintiff received no notice that the defendants
declined to accept the skins. The case comes before us on exceptions to an instruction
to the jury, that, whether there was any prior contract or not, if skins are sent to the
defendant, and it sees fit, whether it has agreed to take them or not, to lie back, and
to say nothing, having reason to suppose that the man who has sent them believes
that it is taking them, since it says nothing about it, then, if it fails to notify, the jury
would be warranted in finding for the plaintiff.

         Standing alone, and unexplained, this proposition might seem to imply that
one stranger may impose a duty upon another, and make him a purchaser, in spite of
himself, by sending goods to him, unless he will take the trouble, and be at the
expense of notifying the sender that he will not buy. The case was argued for the
defendant on that interpretation. But, in view of the evidence, we do not understand
that to have been the meaning of the judge, and we do not think that the jury can
have understood that to have been his meaning. The plaintiff was not a stranger to
the defendant, even if there was no contract between them. He had sent eelskins in
the same way four or five times before, and they had been accepted and paid for. On
the defendant's testimony, it is fair to assume that, if it had admitted the eelskins to
be over twenty-two inches in length, and fit for its business, as the plaintiff testified,
and the jury found that they were, it would have accepted them; that this was
understood by the plaintiff; and, indeed, that there was a standing offer to him for
such skins. In such a condition of things, the plaintiff was warranted in sending the
defendant skins conforming to the requirements, and even if the offer was not such
that the contract was made as soon as skins corresponding to its terms were sent,
sending them did impose on the defendant a duty to act about them; and silence on
its part, coupled with a retention of the skins for an unreasonable time, might be
found by the jury to warrant the plaintiff in assuming that they were accepted, and
thus to amount to an acceptance. See Bushel v. Wheeler, 15 Q. B. 442; JUDAH P.
BENJAMIN, TREATISE ON THE LAW OF SALE OF PERSONAL PROPERTY §§ 162-164 (3d ed.
1888); Taylor v. Dexter Engine Co. 146 Mass. 613, 615 (1888). The proposition stands
on the general principle that conduct which imports acceptance or assent is
acceptance or assent in the view of the law, whatever may have been the actual state
of mind of the party--a principle sometimes lost sight of in the cases.

         Exceptions overruled.

                                          ______________________

         Review Question 8. "Standing alone, and unexplained," says Justice Holmes,
allowing for acceptance of a contract by silence "might seem to imply that one

______________________________________________________________________________

UNIT 6: ACCEPTANCE  109
stranger may impose a duty upon another, and make him a purchaser, in spite of
himself, by sending goods to him" unsolicited. Isn't that exactly what happened to the
Massasoit Whip Company, as it was unwillingly forced into a contract? Why doesn't
Holmes seem to be worried about silence-as-acceptance encouraging a hoard of
overzealous sellers to force unwilling customers into contracts by sending unsolicited
products?

                  47 N.Y.2d 144, 390 N.E.2d 1143, 417 N.Y.S.2d 218 (1979)

GABRIELLI, J.

         The issue in this case is whether the Town of Ramapo is contractually obligated
to receive and pay for the services offered by the petitioner Municipal Consultants &
Publishers, Inc. (Municipal). For the reasons which follow we conclude that there
existed an enforceable contract between the parties, and we therefore affirm the order
of the Appellate Division.

         On June 10, 1976, Municipal, at the request of the town, submitted a written
proposal in the form of a contract to the Town of Ramapo offering to codify its
ordinances and local laws for a sum specified in the proposal. On July 21 Municipal
agreed to certain changes suggested by the town attorney, but no formal action was
taken at that time on behalf of the town on the proposal. Finally, on February 9, 1977
the town board formally acted on it, and agreed to engage petitioner's services.

         By resolution No. 77-54 the town (1) authorized the town attorney to accept
the proposal; (2) authorized the supervisor to sign the agreement, and (3) provided
payment for the work. The resolution adopted by the town board on February 9, 1977,
in pertinent part, provided that:

         RESOLVED by the Town Board of the Town of Ramapo that
         authorization be hereby granted for the Town Attorney to accept the
         proposal submitted by Municipal Consultants & Publishers, Inc., of 64
         Seneca Street, Geneva, New York, to codify Ordinances and Local Laws
         of the Town of Ramapo, and

         BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that the Supervisor be hereby authorized
         to execute the Agreement between the Town of Ramapo and Municipal
         Consultants & Publishers, Inc., and

         BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that the sum of $ 10,000.00 for the first
         450 pages or less and $ 20.00 per page for each additional page in excess

______________________________________________________________________________

110  CHAPTER II: CONTRACT FORMATION
         of 450 pages, be hereby paid to Municipal Consultants & Publishers, Inc.
         for services rendered.

On February 15, 1977, the town attorney notified Municipal that the agreement had
been approved, forwarded copies of the agreement for Municipal to execute, and
stated he looked forward to a long and pleasant relationship.

         Ramapo's supervisor, however, never signed the contract. It appears that one
of Municipal's competitors, long after the passage of the resolution authorizing the
agreement, offered to do the work for a lesser sum. The parties met in an attempt to
work out their differences but to no avail. This [lawsuit] ensued requesting that the
court declare the contract valid and enforceable, and also to direct the supervisor and
town attorney to deliver an executed copy of the agreement.

         The primary issue presented is whether the contract is enforceable against the
town without the signature of the supervisor.

         Generally, where the parties contemplate that a signed writing is required,
there is no contract until one is delivered. Scheck v. Francis, 260 N.E.2d 493 (N.Y.
1970). This rule yields, however, when the parties have agreed on all contractual
terms and have only to commit them to writing. When this occurs, the contract is
effective at the time the oral agreement is made, although the contract is never
reduced to writing and signed. Where all the substantial terms of a contract have
been agreed on, and there is nothing left for future settlement, the fact, alone, that it
was the understanding that the contract should be formally drawn up and put in
writing, did not leave the transaction incomplete and without binding force, in the
absence of a positive agreement that it should not be binding until so reduced to
writing and formally executed. Disken v Herter, 77 N.Y.S. 300 (Sup. Ct. App. Div.
1902), affd, 67 N.E. 1081 (N.Y. 1903); 1 WILLISTON, CONTRACTS, § 28.

         Here, of course, there was no understanding that the agreement would not be
binding, short of formal execution by the supervisor; and the facts of the case before
us fall within the legal framework of the last above-cited cases. All the terms of the
contract had been negotiated and agreed upon. They were, in fact, expressed in
Municipal's written standard contract which had been modified in several slight
respects through negotiations. There was no understanding or agreement that the
contract would not be binding until both parties had signed it, and therefore it is
enforceable although it was never memorialized with a mutually signed writing.

         Accordingly, the order of the Appellate Division should be affirmed, with costs.

                                          ______________________

         Review Question 9. Did the Municipal Consultants court really just say that
a contract was accepted and binding before one of the parties signed it on the dotted
line? If so, then what is the point of the signature? At what moment exactly did the

______________________________________________________________________________

UNIT 6: ACCEPTANCE  111
contract in this case come into existence? Doesn't that seem like the sort of thing
clients would want to know and on which lawyers should be able to offer advice?

         Review Question 10. In Hendricks v. Behee, the court held that there was no
contract even though the offeree had signed. In Municipal Consultants, the court held
that there was a contract even though the offeree had not signed. Can you explain
this apparent discrepancy in outcome?

whether a contract is formed.

     a. Louise says, "That sounds pretty good."

Problem 6.2

         On April 10, Olivia Owner offers Peter Painter $5,000 to paint the exterior of
Owner's lakefront cabin. The job will, however, require scraping off some of the older
paint around the porch that has been peeling. Painter says he is not sure he can do it
for that price. Owner, who is about to leave on a fourteen-day cruise in the
Mediterranean, says, "Well, think about it. You can decide while I'm off on the
holiday. If you agree, just go ahead and do it." Owner then departs.

         Two days later, on April 12, Painter goes to the cabin and spends six hours
scraping paint. This takes much more time than Painter estimated, and he realizes
that this job would be much more work than he expected and that he would need to
get more than $5,000 for the work. He quits and leaves the premises. The next day,
April 13, Painter is offered a job that pays a good deal more and will take a couple of
weeks to complete. He immediately emails Owner that he's decided not to do the

lakefront cabin job. Owner is unable to check emails for a few days, and ultimately
sees Painter's message on April 15. When Owner returns, she discovers that she
cannot hire anyone else to paint the cabin for less than $8,500. She demands that
Painter finish the work. He refuses. She hires another company and sues for the
$3,500. Painter moves for summary judgment on the ground that no contract was
ever formed. What will the two sides argue in this case? You might find sections 45
and 62 of the Restatement (Second) of Contracts helpful in answering this question.

Problem 6.3

         Owner has a piece of property called Blackacre. Buyer is interested in
purchasing it. The following exchange takes place:

May 1               Buyer sends a letter to Owner, offering to buy Blackacre
                    for $50,000.

May 2               Buyer sends a second letter to Owner withdrawing the
                    offer.

May 3               Owner receives Buyer's 5/1 letter which includes the
                    offer.

May 4 (10 a.m.) Owner mails an acceptance of the 5/1 offer.

May 4               (4 p.m.) Owner receives Buyer's 5/2 letter withdrawing
                    the offer.

May 5 Owner mails a revocation of its 5/4 letter of acceptance.

May 6 Buyer receives Owner's 5/4 letter of acceptance.

May 7               Buyer receives Owner's 5/4 letter revoking the
                    acceptance.

It is now May 10, and Buyer decides she wants to purchase the property. Is there a
contract? Why or why not?

                           CONSIDERATION

         The definition of "contract," according to section 1 of the Restatement (Second)
of Contracts, is "a promise or a set of promises for the breach of which the law gives
a remedy, or the performance of which the law in some way recognizes as a duty." To
a certain extent this is a circular definition--the law enforces a promise if it a
"contract," and it is a "contract" if the law enforces it. But the important thing to note
is that enforceable contracts are a subset of all promises, and thus it becomes critical
to be able to distinguish those that are legally enforceable from those that are not.

         Drawing Lines for Enforcement. At early common law--and for millennia
before that--enforceable promises were usually distinguished by their use of specific
rituals or forms. There are countless ritual forms used in various places and times,
ranging from the relatively simple (holding hands over a sacred stone) to the
extremely elaborate (preparing a scroll, killing a sacrificial animal, smearing its blood
on the parties and the document, and then burying the scroll). Obviously, as
commerce grew, contracting became common, and people from one culture began to
trade with others, these sorts of elaborate rituals became cumbersome. Thus,
commercial cultures tended to develop relatively simple forms that were used to
distinguish enforceable from unenforceable promises.

         The English Approach to Formality. In England, the sign of an enforceable
agreement ultimately took the form of a wax seal impressed with a signet. Sealed
contracts were enforceable simply because they were correctly sealed. Even seals are
cumbersome--not everybody has a signet ring and a candle handy--and so over time
the use of special formalities came to be displaced by a different approach. The
common law courts, who by definition were making things up as they went along out
of existing custom and practice, began to focus less on the form that the agreement
took, but rather on the kind of agreement it was. By the 19th century, courts had
clearly swung around to the position that a promise was enforceable if it was
supported by consideration. Exactly how and why this change came out--and
whether it was a good idea--is the subject of some discussion among contract law
scholars, but by the turn of the 20th century it was clear that in American law a
promise generally had to be supported by consideration to be enforceable as a
contract. Whether that is still the case is something you will discover from the
materials that follow.

         A note of caution. If you think "a promise that involves consideration" means
"a promise that you thought seriously about," you are wrong. "Consideration" is one
of those legal terms of art that means something very different from what it means
in ordinary usage. Stay tuned.

            The Basic Consideration Requirement

                                           FOCUS OF THIS UNIT

         One early--and for our purposes, analytically useful--theory of the origin of
consideration came from the idea that an exchange enforceable at law should
ultimately consist of quid pro quo (literally, "this for that"). If A gives B $5,000 in
exchange for B's old car, each gets a benefit and each suffers a detriment. A, in this
example, "benefits" from getting the car, but suffers a "detriment" in having to give
up $5,000. Over the years the requirement of consideration has evolved far beyond a
simple quid pro quo, as we will see in this section. Without consideration, classical
contract considered such promises to be nudum pactum ex quo non oritur actio."1

         Unenforceable Gift Promises. Promises to make gifts are outside the quid pro
quo paradigm and, in most cases, not legally enforceable based on lack of
consideration. If Snyder plans to give you a bottle of Scotch for Christmas and you
plan to give Snyder a necktie, then the two of you are exchanging gifts. Snyder would
get to keep the necktie even if he forgot to get you anything, just as you would be free
to keep the Scotch even if you were ungrateful enough not to get Snyder a gift. No
contract arises between the parties to a gift. Gifts are, in legal parlance, "gratuitous
transfers." If a person promises to give you a gift, the promise is not usually
enforceable. Once a gift has been given to you (or "delivered") the gift is complete. The
giver has no legal right to take the gift back.

         The existence of a gift (rather than a quid pro quo exchange) has important
implications in contract law. Suppose, again, that you promised to give Snyder a tie,
you bought the tie, and you wrapped up the tie. At this point, you are not legally
obliged to give Snyder the tie. Your promise was gratuitous and is not enforceable,

          1 [Translated, the Latin phrase means, "a naked promise from which no action can arise." The
quotation is from the House of Lords opinion in Rann v. Hughes, 101 Eng. Rep. 1014 (1778). The
principle dates back to Roman law, in which a pactum was an agreement that was enforceable if it fell
into a specified class. If not, it was nudum or "bare." In such situations, if the promisor had performed
he could not get the performance back, but he could not be compelled to perform. - Eds.]

______________________________________________________________________________

UNIT 7: THE BASIC REQUIREMENT OF CONSIDERATION  117
and you are free to change your mind up until the moment of delivery. Snyder is
equally free to keep the bottle of Scotch.

         Bargained-for Exchange. But what if we change the facts slightly? Suppose
this time that you and Snyder agree that he will trade you a bottle of Scotch for a
necktie. At that point, rather than a gift, the two of you have a "bargained-for
exchange."2 The Scotch and the necktie, both being things of value exchanged for each
other, are each "consideration" for each other. You and Snyder now have a contract,
and legal liability occurs at the time the promise is made. No actual delivery is
required.

         Distinguishing gifts from contracts is usually not difficult. An employee
typically does not offer her services free to her employer; the grocery store is not
usually giving away its food; and your internet service provider usually is not
providing you broadband access out of the goodness of its heart. In the ordinary
commercial world most transactions occur through trade, not by gift. In some
situations, however, telling whether one party is giving someone a gift or is
bargaining for something in return can be challenging. The key question is whether
the thing or the promise is offered to get something in return. Since one always expects
to get gratitude for a gift, that "something" must be more than just a warm feeling.
It must be something that has "value in the eyes of the law." Exactly what that means
is a matter of some complexity.

         A Three-Part Analysis. As you read the cases and materials below, keep in
mind three distinct questions. First, is there a promise? The definition of a promise
is a pledge to do (or not do) some particular thing. Thus, a statement like, "I will take
out the trash this afternoon if I decide to," is not a promise--merely the illusion of a
promise--because there is no actual statement that the promisor is going to do
anything. Second, is it a promise to do something that the promisor is not already
obligated to do? You can't "bargain" for something that the other party is already
obligated to do, such as not committing murder, refraining from snorting cocaine, or
obeying traffic laws. Third, is the promise part of a bargain that involves an
exchange? A simple promise to take out the trash is gratuitous. But if it is given in
exchange for the promisee's promise to unload the dishwasher, it is a bargain.

         You might find it useful to review sections 71-77 of the Restatement (Second)
of Contracts as you work your way through this unit.

                                          ______________________

     2 [Be careful with this word "bargain." In common usage, it has at least three meanings: (1) an

agreement between parties under which each will do something for the other; (2) the process of

negotiating a deal ("bargaining" over the terms); and (3) a particularly good deal ("it's a real bargain").

The first meaning is the one we use in contract law. We tend to use the words "negotiate" or (in older

materials) "dicker" to mean the second sense. And whether the deal is good or bad is irrelevant to the

question whether it is a "bargain" in our sense. - Eds.]

    RIDGE RUNNER FORESTRY v. VENEMAN
United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit

                287 F.3d 1058 (Fed. Cir. 2002)

MAYER, C.J.

         Ridge Runner Forestry appeals from the decision of the Department of
Agriculture Board of Contract Appeals dismissing its cause of action for lack of
jurisdiction. Because no contract had been formed, we affirm the board's decision.

         Ridge Runner Forestry is a fire protection company located in the Pacific
Northwest. In response to a request for quotations ("RFQ") issued by the Forestry
Service, Ridge Runner submitted a proposal and ultimately signed a document
entitled Pacific Northwest Interagency Engine Tender Agreement ("Tender
Agreement"). The Tender Agreement incorporated the RFQ in its entirety, including
the following two provisions in bold faced lettering: (1) "Award of an Interagency
Equipment Rental Agreement based on response to this Request for Quotations
(RFQ) does not preclude the Government from using any agency or cooperator or local
EERA resources"; and (2) "Award of an Interagency Equipment Rental Agreement
does not guarantee there will be a need for the equipment offered nor does it
guarantee orders will be placed against the awarded agreements." Additionally,
because the government could not foresee its actual equipment needs, the RFQ
contained language that allowed the contractor to decline the government's request
for equipment for any reason: "Because the equipment needs of the government and
availability of contractor's equipment during an emergency cannot be determined in
advance, it is mutually agreed that, upon request of the government, the contractor
shall furnish the equipment offered herein to the extent the contractor is willing and
able at the time of order" (emphasis added). The RFQ also included a clause informing
bidders that they would not be reimbursed for any costs incurred in submitting a
quotation. Ridge Runner signed Tender Agreements in 1996, 1997, 1998, and 1999.
In 1999, it presented a claim for $180,000 to the contracting officer alleging that the
Forestry Service had violated an "implied duty of good faith and fair dealing" because
Ridge Runner had been "systematically excluded for the past several years from
providing services to the Government." In response, the contracting officer.3 told

3 [The process for contracting with the United States government is somewhat different than

contracting with a private entity. Contracts are signed by an officially designated agency official called

a "contracting officer," who has the power to sign agreements for the United States. The contracting

officer is also ultimately responsible for administering the contract on behalf of the government. If a

contractual dispute arises, the private party generally cannot sue. The contractor's claim must first be

Ridge Runner that she lacked the proper authority to decide the claim [because the
Agreement was not a contract]. Ridge Runner timely appealed the decision to the
Department of Agriculture Board of Contract Appeals. The board granted the
government's motion to dismiss concluding that because no contract had been entered
into, it lacked jurisdiction under the Contract Disputes Act.

         We have jurisdiction over an appeal from a decision of an agency board of
contract appeals. The board's jurisdiction under the CDA requires, at a minimum, a
contract between an agency and another party. Therefore, the threshold matter is
whether the Tender Agreements constituted contracts between the parties, which is
a question of law that we review de novo.

         "To be valid and enforceable, a contract must have both consideration to ensure
mutuality of obligation and sufficient definiteness so as to `provide a basis for
determining the existence of a breach and for giving an appropriate remedy.'" Ace-
Federal Reporters, Inc. v. Barram, 226 F.3d 1329, 1332 (Fed. Cir. 2000). "To constitute
consideration, a performance or a return promise must be bargained for."
Restatement (Second) of Contracts § 71(1) (1979). And the "promise or apparent
promise is not consideration if by its terms the promisor or purported promisor
reserves a choice of alternative performances." Id. § 77.

         Ridge Runner argues that the Tender Agreement was a binding contract that
placed specific obligations upon the government; namely, the government was
obligated to call upon Ridge Runner, and the other winning vendors, for its fire
fighting needs, and in return, the vendors were to remain ready with acceptable
equipment and trained staff to answer the government's call. This, Ridge Runner
argues, places the alleged contract squarely within our [earlier] holding in Ace-
Federal.

         Ace-Federal involved a requirements contract whereby the government was
obligated to use, with limited exceptions, enumerated suppliers. We held that "each
time an agency [acquired goods from] a non-contract source, the government breached
the contract."

         The contract in Ace-Federal is quite distinct from the Tender Agreements at
issue in this case. That contract obligated the government to fulfill all of its
requirements for transcription services from enumerated vendors or obtain a waiver.
The Tender Agreements here are nothing but illusory promises. By the phrase
illusory promise is meant words in promissory form that promise nothing; they do not
purport to put any limitation on the freedom of the alleged promisor, but leave his

presented to the contracting officer for her determination. If she denies the contractor's claim, the
contractor can appeal to another part of the agency, called usually called the Board of Contract
Appeals. If the Board denies the claim, the contractor can appeal to a federal court. That is what
happened in this case. - Eds.]

words at all. Torncello v. United States, 681 F.2d 756, 769 (Ct. Cl. 1982) (quoting 1
ARTHUR L. CORBIN, CORBIN ON CONTRACTS § 145 (1963)). The government had the
option of attempting to obtain firefighting services from Ridge Runner or any other
source, regardless of whether that source had signed a tender agreement. The
Agreements contained no clause limiting the government's options for firefighting
services; the government merely "promised" to consider using Ridge Runner for
firefighting services. Also, the Tender Agreement placed no obligation upon Ridge
Runner. If the government came calling, Ridge Runner "promised" to provide the
requested equipment only if it was "willing and able." It is axiomatic that a valid
contract cannot be based upon the illusory promise of one party, much less illusory
promises of both parties. See Restatement (Second) of Contracts § 71(1).

         Accordingly, the decision of the Department of Agriculture Board of Contract
Appeals is affirmed.

                                          ______________________

         Review Question 1. "The Tender Agreements here are nothing but illusory
promises," says the Federal Circuit Court of Appeals, and therefore lacked
consideration to support the existence of an enforceable contract. Think about the
distinction the court draws with the Ace Federal case it discusses. What makes a
promise "illusory" such that it lacks consideration?

      185 Ohio App. 3d 568, 924 N.E.2d 932 (2010)

         [Three local government entities created a special Joint Economic
Development Zone in Monclova Township. After the JEDZ was created, it entered
into a contract with the township to receive certain government services.]

         The "governmental services" contract between the Joint Economic
Development Zone and Monclova township provides that the township "shall furnish
or cause to be furnished to the properties included in the JEDZ territory, all usual
and customary governmental services furnished by Monclova to other comparable
properties in Monclova, including: fire protection, medical rescue, and road
maintenance services." In return Monclova Township is to receive one-third of the net
tax revenues from the zone.

______________________________________________________________________________

UNIT 7: THE BASIC REQUIREMENT OF CONSIDERATION     121
         We conclude that the territory encompassed in the Monclova-Maumee-Toledo
JEDZ remains a part of Monclova Township. As such, the occupiers of property within
the zone are entitled to the same governmental services provided elsewhere in
Monclova Township. Moreover, the Monclova Township Trustees have the same duty
to provide usual and customary governmental services in the JEDZ as they do
elsewhere in the township.

         As a result, the Trustees of Monclova Township have a pre-existing legal duty
to perform governmental services within the JEDZ, which are the same services that
they have contracted to provide to the JEDZ in return for compensation.
"Performance of a legal duty owed to a promisor which is neither doubtful nor the
subject of honest dispute is not consideration." Restatement (Second) of Contracts §
73 (1979). Consideration is an essential element of any contract, without which there
is no contract.

         As a matter of law, Monclova Township has a duty to provide usual and
customary governmental services in the JEDZ. Since the contract between the
township and the JEDZ is premised on the consideration of the township performing
services that it is already legally obligated to provide, the contract fails for want of
consideration.

                                          ______________________

         Review Question 2. The case described what contract law calls the
"preexisting duty rule," which you can find in section 73 of the Second Restatement.
Promising to do something that you already have a duty to do--or, on the flip side,
promising not to do something you have no right to do--is not consideration. Does
that rule make sense to you or is it preventing useful contracts from being formed? If
someone wants to promise you more to make sure you obey the speed limit or don't
do dangerous drugs, why shouldn't the law enforce a promise to do so?

PERKINS, J.

     Action by J. B. Nell against Zacharias Schnell, upon the following instrument:

              This agreement, entered into this 13th day of February, 1856,
     between Zach. Schnell, of Indianapolis, Marion county, State of
     Indiana, as party of the first part, and J. B. Nell, of the same place,

         parties of the second part, witnesseth: The said Zacharias Schnell
         agrees as follows: whereas his wife, Theresa Schnell, now deceased, has
         made a last will and testament, in which, among other provisions, it was
         ordained that every one of the above named second parties, should
         receive the sum of $200; and whereas the said provisions of the will must
         remain a nullity, for the reason that no property, real or personal, was
         in the possession of the said Theresa Schnell, deceased, in her own name,
         at the time of her death, and all property held by Zacharias and Theresa
         Schnell jointly, therefore reverts to her husband; and whereas the said
         Theresa Schnell has also been a dutiful and loving wife to the said Zach.
         Schnell, and has materially aided him in the acquisition of all property,
         real and personal, now possessed by him; for, and in consideration of all
         this, and the love and respect he bears to his wife; and, furthermore, in
         consideration of one cent, received by him of the second parties, he, the
         said Zach. Schnell, agrees to pay the above named sums of money to the
         parties of the second part, to wit: $200 to the said J. B. Nell; $200 to the
         said Wendelin Lorenz; and $200 to the said Donata Lorenz, in the
         following installments, viz., $200 in one year from the date of these
         presents; $200 in two years, and $200 in three years; to be divided
         between the parties in equal portions of $66 2/3 each year, or as they
         may agree, till each one has received his full sum of $200. And the said
         parties of the second part, for, and in consideration of this, agree to pay
         the above named sum of money [one cent], and to deliver up to said
         Schnell, and abstain from collecting any real or supposed claims upon
         him or his estate, arising from the said last will and testament of the
         said Theresa Schnell, deceased.

                  In witness whereof, the said parties have, on this 13th day of
         February, 1856, set hereunto their hands and seals.

                           Zacharias Schnell [seal.]

                           J. B. Nell [seal.]

                           Wen. Lorenz [seal]

         The complaint contained no averment of a consideration for the instruments
outside of those expressed in it; and did not aver that the one cent agreed to be paid,
had been paid or tendered.

         A demurrer to the complaint was overruled.

         The defendant answered, that the instrument sued on was given for no
consideration whatever.

______________________________________________________________________________

UNIT 7: THE BASIC REQUIREMENT OF CONSIDERATION  123
         He further answered, that it was given for no consideration, because his said
wife, Theresa, at the time she made the will mentioned, and at the time of her death,
owned, neither separately, nor jointly with her husband, or any one else (except so
far as the law gave her an interest in her husband's property), any property, real or
personal, &c.

         The will is copied into the record, but need not be into this opinion.

         The Court sustained a demurrer to these answers, evidently on the ground that
they were regarded as contradicting the instrument sued on, which particularly set
out the considerations upon which it was executed. But the instrument is latently
ambiguous on this point.

         The case turned below, and must turn here, upon the question whether the
instrument sued on does express a consideration sufficient to give it legal obligation,
as against Zacharias Schnell. It specifies three distinct considerations for his promise
to pay $600:

         1. A promise, on the part of the plaintiffs, to pay him one cent.

         2. The love and affection he bore his deceased wife, and the fact that she had
done her part, as his wife, in the acquisition of property.

         3. The fact that she had expressed her desire, in the form of an inoperative will,
that the persons named therein should have the sums of money specified.

         The consideration of one cent will not support the promise of Schnell. It is true,
that as a general proposition, inadequacy of consideration will not vitiate an
agreement. Baker v. Roberts, 14 Ind. 457 (1860). But this doctrine does not apply to
a mere exchange of sums of money, of coin, whose value is exactly fixed, but to the
exchange of something of, in itself, indeterminate value, for money, or, perhaps, for
some other thing of indeterminate value. In this case, had the one cent mentioned,
been some particular one cent, a family piece, or ancient, remarkable coin, possessing
an indeterminate value, extrinsic from its simple money value, a different view might
be taken. As it is, the mere promise to pay six hundred dollars for one cent, even had
the portion of that cent due from the plaintiff been tendered, is an unconscionable
contract, void, at first blush, upon its face, if it be regarded as an earnest one.
Hardesty v. Smith, 3 Ind. 39 (1851). The consideration of one cent is, plainly, in this
case, merely nominal, and intended to be so. As the will and testament of Schnell's
wife imposed no legal obligation upon him to discharge her bequests out of his
property, and as she had none of her own, his promise to discharge them was not
legally binding upon him, on that ground. A moral consideration, only, will not
support a promise.

         And for the same reason, a valid consideration for his promise can not be found
in the fact of a compromise of a disputed claim; for where such claim is legally
groundless, a promise upon a compromise of it, or of a suit upon it, is not legally

______________________________________________________________________________

124  CHAPTER III: CONSIDERATION
binding. Spahr v. Hollingshead, 8 Blackf. 415 (Ind. 1847). There was no mistake of
law or fact in this case, as the agreement admits the will inoperative and void. The
promise was simply one to make a gift. The past services of his wife, and the love and
affection he had borne her, are objectionable as legal considerations for Schnell's
promise, on two grounds: (1) They are past considerations. (2) The fact that Schnell
loved his wife, and that she had been industrious, constituted no consideration for his
promise to pay J. B. Nell, and the Lorenzes, a sum of money. Whether, if his wife, in
her lifetime, had made a bargain with Schnell, that, in consideration of his promising
to pay, after her death, to the persons named, a sum of money, she would be
industrious, and worthy of his affection, such a promise would have been valid and
consistent with public policy, we need not decide.

         Nor is the fact that Schnell now venerates the memory of his deceased wife, a
legal consideration for a promise to pay any third person money.

         The instrument sued on, interpreted in the light of the facts alleged in the
second paragraph of the answer, will not support an action. The demurrer to the
answer should have been overruled. See Stevenson v. Druley, 4 Ind. 519 (1853).

                                          ______________________

         Review Question 3. Schnell appears to have--acting of his own free will--
intended to legally bind himself to pay money to Nell and the Lorenzes. Why should
the law not compel him to perform? Should a general policy preference for freedom of
contract apply in this situation? If we are going to enforce some promises as contracts,
then why not enforce this one?

         Review Question 4. The agreement signed by Schnell recites several different
things that might amount to consideration. Make a list of the various items and try
to see why they do not amount to "consideration."

______________________________________________________________________________

UNIT 7: THE BASIC REQUIREMENT OF CONSIDERATION    125
         This action was brought upon an alleged contract.

         The plaintiff presented a claim to the executor of William E. Story, Sr., for
$5,000 and interest from the 6th day of February, 1875. She acquired it through
several mesne assignments from William E. Story, 2d. The claim being rejected by
the executor, this action was brought.

         It appears that William E. Story, Sr., was the uncle of William E. Story, 2d;
that at the celebration of the golden wedding of Samuel Story and wife, father and
mother of William E. Story, Sr., on the 20th day of March, 1869, in the presence of
the family and invited guests he promised his nephew that if he would refrain from
drinking, using tobacco, swearing and playing cards or billiards for money until he
became twenty-one years of age he would pay him a sum of $5,000. The nephew
assented thereto and fully performed the conditions inducing the promise. When the
nephew arrived at the age of twenty-one years and on the 31st day of January, 1875,
he wrote to his uncle informing him that he had performed his part of the agreement
and had thereby become entitled to the sum of $5,000.

         The uncle received the letter and a few days later and on the sixth of February,
he wrote and mailed to his nephew the following letter:

         BUFFALO, Feb. 6, 1875.

         W. E. STORY, Jr.:

         DEAR NEPHEW--Your letter of the 31st ult. came to hand all right,
         saying that you had lived up to the promise made to me several years
         ago. I have no doubt but you have, for which you shall have five thousand
         dollars as I promised you. I had the money in the bank the day you was
         21 years old that I intend for you, and you shall have the money certain.
         Now, Willie I do not intend to interfere with this money in any way till
         I think you are capable of taking care of it and the sooner that time
         comes the better it will please me. I would hate very much to have you
         start out in some adventure that you thought all right and lose this
         money in one year. The first five thousand dollars that I got together
         cost me a heap of hard work. You would hardly believe me when I tell
         you that to obtain this I shoved a jackplane many a day, butchered three
         or four years, then came to this city, and after three months'
         perseverance I obtained a situation in a grocery store. I opened this store
         early, closed late, slept in the fourth story of the building in a room 30
         by 40 feet and not a human being in the building but myself. All this I
         done to live as cheap as I could to save something. I don't want you to
         take up with this kind of fare. I was here in the cholera season `49 and
         `52 and the deaths averaged 80 to 125 daily and plenty of small-pox. I
         wanted to go home, but Mr. Fisk, the gentleman I was working for, told
         me if I left then, after it got healthy he probably would not want me. I

______________________________________________________________________________

126  CHAPTER III: CONSIDERATION
         stayed. All the money I have saved I know just how I got it. It did not
         come to me in any mysterious way, and the reason I speak of this is that
         money got in this way stops longer with a fellow that gets it with hard
         knocks than it does when he finds it. Willie, you are 21 and you have
         many a thing to learn yet. This money you have earned much easier
         than I did besides acquiring good habits at the same time and you are
         quite welcome to the money; hope you will make good use of it. I was ten
         long years getting this together after I was your age.

                  Truly Yours,

                  W. E. STORY.

         P. S. You can consider this money on interest.

The nephew received the letter and thereafter consented that the money should
remain with his uncle in accordance with the terms and conditions of the letters. The
uncle died on the 29th day of January, 1887, without having paid over to his nephew
any portion of the said $5,000 and interest.

         PARKER, J.: The question which provoked the most discussion by counsel on
this appeal, and which lies at the foundation of plaintiff's asserted right of recovery,
is whether by virtue of a contract defendant's testator William E. Story became
indebted to his nephew William E. Story, 2d, on his twenty-first birthday in the sum
of five thousand dollars. The trial court found as a fact that "on the 20th day of March,
1869, William E. Story agreed to and with William E. Story, 2d, that if he would
refrain from drinking liquor, using tobacco, swearing, and playing cards or billiards
for money until he should become 21 years of age then he, the said William E. Story,
would at that time pay him, the said William E. Story, 2d, the sum of $5,000 for such
refraining, to which the said William E. Story, 2d, agreed," and that he "in all things
fully performed his part of said agreement."

         The defendant contends that the contract was without consideration to support
it, and, therefore, invalid. He asserts that the promisee by refraining from the use of
liquor and tobacco was not harmed but benefitted; that which he did was best for him
to do independently of his uncle's promise, and insists that it follows that unless the
promisor was benefitted, the contract was without consideration. A contention, which
if well founded, would seem to leave open for controversy in many cases whether that
which the promisee did or omitted to do was, in fact, of such benefit to him as to leave
no consideration to support the enforcement of the promisor's agreement. Such a rule
could not be tolerated, and is without foundation in the law. The Exchequer Chamber,
in 1875, defined consideration as follows: "A valuable consideration in the sense of
the law may consist either in some right, interest, profit or benefit accruing to the one
party, or some forbearance, detriment, loss or responsibility given, suffered or
undertaken by the other." Courts "will not ask whether the thing which forms the

______________________________________________________________________________

UNIT 7: THE BASIC REQUIREMENT OF CONSIDERATION  127
consideration does in fact benefit the promisee or a third party, or is of any
substantial value to anyone. It is enough that something is promised, done, forborne
or suffered by the party to whom the promise is made as consideration for the promise
made to him." WILLIAM R. ANSON, PRINCIPLES OF THE ENGLISH LAW OF CONTRACT 63
(1884).

         "In general a waiver of any legal right at the request of another party is a
sufficient consideration for a promise." THEOPHILUS PARSONS, THE LAW OF CONTRACTS
444 (7th ed. 1883).

         "Any damage, or suspension, or forbearance of a right will be sufficient to
sustain a promise." 2 JAMES KENT, COMMENTARIES ON AMERICAN LAW 465 (12th ed.
1873).

         Pollock, in his work on contracts, page 166, after citing the definition given by
the Exchequer Chamber already quoted, "The second branch of this judicial
description is really the most important one. Consideration means not so much that
one party is profiting as that the other abandons some legal right in the present or
limits his legal freedom of action in the future as an inducement for the promise of
the first." FREDERICK POLLOCK, THE PRINCIPLES OF CONTRACT 166 (1876).

         Now, applying this rule to the facts before us, the promisee used tobacco,
occasionally drank liquor, and he had a legal right to do so. That right he abandoned
for a period of years upon the strength of the promise of the testator that for such
forbearance he would give him $5,000. We need not speculate on the effort which may
have been required to give up the use of those stimulants. It is sufficient that he
restricted his lawful freedom of action within certain prescribed limits upon the faith
of his uncle's agreement, and now having fully performed the conditions imposed, it
is of no moment whether such performance actually proved a benefit to the promisor,
and the court will not inquire into it, but were it a proper subject of inquiry, we see
nothing in this record that would permit a determination that the uncle was not
benefitted in a legal sense. Few cases have been found which may be said to be
precisely in point, but such as have been support the position we have taken.

         In Shadwell v. Shadwell, 143 Eng. Rep. 62 (C.P. 1860), an uncle wrote to his
nephew as follows:

         MY DEAR LANCEY--I am so glad to hear of your intended marriage
         with Ellen Nicholl, and as I promised to assist you at starting, I am
         happy to tell you that I will pay to you 150 pounds yearly during my life
         and until your annual income derived from your profession of a chancery
         barrister shall amount to 600 guineas, of which your own admission will
         be the only evidence that I shall require.

128  CHAPTER III: CONSIDERATION
                  Your affectionate uncle,

                  CHARLES SHADWELL.

It was held that the promise was binding and made upon good consideration.

         In Lakota v. Newton, an unreported case in the Superior Court of Worcester,
Mass., the complaint averred defendant's promise that "if you (meaning plaintiff) will
leave off drinking for a year I will give you $100," plaintiff's assent thereto,
performance of the condition by him, and demanded judgment therefor. Defendant
demurred on the ground, among others, that the plaintiff's declaration did not allege
a valid and sufficient consideration for the agreement of the defendant. The demurrer
was overruled.

         In Talbott v. Stemmons' Executor, 12 S.W. 297 (Ky. Ct. App. 1889), the step-
grandmother of the plaintiff made with him the following agreement: "I do promise
and bind myself to give my grandson, Albert R. Talbott, $500 at my death, if he will
never take another chew of tobacco or smoke another cigar during my life from this
date up to my death, and if he breaks this pledge he is to refund double the amount
to his mother." The executor of Mrs. Stemmons demurred to the complaint on the
ground that the agreement was not based on a sufficient consideration. The demurrer
was sustained and an appeal taken therefrom to the Court of Appeals, where the
decision of the court below was reversed. In the opinion of the court it is said that "the
right to use and enjoy the use of tobacco was a right that belonged to the plaintiff and
not forbidden by law. The abandonment of its use may have saved him money or
contributed to his health, nevertheless, the surrender of that right caused the
promise, and having the right to contract with reference to the subject-matter, the
abandonment of the use was a sufficient consideration to uphold the promise."

         Abstinence from the use of intoxicating liquors was held to furnish a good
consideration for a promissory note in Lindell v. Rokes, 60 Mo. 249 (1870).

         The order appealed from should be reversed and the judgment of the Special
Term affirmed, with costs payable out of the estate.

                                  834 A.2d 1169 (Pa. Super. Ct. 2003)

JOHNSON, J.

         In July of 2000, Appellant-Defendant Daniel Moran, a certified public
accountant, accepted employment as controller for Appellee-Plaintiff Weavertown
Transport Leasing, Inc. That summer, the Pittsburgh Steelers National Football
League franchise prepared to relocate from Three Rivers Stadium to its new home,
Heinz Field. Moran, a long-time season ticket-holder to Steelers' home games at
Three Rivers Stadium, was offered four season tickets to Heinz Field comparable to
his seats at Three Rivers Stadium as well as the opportunity to secure additional
seats. Moran paid $11,000 for thirty-year licenses to the four seats that corresponded
to his former seats. He also agreed to purchase seven-year licenses to four Club-Level
seats, which cost $3,840. The purchase agreements precluded Moran from selling or
transferring his licenses to another party for at least one year after purchase, but
allowed for transfer thereafter.

         While these transactions took place, Moran began employment as
Weavertown's controller. Soon after his arrival, he learned through Weavertown's
President, Dawn Fuchs-Heiser, that the Company sought full ownership of season
tickets to Heinz Field to entertain its clients. These tickets would augment the
Company's season tickets to see the Pittsburgh Penguins at Mellon Arena and the
Pittsburgh Pirates at PNC Park. In prior years, the Company had purchased tickets
to many Steelers home games on a per-game basis from another holder of season
tickets. For the 2001/2002 season, Fuchs-Heiser agreed to buy them from Moran.

         The parties dispute the nature of the agreement Moran and Fuchs-Heiser
reached on behalf of Weavertown. The trial court, however, found unequivocally that
Moran "offered to sell both the seat license fee to [Weavertown] and the accompanying

          4 [Actually, plaintiff Louisa Hamer was not the original promise, but rather was the eventual
assignee of the rights of William E. Story II. As such, Hamer "stood in the shoes" of the younger Story
and had the ability to assert his rights against Franklin Sidway, who was the executor of the estate of
the elder William E. Story. Toward the end of this book, we will cover the concept of assignment in
more detail. - Eds.]

______________________________________________________________________________

130  CHAPTER III: CONSIDERATION
season tickets for the Steelers to [Weavertown] and to transfer the seat license from
his name to that of [Weavertown] when the Steelers would permit [Moran] to do so."
To that end, Weavertown wrote checks totaling $3,840 to the Stadium Building Fund
(SBF) for the license fees corresponding to four Club Level seats, and then wrote a
check for $5,804 to the Steelers for the face value of the 2001/2002 season tickets.
These checks were delivered to Moran, who in turn sent them to the appropriate
bodies. When he received the tickets he gave them to the Company. When the Steelers
earned a playoff berth at the end of the 2001/2002 season, Weavertown purchased
seats for those games for $1,283--again by giving a check to Moran who delivered it
to the appropriate Steelers office.

         On May 11, 2001, before the Steelers began their first season at Heinz Field,
Moran resigned his position with Weavertown. He nonetheless in no way interfered
with Weavertown's usage of the seats in dispute throughout that season and during
the playoffs. After the 2001/2002 NFL playoffs, in the spring of 2002, Fuchs-Heiser
asked Moran when he would be able to transfer the licenses to Weavertown. Moran
denied that he had ever intended to transfer the licenses. He did, however, tender a
check to Weavertown equal to six-sevenths of the seat license fee Weavertown had
furnished to the SBF--ostensibly to offset, on a pro rata basis, the license fees for the
six years remaining on the licenses. Weavertown rejected the offer and initiated this
action.

         The trial court rejected Moran's argument that the asserted oral contract failed
for want of consideration. It counted Weavertown's payments to SBF and the Steelers
as payments to third parties constituting consideration. Thus, the court found that
an oral contract existed between Weavertown and Moran. The court ordered specific
performance, directing Moran to transfer the seat licenses and any outstanding
Steelers tickets purchased under those licenses. From this order, Moran appeals.

         Our standard of review requires us to determine, based on all the evidence,
whether the trial court properly applied contract principles. We will not usurp the
trial court's fact-finding function, and will intercede only where the trial court
committed an error of law or an abuse of discretion.

         A contract is formed when the parties to it (1) reach a mutual understanding,
(2) exchange consideration, and (3) delineate the terms of their bargain with sufficient
clarity. Consideration consists of a benefit to the promisor or a detriment to the
promisee.

It is not enough, however, that the promisee has suffered a legal

detriment at the request of the promisor. The detriment incurred must

be the `quid pro quo' or the `price' of the promise, and the inducement for

which it was made. If the promisor merely intends to make a gift to the

promisee upon the performance of a condition, the promise is gratuitous

and the satisfaction of the condition is not consideration for a contract.

         The distinction between such a conditional gift and a contract is well
         illustrated in 1 SAMUEL WILLISTON, LAW OF CONTRACTS § 112 (rev. ed.
         1936), where it is said: "If a benevolent man says to a tramp,5 `if you go
         around the corner to the clothing shop there, you may purchase an
         overcoat on my credit,' no reasonable person would understand that the
         short walk was requested as the consideration for the promise, but that
         in the event of the tramp going to the shop the promisor would make
         him a gift."

Stelmack v. Glen Alden Coal Co., 14 A.2d 127, 128-29 (Pa. 1940).

         Moran contends that he received no consideration for the season tickets and
seat licenses due to Weavertown's lack of obligation to the Steelers. Instead, he
argues that his arrangement with Weavertown was gratuitous, conditioned on
Weavertown's standing in his place by paying the amounts due the Steelers and SBF
for the seats in question. He effectively illustrates his point by observing that, "if the
season tickets, for some reason, were no longer valuable, and Weavertown didn't want
them anymore, it is Moran who is obligated to the Pittsburgh Steelers, not
Weavertown."

         Weavertown has more in common with Williston's "tramp" than it does with a
promisee obliged to a third-party: Weavertown's payments directly to SBF and the
Steelers set up Moran's conditional gift granting Weavertown access to four Club
Level seats at Heinz Field; SBF and the Steelers were incidental beneficiaries, the
benefit to whom cannot be consideration. That Moran arranged it so that Weavertown
bore the initial burden of paying the seat licenses does not change the general
character of the transaction, as demonstrated by Moran's unsolicited pre-litigation
offer to repay sixth-sevenths of the license fees to Weavertown. Thus, we find no
consideration in the arrangement between Moran and Weavertown.

         The trial court erred in finding adequate consideration to support an oral
contract in the gratuitous arrangement between Moran and Weavertown. Thus, we
must reverse the trial court's order. We recognize, however, that Moran should not
receive the benefit of the remaining years on the seat licenses in question without
reimbursing Weavertown as the trial court deems appropriate. Thus, we remand for
further proceedings consistent with this Opinion.

         Review Question 6. Williston's "tramp" hypothetical is often seen as a simple
case of charity: of promising a gift but then reneging on the promise. The interactions
between Moran and Weavertown seem much more complex than that. Was Moran

acting charitably? Was he intending some sort of gift to his employer? The trial court
found a "contract," which presumes that it found consideration. What arguable
consideration could there have been in the agreement to support the trial court's
position? Re-consider section 71 of the Restatement (Second) of Contracts while
answering this question.

Problem 7.1

         Antillico's husband died and left her with several children, little money, and a
failing farm. Her brother-in-law, Isaac, heard of her troubles and sent the following
letter:

         Dear sister Antillico - Much to my mortification, I heard, that brother
         Henry was dead, and one of his children. I know that your situation is
         one of grief, and difficulty. You had a bad chance before, but a great deal
         worse now. I should like to come and see you, but cannot with
         convenience at present. I do not know whether you have a purchase
         option on the place you live on, or not. If you had, I would advise you to
         exercise it and sell the land and quit the country, as I understand it is
         very unhealthy, and I know society is very bad. If you will come down
         and see me, I will let you have a place to raise your family, and I have
         more open land than I can tend; and on the account of your situation,
         and that of your family, I feel like I want you and the children to do well.

Antillico promptly packed up and move down to Isaac's place. She stayed there for
two years, cultivating the land. Isaac thereupon kicked her off the property. She sued,
claiming breach of contract. Isaac argued that there was no consideration for his
promise. What result?

Problem 7.2

         Fritz is a well-to-do man who owns a cat. The cat, Fluffy, is his constant
companion and his pride and joy. Vincent is an itinerant artist who paints pictures of
pets. Vincent and Fritz agree that Vincent will paint a picture of Fluffy for $1,000,
provided that Fritz thinks it's a good likeness. If Fritz does not think the painting a
good likeness, he will owe Vincent nothing. Vincent has Fritz sign a brief form
recording the transaction. Vincent never gets around to painting Fluffy.

Shortly after his talk with Fritz, Vincent is discovered by a prominent SoHo

gallery, which wants to do a solo exhibition of his cat paintings. Suddenly Vincent's

paintings skyrocket in price. After the gallery show, the price of Vincent's cat

paintings has risen to $250,000. Fritz demands that Vincent paint Fluffy, as agreed.

______________________________________________________________________________

UNIT 7: THE BASIC REQUIREMENT OF CONSIDERATION  133
Vincent refuses. Fritz eventually sues Vincent, claiming that Vincent breached their
contract by never painting Fluffy. Assume that if Vincent had painted Fluffy, the
painting would be worth about $250,000. Vincent defends on the ground that there
never was a contract because Fritz's promise was illusory.

         Who should prevail, Vincent or Fritz? Why?

Problem 7.3

         Michael and Hildegard were married and lived in California. A few years after
the marriage, Michael began having heart problems and he was admitted to the
hospital several times. He became terrified that he would have to be put in a nursing
home. He orally promised Hildegard that if she would "care for [him] in his home, for
the duration of his illness," he would leave to her a substantial amount of property
that she would not ordinarily be entitled to inherit on his death. She cared for him,
but he never changed his will, and the property went to his daughter by his first
marriage. Upon his death, she sued the estate to get the property. The estate argued
that there was no consideration for her promise, because under California law
spouses owe each other duties of support and care that cannot be disclaimed. Was
there consideration for Michael's promise? Why or why not?

Problem 7.4

         (a) Jules owns a men's clothing store in New York. One bitterly cold day, while
coming out of his bank, he sees a homeless man walking without a coat. He tells the
man, "Look, if you come by my shop this afternoon, I have a coat that I will give you."
That afternoon, the man walks the three blocks to Jules's shop. Is Jules bound to give
him the coat, or can he change his mind without legal consequences?

         (b) Same facts, except that the homeless man is sitting on a heating grate
outside of Jules's expensive haberdashery, causing customers to walk past without
going inside. Jules tells the man, "If you will go somewhere else for the day, I will
give you a coat when you come back at seven when the store closes." The man leaves
and goes to another grate three blocks away. Is Jules bound to give him the coat if he
returns to the shop at seven?

Special Issues with Consideration

                                           FOCUS OF THIS UNIT

         Some promises are relatively trivial, such as promising to pay back a dollar
you borrowed to get a can of soda. Some promises are extraordinarily solemn and
important, like a promise to deliver the last letter home for a dying soldier. But
enforceability, as we have seen, does not depend on the importance of the promise,
but on whether it is supported by consideration--whether there is, in the language of
the Restatement (Second) of Contracts, a "bargained-for exchange."

         Modifications? Recall the preexisting duty rule from the last unit. We talked
about duties arising under law, but duties can also arise under contracts. Suppose
you have a contract to paint your neighbor's house $5,000, but you now refuse to do
so unless the neighbor promises to pay an extra $500. As you have a contractual
obligation to paint the house $5,000, there is no consideration for the extra $500. As
you will see from the following materials, however, it may not be quite that simple.

         Benefits Already Received? The preexisting duty rule, as we saw, was based
on the idea that you can't bargain for something you're already entitled to. But what
about bargaining for something you've already received? You might think that after
the cases in the previous unit, the answer would be easy--if you've already received
something, you are almost by definition not bargaining to get it. An important and
oft-cited English case, Hunt v. Bate, 73 Eng. Rep. 605 (C.P. 1568), made it clear that
a subsequent promise to pay for something already received was not enforceable as a
contract. A gift followed by a return gift does not make a "bargained-for exchange."
Yet the doctrine was never quite that clear. In a series of cases, nearly all involving
debtors who had promised to repay loans after the loans had been discharged in
bankruptcy or barred by the statute of limitations,1 courts held that if the prior

1 [You are probably familiar with this concept, but statutes of limitations are rules that require

lawsuits to be brought within a particular period of time. Thus, in a particular state a contract claim

______________________________________________________________________________

UNIT 8: SPECIAL ISSUES WITH CONSIDERATION  135
benefit was money received, the subsequent promise was enforceable without new
consideration. The reasoning generally was that a debtor was always morally
obligated to pay back the money, even if the debt was unenforceable, and so that debt
acted as consideration.

         Moral Obligation? But there obviously are "moral" obligations beyond just
repaying debts. In Style v. Smith,2 another sixteenth century case decided only a few
years after Hunt v. Bate, the court raised a hypothetical:

         If a physician, who is my friend, hearing that my son is sick, goeth to
         him in my absence and helps and recovers him, and I being informed
         thereof promise him in consideration . . . to give him £20 an action will
         lie for the money.

In other words, said the court, the father must pay even though the promise came
after service was performed. But many cases went the other way, including the
influential Eastwood v. Kenyon, 11 Ad & E 438; 113 ER 482 (Q.B. 1840). Professor
Brian Simpson concluded the English rules relating to moral consideration were
"easier to state than to explain." As you can see from the following cases, these
English rules--in all their confusion--were imported largely intact into American
law.

         As you work through the problems and the readings, try to articulate whether
liability is based on the idea of the promise or the idea of some kind of exchange.
Consider sections 86 and 89 of the Restatement (Second) of Contracts in connection
with the materials that follow.

claim is barred.--Eds.]

                        Cases and Materials

                   ALASKA PACKERS' ASSOCIATION v. DOMENICO
                               Circuit Court of Appeals, Ninth Circuit
                                               117 F. 99 (1902)

ROSS, Circuit Judge.

         The libel3 in this case was based upon a contract alleged to have been entered
into between the libellants and the appellant corporation on the 22d day of May, 1900,
at Pyramid Harbor, Alaska.

         The evidence shows without conflict that on March 26, 1900, at the city and
county of San Francisco, the libellants entered into a written contract with the
appellant, whereby they agreed to go from San Francisco to Pyramid Harbor, Alaska,
and return, on board such vessel as might be designated by the appellant, and to work
for the appellant during the fishing season of 1900, at Pyramid Harbor, as sailors and
fishermen, agreeing to do "regular ship's duty, both up and down, discharging and
loading; and to do any other work whatsoever when requested to do so by the captain
or agent of the Alaska Packers' Association." By the terms of this agreement, the
appellant was to pay each of the libellants $50 for the season, and two cents for each
red salmon in the catching of which he took part.

         On the 15th day of April, 1900, 21 of the libellants signed shipping articles by
which they shipped as seamen on the Two Brothers, a vessel chartered by the
appellant for the voyage between San Francisco and Pyramid Harbor, and also bound
themselves to perform the same work for the appellant provided for by the previous
contract of March 26th; the appellant agreeing to pay them therefor the sum of $60
for the season, and two cents each for each red salmon in the catching of which they
should respectively take part. Under these contracts, the libellants sailed on board
the Two Brothers for Pyramid Harbor, where the appellant had about $150,000
invested in a salmon cannery.

         The libellants arrived there early in April of the year mentioned, and began to
unload the vessel and fit up the cannery. A few days thereafter, to wit, May 19th,

3 [This case involves contracts for seamen, and it therefore is brought under admiralty

jurisdiction in the federal courts. Federal district courts have exclusive jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C.

§ 1333 over "[a]ny civil case of admiralty or maritime jurisdiction." Traditionally, an admiralty

proceeding was begun by filing a "libel," which the equivalent of a "complaint" or "petition" in standard

civil litigation. The person filing the action--the plaintiff--was called the "libellant." This case has

nothing to do with the tort of libel, and you will confuse about ninety-out-of-a-hundred lawyers if you

unwisely say that you are reading a "libel case." Just call Alaska Packers an "admiralty case," and

everyone will be happy. - Eds.]

______________________________________________________________________________

UNIT 8: SPECIAL ISSUES WITH CONSIDERATION  137
they stopped work in a body, and demanded of the company's superintendent there
in charge $100 [each] for services in operating the vessel to and from Pyramid Harbor,
instead of the sums stipulated for in and by the contracts; stating that unless they
were paid this additional wage they would stop work entirely, and return to San
Francisco. The evidence showed, and the court below found, that it was impossible
for the appellant to get other men to take the places of the libellants, the place being
remote, the season short and just opening; so that, after endeavoring for several days
without success to induce the libellants to proceed with their work in accordance with
their contracts, the company's superintendent, on the 22d day of May, so far yielded
to their demands as to instruct his clerk to copy the contracts executed in San
Francisco, including the words "Alaska Packers' Association" at the end, substituting,
for the $50 and $60 payments, respectively, of those contracts, the sum of $100, which
document, so prepared, was signed by the libellants before a shipping commissioner
whom they had requested to be brought from Northeast Point.

         Upon the return of the libellants to San Francisco at the close of the fishing
season, they demanded pay in accordance with the terms of the alleged contract of
May 22d, when the company denied its validity, and refused to pay other than as
provided for by the contracts of March 26th and April 5th, respectively.

         On the trial in the court below, the libellants undertook to show that the fishing
nets provided by the respondent were defective, and that it was on that account that
they demanded increased wages. On that point, the evidence was substantially
conflicting, and the finding of the court was against the libelants, the court saying:

                  The contention of libellants that the nets provided them were
         rotten and unserviceable is not sustained by the evidence. The
         defendant's interest required that libellants should be provided with
         every facility necessary to their success as fishermen, for on such success
         depended the profits defendant would be able to realize that season from
         its packing plant, and the large capital invested therein. In view of this
         self-evident fact, it is highly improbable that the defendant gave
         libellants rotten and unserviceable nets with which to fish. It follows
         from this finding that libellants were not justified in refusing
         performance of their original contract.

         The evidence being sharply conflicting in respect to these facts, the conclusions
of the court, who heard and saw the witnesses, will not be disturbed.

         The real questions in the case as brought here are questions of law, and, in the
view that we take of the case, it will be necessary to consider but one of those.
Assuming that the appellant's superintendent at Pyramid Harbor was authorized to
make the alleged contract of May 22d, and that he executed it on behalf of the
appellant, was it supported by a sufficient consideration?

______________________________________________________________________________

138  CHAPTER III: CONSIDERATION
         From the foregoing statement of the case, it will have been seen that the
libellants agreed in writing, for certain stated compensation, to render their services
to the appellant in remote waters where the season for conducting fishing operations
is extremely short, and in which enterprise the appellant had a large amount of
money invested; and, after having entered upon the discharge of their contract, and
at a time when it was impossible for the appellant to secure other men in their places,
the libellants, without any valid cause, absolutely refused to continue the services
they were under contract to perform unless the appellant would consent to pay them
more money. Consent to such a demand, under such circumstances, if given, was, in
our opinion, without consideration, for the reason that it was based solely upon the
libellants' agreement to render the exact services, and none other, that they were
already under contract to render. The case shows that they willfully and arbitrarily
broke that obligation. As a matter of course, they were liable to the appellant in
damages, and it is quite probable, as suggested by the court below in its opinion, that
they may have been unable to respond in damages. But we are unable to agree with
the [district court judge's] conclusions there drawn, from these facts, in these words:

         Under such circumstances, it would be strange, indeed, if the law
would not permit the defendant to waive the damages caused by the
libellants' breach, and enter into the contract sued upon--a contract
mutually beneficial to all the parties thereto, in that it gave to the
libellants reasonable compensation for their labor, and enabled the
defendant to employ to advantage the large capital it had invested in its
canning and fishing plant.

         The circumstances of the present case bring it, we think, directly within the
sound and just observations of the supreme court of Minnesota in the case of King v.
Duluth, M. & N. Ry Co., 63 N.W. 1105 (Minn. 1895):

         No astute reasoning can change the plain fact that the party who
refuses to perform, and thereby coerces a promise from the other party
to the contract to pay him an increased compensation for doing that
which he is legally bound to do, takes an unjustifiable advantage of the
necessities of the other party. There can be no consideration for the
promise of the other party, and there is no warrant for inferring that the
parties have voluntarily rescinded or modified their contract. The
promise cannot be legally enforced, although the other party has
completed his contract in reliance upon it.

         In Lingenfelder v. Wainwright Brewing Co., 15 S.W. 844 (Mo. 1890), the court,
in holding void a contract by which the owner of a building agreed to pay its architect
an additional sum because of his refusal to otherwise proceed with the contract, said:

It is urged upon us by respondents that this was a new contract.

New in what? Jungenfeld was bound by his contract to design and

______________________________________________________________________________

UNIT 8: SPECIAL ISSUES WITH CONSIDERATION                                   139
         supervise this building. Under the new promise, he was not to do
         anything more or anything different. What benefit was to accrue to
         Wainwright? He was to receive the same service from Jungenfeld under
         the new, that Jungenfeld was bound to tender under the original,
         contract. What loss, trouble, or inconvenience could result to Jungenfeld
         that he had not already assumed? No amount of metaphysical reasoning
         can change the plain fact that Jungenfeld took advantage of
         Wainwright's necessities, and extorted the promise of five per cent. on
         the refrigerator plant as the condition of his complying with his contract
         already entered into. To permit plaintiff to recover under such
         circumstances would be to offer a premium upon bad faith, and invite
         men to violate their most sacred contracts that they may profit by their
         own wrong.

                  It is true that as eminent a jurist as Judge Cooley, in Goebel v.
         Linn, 11 N.W. 284 (Mich. 1884), held that an ice company which had
         agreed to furnish a brewery with all the ice they might need for their
         business at $1.75 per ton, and afterwards declined to deliver any more
         ice unless the brewery would give it $3 per ton, could recover on a
         promissory note given for the increased price. Profound as is our respect
         for the distinguished judge who delivered the opinion, we are still of the
         opinion that his decision is not in accord with the almost universally
         accepted doctrine, and is not convincing; and certainly so much of the
         opinion as holds that the payment, by a debtor, of a part of his debt then
         due, would constitute a defense to a suit for the remainder, is not the
         law of this state, nor, do we think, of any other where the common law
         prevails.

                  What we hold is that, when a party merely does what he has
         already obligated himself to do, he cannot demand an additional
         compensation therefor; and although, by taking advantage of the
         necessities of his adversary, he obtains a promise for more, the law will
         regard it as nudum pactum, and will not lend its process to aid in the
         wrong.

         It results from the views above expressed that the judgment must be reversed,
and the cause remanded, with directions to the court below to enter judgment for the
respondent, with costs. It is so ordered.

     ______________________

         Review Question 1. If the fishermen had known in advance how this case
would come out, what could they have done differently at the time of the dispute to
get higher pay and have it enforceable against the packing company? Assume that

______________________________________________________________________________

140                          CHAPTER III: CONSIDERATION
there was not enough cash on hand at Pyramid Harbor to pay them in advance. Do
they have any other viable legal options?

         Review Question 2. In her article, A Fish Story, 2000 Utah L. Rev. 185,
Professor Deborah Threedy researched the history of the Alaska Packers case. She
concludes that the company did deliberately provide faulty nets, because while they
needed the fishermen to work the ship to Pyramid Harbor and back, they could buy
the salmon from local Alaska natives for less than they had agreed to pay the
fishermen. Thus, the more fish caught by the fishermen, the less money the cannery
made. If Professor Threedy's conclusion is true--and, more importantly, was found
by the court to be true--would those facts make a difference in the court's
consideration analysis and the outcome of the case? Why or why not?

                                 474 N.W.2d 277 (Iowa Ct. App. 1991)

OXBERGER, C.J.

         In 1980 Lester Quigley, Sr. sold his farm on contract to Donald and Janis
Wilson. The Wilsons made the installment payments until 1985. In 1985, the Wilsons
assigned the contract to Forrest Hatfield. Sometime prior to February 1986, Hatfield
informed the Wilsons he could no longer make the payments and returned the farm
to them. Donald Wilson then met with Quigley, Sr. to inform him they were also
unable to make the upcoming March 1, 1986 payment. After negotiations, Quigley,
Sr. and the Wilsons agreed to reduce the contract price along with some other changes
from the original contract terms. Both parties signed an agreement dated March 7,
1986, created by Quigley, Sr.'s attorney which reduced their negotiations to writing.
Quigley, Sr.'s attorney later recorded the agreement. The Wilsons made all payments
due under the 1986 agreement.

         Quigley, Sr. is quite elderly and has resided in a nursing home since 1985. In
1988 Quigley, Sr. established a voluntary conservatorship appointing his two
children, Lester L. Quigley, Jr. and Veronna Kay Lovell, co-conservators for himself.

         The co-conservators filed this lawsuit September 12, 1988, against the Wilsons
seeking a declaratory judgment that the Wilsons were in default of the 1980 contract.
The Wilsons filed an answer generally denying the claims and asserting the 1986
agreement modified the 1980 contract.

______________________________________________________________________________

UNIT 8: SPECIAL ISSUES WITH CONSIDERATION  141
         The day before trial the plaintiffs filed a trial brief and motion for partial
judgment on the pleadings. They alleged the 1986 agreement was unenforceable due
to lack of consideration. The district court overruled the motion finding lack of
consideration was not a triable issue.

         The case proceeded to trial. The jury found Lester Quigley, Sr. was mentally
competent when he entered into the 1986 agreement. The court then held a bench
trial on the equitable issues of fraud and undue influence. The court entered a verdict
in favor of the Wilsons, finding the 1986 agreement enforceable.

         The co-conservators appeal. They contend the issue of lack of consideration
should have been submitted to the jury.

         We find the case at bar establishes a modification which normally does require
consideration. See Recker v. Gustafson, 279 N.W.2d 744, 759 (Iowa 1979). In Recker
which dealt with an oral "modification" to an oral land contract, the court discussed
the Iowa law on sufficiency of consideration to support a modification or replacement
of a contract. In Recker the court quoted the Restatement (Second) of the Law of
Contracts § 89, which provides:

     A promise modifying a duty under a contract not fully performed on
     either side is binding

     (a) if the modification is fair and equitable in view of circumstances not
     anticipated by the parties when the contract was made . . ..

The Recker court also quoted from comment b, Illustration 4 of the Restatement § 89:

     The reason for modification must rest in circumstances not "anticipated"
     as part of the context in which the contract was made, but a frustrating
     event may be unanticipated for this purpose if it was not adequately
     covered, even though it was foreseen as a remote possibility. When such
     a reason is present, the relative financial strength of the parties, the
     formality with which the modification is made, the extent to which it is
     performed or relied on and other circumstances may be relevant to show
     or negate imposition or unfair surprise.

The Recker court declined to adopt the Restatement position because no
unanticipated circumstances existed in the case other than a desire for more money.
However, the court did not discount its application in appropriate circumstances in
the future.

         We find the case at bar an appropriate circumstance for the adoption of the
Restatement's position. The unanticipated circumstances were the drastic decrease
in the value of the land coupled with the seller's concern about tax repercussions from
reacquiring the land and the fact the Wilsons had not received any income from the
farm for the previous year. Additionally, the new agreement followed negotiations
lasting over a period of time, the document was written by the seller's attorney, the

trial court found the reduced price was roughly the fair market value of the property
at the time the re-negotiations occurred, and the buyers had already paid $58,000
toward principal on the original contract and the balance of the new contract price
was $62,500. Additionally, we find it significant the jury found Quigley, Sr. was
competent when he entered the 1986 agreement and the trial court found no undue
influence or fraudulent misrepresentation involved in the agreement. These factors
lead us to find this is a situation where it is appropriate to find the modification fair
and equitable and does not require proof of additional consideration.

         We affirm the trial court's refusal to allow the issue of consideration to be
litigated.

                                          ______________________

         Review Question 3. Quigly illustrates the Restatement's attitude toward
modifications. What "circumstances not anticipated by the parties" would be covered,
do you think? And assuming that the parties now disagree about whether it is "fair
and equitable," how would a court decide the issue?

         This was an action of assumpsit brought to recover a compensation for the
board, nursing, &c., of Levi Wyman, son of the defendant, from the 5th to the 20th of
February, 1821. The plaintiff then lived at Hartford, in Connecticut; the defendant,
at Shrewsbury, in this county. Levi Wyman, at the time when the services were
rendered, was about 25 years of age, and had long ceased to be a member of his
father's family. He was on his return from a voyage at sea, and being suddenly taken
sick at Hartford, and being poor and in distress, was relieved by the plaintiff in the
manner and to the extent above stated. On the 24th of February, after all the
expenses had been incurred, the defendant wrote a letter to the plaintiff, promising
to pay him such expenses. There was no consideration for this promise, except what
grew out of the relation which subsisted between Levi Wyman and the defendant,
and Howe J., before whom the cause was tried in the Court of Common Pleas,
thinking this not sufficient to support the action, directed a nonsuit. To this direction
the plaintiff filed exceptions.

UNIT 8: SPECIAL ISSUES WITH CONSIDERATION  143
         General rules of law established for the protection and security of honest and
fair-minded men, who may inconsiderately make promises without any equivalent,
will sometimes screen men of a different character from engagements which they are
bound in foro conscientioe to perform. This is a defect inherent in all human systems
of legislation. The rule that a mere verbal promise, without any consideration, cannot
be enforced by action, is universal in its application, and cannot be departed from to
suit particular cases in which a refusal to perform such a promise may be disgraceful.

         The promise declared on in this case appears to have been made without any
legal consideration. The kindness and services towards the sick son of the defendant
were not bestowed at his request. The son was in no respect under the care of the
defendant. He was twenty-five years old, and had long left his father's family. On his
return from a foreign country, he fell sick among strangers, and the plaintiff acted
the part of the good Samaritan, giving him shelter and comfort until he died. The
defendant, his father, on being informed of this event, influenced by a transient
feeling of gratitude, promises in writing to pay the plaintiff for the expenses he had
incurred. But he has determined to break this promise, and is willing to have his case
appear on record as a strong example of particular injustice sometimes necessarily
resulting from the operation of general rules.

         It is said a moral obligation is a sufficient consideration to support an express
promise; and some authorities lay down the rule thus broadly; but upon examination
of the cases we are satisfied that the universality of the rule cannot be supported.

         If moral obligation, in its fullest sense, is a good substratum for an express
promise, it is not easy to perceive why it is not equally good to support an implied
promise. What a man ought to do, generally he ought to be made to do, whether he
promise or refuse. But the law of society has left most of such obligations to the
interior forum, as the tribunal of conscience has been aptly called. Is there not a moral
obligation upon every son who has become affluent by means of the education and
advantages bestowed upon him by his father, to relieve that father from pecuniary
embarrassment, to promote his comfort and happiness, and even to share with him
his riches, if thereby he will be made happy? And yet such a son may, with impunity,
leave such a father in any degree of penury above that which will expose the
community in which he dwells, to the danger of being obliged to preserve him from
absolute want. Is not a wealthy father under strong moral obligation to advance the
interest of an obedient, well disposed son, to furnish him with the means of acquiring
and maintaining a becoming rank in life, to rescue him from the horrors of debt
incurred by misfortune? Yet the law will uphold him in any degree of parsimony,
short of that which would reduce his son to the necessity of seeking public charity.

         Without doubt there are great interests of society which justify withholding
the coercive arm of the law from these duties of imperfect obligation, as they are
called; imperfect, not because they are less binding upon the conscience than those

______________________________________________________________________________

144  CHAPTER III: CONSIDERATION
which are called perfect, but because the wisdom of the social law does not impose
sanctions upon them.

         A deliberate promise, in writing, made freely and without any mistake, one
which may lead the party to whom it is made into contracts and expenses, cannot be
broken without a violation of moral duty. But if there was nothing paid or promised
for it, the law, perhaps wisely, leaves the execution of it to the conscience of him who
makes it. It is only when the party making the promise gains something, or he to
whom it is made loses something, that the law gives the promise validity. And in the
case of the promise of the adult to pay the debt of the infant, of the debtor discharged
by the statute of limitations or bankruptcy, the principle is preserved by looking back
to the origin of the transaction, where an equivalent is to be found. An exact
equivalent is not required by the law; for there being a consideration, the parties are
left to estimate its value: though here the courts of equity will step in to relieve from
gross inadequacy between the consideration and the promise.

         A legal obligation is always a sufficient consideration to support either an
express or an implied promise; such as an infant's debt for necessaries, or a father's
promise to pay for the support and education of his minor children. But when the
child shall have attained to manhood, and shall have become his own agent in the
world's business, the debts he in curs, whatever may be their nature, create no
obligation upon the father; and it seems to follow, that his promise founded upon such
a debt has no legally binding force.

         The opinions of the judges had been variant for a long course of years upon this
subject, but there seems to be no case in which it was nakedly decided, that a promise
to pay the debt of a son of full age, not living with his father, though the debt were
incurred by sickness which ended in the death of the son, without a previous request
by the father proved or presumed, could be enforced by action.

         It has been attempted to show a legal obligation on the part of the defendant
by virtue of our statute, which compels lineal kindred in the ascending or descending
line to support such of their poor relations as are likely to become chargeable to the
town where they have their settlement. But it is a sufficient answer to this position,
that such legal obligation does not exist except in the very cases provided for in the
statute, and never until the party charged has been adjudged to be of sufficient ability
thereto. We do not know from the report any of the facts which are necessary to create
such an obligation. Whether the deceased had a legal settlement in this
commonwealth at the time of his death, whether he was likely to become chargeable
had he lived, whether the defendant was of sufficient ability, are essential facts to be
adjudicated by the court to which is given jurisdiction on this subject. The legal
liability does not arise until these facts have all been ascertained by judgment, after
hearing the party intended to be charged.

         Review Question 4. Isn't this exactly the same situation as the hypothetical
in Style v. Smith, mentioned in the introduction to this unit? Can you distinguish the
two? Would it make a difference if the son in Style were a minor living in his father's
home?

         Review Question 5. In a later English case, Eastwood v. Kenyon, 113 Eng. Rep.
482 (K.B. 1840), Lord Chief Justice Denman suggested that enforcing gratuitous
promises was not a great idea:

         The enforcement of such [gratuitous] promises by law, however
         plausibly reconciled by the desire to effect all conscientious
         engagements, might be attended with mischievous consequences to
         society; one of which would be the frequent preference of voluntary
         undertakings to claims for just debts. Suits would thereby be multiplied,
         and voluntary undertakings would also be multiplied, to the prejudice
         of real creditors. The temptations of executors would be much increased
         by the prevalence of such a doctrine, and the faithful discharge of their
         duty be rendered more difficult.

What "mischievous consequences" can you imagine arising from enforcing gratuitous
promises? Is there anything wrong with a bright-line rule that people are legally
obliged to pay whatever they have promised to pay?

                                  225 N.C. 690, 36 S.E.2d 227 (1945)

PER CURIAM
         The plaintiff in this case sought to recover of the defendant upon a promise

made by him under the following peculiar circumstances:
         The defendant had assaulted his wife, who took refuge in plaintiff's house. The

next day the defendant gained access to the house and began another assault upon
his wife. The defendant's wife knocked him down with an axe, and was on the point
of cutting his head open or decapitating him while he was laying on the floor, and the
plaintiff intervened, caught the axe as it was descending, and the blow intended for
defendant fell upon her hand, mutilating it badly, but saving defendant's life.

         Subsequently, defendant orally promised to pay the plaintiff her damages; but,
after paying a small sum, failed to pay anything more. So, substantially, states the
complaint.

         The defendant demurred to the complaint as not stating a cause of action, and
the demurrer was sustained. Plaintiff appealed.

         The question presented is whether there was a consideration recognized by our
law as sufficient to support the promise. The Court is of the opinion that however
much the defendant should be impelled by common gratitude to alleviate the
plaintiff's misfortune, a humanitarian act of this kind, voluntarily performed, is not
such consideration as would entitle her to recover at law.

         The judgment sustaining the demurrer is
         Affirmed.

         Review Question 5. The facts of Harrington seem pretty straightforward.
Harrington saved Taylor's life gratuitously, so the subsequent promise lacked
consideration. As you read the next case, consider whether it is equally
straightforward and should reach the same result.

     27 Ala. App. 82, 168 So. 196 (1935), aff'd 232 Ala. 374, 168 So. 199 (1936)

BRICKEN, P.J.

         A fair statement of the case presenting the questions for decision is set out in
appellant's brief, which we adopt.

              On the 3d day of August, 1925, appellant [Joe Webb] while in the employ
     of the W.T. Smith Lumber Company, a corporation, and acting within the scope
     of his employment, was engaged in clearing the upper floor of mill No. 2 of the
     company. While so engaged he was in the act of dropping a pine block from the
     upper floor of the mill to the ground below; this being the usual and ordinary
     way of clearing the floor, and it being the duty of the plaintiff in the course of
     his employment to so drop it. The block weighed about 75 pounds.

              As appellant was in the act of dropping the block to the ground below,
     he was on the edge of the upper floor of the mill. As he started to turn the block
     loose so that it would drop to the ground, he saw J. Greeley McGowin, testator
     of the defendants [and president of the company], on the ground below and
     directly under where the block would have fallen had appellant turned it loose.
     Had he turned it loose it would have struck McGowin with such force as to
     have caused him serious bodily harm or death. Appellant could have remained
     safely on the upper floor of the mill by turning the block loose and allowing it
     to drop, but had he done this the block would have fallen on McGowin and
     caused him serious injuries or death. The only safe and reasonable way to
     prevent this was for appellant to hold to the block and divert its direction in
     falling from the place where McGowin was standing and the only safe way to
     divert it so as to prevent its coming into contact with McGowin was for
     appellant to fall with it to the ground below. Appellant did this, and by holding
     to the block and falling with it to the ground below, he diverted the course of
     its fall in such way that McGowin was not injured. In thus preventing the
     injuries to McGowin appellant himself received serious bodily injuries,
     resulting in his right leg being broken, the heel of his right foot torn off and his
     right arm broken. He was badly crippled for life and rendered unable to do
     physical or mental labor.

     On September 1, 1925, in consideration of appellant having prevented

     him from sustaining death or serious bodily harm and in consideration of the

     injuries appellant had received, McGowin agreed with him to care for and

     maintain him for the remainder of appellant's life at the rate of $15 [about

     $800 today] every two weeks from the time he sustained his injuries to and

     during the remainder of appellant's life; it being agreed that McGowin would

     pay this sum to appellant for his maintenance. Under the agreement McGowin

______________________________________________________________________________

148            CHAPTER III: CONSIDERATION
paid or caused to be paid to appellant the sum so agreed on up until McGowin's
death on January 1, 1934. After his death the payments were continued to and
including January 27, 1934, at which time they were discontinued. Thereupon
plaintiff brought suit to recover the unpaid installments accruing up to the
time of the bringing of the suit.

         The material averments of the different counts of the original complaint
and the amended complaint are predicated upon the foregoing statement of
facts.

         In other words, the complaint as amended averred in substance: (1) That on
August 3, 1925, appellant saved J. Greeley McGowin, appellee's testator, from death
or grievous bodily harm; (2) that in doing so appellant sustained bodily injury
crippling him for life; (3) that in consideration of the services rendered and the
injuries received by appellant, McGowin agreed to care for him the remainder of
appellant's life, the amount to be paid being $15 every two weeks; (4) that McGowin
complied with this agreement until he died on January 1, 1934, and the payments
were kept up to January 27, 1934, after which they were discontinued.

         The action was for the unpaid installments accruing after January 27, 1934, to
the time of the suit. [The trial court sustained a demurrer to Webb's complaint, and
Webb appealed.]

         The principal grounds of demurrer to the original and amended complaint are:
(1) It states no cause of action; (2) its averments show the contract was without
consideration; (3) it fails to allege that McGowin had, at or before the services were
rendered, agreed to pay appellant for them.

         The averments of the complaint show that appellant saved McGowin from
death or grievous bodily harm. This was a material benefit to him of infinitely more
value than any financial aid he could have received. Receiving this benefit, McGowin
became morally bound to compensate appellant for the services rendered.
Recognizing his moral obligation, he expressly agreed to pay appellant as alleged in
the complaint and complied with this agreement up to the time of his death; a period
of more than 8 years.

         Had McGowin been accidentally poisoned and a physician, without his
knowledge or request, had administered an antidote, thus saving his life, a
subsequent promise by McGowin to pay the physician would have been valid.
Likewise, McGowin's agreement as disclosed by the complaint to compensate
appellant for saving him from death or grievous bodily injury is valid and enforceable.

         Where the promisee cares for, improves, and preserves the property of the
promisor, though done without his request, it is sufficient consideration for the
promisor's subsequent agreement to pay for the service, because of the material
benefit received. Pittsburg Vitrified Paving & Building Brick Co. v. Cerebus Oil Co.,

______________________________________________________________________________

UNIT 8: SPECIAL ISSUES WITH CONSIDERATION  149
100 P. 631 (Kan. 1909); Edson v. Poppe, 124 N.W. 441 (S.D. 1910); Drake v. Bell, 55
N.Y.S. 945 (N.Y. Sup. Ct. 1899).

         In Boothe v. Fitzpatrick, 36 Vt. 681 (1864), the court held that a promise by
defendant to pay for the past keeping of a bull which had escaped from defendant's
premises and been cared for by plaintiff was valid, although there was no previous
request, because the subsequent promise obviated that objection; it being equivalent
to a previous request. On the same principle, had the promisee saved the promisor's
life or his body from grievous harm, his subsequent promise to pay for the services
rendered would have been valid. Such service would have been far more material
than caring for his bull. Any holding that saving a man from death or grievous bodily
harm is not a material benefit sufficient to uphold a subsequent promise to pay for
the service, necessarily rests on the assumption that saving life and preservation of
the body from harm have only a sentimental value. The converse of this is true. Life
and preservation of the body have material, pecuniary values, measurable in dollars
and cents. Because of this, physicians practice their profession charging for services
rendered in saving life and curing the body of its ills, and surgeons perform
operations. The same is true as to the law of negligence, authorizing the assessment
of damages in personal injury cases based upon the extent of the injuries, earnings,
and life expectancies of those injured.

         In the business of life insurance, the value of a man's life is measured in dollars
and cents according to his expectancy, the soundness of his body, and his ability to
pay premiums. The same is true as to health and accident insurance.

         It follows that if, as alleged in the complaint, appellant saved J. Greeley
McGowin from death or grievous bodily harm, and McGowin subsequently agreed to
pay him for the service rendered, it became a valid and enforceable contract.

         It is well settled that a moral obligation is a sufficient consideration to support
a subsequent promise to pay where the promisor has received a material benefit,
although there was no original duty or liability resting on the promisor. Lycoming
County v. Union County, 15 Pa. 166 (1850); Ferguson v. Harris, 17 S.E. 782 (S.C.
1893); Muir v. Kane, 104 P. 153 (Wash. 1909); Hawkes v. Saunders, 98 Eng. Rep. 1091
(K.B. 1782).

         In the case of State ex rel. Bayer v. Funk, 199 P. 592 (Ore. 1921), the court held
that a moral obligation is a sufficient consideration to support an executory promise
where the promisor has received an actual pecuniary or material benefit for which he
subsequently expressly promised to pay.

         Some authorities hold that, for a moral obligation to support a subsequent
promise to pay, there must have existed a prior legal or equitable obligation, which
for some reason had become unenforceable, but for which the promisor was still
morally bound. This rule, however, is subject to qualification in those cases where the
promisor, having received a material benefit from the promisee, is morally bound to

______________________________________________________________________________

150  CHAPTER III: CONSIDERATION
compensate him for the services rendered and in consideration of this obligation
promises to pay. In such cases the subsequent promise to pay is an affirmance or
ratification of the services rendered carrying with it the presumption that a previous
request for the service was made. McMorris v. Herndon, 18 S.C.L. (2 Bail.) 56 (1820);
Chadwick v. Knox, 31 N.H. 226 (1855); Kenan v. Holloway, 16 Ala. 53 (1849); Ross v.
Pearson, 21 Ala. 473 (1852).

         The case at bar is clearly distinguishable from that class of cases where the
consideration is a mere moral obligation or conscientious duty unconnected with
receipt by promisor of benefits of a material or pecuniary nature. Park Falls State
Bank v. Fordyce, 238 N.W. 516 (Wis. 1932). Here the promisor received a material
benefit constituting a valid consideration for his promise.

         Under the decisions above cited, McGowin's express promise to pay appellant
for the services rendered was an affirmance or ratification of what appellant had done
raising the presumption that the services had been rendered at McGowin's request.

         The cases of Shaw v. Boyd, 1 Stew. & P. 83 (Ala. 1831), and Duncan v. Hall,
9 Ala. 128 (1846), are not in conflict with the principles here announced. In those
cases the lands were owned by the United States at the time the alleged
improvements were made, for which subsequent purchasers from the government
agreed to pay. These subsequent purchasers were not the owners of the lands at the
time the improvements were made. Consequently, they could not have been made for
their benefit.

         The averments of the complaint show that in saving McGowin from death or
grievous bodily harm, appellant was crippled for life. This was part of the
consideration of the contract declared on. McGowin was benefitted. Appellant was
injured. Benefit to the promisor or injury to the promisee is a sufficient legal
consideration for the promisor's agreement to pay. Fisher v. Bartlett, 8 Greenl. 122,
22 Am. Dec. 225.

         From what has been said, we are of the opinion that the court below erred in
the ruling complained of; that is to say, in sustaining the demurrer, and for this error
the case is reversed and remanded.

         Reversed and remanded.

                                          ______________________

         Review Question 6. In affirming the court of appeals, the Alabama Supreme
Court emphasized "the distinction between a supposed moral obligation of the
promisor, based upon some refined sense of ethical duty, without material benefit to
him, and one in which such a benefit did in fact occur." If Webb had saved the life of

______________________________________________________________________________

UNIT 8: SPECIAL ISSUES WITH CONSIDERATION  151
McGowin's adult child, would that have been a "material" benefit? Or would the case
fall under Mills v. Wyman?

         Review Question 7. Mrs. Harrington saved a man from being hit by an axe
wielded by an angry third party. She lost. Mr. Webb simply stopped dropping a heavy
block on a man. He won. Can you reconcile the two cases? If so, how?

         Review Question 8. Suppose McGowin, when he saw Webb fall, instead said,
"Webb, you clumsy oaf, you almost hit me! Next time, be more careful--you're getting
blood on my shoes!" Instead of promising to pay Webb, McGowin demands that he
pay to remove the stains from the leather. Does McGowin owe anything to Webb? If
not, why is it different if he just acts like a nice guy and makes a promise?

Problem 8.1

         John is a student who is just about to graduate from medical school. During
medical school he has lived with his long-time girlfriend, Mary, a bookkeeper who has
paid most of his living expenses during the previous three-years. At a party to
celebrate his graduation, John stands up in front of Mary and a group of friends, and
thanks her for all of her support: "Without her financial support, I couldn't have even
made it through, and without her emotional support I wouldn't have been able to
succeed the way I have." To general applause, John continues, "I know that Mary has
always dreamed about going to law school, and I want to thank her for everything
she's done for me. So in front of you all, I promise that I will support her the way she
supported me, and I'll pay all of her expenses in law school just the way she paid

Problem 8.2

         Mona was hired to work at a hospital as an at-will employee. Several days after
she started work, she was called into the Human Resources office to do the necessary
paperwork. As part of that process, she signed a variety of documents. The documents
included the following:

     I agree to the grievance and arbitration provisions set forth in the

     Associates Policy Manual. I understand that I am waiving my right to a

     trial, including a jury trial, in state or federal court of the class of

______________________________________________________________________________

152          CHAPTER III: CONSIDERATION
         disputes specifically set forth in the grievance and arbitration provisions
         on pages 8-10 of the Manual.

Later that day, she was given a copy of the Manual. It provided that if an employee
claimed a violation of anti-discrimination law by the hospital,

         THEN IT IS CLEARLY INTENDED AND AGREED THAT THE SOLE
         AND EXCLUSIVE MEANS FOR THE RESOLUTION OF ALL
         DISPUTES, ISSUES, CONTROVERSIES, CLAIMS, CAUSES OF
         ACTION OR GRIEVANCES BY AN EMPLOYEE AGAINST
         NEIGHBORHOOD HEALTH CLINICS SHALL BE THROUGH THE
         PROCESS OF ARBITRATION AND PURSUANT TO THE INDIANA
         UNIFORM ARBITRATION ACT.

The opening two paragraphs of the Manual include the following language:

         [The hospital] reserves the right at any time to modify, revoke, suspend,
         terminate, or change any or all terms of this Manual, plans, policies, or
         procedures, in whole or in part, without having to consult or reach
         agreement with anyone, at any time, with or without notice.

         While [the hospital] intends to abide by the policies and procedures
         described in this Manual, it does not constitute a contract nor promise
         of any kind. Therefore, employees can be terminated at any time, with
         or without notice, and with or without cause.

Mona was subsequently fired and sued for discrimination in federal court. The
hospital moved to dismiss the suit and refer it to arbitration. Mona argued that there
was no consideration for her agreement to the new policy because she had already
started work before she signed it. What result?

Problem 8.3

         Kümmerbünd is a relatively unknown musical group, which has agreed to play
a concert at Club Now, a popular music venue, for a flat fee of $2.500. After the
contract is signed, but several weeks before the performance, Kümmerbünd is
suddenly catapulted to fame with the success of a new single, "Smell the Glove," a
cover version of an old Spinal Tap song. Kümmerbünd now has many offers to
perform at much higher prices. Kümmerbünd calls Club Now and says that it will not
perform unless the payment is increased to $10,000. Club Now at first tries to insist
on the original deal, but finally gives up and agrees to pay $10,000.

         On the night of the concert, Club Now triples the cover-charge and sells out
every seat, clearing $25,000 in profit. When Kümmerbünd asks for payment, Club
Now gives them a check for $2,500. Kümmerbünd demands the remainder. Club Now

receive the extra $7,500 in compensation? Why or why not?

Problem 8.4

         The Poplars is a beautiful and historic old mansion that is very popular with
prospective brides as a site for their weddings. Peach (a rich debutante) and Mario
are going to be married, and Peach wants to have the event at The Poplars. She wants
to be married August 1.

         The Poplars, however, is undergoing some remodeling, which would interfere
with the wedding. That work is supposed to be finished by July 25, just in time for
Peach's wedding to go off without a hitch. But the contractor, Yoshi, is running a little
behind. Yoshi repeatedly asserts that the project will be by July 25, but both the
management of The Poplars and Peach are dubious.

         To ensure that the remodeling will not disrupt her wedding, Peach (who has
no other connection to The Poplars except that she wants to have her wedding there)
on her own offers Yoshi a $10,000 bonus if all work is done on The Poplars by July
25, the date required by his contract with The Poplars. Spurred by this promise, Yoshi
lays on some extra help and finishes the work on time. Peach and Mario's wedding is
held, and is a terrific success.

         Peach, however, never pays the $10,000. Yoshi sues, demanding payment. Can
Yoshi recover the money from Peach?

Promissory Estoppel as a Consideration Substitute

FOCUS OF THIS UNIT

         If you have found the requirement of consideration to be prone to occasional
injustice, you are not alone. Courts have wrestled with the issue of avoiding injustice
in some situations where parties have an enforceable contract, except for its lack of
consideration. In this unit, you will learn about one of the most important vehicles
for enforcing such agreements, the doctrine of promissory estoppel. A proper
understanding of promissory estoppel, however, requires that we begin with a brief
diversion into its origins in the broader concept of equitable estoppel. The easiest way
to do that is to tell you a story. Grab some popcorn and listen closely.

         The Plight of Farmer Giles. Suppose back in the 15th century--a time when
property lines were rather hazy given the lack of a good recording system--Farmer
Giles, a prosperous freeholder, wants to dig a new well for his flocks. His land is
adjacent to that of a local magnate, Lord Blicester. Giles talks with Lord Blicester,
who tells him that the boundary line between the two properties lays along a
particular line of trees. Giles, relying on the lord's statement, goes ahead and digs the
well on what he thinks is his side of the property line. When it is finished, however,
Lord Blicester laughs, slaps his knee, and explains that the boundary line is actually
six rods west of the tree line, so the new well is on the lord's property. Giles is thrown
off the property and cannot use the well.

         The English courts, faced with situations like this--where one party had relied
on a false statement of fact made by another--invented a doctrine to deal with the
problem. In the law-French used in English courts in those days, it was called
"estoppel." The word comes from the Anglo-French estopper, which meant "stop up"
(as with a bottle) or "close" (as with a door). Thus, the word "estop" means, quite
literally, "shut up."

If You're Not Allowed to Prove It, Then Guess What Happens. In Farmer

Giles's case, he might set his sheep onto Lord Blicester's land to use the well. The

lord, in response, would try to assert that the well was on the lord's property and thus

______________________________________________________________________________

UNIT 9: PROMISSORY ESTOPPEL AS A CONSIDERATION SUBSTITUTE  155
Giles had no right to use it. But the judges, if they believed Giles, would, in effect
(and in prettier language), tell Lord Blicester to shut up. He would simply be
forbidden to argue that the well was on his property.1 The proceedings would go
something like this (translated very loosely from the law French of the period):

                  BLICESTER: Your honor, the well is on my land so I have a right
         to exclude Giles from using it. A man's castle is his home.

                  JUDGE: Well, yes, but you tricked him into digging it on your
         property by lying to him, didn't you?

                  BLICESTER: So what? It isn't my fault that some of the peasants
         aren't the sharpest needles in the haystack.

                  JUDGE: So . . . that was a pretty bad thing you did. You're a bad
         person to try and take advantage of your neighbor.

                  BLICESTER: "Sticks and stones will break my bones." There's no
         law against lying to your neighbor, is there?

                  JUDGE: Well, no.

                  BLICESTER: And a man has the legal right to throw people off
         his own property, doesn't he?

                  JUDGE: Yes.

                  BLICESTER: So why aren't we done? I obviously win.

                  JUDGE: Not so fast. To throw him off your land, you have to be
         able to prove that it is your land, don't you?

                  BLICESTER: Sure. But I can prove that easily, because here's my
         deed to the property that lays the boundaries out correctly. It's all
         straight from the Earl himself. That's his "X" right there on the
         signature line, and his wax seal. I have the scriveners and the surveyors
         here to testify.

                  JUDGE [pretends to cover ears]: La-la-la-laaa! I can't hear you.

          1 [If you think it unrealistic that a royal courts in the 15th century would rule for a farmer
against a nobleman, then think again. Don't erroneously assume that rich people all make up a single
class with similar interests. A concern of the Crown in many European countries during this period
was to cut away at the power of the nobility who had their own armies, their own personal courts, and
a nasty habit of rebelling every few decades. Increasing the power of rising freedmen and peasants as
against nobles served as a means to suppress the relative power of the nobles and reduce their financial
resources. Of course, the Crown was not nearly so enthusiastic about increasing the power of freedmen
and peasants against the Crown itself. The moral of the story is that you sometimes you need a
scorecard to tell who is doing what to whom and why.--Eds.]

         BLICESTER: What?

         JUDGE [covers eyes]: And I can't see your deed.

         BLICESTER: What are you talking about?

         JUDGE [uncovers his eyes]: I'm sorry, you have to prove the well
is on your land, and you can't prove it.

         BLICESTER: Yes, I can. Here's the blinking deed! It's signed by
the blooming Earl!

         JUDGE: Ah, yes. If I listened to what you said and looked at the
deed, you'd win.

         BLICESTER: That's what I'm saying!

         JUDGE: So I won't.

         BLICESTER: You won't what?

         JUDGE: Listen to you or look at your proof.

         BLICESTER: But you have to!

         JUDGE: I don't have to do anything. I'm a judge.

         BLICESTER: What?

         JUDGE: [Patiently] Here, you're not a lawyer, my lord. Let me
explain. To prove that the property is on your land, you'd have to swear
that it's your land and show me the deed. In order for me to officially
recognize your testimony and your documents, I have to enter them into
evidence before me, right?

         BLICESTER: I suppose so.

         JUDGE: Now, think hard. I'm the judge. Who decides whether
things are going to be admitted into evidence before me?

BLICESTER: Uh . . . you?

         JUDGE: Nicely done! Me. So follow this carefully. [Illustrates
points by raising fingers one by one.] One, you will prove your case if your
testimony and evidence are admitted. But two, to prove the case you
have to get your evidence admitted. Three, I am not going to admit your
evidence because you are a bad person who lied, and you shouldn't be
rewarded for your own evil acts. That would be inequitable. Four, since
you have failed to place any admissible evidence before me, you haven't
proved it's your land. And five, since you have no right to throw anyone
off property that isn't yours, Farmer Giles wins.

                  BLICESTER: That's crazy.

                  JUDGE: No, that's estoppel. When you lie and then try to take
         advantage of it in a court, we judges will use our inherent equitable
         powers to prevent ourselves from helping you do it. We do that by
         making you shut up.

                  BLICESTER: But the proof is right here!

                  JUDGE [hammers gavel]: Shut up. Bailiff, see his lordship out.
         Next case!

         Equity Says You Can't Have It Both Ways. This "equitable" power of judges
makes a good deal of sense. It's one thing for someone to cheat another. It's something
very different for courts to help someone use the law to cheat. Where one party has
lied and tries to take advantage of that lie, he or she will be estopped to contradict
the previous lie.

         Over time, however, the doctrine of estoppel--originally called "estoppel in
pais" (roughly, "estoppel by your own conduct"), became broader. There began to be
categories, such as estoppel by deed, estoppel by record, and estoppel by silence, but
all of these ultimately came to be categorized, in American law, as "equitable
estoppel." Judges began to apply the principle to situations in which the speaker did
not deliberately lie, but was merely negligent about the truth. Finally, the principle
came to be applied even in situations where the facts turned out to be untrue even
though the speaker was acting entirely in good faith. All of these forms of equitable
estoppel, however, applied only to statements of fact, not to promises.

         Reliance on What? People do, however, rely on many statements that are not
facts, including opinions, predictions, and promises. When A makes a promise to B,
B might well rely on that promise. If the promise is in the form of a contract, reliance
by the promisee is reasonable due to the promise being enforceable at law. If the
promise is made by someone you trust, reliance may be reasonable based on that trust
relationship. But what if you rely on a promise from someone you hardly know, and
it is not the kind of exchange transaction we saw in our consideration cases? Will the
law enforce a promise just because you relied on it?

         The answer, perhaps surprisingly, is yes--sometimes. Because the doctrine of
equitable estoppel requires a false statement of fact, judges developed a new doctrine
based on an unkept promise and called it "promissory estoppel." Rather than basing
the enforceability of a promise on the presence of absence of consideration, promissory
estoppel is grounded in the concept of reliance.

         Promissory Estoppel Is Something, But Not Everything. After suffering
through the study of consideration and its technicalities, many law students become
overly attached to promissory estoppel, viewing it as a solution for every injustice
that occurs based on the absence of an otherwise enforceable contract. The doctrine,

______________________________________________________________________________

158  CHAPTER III: CONSIDERATION
however, is not that broad, and also does not necessarily replicate the remedies that
are available for enforcement of a true contract. As you read the cases and materials
in this unit, watch carefully for the specific factual scenarios in which courts are
willing to allow the use of promissory estoppel.

         Read section 90 of the Restatement (Second) of Contracts before you continue

                        Cases and Materials

 RICKETTS v. SCOTHORN
  Supreme Court of Nebraska
57 Neb. 51, 77 N.W. 365 (1898)

SULLIVAN, J.

         In the district court of Lancaster county the plaintiff Katie Scothorn recovered
judgment against the defendant Andrew D. Ricketts, as executor of the last will and
testament of John C. Ricketts, deceased. The action was based upon a promissory
note, of which the following is a copy:

         May the first, 1891

         I promise to pay to Katie Scothorn on demand, $ 2,000,
         to be at 6 per cent per annum.

         J. C. RICKETTS.

         The material facts are undisputed. They are as follows: John C. Ricketts, the
maker of the note, was the grandfather of the plaintiff. Early in May--presumably
on the day the note bears date--he called on her at the store where she was working.
What transpired between them is thus described by Mr. Flodene, one of the plaintiff's
witnesses:

                  A. Well the old gentleman came in there one morning about 9
         o'clock--probably a little before or a little after, but early in the
         morning--and he unbuttoned his vest and took out a piece of paper in
         the shape of a note; that is the way it looked to me; and he says to Miss
         Scothorn, "I have fixed out something that you have not got to work any
         more." He says, "None of my grandchildren work and you don't have to."

                  Q. Where was she?

______________________________________________________________________________

UNIT 9: PROMISSORY ESTOPPEL AS A CONSIDERATION SUBSTITUTE  159
                  A. She took the piece of paper and kissed him; and kissed the old
         gentleman and commenced to cry.

         It seems Miss Scothorn immediately notified her employer of her intention to
quit work and that she did soon after abandon her occupation. The mother of the
plaintiff was a witness and testified that she had a conversation with her father, Mr.
Ricketts, shortly after the note was executed in which he informed her that he had
given the note to the plaintiff to enable her to quit work; that none of his
grandchildren worked and he did not think she ought to. For something more than a
year the plaintiff was without an occupation; but in September, 1892, with the
consent of her grandfather, and by his assistance, she secured a position as
bookkeeper with Messrs. Funke & Ogden. On June 8, 1894, Mr. Ricketts died. He had
paid one year's interest on the note, and a short time before his death expressed regret
that he had not been able to pay the balance. In the summer or fall of 1892 he stated
to his daughter, Mrs. Scothorn, that if he could sell his farm in Ohio he would pay the
note out of the proceeds. He at no time repudiated the obligation. We quite agree with
counsel for the defendant that upon this evidence there was nothing to submit to the
jury, and that a verdict should have been directed peremptorily for one of the parties.
The testimony of Flodene and Mrs. Scothorn, taken together, conclusively establishes
the fact that the note was not given in consideration of the plaintiff pursuing, or
agreeing to pursue, any particular line of conduct. There was no promise on the part
of the plaintiff to do or refrain from doing anything. Her right to the money promised
in the note was not made to depend upon an abandonment of her employment with
Mayer Bros. and future abstention from like service. Mr. Ricketts made no condition,
requirement, or request. He exacted no quid pro quo. He gave the note as a gratuity
and looked for nothing in return. So far as the evidence discloses, it was his purpose
to place the plaintiff in a position of independence where she could work or remain
idle as she might choose. The abandonment by Miss Scothorn of her position as
bookkeeper was altogether voluntary. It was not an act done in fulfillment of any
contract obligation assumed when she accepted the note. The instrument in suit being
given without any valuable consideration, [it] was nothing more than a promise to
make a gift in the future of the sum of money therein named. Ordinarily, such
promises are not enforceable even when put in the form of a promissory note.2
Kirkpatrick v. Taylor, 43 Ill. 207 (1867); Johnston v. Griest, 85 Ind. 503 (1882); Fink
v. Cox, 18 Johns. 145 (N.Y. 1820).

     2 [This particular statement about promissory notes not being enforceable absent consideration

is not fully a reflection of current law. Certain holders of promissory notes, those known as "holders in

due course," are able to enforce a promissory note (a particular form of written promise to pay money)

even if the note is not supported by consideration. See generally UNIFORM COMMERCIAL CODE § 3-305.

You can learn more about the ins and outs of promissory notes and other negotiable instruments--all

a peculiar species of contract law--in an upper level law school course sometimes known as Payment

Systems, Negotiable Instruments, or Commercial Law. - Eds.]

         But it has often been held that an action on a note given to a church, college,
or other like institution, upon the faith of which money has been expended or
obligations incurred, could not be successfully defended on the ground of a want of
consideration. Barnes v. Perine, 12 N.Y. 18 (1854); Philomath College v. Hartless, 6
Ore. 158 (1876); Thompson v. Mercer County, 40 Ill. 379 (1866); Irwin v. Lombard
University, 46 N.E. 63 (Ohio 1897). In this class of cases the note in suit is nearly
always spoken of as a gift or donation, but the decision is generally put on the ground
that the expenditure of money or assumption of liability by the donee, on the faith of
the promise, constitutes a valuable and sufficient consideration. It seems to us that
the true reason is the preclusion of the defendant, under the doctrine of estoppel, to
deny the consideration. Such seems to be the view of the matter taken by the supreme
court of Iowa in the case of Simpson Centenary College v. Tuttle, 33 N.W. 74 (Iowa
1887), where Rothrock, J., speaking for the court, said:

                  Where a note, however, is based on a promise to give for the
         support of the objects referred to, it may still be open to this defense
         [want of consideration], unless it shall appear that the donee has, prior
         to any revocation, entered into engagements or made expenditures
         based on such promise, so that he must suffer loss or injury if the note
         is not paid. This is based on the equitable principle that, after allowing
         the donee to incur obligations on the faith that the note would be paid,
         the donor would be estopped from pleading want of consideration.

When the [promisee] changes his position to his disadvantage, in reliance on the
promise, a right of action does arise. McClure v. Wilson, 43 Ill. 356 (1867)

         Under the circumstances of this case is there an equitable estoppel which ought
to preclude the defendant from alleging that the note in controversy is lacking in one
of the essential elements of a valid contract? We think there is. An estoppel in pais is
defined to be "a right arising from acts, admissions, or conduct which have induced a
change of position in accordance with the real or apparent intention of the party
against whom they are alleged." Mr. Pomeroy has formulated the following definition:

         Equitable estoppel is the effect of the voluntary conduct of a party
         whereby he is absolutely precluded, both at law and in equity, from
         asserting rights which might perhaps have otherwise existed, either of
         property, or contract, or of remedy, as against another person who in
         good faith relied upon such conduct, and has been led thereby to change
         his position for the worse, and who on his part acquires some
         corresponding right either of property, of contract, or of remedy.

REMEDIES 804 (2d ed. 1892).

UNIT 9: PROMISSORY ESTOPPEL AS A CONSIDERATION SUBSTITUTE  161
         According to the undisputed proof, as shown by the record before us, the
plaintiff was a working girl, holding a position in which she earned a salary of $10
per week. Her grandfather, desiring to put her in a position of independence, gave
her the note, accompanying it with the remark that his other grandchildren did not
work, and that she would not be obliged to work any longer. In effect he suggested
that she might abandon her employment and rely in the future upon the bounty
which he promised. He, doubtless, desired that she should give up her occupation,
but whether he did or not, it is entirely certain that he contemplated such action on
her part as a reasonable and probable consequence of his gift. Having intentionally
influenced the plaintiff to alter her position for the worse on the faith of the note being
paid when due, it would be grossly inequitable to permit the maker, or his executor,
to resist payment on the ground that the promise was given without consideration.
The petition charges the elements of an equitable estoppel, and the evidence
conclusively establishes them. If errors intervened at the trial they could not have
been prejudicial. A verdict for the defendant would be unwarranted. The judgment is
right and is

         AFFIRMED.

                                          ______________________

         Review Question 1. We have already seen that this kind of note does not
constitute a gift (because there was no delivery of the money) or a contract (because
Katie provided no consideration). So if it's not enforceable, why exactly is it
reasonable to rely on it? Does the court really mean that a promise of a gift is
enforceable if I rely on it?

         Review Question 2. Suppose Katie had a twin sister named Sadie who
received the same promise from their grandfather. Instead of giving up her job and
"working girl" social status, however, Sadie decided to keep working and put the
money from her grandfather into savings. Would Sadie be able to enforce the promise
upon which she had not actually relied? If not, why does Katie, who quit her job to
live off an inheritance, get the money while the hard-working and more cautious
Sadie does not. What social benefit, if any, is the doctrine of estoppel actually
accomplishing? Is estoppel fair? Is abstract fairness something we should care one
way or the other?

          Supreme Court of Wisconsin

   26 Wis. 2d 683, 133 N.W.2d 267 (1965)

CURRIE, C.J.

         [Joseph Hoffman owned and operated an independent bakery. He decided he
wanted to go into the larger and more complex grocery-store business. Red Owl Stores
was a grocery store company that sold franchises to operate locally-owned "Red Owl"
markets. Hoffman began negotiations with Red Owl, and was assured by Red Owl
employees that they would be able to put him in a store for an $18,000 investment.
No contract was ever signed between the parties. On Red Owl's advice, he sold his
bakery and bought another grocery store to get experience in the business. He then
sold that store so he would be eligible for a Red Owl franchise, and he then went to
work temporarily for another bakery. At this point, negotiations bogged down over
how much money Hoffman would be required to invest in the new business.
Ultimately, no contract was reached because the parties could not agree on how much
Hoffman had to invest. The jury found that Red Owl had represented to Hoffman that
$18,000 would be sufficient, and that Hoffman had relied on that representation in
selling first his bakery and then his grocery store. The jury assessed damages against
Red Owl based on a theory of promissory estoppel.]

         The instant appeal and cross appeal present these questions: (1) Whether this
court should recognize causes of action grounded on promissory estoppel as
exemplified by Restatement of Contracts § 90? (2) Do the facts in this case make out
a cause of action for promissory estoppel?

         Section 90 provides :

         A promise which the promisor should reasonably expect to induce action
         or forbearance of a definite and substantial character on the part of the
         promisee and which does induce such action or forbearance is binding if
         injustice can be avoided only by enforcement of the promise."

The Wisconsin Annotations to Restatement, Contracts, prepared under the direction
of the late Professor William H. Page and issued in 1933, stated:

         The Wisconsin cases do not seem to be in accord with this section of the
         Restatement. It is certain that no such proposition has ever been
         announced by the Wisconsin court and it is at least doubtful if it would
         be approved by the court.

Since 1933, the closest approach this court has made to adopting the rule of the
Restatement occurred in the recent case of Lazarus v. American Motors Corp., 123
N.W.2d 548 (Wis. 1963), wherein the court stated:

______________________________________________________________________________

UNIT 9: PROMISSORY ESTOPPEL AS A CONSIDERATION SUBSTITUTE  163
                  We recognize that upon different facts it would be possible for a
         seller of steel to have altered his position so as to effectuate the equitable
         considerations inherent in sec. 90 of the Restatement.

While it was not necessary to the disposition of the Lazarus case to adopt the
promissory-estoppel rule of the Restatement, we are squarely faced in the instant
case with that issue.

         Many courts of other jurisdictions have seen fit over the years to adopt the
principle of promissory estoppel, and the tendency in that direction continues. As Mr.
Justice McFaddin, speaking in behalf of the Arkansas court, well stated, the
development of the law of promissory estoppel "is an attempt by the courts to keep
remedies abreast of increased moral consciousness of honesty and fair
representations in all business dealings." Peoples National Bank of Little Rock v.
Linebarger Construction Co., 240 S.W.2d) 12 (Ark. 1951).

         Because we deem the doctrine of promissory estoppel, as stated in § 90 is one
which supplies a needed tool which courts may employ in a proper case to prevent
injustice, we endorse and adopt it.

         The record here discloses a number of promises and assurances given to
Hoffman by [Red Owl employee] Lukowitz in behalf of Red Owl upon which plaintiffs
relied and acted upon to their detriment.

         Foremost were the promises that for the sum of $18,000 Red Owl would
establish Hoffman in a store. After Hoffman had sold his grocery store and paid the
$1,000 on the Chilton lot, the $18,000 figure was changed to $24,100. Then in
November, 1961, Hoffman was assured that if the $24,100 figure were increased by
$2,000 the deal would go through. Hoffman was induced to sell his grocery store
fixtures and inventory in June, 1961, on the promise that he would be in his new store
by fall. In November, plaintiffs sold their bakery building on the urging of defendants
and on the assurance that this was the last step necessary to have the deal with Red
Owl go through.

         We determine that there was ample evidence to sustain the answers of the jury
to the questions of the verdict with respect to the promissory representations made
by Red Owl, Hoffman's reliance thereon in the exercise of ordinary care, and his
fulfilment of the conditions required of him by the terms of the negotiations had with
Red Owl.

         We conclude that injustice would result here if plaintiffs were not granted some
relief because of the failure of defendants to keep their promises which induced
plaintiffs to act to their detriment.

         Where damages are awarded in promissory estoppel instead of specifically
enforcing the promisor's promise, they should be only such as in the opinion of the

the damage problem should be avoided.

         Review Question 3. In Ricketts, Katie could fairly assume that her
grandfather would be acting with her best interests at heart and that he could
reasonably be relied upon to keep his promise. Small-businessman Hoffman, in
contrast, was dealing with another business in an arms-length negotiation where a
contract was never actually finalized. Was it really reasonable for Hoffman to rely on
a promises made by Red Owl during the parties' negotiations? Why or why not?

         Review Question 4. Suppose you are the transactional lawyer asked by Red
Owl to figure out a way to make sure that this thing never happens again--that when
Red Owl is negotiating a franchise agreement, it will not be liable until the final
agreement is signed. What would you recommend to Red Owl, especially given that
the parties in Hoffman never actually entered into a contract? To what extent can
Red Owl actually rely on the proposition that the "offeror is master of the offer"?

MAYER v. KING COLA MID-AMERICA, INC.
  Court of Appeals of Missouri, Eastern District
         660 S.W.2d 746 (Mo. Ct. App. 1983)

STEPHAN, J.

         Plaintiff Theodore Mayer is experienced in the soft drink business, and has
worked in that business since 1956. Plaintiff was employed by Pepsi Cola
International for many years, and worked abroad setting up and managing soda
franchise operations. In 1978, he returned to the United States and eventually was
employed by Double Cola as Vice President of Marketing. After Mr. Mayer resigned
from Double Cola, in January 1980, he was contacted by Linda Leary, then secretary
and later president of defendant King Cola Mid-America, Inc. She inquired as to his
interest in a position as general manager of a new soda franchise in St. Louis. On
February 2, 1980, plaintiff met with Ms. Leary. A three-year employment contract

______________________________________________________________________________

UNIT 9: PROMISSORY ESTOPPEL AS A CONSIDERATION SUBSTITUTE  165
was discussed with compensation to be set at $40,000 the first year and $45,000, and
$50,000 in each succeeding year, plus an additional commission based on sales. In
addition, defendant promised to pay plaintiff's moving expenses up to $5,000.
Plaintiff recovered judgment for these expenses as prayed for in his Count II, and
they are not an issue here. Plaintiff agreed to work for defendant, and moved from
his home in Chattanooga, Tennessee to St. Louis. He began work for defendant in
February 1980; and in accordance with the negotiations, he awaited a written
contract. No written agreement, however, was executed. The relationship between
plaintiff and defendant deteriorated in the months that followed. In late April, or
early May, Ms. Leary informed plaintiff that he was not going to be given a contract.
A few weeks later, plaintiff was asked to resign; when he refused, he was terminated.

         [Because the three-year contract was never executed, it was unenforceable
under Missouri's Statute of Frauds (a topic covered elsewhere in these materials)
Since Mayer was merely an employee at will, his breach of contract claim failed.]

         Plaintiff's alternative argument is that the doctrine of promissory estoppel
excuses compliance with the requirements of the Statute of Frauds.

         We acknowledge that the doctrine of promissory estoppel has been resorted to
in Missouri in extreme cases to avoid unjust results. To some extent the concept has
been intermixed with the doctrine of equitable estoppel or estoppel in pais. In one
such case, In re Jamison's Estate, 202 S.W.2d 879, 886 (Mo. 1947), our Supreme Court
quoted with favor from Section 90 of the Restatement of the Law of Contracts

                  A promise which the promisor should reasonably expect to induce
         action or forbearance of a definite and substantial character on the part
         of the promisee and which does induce such action or forbearance is
         binding if injustice can be avoided only by enforcement of the promise.

In two subsequent cases, Missouri Courts have used the doctrine of promissory
estoppel to permit recovery by former employees who had retired in reliance upon
promises that they would be paid lifetime pensions and the employers later stopped
making payments. Feinberg v. Pfeiffer Company, 322 S.W.2d 163 (Mo. Ct. App. 1959);
Katz v. Danny Dare, Inc., 610 S.W.2d 121 (Mo. Ct. App. 1980). In each of those cases,
plaintiff's reliance upon the promise to his detriment was held to supply the otherwise
missing element of consideration and thus to establish a contractual obligation of the
defendant to honor the promise.

         We do not find [Feinberg and Katz] persuasive on the issue before us. Plaintiff
did not have a "promise" in the contractual sense. In view of the evidence concerning
many unsettled matters to be embodied in the written contract, particularly the
potentially very substantial item of plaintiff's commission, the relationship here
would be more properly characterized as an "expectation of a promise" rather than
an accomplished fact. If the final form of the written contract tendered to plaintiff
had not been satisfactory to him in such matters, for example, as the commission or

______________________________________________________________________________

166  CHAPTER III: CONSIDERATION
covenant not to compete, he could have abandoned the relationship with impunity.
Absent mutuality, there can be no contract to enforce at law or equity. Moreover, even
if it could be said that a promise existed here, plaintiff's action in reliance thereon
constituted no detriment to him. At the time plaintiff was contacted by Ms. Leary, he
was unemployed; he did not forego continued employment. Although he moved from
Chattanooga, Tennessee to St. Louis in order to commence his duties, he recovered
judgment for his moving expenses in the court below. Finally, he was compensated at
the "contractual" rate of $40,000 per year by the defendant through the time of his
termination. Thus, adherence to the mandate of the Statute of Frauds would work no
injustice. In Katz, it is said, "There are three elements to be satisfied to invoke the
Doctrine of Promissory Estoppel. These are: (1) a promise; (2) a detrimental reliance
on such promise; and (3) injustice can be avoided only by enforcement of the promise."
Plaintiff's case is wanting in all three elements and is barred by the Statute of Frauds.

         In Morsinkhoff v. DeLuxe Laundry & Dry Cleaning Co., 344 S.W.2d 639 (Mo.
App. 1961), plaintiff entered into an oral agreement whereby plaintiff would accept a
managerial position in defendant's business at $10,000 per year. Plaintiff was
employed at the time; and, because he wanted to give his current employer one
month's notice of his resignation and take a week's vacation before commencing his
new job, it was agreed that he would start work thirty-seven days later. The evidence
was in conflict as to whether the term of the contract was to be one year or for an
indefinite period. Thereafter, plaintiff gave his notice, resigned and offered to start
his new employment with defendant. Defendant, however, refused to allow him to
start work, and plaintiff sought different employment. Plaintiff prevailed in the trial
court, recovering damages for the time he was out of work, bonus lost by reason of his
resignation, and expenses incurred in obtaining new employment.

         In reversing, the court held that, if the contract was for an indefinite period, it
was terminable at will and the employer incurred no liability for not allowing the
employee to start.

         The judgment is affirmed.

                                          ______________________

         Review Question 5. The Mayer court notes that there were many details still
to be settled about the contract, and suggests that if Mayer had disliked the final
proffered contract, he could have "abandoned the relationship with impunity." Wasn't
that also true of the plaintiff in Hoffman v. Red Owl Stores? Are the facts of these two
cases distinguishable or are the two courts acting inconsistently in their application
of promissory estoppel doctrine?

              CONRAD v. FIELDS
         Court of Appeals of Minnesota
     2007 Minn. App. Unpub. LEXIS 744

         Appellant Walter R. Fields and respondent Marjorie Conrad met and became
friends when they were neighbors in an apartment complex in the early 1990's.
Appellant started his own business and became a financially successful businessman.
Appellant built a $1.2 million house in the Kenwood neighborhood in Minneapolis
and leased a Bentley automobile for more than $50,000 a year. Appellant is a
philanthropic individual who has sometimes paid education costs for others.

         In the fall of 2000, appellant suggested that respondent attend law school, and
he offered to pay for her education. Respondent, who had recently paid off an $11,000
medical bill and still owed about $5,000 for undergraduate student loans, did not feel
capable of paying for law school on her own. Appellant promised that he would pay
tuition and other expenses associated with law school as they became due. Appellant
quit her job at Qwest, where she had been earning $45,000 per year, to attend law
school. Appellant admitted at trial that before respondent enrolled in law school, he
agreed to pay her tuition.

         Respondent testified that she enrolled in law school in the summer of 2001 as
a result of appellant's "inducement and assurance to pay for [her] education."
Appellant made two tuition payments, each in the amount of $1,949.75, in August
and October 2001, but he stopped payment on the check for the second payment. At
some point, appellant told respondent that his assets had been frozen due to an
Internal Revenue Service audit and that payment of her education expenses would
be delayed until he got the matter straightened out. In May 2004, appellant and
respondent exchanged e-mail messages about respondent's difficulties in managing
the debts that she had incurred for law school. In response to one of respondent's
messages, appellant wrote, "to be clear and in writing, when you graduate law school
and pas[s] your bar exam, I will pay your tuition." Later, appellant told respondent
that he would not pay her expenses, and he threatened to get a restraining order
against her if she continued attempting to communicate with him.

         Respondent brought suit against appellant, alleging that in reliance on
appellant's promise to pay her education expenses, she gave up the opportunity to
earn income through full-time employment and enrolled in law school. The case was
tried to the court, which awarded respondent damages in the amount of $87,314.63
under the doctrine of promissory estoppel. The district court denied appellant's
motion for a new trial or amended findings. This appeal followed.

         Appellant argues that respondent did not plead or prove the elements of
promissory estoppel. Minnesota is a notice-pleading state that does not require

______________________________________________________________________________

168  CHAPTER III: CONSIDERATION
absolute specificity in pleading and, instead, requires only information sufficient to
fairly notify the opposing party of the claim against it.

         Paragraph 12 of respondent's complaint states, "That as a direct and
approximate result of the negligent conduct and breach of contract conduct of
[appellant], [respondent] has been damaged . . . . ." But the complaint also states:

                  4. That in 2000, based on the assurance and inducement of
         [appellant] to pay for [respondent's] legal education, [respondent] made
         the decision to enroll in law school at Hamline University School of Law
         (Hamline) in St. Paul, Minnesota which she did in 2001.

                  5. That but for the inducement and assurance of [appellant] to
         pay for [respondent's] legal education, [respondent] would not have
         enrolled in law school. [Appellant] was aware of this fact.

Paragraphs four and five of the complaint are sufficient to put appellant on notice of
the promissory-estoppel claim.3

         At a pretrial deposition, respondent testified that negligence and breach of
contract were the only two causes of action that she was pleading. Because
promissory estoppel is described as a contract implied at law, respondent's deposition
testimony can be interpreted to include a promissory-estoppel claim.

         In its legal analysis, the district court stated:

                  The Court finds credible [respondent's] testimony that [appellant]
         encouraged her to go to law school, knowing that she would not be able
         to pay for it on her own. He knew that she was short on money, having
         helped her pay for food and other necessities. He knew that she was
         working at Qwest and would need to quit her job to go to law school. He
         offered to pay for the cost of her going to law school, knowing that she
         had debts from her undergraduate tuition. He made a payment on her
         law school tuition after she enrolled. [Respondent] knew that [appellant]
         was a wealthy philanthropist, and that he had offered to pay for the
         education of strangers he had met in chance encounters. She knew that
         he had the wealth to pay for her law school education. She knew that []
         he was established in society, older than she, not married, without
         children, an owner of a successful company, an owner of an expensive
         home, and a lessor of an expensive car. Moreover, [appellant] was a
         friend who had performed many kindnesses for her already, and she
         trusted him. [Appellant's] promise in fact induced [respondent] to quit

of a vaguely stated claim.--Eds.]

         her job at Qwest and enroll in law school, which she had not otherwise
         planned to do. . . .

         . . . [T]he circumstances support a finding that it would be unjust not to
         enforce the promise. Upon reliance on [appellant's] promise,
         [respondent] quit her job. She attended law school despite a serious
         health condition that might otherwise have deterred her from going.

These findings are sufficient to show that respondent proved the elements of
promissory estoppel.

         Appellant argues that because he advised respondent shortly after she enrolled
in law school that he would not be paying her law-school expenses as they came due,
respondent could not have reasonably relied on his promise to pay her expenses to
her detriment after he repudiated the promise. Appellant contends that the only
injustice that resulted from his promise involved the original $5,000 in expenses that
respondent incurred to enter law school. But appellant's statement that he would not
pay the expenses as they came due did not make respondent's reliance unreasonable
because appellant also told respondent that his financial problems were temporary
and that he would pay her tuition when she graduated and passed the bar exam. This
statement made it reasonable for respondent to continue to rely on appellant's
promise that he would pay her expenses.

         Appellant argues that because respondent received a valuable law degree, she
did not suffer any real detriment by relying on his promise. But receiving a law degree
was the expected and intended consequence of appellant's promise, and the essence
of appellant's promise was that respondent would receive the law degree without the
debt associated with attending law school. Although respondent benefitted from
attending law school, the debt that she incurred in reliance on appellant's promise is
a detriment to her.

                                          ______________________

         Review Question 6. The principal purpose of "reliance" damages (a topic
addressed in this book at much greater length in Chapter VIII) is to put the relying
promisee back in her pre-contractual position by restoring to her what she has lost.
The court says that Fields promised Conrad "a law degree without the debt." But
what she was promised and what she has lost in reliance on that promise are two
different things. Doesn't getting the money she spent and getting a law degree
actually put her in a better position than she was before the promise was made? To
what extent, in the language of section 90 of the Second Restatement, can injustice
actually be avoided only by enforcement of the promise?

         Drennan is a construction contractor who is bidding on a new project. Part of
the project involves paving. A subcontractor, Star, submits a bid to do the paving part
of the project for $500,000. Drennan does not require that Star certify that its bid is
irrevocable, nor does Drennan pay Star for an option. Drennan uses Star's bid in
putting together its own $10 million primary contract bid on the project. Drennan
subsequently is awarded the prime contract on the project. Before it can contact Star,
however, Star calls to say that it cannot do the job at the price it bid. Drennan
demands that it perform; Star refuses. Drennan immediately seeks other contractors,
but cannot find anyone who will do the job for less than $700,000. Drennan hires the
new contractor, pays $700,000, and then sues Star, arguing that Star is liable for
$200,000 in damages because Drennan relied on Star's original bid. What are the
legal arguments for each party in this situation?

         Much to my mortification, I heard, that brother Henry was dead. I know
         that your situation is one of grief, and difficulty. You had a bad chance
         before, but a great deal worse now. If you will come down and see me, I
         will let you have a place to raise your family, and I have more open land
         than I can tend; and on the account of your situation, and that of your
         family, I feel like I want you and the children to do well.

Antillico, at some expense to herself, packs up her kids in her 1987 Ford Econoline
van and drives down. Isaac greets her joyfully and lets her move into an empty house
on his property. Six years later, relations between Isaac and Antillico have become
strained and Isaac demands that she move out. Antillico sues, claiming that she
relied on Isaac's promise in moving, and arguing that she should be entitled to
damages for her loss. What result under the cases and materials in this unit? How

        ALTERNATIVE REGIMES OF CONTRACT LAW

         Common Law is the Beginning of American Contract Law, not the End. This
course focuses on the common law of contracts because that law is a fundamental
foundation for many advanced substantive areas of law. The common law is also the
default law of contracts that will apply where it has not been displaced by other law.
Nearly every aspect of contract law has, however, been augmented to a greater or
lesser degree by statutes relating to particular kinds of contracts. Where such
statutes apply, the common law is changed. Real estate contracts, insurance
contracts, employment contracts, professional services contracts, construction
contracts, and consumer contracts are all are rooted in the common law of contracts,
but all also have distinctive statutory schemes. After the first year of law school, you
will have the opportunity to study some of these specialized areas

         Specialized regimes of contract law can vary greatly from state to state, but
two regimes are both important and ubiquitous enough that they are universally
recognized as an important part of American contract law: (1) the Uniform
Commercial Code--or as most every lawyer also knows it, the "UCC."1 and (2) the
United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods--most
frequently referred to as the "CISG." The CISG is an international treaty to which
the United States is a party. Having been ratified by the United States Senate, the
CISG is binding federal law under the Constitution, and you can read its provisions
much as you read a statute. In a global economy, both of these legal structures are
extremely important, impacting trade and commerce locally, nationally, and
internationally. The three units in this section explore the ways in which the UCC
and the CISG vary the common law rules of contract.

     1 [The acronym is pronounced "YOU-SEE-SEE," and not "UCK." Many law students over the

years have, however, decided the latter is more descriptive of their personal interactions with the

code. We hope you won't necessarily fall into that category. - Eds.]

                                           FOCUS OF THIS UNIT

         Welcome to the Uniform Commercial Code. The Uniform Commercial Code
has major substantive divisions dealing with different topics, each one of which is
known as an "article." Every article is then divided into "sections," which are like code
sections you have seen in other contexts. Article 1 ("General Provisions") contains
principles and definitions that apply to the rest of the code, so it can come up in any
study of the UCC, including in a basic course on contracts. Other UCC articles
frequently arise in upper level law school courses, perhaps most prominently Article
3 ("Negotiable Instruments"), Article 4 ("Bank Deposits and Collections"), and Article
9 ("Secured Transactions"). The UCC as a whole was largely developed in the 1940s
and 1950s as a joint effort by the American Law Institute (whom you may already
recognize as the drafters of all the Restatements) and the National Conference of
Commissioners on Uniform State Laws (now better known as the "Uniform Law
Commission"), both being groups comprised of law professors and practicing lawyers.
Most state enactments of the UCC first occurred in the mid-to-late 1960s.

         Welcome to UCC Article 2 on Sales of Goods. The part of the code that we
(and by "we," of course, we actually mean "you") will study most for this course is
Article 2, which governs sales of "goods." Article 2 has been adopted in every
American jurisdiction except Louisiana,1 and it was designed with the goal that
people and companies selling products nationally should not have to worry about the
specific contract law of every state. Like many pieces of legislation, Article 2 reflects
a number of political compromises, balancing the interests of big businesses, small
businesses, and consumers, and of both buyers and sellers. It was also largely written
by law professors, who are (you may have already recognized) are not always noted
for their clarity in communication. As a result, it is not always a model of clarity or

Commercial Code, but not UCC Article 2, which is the principal subject of this unit. - Eds.]

consistency. Some provisions have proved extremely successful in practice, others less
so. In particular, many have criticized the Code as not particularly responsive to
consumer problems, and as a result nearly every state has specific consumer-
protection laws that supplement both the Code and the common law of contracts.

         In many areas, the rules of Article 2 are similar to those of the common law,
but in a number of important contact doctrines the rules are significantly different.
These differing rules, as you can see from the cases below, can cause different results
in cases than if we applied the common law.

         One of the most important takeaways from this unit should be an
understanding of which contracts are governed by Article 2. The cases below also
address offer, acceptance, and consideration in the context of contracts for the sale of
goods. In subsequent units, we will occasionally see how differences between the
common law and the UCC play out in other areas.

         The UCC is State Law, not Federal Law. Some law students tragically assume
that because the Uniform Commercial Code is the law of nearly all states, it is federal
law. That assumption is profoundly wrong. The Uniform Commercial Code is state
law that must be enacted by state legislatures to be effective. State legislatures
occasionally enact UCC sections that vary in some way from the "official" UCC text
we will consider here. The state supreme court in each state has the authority to
make the definitive interpretation of an enacted UCC section in that state. Thus, if
the Texas Supreme Court interprets a code provision one way, but the Missouri
Supreme Court later interprets the identical provision in a way that conflicts with
the Texas case, both interpretations are binding as the law of each court's home state.
If you ask us, we think a more accurate name for the Uniform Commercial Code would
be the "Mostly-but-not-entirely `uniform' Commercial Code." But nobody asked us.

         Much Common Law Coexists with the UCC. Although we will tend to focus on
areas where UCC Article 2 changes the result under the common law, you should
understand that the UCC explicitly endorses the use of the common law (and other
law) in areas that it does not address. Take a moment to read UCC § 1-103(b) for the
definitive statement of this principle. In situations that it does not address, UCC
Article 2 assumes the existence of--and applicability of--the common law of
contracts.

         What Is an "Official Comment," Anyway? In many UCC cases, courts will
refer to or quote from the official comments to the UCC, which are paragraphs--
sometimes numbered--that follow each section of the code. You can think of these
comments as a sort of legislative history. The drafters of the code wanted to explain
what the origin or intent was for specific code sections, and they put those
explanations into a comment rather than in the text of the statute. Like other
legislative history, the official comments are not "law" and courts are not bound to
follow them. While the official comments are merely persuasive authority, you should

______________________________________________________________________________

176  CHAPTER IV: ALTERNATIVE REGIMES
be aware that they are highly persuasive authority that courts will frequently defer
to absent a good reason to do otherwise.

         Some people believe--not without reason--that the comments to the UCC are
occasionally used to further policies or goals that did not have enough support to
make it into the statutory text. As a practicing attorney, you should be prepared to
use the official comments when they support your position, but you should also be
prepared to argue against them when they do not. The one thing an attorney should
not do with the official comments is ignore them.

         Official Code Numbering vs. State Code Numbering. Here is one more thing
you should know about the UCC as it relates to legal research: Each jurisdiction
codifies its provisions differently because each state uses its own numbering system
for state statutes. Fortunately, most states incorporate the UCC numbering system
into their own in some recognizable way. For example, UCC § 2-105 becomes Indiana
Code § 26-1-2-105, Tennessee Code § 47-2-105, and 13 Pennsylvania Statutes § 2105.
Beware that some states have murkier numbering, however. Practice tip: If you find
yourself litigating an Article 2 case, be sure to find the version in your state's code.

         In this unit and elsewhere, we have edited citations to the Uniform
Commercial Code in the cases so that they will refer you to the "Official" version of
the UCC that you can find in many law school statutory supplements (or in online
databases, such as the free-to-access materials of the Legal Information Institute:
https://www.law.cornell.edu/ucc). You will generally find it helpful to see the statute
separately, even where courts provide you with a lengthy quotation. Doing so will
enable you to see the larger context in which particular sections of the code operate.

     TOUSLEY-BIXLER CONSTRUCTION CO.
          v. COLGATE ENTERPRISES, INC.
                  Court of Appeals of Indiana
            429 N.E.2d 979 (Ind. Ct. App. 1982)

BUCHANAN, J.

         Tousley-Bixler, as contractor of a sanitation project for the City of Indianapolis,
needed clay soil to construct a levee. Colgate's property was located near the
construction site, so Fred Lind of Tousley-Bixler contacted Colgate about the
possibility of purchasing clay. Subsequent tests on Colgate's property revealed that
before reaching the approximately four to eight feet of clay beneath the surface,
Tousley-Bixler would have to remove about four feet of top soil.

         On April 2, 1976, Lind delivered a purchase order to Colgate for 50,000 cubic
feet of clay. Discussions then ensued between Tousley-Bixler and Colgate regarding
disposal of brush. The purchase order as signed and returned contained an additional
statement typed in by Colgate that any material used in 1976 was to be paid for on
or before January 10, 1977.

         On receipt of the purchase order with this additional provision typed in,
Tousley-Bixler mailed an addendum to cancel the order because of failure to reach
agreement on brush removal. Colgate responded by letter in June 1976 that it did not
realize there was a problem as to brush removal and for Tousley-Bixler to proceed as
originally agreed. Nevertheless, Tousley-Bixler failed to remove any clay.

         In an action brought by Colgate for breach of the agreement, the trial court
instructed the jury under both the common law and Indiana's version of the Uniform
Commercial Code (UCC). The jury found for Colgate, and Tousley-Bixler appeals.

         Did the trial court commit reversible error in instructing the jury under the
provisions of the UCC?

         According to Tousley-Bixler, the sale of clay soil is not a sale of goods within
the meaning of Ind. Code subsection 2-107(1) or 2-107(2), because the clay soil is to
be removed by the buyer, not the seller, and because such soil is part of the realty.

         Colgate counters that the UCC is a codification of the common law, so no error
or prejudice could result from the giving of instructions under both the common law
and the UCC. In any event, the UCC is applicable.

         Buried somewhere in that mountain of words known as the UCC is the answer
as to whether clay soil lying four feet below the surface is "goods."

         Tousley-Bixler is particularly disturbed because the trial court gave an
instruction under a provision of 2-206 (relating to contract formation) which in effect

______________________________________________________________________________

178  CHAPTER IV: ALTERNATIVE REGIMES
treated the sale of clay as a transaction "in goods." "Goods" are defined in UCC § 2-
105 as

         all things (including specially manufactured goods) which are movable
         at the time of identification to the contract for sale other than the money
         in which the price is to be paid, investment securities (Article 8) and
         things in action. "Goods" also includes the unborn young of animals and
         growing crops and other identified things attached to realty as described
         in the section on goods to be severed from realty (section 2-107).

The term "movable" is somewhat elusive in that virtually anything is movable, even
Blackacre, "in the sense that much of the dirt, gravel, water, and minerals that
comprise the `things' called Blackacre can be transported to another location."
ROBERT J. NORDSTROM, HANDBOOK OF THE LAW OF SALES § 22, at 45 (1970). However,
movable is modified by "at the time of identification," and there is further reference
to growing crops which can be severed. Considered as a whole, "the words of section
2-105 lose much of their obscurity. The drafters were concerned with items of tangible
property which were portable at the time they were set aside for their transfer, items
which normally flow in commerce." Id. at 46.2

         Indicative of the variety of items which may be classified as goods within the
meaning of section 2-105 are hoghouses, electricity, mobile homes, growing crops,
tomato seeds, and modular homes. See Thompson Farms, Inc. v. Corno Feed Products,
366 N.E.2d 3 (Ind. Ct. App. 1977); Helvey v. Wabash County REMC, 176, 278 N.E.2d
608 (Ind. Ct. App. 1972); Jones v. Abriani, 350 N.E.2d 635 (Ind. Ct. App. 1976);
Sebasty v. Perschke, 404 N.E.2d 1200 (Ind. Ct. App. 1980); Stumler v. Ferry-Morse
Seed Co., 644 F.2d 667 (7th Cir. 1981); Stephenson v. Frazier, 399 N.E.2d 794 (Ind.
Ct. App. 1980). None of these seem similar to the sale of several feet of clay soil lying
four feet beneath the surface of the earth.

         There is another section which should be read with § 2-105, to-wit, § 2-107.
Section 2-107 provides in part:

         (1) A contract for the sale of timber, minerals or the like or a structure
         or its materials to be removed from realty is a contract for the sale of
         goods within this Article if they are to be severed by the seller but until
         severance a purported present sale thereof which is not effective as a
         transfer of an interest in land is effective only as a contract to sell.

         (2) A contract for the sale apart from the land of growing crops or other
         things attached to realty and capable of severance without material
         harm thereto but not described in subsection (1) is a contract for the sale

2 [By the Court:] The comment to 2-105, explains that growing crops are goods because "they are
frequently intended for sale."

______________________________________________________________________________

UNIT 10: UCC SCOPE AND FORMATION  179
         of goods within this Article whether the subject matter is to be severed
         by the buyer or by the seller even though it forms part of the realty at
         the time of contracting, and the parties can by identification effect a
         present sale before severance.

Comment 1 to § 2-107(1) emphasizes that 2-107(1) "applies only if the timber,
minerals or structures `are to be severed by the seller.' If the buyer is to sever, such
transactions are considered contracts affecting land." It is to be remembered that
buyer Tousley-Bixler was to remove the clay from seller Colgate's property.

         Thus, the UCC considers the sale of some items affixed to real estate as a sale
of goods if they are to be severed by the seller, i.e., "timber, minerals or the like or a
structure or its materials." If the seller is to sever the items from the real estate, they
are treated as goods because they would more likely be intended for sale after
severance. The protections reserved for the sale of real estate would not be necessary.

         On the other hand, if the buyer is to sever the items, there is a good reason for
not applying the UCC to the transaction: "A lease of land ought not be converted into
a contract for the sale of goods even though the lessee in possession is given the
privilege of removing a part of the realty--such as its gravel, coal or oil. Lawyers have
too long thought of such an arrangement as a lease with all the intended duties of
recording determined under real estate statutes." R. NORDSTROM, supra, at 48.
Williston makes much the same point in his treatise on sales:

                  Common law and sales law have not treated goods and realty to
         be one and the same. Real estate has been the subject matter of its own
         well developed law, including among other things, recording statutes,
         title statutes and other related real property law all dependent upon the
         locus of the land. Sales law, however, hinges on commercial fluidity
         which has in turn necessitated a modification of the law to promote
         uniformity and to facilitate the expanding and transient market for
         goods.

ALPHONSE M. SQUILLANTI & JOHN R. FONSECA, 1 WILLISTON ON SALES § 6-6, at 170
(4th ed. 1973).

         The distinction between personalty and realty is important. In view of the
express language of § 2-107, we fail to see how Colgate's intended sale of dirt was a
sale of goods. It is undisputed that seller Colgate was not to sever the goods for buyer
Tousley-Bixler. So we conclude that the sale of several feet of clay soil, which could
only be reached by removing several feet of top soil, was a sale of "mineral or the like."
See § 2-107(1).

         For over 100 years Indiana law has treated such sales as transactions affecting
realty. See Owens v. Lewis, 46 Ind. 488 (1874) (growing trees); Armstrong v. Lawson,
73 Ind. 498 (1881) (growing trees); Callihan v. Bander, 73 N.E.2d 360 (Ind. Ct. App.

______________________________________________________________________________

180  CHAPTER IV: ALTERNATIVE REGIMES
1947) (oil and gas lease); Creasey v. Pyramid Coal Corp., 61 N.E.2d 477 (Ind. Ct. App.
1945) (conveyance of coal, clay, and minerals).

         Colgate cites us to no precedent leading to a contrary conclusion, whereas
Tousley-Bixler directs us to DeLuca v. C. W. Blakeslee & Sons, Inc., 391 A.2d 170
(Conn. 1978). In DeLuca the Supreme Court of Connecticut pointed out that § 2-
107(1) "made a significant distinction between instances where the subject of the
profit a prendre was to be severed from the realty by the seller rather than the buyer."
Because the agreement in that case "provided that the buyer of fill dirt should remove
it from the plaintiff's land . . . , the [trial] court properly concluded to be enforceable
it was necessary that the alleged agreement conform to the Statute of Frauds
affecting the transfer of an interest in land."

         [We conclude] that the sale was not a sale of goods within the meaning of the
UCC. So the trial court should not have given instructions based on the UCC which
conflicted with the common law.

         Although it was error for the trial court to give UCC instructions conflicting
with the common law and which were not supported by the evidence, to obtain
reversal Tousley-Bixler has the burden of proving prejudicial error. Prejudice is not
presumed when erroneous instructions are given over objection if the jury has
unquestionably reached the right result, but we cannot say that the jury
unquestionably reached the right result in finding for Colgate.

         The jury was given conflicting instructions regarding contract formation. [The
court notes that under the common law Colgate's signing of the purchase order with
a new term typed in would be a counter-offer, and therefore no contract would be
formed. Under the UCC, it would be an "acceptance" with "additional or different"
terms, which would mean that a contract was formed. Thus the issue of the contract's
existence depended on which law applied.]

         The evidence could support a jury finding under either instruction with
differing results. There is no way of knowing if the jury reached the right result under
these circumstances. So Tousley-Bixler was prejudiced by the giving of erroneous
instructions based on the UCC and is entitled to a new trial with proper instructions.

         Reversed and remanded for a new trial.

______________________

         Review Question 1. If Colgate had previously dug up and bagged the clay for
sale itself, the clay would be "goods" governed by the UCC, but where Tousley-Bixler
is responsible for strip-mining it out, the clay is "mineral" governed by the common
law of contracts. Does that distinction really make sense? As you read Tousley-Bixler
Construction, what possible policy reasons can you discern for treating sales of goods

______________________________________________________________________________

UNIT 10: UCC SCOPE AND FORMATION  181
differently from other contracts? For that matter, why would we sometimes treat real
estate differently from other contracts?

         Review Question 2. Notice that the determination of whether the agreement
in Tousley-Bixler Construction was for a sale of goods or not affected something
fundamental: the certainty (or not) of whether a contract between the parties even
existed. The contract formation rules of UCC differ substantially from the common
law. We have already seen how the doctrines of consideration and promissory
estoppel can cause a great deal of uncertainty for the legal status of parties to an
agreement. At this point in the course, how much value do you think the law of
contracts should place on certainty as opposed to fairness when those two values come
into conflict, as they inevitably do?

                                          ______________________

         Statutory Note. In connection with the Computer Network case that follows,
read UCC §§ 1-201(b)(3) (definition of "agreement"), 1-201(b)(12) (definition of

running list for yourself on differences between the UCC and the common law on
contracts on how and when contracts are formed. You will find that a grasp of these
differences will be quite useful for the remainder of the course.

         In March 1984, two units were delivered to Purcell and paid for promptly. Over
the next few months, seven other units were delivered and paid for. The last of the

______________________________________________________________________________

UNIT 10: UCC SCOPE AND FORMATION                                                      183
nine units was delivered and paid for in December, 1984. No further deliveries were
made and no further units were paid for.

         Sometime after February 1985, after the expiration of the "agreement," Brown
telephoned Chapman concerning the delivery of the remaining twelve computers and
"he said that we had no such agreement, so we sent him a copy of the agreement
[letter], showing him."

         On September 27, 1985, Computer Network filed its petition for damages for
breach of contract. It alleged that the parties "entered into a written contract
regarding the sale of twenty-one (21) IBM Personal Computers" and that Purcell
"breached the Agreement by not purchasing the additional twelve (12) units."
Computer prayed for $25,515.60 in damages.

         Purcell answered denying that it had entered into a contract to purchase the
twenty-one computers, and asserted that "there never was a contract, as indicated by
the letter," but "there had only been conversations regarding the possible
transaction."

         On January 30, 1987, the cause was heard by the trial court on a change of
venue. At the hearing, Brown testified as to the facts stated above and testified that
the letter was the "final and complete expression of [the] agreement." He testified
that Purcell did not request the additional twelve units, that Computer Network was
making a profit of $2,008.30 per unit and that it lost profits of $24,099.60.

         [At trial, the parties testified about their conversations and understandings,
but they did not agree. Basically, Purcell's witnesses stated that Purcell had never
agreed to buy twenty-one computers.]

         Following the hearing, and on March 30, 1987, the trial court found the issues
in favor of Computer Network and entered judgment for $24,099.60 plus interest.

         Purcell appealed. On appeal, Purcell contends that [the parties did not enter
into a legally binding "contract"].

         A resolution of the issues requires adherence to the time-tested principles of
common law and the various provisions of Missouri's Uniform Commercial Code
relating to the sale of goods. UCC §§2-101 to 2-725 (1986). We deal here with the sale
of "goods" as defined in § 2-105(1). We also deal with various principles of the common
law of contracts which have not been displaced by the Code. § 1-103.

         Under the Uniform Commercial Code, "a contract for the sale of goods may be
made in any manner sufficient to show agreement, including conduct by both parties
which recognizes the existence of such a contract." UCC § 2-204(1). The Code defines
"contract" as the "total legal obligation which results from the parties' agreement as
affected by the code and any other applicable rules of law." [§ 1-201(b)(12)]. An
"agreement" "means the bargain of the parties in fact as found in their language or
by implication from the circumstances including course of dealing or usage of trade

______________________________________________________________________________

184  CHAPTER IV: ALTERNATIVE REGIMES
or course of performance...." [§ 1-201(b)(3)]. The provisions of the Code are to be
liberally construed. Article Two expands the traditional concept of a contract and
imposes new and wider ranges of obligation. J. WHITE AND R. SUMMERS, UNIFORM
COMMERCIAL CODE, § 1-1 at 23-24 (1980). In keeping with this liberal trend, the
Official Comment to the Code, Section 2-204, states that if the parties intend to enter
into a binding agreement and an appropriate remedy may be fashioned, a contract
for sale does not fail despite missing terms, if there is any reasonably certain basis
for granting a remedy. The Code, however, will not imply an agreement if the parties
did not reach or intend one. Section 2-204 requires an agreement between the
negotiating parties. But the Code focuses upon "mutuality of assent as manifested by
the conduct of the parties" in place of the 19th century's subjective test of intent.

         While Section 2-204 provides that a contract for the sale of goods may be made
in any manner sufficient to show agreement, including conduct by both parties which
recognizes the existence of such a contract, this section continues the common-law
principle that the intent of the parties to make a contract must be manifested. The
basic philosophy of this article is simple.

Practical business people cannot be expected to govern their actions with
reference to nice legal formalisms. Thus, when there is basic agreement,
. . . failure to articulate that agreement in the precise language of a
lawyer with every difficulty and contingency considered and resolved,
will not prevent formation of a contract."

151, 363 N.E.2d 701 (1977) (quoted in 2 R. ANDERSON, UNIFORM COMMERCIAL CODE,
§ 2-204:4 at 201 (1982)).

         The core issue here, under the evidence, is whether the parties intended a
legally binding contract to arise from the February 23, letter. If the parties intended
no binding agreement or contract, the rules of construction and interpretation will
not establish one. If no intent is found, the inquiry is put to an end. If the expressions
in the agreement are clear, the court determines the intent from a reading of the
writing. If the intent is not clearly expressed, then surrounding circumstances may
be considered--the subsequent actions of the parties and the practical construction
of the contract. But the question whether there is an "intent to contract" is a question
of fact to be determined by the trier of fact. Under UCC § 2-204(1), in order to
determine whether there is an enforceable contract, the court must find that the
circumstances, including conduct, are sufficient to show agreement. The formation of
a contract does not require that all terms be settled. One or more of the terms may
be left open and the agreement will not fail for indefiniteness; but the parties must
intend to make a contract. If the parties act in a way which recognizes the existence
of a contract, one may exist even though the writing does not otherwise establish a
contract. "Sellers usually do not ship and buyers do not receive goods unless they

think they have struck a deal." Quaker State Mushroom v. Dominick's Finer Foods,
635 F. Supp. 1281, 1285 (N.D. Ill.1986).

         Courts do not favor the destruction of agreements, but will, if feasible, construe
agreements so as to carry into effect the reasonable intention of the parties.

         The main thrust of the appellant's contention is that the trial court failed to
consider that there was no "mutual assent" and that Harry Chapman did not "intend"
to enter into a binding agreement for the purchase of twenty-one computers. But the
trial court held otherwise, and recognized that there was mutual assent.

         While a few cases under § 2-204 of the UCC speak in terms of "meeting of the
minds," the actual holdings are consistent with the theory of objective manifestation
of assent. An actual mental reservation does not prevent a contract from being formed
if there is a manifestation of assent and nothing in Section 2-204 changes this
approach. 2 W. HAWKLAND, UCC SERIES, § 2-204:02 at 64 (1982); Bradford v. Plains
Cotton Cooperative Assn., 539 F.2d 1249, 1256 (10th Cir.1976).

         Tested by these principles, there was, under the circumstances here, "mutual
assent" to purchase twenty-one computers. Regardless of Chapman's intent to
purchase a lesser number, the letter of February 23 explicitly contained that number.
Although the trial court admitted testimony of Chapman that Purcell did not intend
to purchase twenty-one computers, because it had only 15 stores, the trial court found
mutual assent and that the contract called for the sale of twenty-one computers.
Chapman acknowledged that he signed the letter containing that number;
presumably he must have read the letter when it was presented to him. Having
signed the letter, he is charged with knowledge of its contents. See 2 ANDERSON,
UNIFORM COMMERCIAL CODE, § 2-204:20; 67 AM. JUR. 2D, Sales, § 226 at 449; Crim v.
Crim, 162 Mo. 544, 63 S.W. 489, 491 (1901); 17 AM. JUR. 2D, Contracts, § 149 (1964).
He admitted he signed the letter; he admitted that he could have changed the letter
if he desired to do so but did not. A mere change could have effected a lesser number.

         Appellant next contends that the February 23 letter was ambiguous and
incomplete so that no contract was made. This contention was rejected by the trial
court and we affirm that finding.

         Under the UCC, the ultimate test of definiteness with respect to the sale of
goods is that there be a reasonably certain basis for giving an appropriate remedy.
§ 2-204 Official Comment. The fact that a contract for the sale of goods may be open
does not void the contract if it can be ascertained from the express or implied
provisions.

         Section 2-204(3) requires only that, even though one or more of the terms are
left open, a contract does not fail if the parties have intended to make a contract and
there is a reasonably certain basis for giving an appropriate remedy. See 67 AM. JUR.
2D, Sales, §§ 117, 118 (1985); Official Comment.

186  CHAPTER IV: ALTERNATIVE REGIMES
         Recently we had occasion to consider the definiteness of a price term in an
agreement in Sedmak v. Charlie's Chevrolet, Inc., 622 S.W.2d at 694. There we said
that "[f]ailure to specify the selling price in dollars and cents did not render the
contract void or voidable . . . . As long as the parties agreed to a method by which the
price was to be determined and as long as the price could be ascertained at the time
of performance, the price requirement for a valid and enforceable contract was
satisfied." Id. at 697 (holding also that the "quantity" term is a "key provision without
which the court cannot reconstruct the contract fairly.").

         In Allied Disposal v. Bob's Home Service, 595 S.W.2d 417 (Mo. App. 1980), we
held that an "agreement to agree" on price does not preclude the validity of a contract.
While we recognized the general rule that an agreement must fix a price or provide a
method to ascertain the price in order to form an enforceable contract, we also
recognized that where there is no statement at all as to price and the contract has
been executed, the law implies a standard of reasonableness. We noted the fact that
earlier cases in Missouri on vagueness and indefiniteness have been largely rendered
obsolete by the enactment of the Uniform Commercial Code as it pertains to the sale
of goods.

         In the case at bar, the letter of February 23, 1984 contains all the material and
essential terms for a binding agreement. The parties, Brown and Chapman, signed
the letter "regarding the purchase" by Purcell of "twenty-one (21) IBM PC's over the
next twelve (12) months." The long list of omissions suggested by Purcell--ranging
from the lack of a total price in the "letter," and which party is to deliver the
computers, to no mention of liquidated damages--does not show that the contract is
ambiguous as to be void. Furthermore, there is no requirement to detail and list all
the previous conversations in the letter.

         Under all the circumstances, we conclude that the trial court did not err in
finding that the contract for the sale of computers was not indefinite.

         The judgment is affirmed.

         Review Question 3. The Computer Network court discusses at some length the
differences between contract formation under the common law and under the
Uniform Commercial Code, with the UCC generally taking a more liberal approach
to contract formation. Would the case have come out differently if the common law
had applied? What are some specific factual reasons the case might or might not have
come out differently?

         Review Question 4. Computer Network and Purcell Tire do not seem to have
had a literal "meeting of the minds" in the formation of their contract. What exactly
is the policy justification for binding parties like these to a contract? Wouldn't it make

         Statutory Note. In connection with the Scoular case that follows, read UCC
§§ 2-205 and 2-206, which create important differences between the UCC and the
common law on contracts in the areas of offer, acceptance, and consideration. Section
2-205 also introduces the concept of a "merchant" under the UCC, which we will
explore in more detail in the next unit.

               SCOULAR CO. v. DENNEY
               Court of Appeals of Colorado
            151 P.3d 615 (Colo. Ct. App. 2006)

DAILEY, J.

         Denney is a grain farmer in Holyoke, Colorado. Scoular is a grain company
headquartered in Omaha, Nebraska that operates a grain elevator in Venango,
Nebraska. Denney grows, and Scoular buys and resells, millet, a grain used for,
among other things, birdfeed.

         Denney had had numerous dealings with Scoular in the past. On several
occasions, he had sold his grain on a "spot" sale basis, that is, without negotiating a
contract beforehand. He simply arrived at the grain elevator with his crop and
bargained for and received payment based on the market price prevailing at that
time. On other occasions, he entered into "forward contracts" with Scoular, under
which he agreed to deliver his crop to the elevator at some later time, for a price that
was locked in as of the date the agreement was reached.

         On May 30, 2002, Denney and Scoular discussed a forward contract for 15,000
bushels of millet. Although Denney indicated a desire to sell his millet, which had not
yet been grown, at $5 per hundredweight of product, Scoular declared that that price
was not then available. Four days later, however, Scoular, relying on Denney's offer,
sold the millet to a buyer who purchased it at a rate sufficient to meet Denney's price.
Scoular's general manager unsuccessfully tried several times to reach Denney by
telephone to inform him of the sale, but Denney was out farming. On June 27, 2002,
the general manager spoke with Denney and mailed him a written and signed
purchase contract.

         Denney did not check his mail. Consequently, he never signed or returned the
purchase contract. When the millet was harvested and ready for delivery in the fall
of 2002, the market price of millet had trebled. Denney delivered his millet not to
Scoular, but to a grain operator in Paoli, Colorado. When Scoular asked why he had

______________________________________________________________________________

188         CHAPTER IV: ALTERNATIVE REGIMES
not delivered the millet to it, Denney purportedly remarked that it was "too bad"
Scoular did not have a signed contract.

         Thereafter, Scoular instituted the present action for monetary damages, based
on claims of breach of contract, promissory estoppel, and unjust enrichment.3 After a
bench trial, the trial court determined that (1) Denney had entered into and breached
an enforceable contract to sell 15,000 bushels of millet to Scoular at $ 5 per hundred
weight of product and (2) Scoular was entitled to recover $82,500 in damages arising
from Denney's breach. The court did not address Scoular's alternative theories for
relief.

         On appeal, Denney contends that the trial court erred in concluding that he
had entered into an enforceable contract with Scoular to sell millet. Although a
contract is formed when an offer is accepted, Williams v. Chrysler Ins. Co., 928 P.2d
1375, 1379 (Colo. App. 1996), Denney asserts that (1) under UCC § 2-101, et seq.,
Colorado's version of the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC), he could not be bound to
a contract based only on his oral offer to sell; (2) contrary to the trial court's
conclusion, Scoular's contracting to sell the millet to a third party did not constitute
an acceptance of his offer; and (3) if a contract was entered into, it was not enforceable
because it was not in writing and signed by both parties.

         Denney contends that, under § 2-205, he could not be bound by what the trial
court referred to as a "firm offer" because the offer had not been made in writing. We
disagree.

         As Denney notes, the purpose of the section is "to modify the former rule which
required that `firm offers' be sustained by consideration in order to bind, and to
require instead that they must merely be characterized as such and expressed in
signed writings." Section 2-205 cmt. 1. As the language of § 2-205 itself makes clear,
as used in the comment, the term "bind" means only to make irrevocable.

         Indeed, as noted by one leading treatise, under common law "it was frequently
said `an offeror can always withdraw an offer if no consideration was received for it.'"
1 JAMES J. WHITE & ROBERT S. SUMMERS, UNIFORM COMMERCIAL CODE § 1-4 (4TH ED.
1995). "Section 2-205 is intended mainly to limit the power of an offeror to withdraw
a firm offer when the offeree reasonably relies on the offer's firmness." Id. § 1-4.

         Thus viewed, the purpose of § 2-205 is only to establish a type of offer that,
although not supported by consideration, is nonetheless irrevocable; § 2-205 is not
intended to provide the exclusive mechanism by which a valid (though perhaps
revocable) offer can be made. See 2 LARY LAWRENCE, ANDERSON ON THE UNIFORM

3 [Notice that breach of contract, promissory estoppel, and unjust enrichment are all

alternative causes of action raised by the plaintiff. Scoular would not ultimately be able to recover

under more than one of these claims. Breach of contract is unsurprisingly listed first because it would

provide a financially more attractive recovery than the two more "equitable" causes of action. - Eds.]

______________________________________________________________________________

UNIT 10: UCC SCOPE AND FORMATION  189
COMMERCIAL CODE § 2-206:12 (3D ED. 2004) ("The Code does not displace the non-Code
law as to what constitutes an offer, which therefore continues under the Code.").

         Here, the trial court found that Denney had made a "firm offer" as that term
is employed in the grain industry. In that industry, the term "firm offer" refers to a
standing offer by a producer to sell a set amount of bushels, at a set price, for a set
delivery date. Consistent with ordinary common law contract principles, and
comment 2 to § 2-205, this type of oral offer remains open and viable until the
producer revokes it. Section 2-205 cmt. 2 (firm offers made by oral communication
and relied upon without more evidence "remain revocable under this Article"); East
Larimer County Water Dist. v. Centric Corp., 693 P.2d 1019, 1021 (Colo. Ct. App.
1984) ("an offer to contract may be withdrawn at any time prior to acceptance").

         Thus, we conclude that Denney's oral offer could, if timely accepted, form the
basis of a valid contract.

         Denney also contends that the trial court erred when it found that Scoular had
accepted his offer. We conclude that a remand for further findings is necessary.

         Denney asserts that his offer was not open for acceptance because Scoular had
rejected it on May 30, 2002 when Scoular failed then to agree to pay the price he was
asking. However, the trial court did not find that Scoular had rejected the offer, or
that Scoular had indicated that it would not pay that price. The trial court found only
that, on May 30, the requested price was "not then available."

         Indeed, according to the transcript provided by Scoular, on May 30, Scoular's
general manager told Denney only that "at that particular time [he] could not" pay
that price, but that he would "work on it [and] see what [he could] do." In our view,
Scoular's response on May 30 was not, as a matter of law, a rejection of Denney's
offer. See Collins v. Thompson, 679 F.2d 168, 171 (9th Cir. 1982) (because offeree's
statement that it would take offer under further advisement was not a rejection of
the offer, the offer remained open); Restatement (Second) of Contracts § 38 (1981)
(same).

         Denney also asserts, and we agree, that the trial court erred in concluding that
Scoular accepted his offer when it arranged to sell his millet to another buyer.

         Acceptance is defined as words or conduct that, when objectively viewed,
manifests an intent to accept the offer. When, under § 2-206(2), an offeree relies on
the beginning of performance as the mode of acceptance, the offeree's actions must be
such as to "unambiguously express the offeree's intention to engage himself." Section
2-206 cmt. 3. Whether there has been acceptance is determined by an objective or
reasonable person standard. Joseph Heiting & Sons v. Jacks Bean Co., 236 Neb. 765,
463 N.W.2d 817, 821 (Neb. 1990).

         "The Code, with one exception, does not alter the general rule that
communication is required of the acceptance of the offer for a bilateral contract while

______________________________________________________________________________

190  CHAPTER IV: ALTERNATIVE REGIMES
it is not required of the acceptance of the offer for a unilateral contract." 2 LAWRENCE,
supra, § 2-206:55. The exception to the general rule applies when the offeree relies on
the beginning of performance as the mode of acceptance, and, in that instance, the
offeree must notify the offeror of the acceptance within a reasonable time. Id.

         Here, the trial court concluded that "the contract was made [by the]
`acceptance' of the firm offer of Mr. Denney when Scoular sold Mr. Denney's millet on
June 3, 2002." In our view, however, Scoular's act in contracting to sell millet to a
third party did not constitute acceptance.

         We reject the notion that Scoular's contract with a third party effected an
acceptance, either on the ground that it constituted performance in response to an
offer for a unilateral contract (thus, requiring no further notice to Denney) or on the
ground that it was, under § 2-206(2), the beginning of performance under a bilateral
contract (allowing for a delayed notice to Denney).

         An offer requesting a return performance rather than a promise to perform is
a unilateral contract. Here, Denney did not ask Scoular to broker a sale of his millet
to another. He offered to sell his millet to Scoular, and the performance he desired
was payment of money. Inasmuch as Scoular did not immediately pay Denney as a
result of its contract with the third party, Scoular cannot be held to have rendered
performance constituting acceptance of an offer for a unilateral contract.

         Similarly, because Scoular did not begin paying Denney as a result of its
contract with the third party, Scoular cannot be held to have begun the performance
that would have constituted acceptance of an offer to enter into a bilateral contract.

         Further, even if Scoular's contracting with the third party could be considered
"beginning performance" (that is, setting up the circumstances to make payment
possible) in response to an offer for a bilateral contract, we would nonetheless
conclude that it would not qualify as "acceptance" under § 2-206(2).

         Here, the record reveals that Scoular deals with a great number of farmers and
in vast amounts of grain. As pertinent here, Scoular did nothing in or with the
contract with the third party to earmark Denney's millet as the source of the millet
sold there. Viewed from the perspective of an objective, reasonable person, Scoular
was free to use, or plan on using, any number of farmers' millet to satisfy the demands
of the contract with the third party. Under the circumstances, we conclude that the
transaction with the third party was too open-ended to constitute an unambiguous
expression of intent on Scoular's part to be bound to a contract with Denney.

         This conclusion, however, does not end our inquiry, for the limited record
presented to us on appeal suggests that Scoular accepted Denney's offer during a
telephone conversation on June 27, 2002. According to the testimony of Scoular's
general manager, an agreement between the parties was reached over the phone. And
following the conversation, Scoular sent Denney a written purchase contract, on the

______________________________________________________________________________

UNIT 10: UCC SCOPE AND FORMATION  191
face of which appears the notation, "Thanks Doug!" above the signature of Scoular's
general manager.

         The trial court made no explicit findings regarding the contents of the
telephone conversation. The court found only that the purchase contract was a
confirmation of the contract discussed over the phone. Arguably, in so finding, the
trial court implicitly determined that, during the phone conversation, Scoular
expressed its assent to, and thus accepted, Denney's offer. However, in view of the
court's finding that the contract had been formed at an earlier time, as a result of
Scoular's conduct, the implication is too tenuous to uphold the trial court's judgment
with any degree of confidence. Consequently, a remand is necessary for the trial court
to determine whether, during the phone conversation, Scoular accepted or Denney
revoked the offer.

                                          ______________________

         Review Question 5. Having read Scoular Co. v. Denney, can you identify the
specific rules under the common law of contracts that are changed by UCC §§ 2-205
and 2-206? How exactly does the UCC change those rules? How would the case come
out if the common law applied? Be prepared to tell your classmates--and your
professor--your answer to these questions. Understanding the distinction may help
you later.

         Review Question 6. Do you think either Scoular or Denney were acting
unfairly or opportunistically in the course their transaction? Did the UCC rules
prevent or enable opportunistic behavior in this case? Should the law care about
opportunistic behavior one way or the other?

         Seller is a software company that has a professional suite of software for law
office operations. Purchasers can either get the software mailed to them on CDs for
$1,099, or can download the software from the Web for $999. Lawyer downloads the
Web-based software and pays the money. Unfortunately, the software has a defect
that causes Lawyer's entire system to crash, causing serious damage and losses to
his law practice. Lawyer wants to sue Seller. In particular, Lawyer wants to argue
that his software purchase is an Article 2 transaction because Article 2 provides
better implied warranties (see UCC section 2-314 as an example) than does the
common law.

         What is Lawyer's argument that the software purchase was a sale of "goods"
for purposes of UCC Article 2? What is Seller's argument that the purchase was not
a sale of goods? Be sure to use UCC § 2-105(1) in both sides' arguments.

         On June 1, the sales director of Nanakuli Asphalt sent an email message to
Star Paving saying as follows: "Following up on our conversation yesterday on the
Montecito job, we are offering you 1,500 cubic yards of HMA asphalt (approx. 3,000
tons) at $75/ton, loaded on your trucks at our facility. We will keep this offer open
until June 7. Please let us know ASAP. Thanks for your business!" The sales director's
e-mail gave his name on the "from" line but did not contain an e-mail signature block,
and the body of the email contained the Nanakuli logo and his electronic business
card. On June 4, Nanakuli's sales director sent a new email, saying, "We regret that
a sudden price increase from our oil supplier means we have to withdraw our quote
of June 1. We can provide the asphalt, but the new price will be $82/ton. Sorry for
any inconvenience." Star gets this shortly after it is sent. Nevertheless, on June 6,
Star sends a message purporting to accept the June 1 offer. Nanakuli refuses.

         Star ultimately pays the $82/ton price, but later sues for a refund of $7/ton on
the 3,000 tons purchased, claiming Nanakuli made an irrevocable offer that it
accepted, and therefore that there was a contract at $75/ton. What result under the
UCC? Consider UCC §§ 2-204, 2-205, and 2-206 in connection with this problem.

 Uniform Commercial Code - Merchants and Terms

FOCUS OF THIS UNIT

         Article 2 of the Uniform Commercial Code applies to all sales of goods, even if
(for example) you sell your classmate a used comic book for one dollar. As to its
applicability, the UCC does not have a minimum price or any particular
qualifications for buyers or sellers. The transaction need only be one in which title to
goods passes from the seller to the buyer for a price. That being said, Article 2 does
contain several special rules that apply only to merchants. This unit will introduce
you to the concept and some of the implications of a there being a UCC "merchant"
on one or both sides of a sales transaction. We will also consider a topic that has been
the bane of generations of students (and professors) of American contract law--the
so-called "battle of the forms" under UCC § 2-207. Suffice it to say for now that section
2-207 throws out the "last shot rule" of common-law contract formation and replaces
it with . . . something different. It is a little bit complicated.

         Merchants and Additional Standards. A recurring tension in American law--
not just in contract law--is the question of whether the law should treat all parties
the same regardless of their knowledge or sophistication. The question is frequently
resolved both ways. A healthy dose of equal treatment is embodied in Theodore
Roosevelt's famous declaration that "no man is above the law and no man is below
it." On the other hand, some situations seem to call for recognition that some parties
are in a position where holding them to a higher standard is reasonable, reflecting
the famous Biblical admonition that "to whom much is given, from him much will be
required." Or, as football coach Tony Dungy put it, "I need to treat everybody fairly,
but fair doesn't always mean equal."

         Article 2 addresses this tension by creating a special category of buyers and
sellers known as "merchants," essentially people or organizations who regularly deal
in the goods or practices of selling goods. For example, if law professor Snyder sells
his used car to law professor Burge, the transaction is governed by the UCC, but
neither party is a merchant. Snyder is not a car dealer and Burge does not buy cars

______________________________________________________________________________

UNIT 11: UCC MERCHANTS AND TERMS  195
except for personal use. If, however, Burge buys his vehicle off the lot at Snyder's
Used Car Mart, Snyder in that case qualifies as a merchant while Burge does not.
Taking the facts one step further, suppose that Burge is actually a used car buyer for
the local auto auction. In that case, the sale occurred "between merchants" because
both sides both sides of the car sale qualify as merchants. UCC § 2-104 defines the
term "merchant" in subsection (1), while subsection (3) describes when a transaction
is "between merchants." Both concepts will show up in the cases in this unit, so you
would do well to examine UCC § 2-104 briefly before continuing.

         In this unit, we will see two of the instances where merchant status matters
under Article 2. The first is the creation of a warranty that goods sold by a merchant
are of a certain quality, a warranty known as the "implied warranty of
merchantability," contained in UCC § 2-314. A second place where merchants make
an appearance in this unit is in section 2-207, the other major topic in this unit.

         Shattering the Mirror Image Rule. Section 2-207, it is fair to say, changes
everything that you think you know (and we just taught you) about the mirror-image
rule under the common-law of contracts. Indeed, one could fairly say that section 2-
207 smashes the mirror into thousands of shards capable of bloodying the hands that
touch them. Section 2-207 was drafted to deal with a real problem under the common
law. Because the mirror-image rule requires that contracting parties agree to the
exact same terms in order to form a contract, the last party to propose terms before
performance of the contract always controlled the terms of the deal. Because the last
party gets the upper hand in dictating contract terms in this situation, this mirror-
image requirement is also frequently referred to as the "last shot rule." While that
was not necessarily a fair way to select among conflicting terms on which parties did
not agree, it at least has the virtue of being simple. Section 2-207, as you will see,
replaces mirror-image offer and acceptance with a regime where non-identical
responses to an offer are treated as acceptance of the offer, along with proposals to
modify the contract. At common law, of course, a non-identical acceptance would be
treated as a counter-offer. Section 2-207 has proved to be one of the most controversial
contract-law innovations in UCC Article 2, as well as one of the more challenging
concepts for students to understand.

         As in the previous unit, we have edited citations to the Uniform Commercial
Code in the cases that follow so that they will refer you to the "Official" version of the
UCC found in many statutory supplements (or in online databases, including the free-
access Legal Information Institute: https://www.law.cornell.edu/ucc). We believe you
will find it helpful to see the statute separately, even where courts provide you with
a lengthy quotation. Doing so will enable you to see the larger context in which
particular sections of the code operate.

A. Merchants

                              FOLEY v. DAYTON BANK & TRUST
                                     Court of Appeals of Tennessee

                                696 S.W.2d 356 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1985).

CRAWFORD, Judge.

         In this non-jury case, plaintiffs, Marvin A. Foley, William E. Ball, III, and
Johanna M. Foley, buyers of a used truck from defendant, Dayton Bank and Trust,
appeal from the order of the Chancery Court dismissing their suit to rescind the
transaction. Plaintiffs' complaint alleges in substance that they purchased a 1977
International Transtar II truck from Dayton; that Mayfield, the representative of the
bank handling the transaction, "stated emphatically that the motor vehicle was `in
good mechanical condition' and in particular assured the plaintiff the engine in the
vehicle was in excellent condition at the time of the purchase;" and that plaintiff
relied on Mayfield's representation and expended large sums to prepare the vehicle
for its proposed use. The complaint further avers that the vehicle broke down as the
result of engine trouble after less than 250 miles of operation, thus substantially
impairing the vehicle's value, and that repairing the engine would require the
expenditure of at least $6,400. Plaintiffs' complaint states that they rightfully
revoked acceptance and now seek the return of all monies paid plus other described
damages.

         The record reflects that the bank had previously financed the large trailer-type
truck in question and had acquired title thereto after repossession pursuant to its
financing papers. The truck had been on the defendant's lot for several months prior
to its purchase by plaintiffs. It was eight years old and had been driven approximately
447,161 miles. Although the defendant bank engaged in the business of financing
automobiles and related-type motor vehicles, it did not normally finance trucks of this
type.

         [The court first affirms the trial court finding that Dayton Bank & Trust did
not create an "express warranty" by any statements about the condition and quality
of the truck engine.]

         Plaintiffs now assert that there was an implied warranty of merchantability
as provided in UCC 2-314 which states in part:

                  (1) Unless excluded or modified (§2-316), a warranty that the
         goods shall be merchantable is implied in a contract for their sale if the
         seller is a merchant with respect to goods of that kind . . . .

______________________________________________________________________________

UNIT 11: UCC MERCHANTS AND TERMS  197
         [T]he plain reading of the statute excludes the finding of any implied warranty
since UCC § 2-314 (1979) applies only to sales made by a "merchant with respect to
goods of that kind." UCC § 2-104 defines merchant as:

                  "Merchant" means a person who deals in goods of the kind or
         otherwise by his occupation holds himself out as having knowledge or
         skill peculiar to the practices or goods involved in the transaction or to
         whom such knowledge or skill may be attributed by his employment of
         an agent or broker or other intermediary who by his occupation holds
         himself out as having such knowledge or skill.

From the undisputed testimony in the record, it is clear that the defendants, Dayton
Bank & Trust Company and Homer Mayfield, are not merchants within the meaning
of the statute.

                                          ______________________

         Review Question 1. Courts are not always helpful in articulating their
reasoning, and here the Foley court seemed to think it self-evident why Dayton Bank
& Trust was not a merchant against whom the implied warranty of merchantability
would operate. Why exactly is a bank--generally considered a sophisticated
commercial party--not a "merchant" for purposes of this case? Carefully read the
quoted text of the definition of "merchant" in UCC § 2-104(1).

         Review Question 2. Burge is annoyingly fond of a sing-song saying that "only
a merchant has the ability to imply the warranty of merchantability." Is that
statement correct? Read UCC § 2-314 and see if you can explain what quality of goods
are implied when goods are sold by a merchant. Can you see why parties get in legal
battles over whether a seller is or is not a merchant? The Gared Holdings case that
follows may help you answer this question.

CRONE, J.

           Facts and Procedural History

         Best Bolt primarily sells fasteners, such as "bolts, nuts and screws and
miscellaneous hardware items." Best Bolt is a distributor; it does not manufacture
the products that it sells. Sometime in 2006, Curtis Sparks, a salesman for Best Bolt,
noticed that Gared Holdings had playground equipment outside its facility and
thought that Gared could be a potential customer. Sparks stopped in and introduced

______________________________________________________________________________

198        CHAPTER IV: ALTERNATIVE REGIMES
himself. He was directed to Lori Turner, a purchasing manager who is responsible
for ordering parts that Gared uses in the products that they manufacture. Sparks
began stopping in every four weeks in hopes of establishing a business relationship
with Gared. Gared eventually placed orders for cable clamps, clevis pins, and D rings.

         At issue in this case are two orders that Gared placed for pulleys. Gared uses
pulleys in the basketball goal systems that it manufactures. The basketball goals are
designed to hang from the ceiling and can be raised and lowered. The facts favorable
to the judgment reflect that, during one of Sparks's regular sales calls in 2006, Turner
asked him if Best Bolt could supply pulleys. Turner indicated that their current
supplier, Inventory Sales, was going to raise the price, and she was hoping to find a
less expensive pulley. Turner also indicated that there was a problem with cables
slipping off the wheel and becoming lodged between the wheel and the side plate.
Turner provided samples pulleys in two sizes, #3 and #5. Sparks told Turner, "I'll see
what I can do." Sparks did not tell Turner that neither he personally nor Best Bolt
generally had ever sold pulleys before.

         Sparks requested a drawing, but Turner indicated that they did not have one.
Gared did not provide detailed specifications for the pulleys, but did indicate that the
#5 pulleys needed to be rated at 1,550 pounds, withstand a standard pull test of 8,000
pounds, and withstand a side pull test of 5000 pounds. At some point during the
design process, Gared also requested that the pulleys be fastened together with
nylocks rather than rivets.

         Best Bolt decided to source the pulleys through Dakota Engineering, which
would manufacture the pulleys in China. The sample pulleys from Gared were sent
to Dakota's engineer in China, who sent back a sample. Joe Connerly, the engineering
manager for Gared, examined the samples, measured the diameter, and looked for a
proper gap between the wheel and side plate. He did not take the samples apart
because they "appeared to be correct." Although he could not tell for sure without
taking the pulley apart, he believed that the pulley contained a lubricated bushing
because there was a small gap on each side of the wheel between the wheel and the
side plate. However, the sample pulleys did not actually have a bushing.

         On June 27, 2007, Turner placed an order with Best Bolt for 4,995 #5 pulleys.
On April 14, 2008, Turner placed an order for 2,000 #3 pulleys and an additional
5,000 #5 pulleys. The purchase order requested that Best Bolt send samples of each
for testing, although it is unclear whether Best Bolt sent the samples and, if so,
whether Gared had any testing done.

In the fall of 2008, one of Gared's customers reported that a basketball goal

had fallen part way to the floor. Connerly examined the goal system and determined

that the pulley had stopped turning. Because the pulley was not moving with the

cable, the cable eventually became frayed and snapped. Connerly took the pulley

apart and realized for the first time that the pulley did not have a bushing and was

______________________________________________________________________________

UNIT 11: UCC MERCHANTS AND TERMS  199
not lubricated in any way. Without any lubrication, the wheel and axle had become
"frozen" together. Connerly conducted a cycling test on two Best Bolt pulleys, which
involves repeatedly lifting and lowering a load. The pulleys each seized up after
twenty-one cycles.

         Gared contacted Best Bolt about the problem, and Best Bolt proposed applying
a spray lubricant to the pulleys. Connerly felt that this solution was inadequate
because there was no guarantee that the spray could be accurately applied to the
axle, the spray would likely need to be applied repeatedly, and the process would
require a lot of manpower. Gared wanted Best Bolt to accept the return of the unused
pulleys and pay for the replacement of the pulleys that had been already been used,
but Best Bolt refused. Concerned that the basketball goal systems incorporating the
Best Bolt pulley posed a safety hazard, Gared decided to replace the pulleys with a
more expensive pulley manufactured by Block Division ("Block"). Gared refused to
pay for the second order of Best Bolt pulleys and also refused delivery of an order of
clevis pins.

         On September 10, 2009, Gared filed a complaint against Best Bolt stating five
claims [including] breach of the implied warranty of merchantability. On November
4, 2009, Best Bolt filed an answer and a counterclaim seeking payment for the second
order of pulleys and the clevis pins.

         A bench trial was held on June 5 through 7, 2012. It was undisputed that Gared
did not specifically request that the pulley have a lubricated bushing. However,
Gared attempted to show that a lubricated bushing was a standard or essential
component of a pulley, and therefore a buyer would not typically need to make a
specific request for a lubricated bushing. Connerly testified that he considered pulleys
to be an "off-the-shelf" item that could be purchased from a catalog without needing
to provide a drawing. He testified that a buyer would not have to specify that it have
a lubricated bushing or bearing because "[t]hat's standard in the industry." Connerly
stated that the pulleys that Gared has purchased from suppliers other than Best Bolt
have all had lubricated bushings and did not have problems with seizing up. Connerly
testified that a pulley without a lubricated bushing could work only "[f]or a short
period of time," but not for the "expected life of the . . . pulley." He stated that the
Best Bolt pulleys started failing less than a year after the basketball goal systems
were sold, and he would expect a pulley to last more than a year. Connerly testified
that he had not opted to perform a cycle test on the pulleys before approving them for
purchase because "the pulleys that . . . are normally manufactured . . . it's a
requirement of that pulley to be able to rotate. So when you purchase a pulley you
expect it to be able to rotate and it was really no reason to do a cycle test at that point
in time." After the problem arose with the Best Bolt pulleys, Connerly made a detailed
drawing of a pulley "so that if we chose to go to . . . another supplier who was not a
normal manufacturer of pulley[s] they would understand the requirements of

______________________________________________________________________________

200  CHAPTER IV: ALTERNATIVE REGIMES
manufacturing a pulley." However, when Gared started purchasing pulleys from
Block, it did not provide the drawing to Block because Block had its own drawing.

         Turner likewise testified that the pulleys that Gared had purchased from other
manufacturers all had lubricated bushings. She said that at the time that she started
ordering from Best Bolt, Gared did not have a specification sheet for the # 5 pulley
because "it was a standard item. There was nothing custom about it...." She did not
think that it was necessary to specify that the pulleys needed to have a lubricated
bushing because they were an off-the-shelf item and always have a lubricated
bushing.

         Kevin Needier, the operations manager of Gared, also characterized pulleys as
an off-the-shelf part. Needier also testified that the pulleys that Gared had purchased
from other manufacturers all had lubricated bushings. He stated that Gared had not
had to ask Inventory Sales or Block to provide a lubricated bushing.

                             Implied Warranty of Merchantability

         The trial court ruled that the implied warranty of merchantability did not
apply because Best Bolt is not a merchant as that term is defined by Indiana's version
of the Uniform Commercial Code. Section 2-314(1) provides: "Unless excluded or
modified [under § 2-316], a warranty that the goods shall be merchantable is implied
in a contract for their sale if the seller is a merchant with respect to goods of that
kind." The comments to this section state, "A person making an isolated sale of goods
is not a `merchant' within the meaning of the full scope of this section and, thus, no
warranty of merchantability would apply." UCC § 2-314, cmt. 3. Section 2-104 defines
a "merchant" as "a person who deals in goods of the kind or otherwise by his
occupation holds himself out as having knowledge or skill peculiar to the practices or
goods involved in the transaction." The comments to this section state that, in the
context of the implied warranty of merchantability, the term "merchant" is restricted
"to a much smaller group than everyone who is engaged in business and requires a
professional status as to particular kinds of goods." UCC § 2-104, cmt. 2. At the same
time, our cases hold that the implied warranty of merchantability "is imposed by
operation of law for the protection of the buyer and must be liberally construed in
favor of the buyer." Frantz v. Cantrell, 711 N.E.2d 856, 859 (Ind.Ct.App.1999).

         Regarding Gared's claim for breach of the warranty of merchantability, the
court's order states: "The evidence demonstrated that this was the first and last sale
of pulleys by Best Bolt. In fact Best Bolt was merely the distributor and Gared was
aware that Best Bolt was trying to find a company to manufacture the pulleys at a
price acceptable to Gared." The term "merchant" is not limited to manufacturers, and
Best Bolt does not cite any authority that supports the proposition that a distributor
cannot be a merchant. Furthermore, the court's order is incorrect insofar as it states
that Best Bolt made only one sale of pulleys. Best Bolt made two sales to Gared, and

______________________________________________________________________________

UNIT 11: UCC MERCHANTS AND TERMS  201
we also note that Best Bolt's vice president testified that Best Bolt would be willing
to continue selling pulleys if it had a buyer.

         Gared argues that if the trial court's "interpretation of the definition of
`merchant' is accepted then a seller such as Defendant which sells a wide variety of
industrial products would get a free pass on its first sale of any item that it sold."
Although the number or frequency of sales surely is relevant to the question of
whether a seller is a merchant, we are inclined to agree that a small number of sales
is not necessarily conclusive proof that the seller is not a merchant; rather, it could
be indicative that the seller simply has a relatively new product or a limited market
for a particular product.

         Gared argues that this case is similar to Frantz. In that case, a homeowner
sued Joseph Frantz and Frantz Lumber Company over defective shingles that were
installed on his roof. The opinion treats Frantz and the lumber company as a single
entity, although the opinion is somewhat vague as to their relationship and the
lumber company's role in the work that was performed on the roof. However, the
ultimate holding appears to be that the lumber company was found to be a merchant
of shingles because it represented that it sold "all kinds of building material" and
appeared knowledgeable about roofing materials. Frantz, 711 N.E.2d at 859.
Similarly, Best Bolt sold a variety of hardware products, and pulleys are in the same
general line of business. On the other hand, Frantz does not shed much light on the
issue of whether a seller who has made only a few sales of a product may be
considered a merchant.

         Frantz is one of only a few Indiana cases to discuss the meaning of the term
merchant; therefore, we find it helpful to look to cases from other jurisdictions that
have addressed the issue. One commentator states:

         A single, isolated transaction is not enough to establish that a merchant
         deals in goods of that kind, but one can be found to be a merchant for
         this purpose if he customarily sells a general line of goods related to the
         item in question, even though that specific item is being sold for the first
         time.

HAWKLAND'S UNIFORM COMMERCIAL CODE SERIES § 2-314:2 (West 2012) (footnotes
omitted). Wood Products v. CMI Corp., 651 F. Supp. 641 (D. Md.1986), is cited in
support.

         Wood Products concerned a furnace that was originally designed by James
Angelo to convert sawdust and other wood waste products into charcoal. CMI
Corporation obtained the rights to manufacture the Angelo furnace and sold one to
Wood Products, a company primarily engaged in milling and selling lumber. CMI
altered the design of the furnace to incorporate a larger drum. Wood Products began
experiencing problems with the furnace almost immediately, most of which stemmed
from the fact that the drum was too large and too thin. Wood Products sued CMI on

______________________________________________________________________________

202  CHAPTER IV: ALTERNATIVE REGIMES
several theories, including breach of the warranty of merchantability. CMI argued
that it was not a merchant with respect to goods of the kind due to "the experimental
nature of the furnace." The court disagreed, noting that CMI "was then
manufacturing (for the use of one of its affiliates) a similar furnace and it has
manufactured another since." See also Geo. Byers Sons, Inc. v. E. Europe Import
Export, Inc., 488 F. Supp. 574, 580 (D. Md.1980) (company that was trying to
establish an American market for East European vehicles was held to be a merchant
of East German motorcycles even though its only other sale at the time was a single
Romanian jeep).

         Best Bolt argues that this case is similar to Fred J. Moore, Inc. v. Schinmann,
700 P.2d 754 (Wash. Ct. App. 1985). In that case, the Moore family was in the
business of growing mint for the production of mint oil. The Moores were approached
by the Schinmanns, who wished to buy spearmint roots. The Moores had never
previously sold mint roots, but ultimately agreed to sell roots to the Schinmanns.
When the mint roots turned out to be a mixture of spearmint and peppermint, the
Schinmanns sued the Moores on several theories, including the warranty of
merchantability. The court held that the Moores were not merchants with respect to
mint roots because "this was the first and only sale of roots by the Moores." Moore
involved a single sale, and there was no evidence to suggest that the Moores were
interested in continuing to sell mint roots. The case at bar is more similar to Wood
Products and Geo. Byers, where the sellers had made a few sales and there was
evidence to suggest that the sellers were attempting to develop a new market.

         We conclude that the trial court erred by focusing on the fact that Best Bolt
was a distributor rather than a manufacturer because that fact is not relevant to the
analysis. We also conclude that the trial court erred by characterizing Best Bolt's
experience with pulleys as a single sale where the undisputed evidence reflects that
Best Bolt made two sales and was willing to continue selling pulleys if it had a buyer.
See McHugh v. Carlton, 369 F. Supp. 1271, 1277 (D.S.C.1974) (service station that
would procure and sell recapped tires upon request of customer was a merchant of
recapped tires even though service station did not regularly stock and sell recapped
tires). Based on the authorities that we have examined, we conclude that Best Bolt is
a merchant with respect to pulleys.

         We turn then to whether Best Bolt breached the implied warranty of
merchantability. Indiana UCC § 2-314(2) provides:

         Goods to be merchantable must at least be such as:

         (a) pass without objection in the trade under the contract description;
               and

         (b) in the case of fungible goods, are of fair, average quality within the
               description; and

______________________________________________________________________________

UNIT 11: UCC MERCHANTS AND TERMS  203
         (c) are fit for the ordinary purposes for which such goods are used; and

         (d) run, within the variations permitted by the agreement, of even
               kind, quality, and quantity within each unit and among all units
               involved; and

         (e) are adequately contained, packaged, and labeled as the agreement
               may require; and

         (f) conform to the promises or affirmations of fact made on the
               container or label if any.

         The undisputed evidence establishes that the ordinary purpose of a pulley is
to bear a dynamic load. Several of Gared's witnesses testified that a lubricated
bushing was an essential part of a pulley, that lubricated bushings were standard in
the industry, that it was unreasonable to make pulleys without lubricated bushings,
and that a pulley without a lubricated bushing would inevitably have a short useful
life. On the other hand, Hylton testified that he was aware of pulleys made without
lubricated bushings and opined that "under certain load--static load or . . . very low
dynamic loads a non[-]bushed pulley could work just as well as a bushed pulley."
Because the evidence is in conflict and the trial court did not reach the issue, we
remand for the trial court to determine whether Best Bolt breached the warranty of
merchantability.

                                                  Conclusion

         We conclude that the trial court erred in ruling that Best Bolt was not a
merchant. We therefore remand for the trial court to determine whether Best Bolt
breached the implied warranty of merchantability.

                                          ______________________

         Review Question 3. Why exactly did Best Bolt qualify as a merchant,
especially given that it does not manufacture the fasteners that it sold? UCC
section 2-314(2) lists seven aspects of what it means for goods to be "merchantable."
If you were defending Best Bolt in its case remanded to the trial court, which of the
seven items would you be most concerned that your client potentially breached, given
the evidence described in the case?

         Review Question 4. The implied warranty of merchantability is so called
because it is implied by law into the contract, even if neither party intends such a
warranty. Suppose that, after the Gared Holdings case, manufacturer Best Bolt
approaches you about getting rid of the implied warranty of merchantability in its
contracts. Is there anything you could possibly do about that? Consult UCC § 2-316
in connection with your answer.

B. Conflicting Terms in Offer and Acceptance

                 COMMERCE & INDUSTRY INS. CO. v. BAYER CORP.
                             Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts
                                433 Mass. 388, 742 N.E.2d 567 (2001)

GREANEY, J.

         We granted the application for direct appellate review of the defendant, Bayer
Corporation (Bayer), to determine the enforceability of an arbitration provision
appearing in the plaintiff's, Malden Mills Industries, Inc. (Malden Mills), orders
purchasing materials from Bayer. In a written decision, a judge in the Superior Court
concluded that the provision was not enforceable. An order entered denying Bayer's
motion to compel arbitration and to stay further litigation against it. We affirm the
order.

         The background of the case is as follows. Malden Mills manufactures
internationally-known apparel fabrics and other textiles. On December 11, 1995, an
explosion and fire destroyed several Malden Mills's buildings at its manufacturing
facility. Subsequently, Malden Mills and its property insurers, the plaintiffs
Commerce and Industry Insurance Company and Federal Insurance Company,
commenced suit in the Superior Court against numerous defendants, including
Bayer. In their complaint, the plaintiffs allege, insofar as relevant here, that the
cause of the fire was the ignition, by static electrical discharge, of nylon tow (also
known as bulk nylon fiber), which was sold by Bayer to Malden Mills and used by
Malden Mills to manufacture "flocked fabric," a fabric used primarily for upholstery
application.

         Malden Mills initiated purchases of nylon tow from Bayer either by sending its
standard form purchase order to Bayer, or by placing a telephone order to Bayer,
followed by a standard form purchase order. Each of Malden Mills's purchase orders
contained, on the reverse side, as one of its "terms and conditions," an arbitration
provision stating:

         Any controversy arising out of or relating to this contract shall be settled by
         arbitration in the City of New York or Boston as [Malden Mills] shall determine in
         accordance with the Rules then obtaining of the American Arbitration Association
         or the General Arbitration Council of the Textile Industry, as [Malden Mills] shall
         determine.

Another "term and condition" appearing in paragraph one on the reverse side of each
purchase order provides:

______________________________________________________________________________

UNIT 11: UCC MERCHANTS AND TERMS                                      205
     This purchase order represents the entire agreement between both parties, not
     withstanding any Seller's order form, whether sent before or after the sending of
     this purchase order, and this document cannot be modified except in writing and
     signed by an authorized representative of the buyer.

In response, Bayer transmitted Malden Mills's purchase orders to the manufacturer
with instructions, in most instances, that the nylon tow was to be shipped directly to
Malden Mills. Thereafter, Bayer prepared and sent Malden Mills an invoice. Each of
the Bayer invoices contained the following language on its face, located at the bottom
of the form in capital letters:

     TERMS AND CONDITIONS: NOTWITHSTANDING ANY CONTRARY OR
     INCONSISTENT CONDITIONS THAT MAY BE EMBODIED IN YOUR
     PURCHASE ORDER, YOUR ORDER IS ACCEPTED SUBJECT TO THE
     PRICES, TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THE MUTUALLY EXECUTED
     CONTRACT BETWEEN US, OR, IF NO SUCH CONTRACT EXISTS, YOUR
     ORDER IS ACCEPTED SUBJECT TO OUR REGULAR SCHEDULED PRICE
     AND TERMS IN EFFECT AT TIME OF SHIPMENT AND SUBJECT TO THE
     TERMS AND CONDITIONS PRINTED ON THE REVERSE SIDE HEREOF.

The following "condition" appears in paragraph fourteen on the reverse side of each
invoice:

     This document is not an Expression of Acceptance or a Confirmation document as
     contemplated in Section 2-207 of the Uniform Commercial Code. The acceptance
     of any order entered by [Malden Mills] is expressly conditioned on [Malden Mills's]
     assent to any additional or conflicting terms contained herein.

Malden Mills usually remitted payment to Bayer within thirty days of receiving an
invoice.

         Based on the arbitration provision in Malden Mills's purchase orders, Bayer
demanded that Malden Mills arbitrate its claims against Bayer. After Malden Mills
refused, Bayer moved to compel arbitration and to stay the litigation against it. The
judge denied Bayer's motion, concluding, under § 2-207 of the Massachusetts
enactment of the Uniform Commercial Code, that the parties' conduct, as opposed to
their writings, established a contract. As to whether the arbitration provision was an
enforceable term of the parties' contract, the judge concluded that subsection (3) of
§ 2-207 governed, and, pursuant thereto, the arbitration provision was not
enforceable because the parties had not agreed in their writings to arbitrate. Finally,
the judge rejected Bayer's argument that the plaintiffs should be equitably estopped
from refusing to proceed under the arbitration provision.

     This case presents a dispute arising from what has been styled a typical "battle

of the forms" sale, in which a buyer and a seller each attempt to consummate a

commercial transaction through the exchange of self-serving preprinted forms that

clash, and contradict each other, on both material and minor terms. See 1 JAMES J.

WHITE & ROBERT S. SUMMERS, UNIFORM COMMERCIAL CODE § 1-3, at 6-7 (4th ed.

1995). Here, Malden Mills's form, a purchase order, contains an arbitration provision,

______________________________________________________________________________

206  CHAPTER IV: ALTERNATIVE REGIMES
and Bayer's form, a seller's invoice, is silent on how the parties will resolve any
disputes. Oddly enough, the buyer, Malden Mills, the party proposing the arbitration
provision, and its insurers, now seek to avoid an arbitral forum.

         Section 2-207 was enacted with the expectation of creating an orderly
mechanism to resolve commercial disputes resulting from a "battle of the forms." The
section has been characterized as "an amphibious tank that was originally designed
to fight in the swamps, but was sent to fight in the desert." WHITE & SUMMERS, supra,
at § 1-3, at 8. Section 2-207 sets forth rules and principles concerning contract
formation and the procedures for determining the terms of a contract. As to contract
formation, under § 2-207, there are essentially three ways by which a contract may
be formed. "First, if the parties exchange forms with divergent terms, yet the seller's
invoice does not state that its acceptance is made `expressly conditional' on the buyer's
assent to any additional or different terms in the invoice, a contract is formed [under
subsection (1) of § 2-207]." JOM, Inc. v. Adell Plastics, Inc., 193 F.3d 47, 53 (1st Cir.
1999). "Second, if the seller does make its acceptance `expressly conditional' on the
buyer's assent to any additional or divergent terms in the seller's invoice, the invoice
is merely a counteroffer, and a contract is formed [under subsection (1) of § 2-207]
only when the buyer expresses its affirmative acceptance of the seller's counteroffer."
Id. Third, "where for any reason the exchange of forms does not result in contract
formation (e.g., the buyer `expressly limits acceptance to the terms of [its offer]' under
§ 2-207(2)(a), or the buyer does not accept the seller's counteroffer under the second
clause of § 2-207[1]), a contract nonetheless is formed [under subsection (3) of § 2-
207] if their subsequent conduct--for instance, the seller ships and the buyer accepts
the goods--demonstrates that the parties believed that a binding agreement had been
formed." Id. at 54.

         Bayer correctly concedes that its contract with Malden Mills resulted from the
parties' conduct, and, thus, was formed pursuant to subsection (3) of § 2-207. A
contract never came into being under subsection (1) of § 2-207 because (1) paragraph
fourteen on the reverse side of Bayer's invoices expressly conditioned acceptance on
Malden Mills's assent to "additional or different" terms, and (2) Malden Mills never
expressed "affirmative acceptance" of any of Bayer's invoices. In addition, the
exchange of forms between Malden Mills and Bayer did not result in a contract
because Malden Mills, by means of language in paragraph one of its purchase orders,
expressly limited Bayer's acceptance to the terms of Malden Mills's offers.

         Although Bayer acknowledges that its contract with Malden Mills was formed
under subsection (3) of § 2-207, it nonetheless argues, relying on language in both
JOM, supra at 55, and official comment 6 to § 2-207 of the Code, that the terms of the
contract are determined through an application of the principles in subsection (2) of
§ 2-207. Under this analysis, Bayer asserts that the arbitration provision became part
of the parties' contract because it was not a "material alteration," and to include the

______________________________________________________________________________

UNIT 11: UCC MERCHANTS AND TERMS  207
provision would cause no "surprise or hardship" to the plaintiffs. This analysis is
incorrect.

         Bayer ignores the significance of the method of contract formation in
determining the terms of a contract. See WHITE & SUMMERS, supra, at § 1-3, at 19-20
(discussing three routes of contract formation under § 2-207, and noting "the terms
of any resulting contracts will vary, depending on which route to contract formation
a court adopts"). Where a contract is formed by the parties' conduct (as opposed to
writings), as is the case here, the terms of the contract are determined exclusively by
subsection (3) of § 2-207. 2 RONALD A. ANDERSON, UNIFORM COMMERCIAL CODE § 2-
207:14, at 568; § 2-207:28, at 574-575; § 2-207:47, at 584; § 2-207:146, at 640 (3d ed.
rev. 1997). Official comment 7, which Bayer overlooks, expressly directs as much:

                  In many cases, as where goods are shipped, accepted and paid for
         before any dispute arises, there is no question whether a contract has
         been made. In such cases, where the writings of the parties do not
         establish a contract, it is not necessary to determine which act or
         document constituted the offer and which the acceptance. . . . The only
         question is what terms are included in the contract, and subsection [3]
         furnishes the governing rule"). Under subsection (3) of § 2-207, "the
         terms of the particular contract consist of those terms on which the
         writings of the parties agree, together with any supplementary terms
         incorporated under any other provisions of this chapter.

In this respect, one commentator has aptly referred to subsection (3) of § 2-207 as the
"fall-back" rule. See 1 THOMAS M. QUINN, UNIFORM COMMERCIAL CODE COMMENTARY
AND LAW DIGEST ¶ 2-207[A][14], at 2-134 (2d ed. 1991). Under this rule, the Code
accepts "common terms but rejects all the rest." While this approach "serves to leave
many matters uncovered," terms may be filled by "recourse to usages of trade or
course of dealing under § 1-205 or, perhaps, the gap filling provisions of §§ 2-300s."

         Contrary to Bayer's contentions, subsection (2) of § 2-207 is not applicable for
several reasons. First, subsection (2) instructs on how to ascertain the terms of a
contract when the contract is formed either by the parties' writings or by a party's
written confirmation of an oral contract, situations not present here (the parties'
contract was formed by their conduct). Second, the rules set forth in subsection (2),
concerning how the terms of a contract between merchants are determined, apply
only when the acceptance or written confirmation contains "additional or different
terms," a situation also not present here (Bayer's invoice is silent concerning how to
resolve disputes).

         Where the writings do not form a contract, subsection (3) states its own
criteria--"those terms on which the writings agree" plus any terms that would be
provided by other Code sections.

______________________________________________________________________________

208  CHAPTER IV: ALTERNATIVE REGIMES
         Thus, the judge correctly concluded, under subsection (3) of § 2-207, that the
arbitration provision in Malden Mills's purchase orders did not become a term of the
parties' contract. The arbitration provision was not common to both Malden Mills's
purchase orders and Bayer's invoices. Because Bayer concedes that it never
previously arbitrated a dispute with Malden Mills, we reject Bayer's claim that the
parties' course of dealing requires us to enforce the arbitration provision.

                                          ______________________

         Review Question 5. Do you need an aspirin after reading the Bayer case? Grab
a sharp pencil and work your way through the formation processes under section 2-
207 in three situations where the parties' forms do not match: (1) The second form
purports to be an acceptance with different terms but contains no "expressly
conditional" language. (2) The second form does contain the "expressly conditional"
language, but neither party has yet begun to perform. (3) The second form does
contain the "expressly conditional" language but the parties have performed. Whose
terms get to be controlling in each of those three circumstances?

         Review Question 6. What is the problem that the UCC drafters tried to solve
by replacing the simple mirror-image rule with the more complex machinations of
section 2-207? What are some potential benefits (and yes, there are some) to the
section 2-207 approach to terms in contract formation?

         Review Question 7. "Where a contract is formed" says the Bayer court, "by the
parties' conduct (as opposed to writings), as is the case here, the terms of the contract
are determined exclusively by subsection (3) of § 2-207." What exactly prevented a
contract from being formed by the parties' writings in the Bayer case? How might
those writings have been changed to lead to (as Bayer wanted) formation of a contract
under subsections (1) and (2) rather than under subsection (3)?

     FLENDER CORPORATION v. TIPPINS INTERNATIONAL, INC.
                                Superior Court of Pennsylvania
                                830 A.2d 1279 (Pa. Super. 2003)

JOHNSON, J.
         Tippins International, Inc., appeals the trial court's order denying its motion

to compel arbitration under the terms of a commercial contract. The trial court
determined that the arbitration clause on which Tippins relies was merely a part of
its offer of purchase and never became a part of the parties' contract. The court
determined, in addition, that the parties formed a contract through course of conduct
pursuant to section 2-207(3) of the Pennsylvania [Uniform] Commercial Code that
did not include an arbitration provision. [W]e affirm the court's order.

         This matter arose out of a "battle of the forms" in which the two contracting
parties attempted to impose differing terms on the purchase of goods. Tippins, a
Pittsburgh company then engaged in the construction of a steel rolling mill in the
Czech Republic, sought to purchase gear drive assemblies from Flender Corporation
for installation at the new facility. In January 1998, Tippins mailed a purchase order
to Flender specifying terms of sale. The order limited the form in which Flender could
acknowledge and accept Tippins's offer and required that the parties' disputes under
any resulting contract be submitted to arbitration. The order stated Tippins's terms
as follows: "Tippins['s] purchase order is expressly limited to acceptance of `Standard
General Conditions Nova Hut Purchase Order' and special conditions of purchase,
which take precedence over any terms and conditions written on the back of the
purchase order." The "Standard General Conditions Nova Hut Purchase Order"
included the arbitration clause at issue here, requiring that all claims or disputes
arising out of the contract must be submitted to arbitration before the International
Chamber of Commerce in Vienna, Austria, and would be governed by Austrian law.
Moreover, the order limited the form of Flender's acceptance as follows:

     AS PART OF THIS OFFER TO PURCHASE GOODS OR SERVICES THE
     ATTACHED ACKNOWLEDGMENT FORM OF THE PURCHASE ORDER "MUST"
     BE SIGNED AND RETURNED.... [NEITHER] TIPPINS NOR ANY OF ITS
     AFFILIATES RECOGNIZES ANY OTHER DOCUMENT AS AN
     ACKNOWLEDGMENT.

         Flender did not sign the attached acknowledgment form or issue any other
written acceptance of Tippins's offer, but instead manufactured and shipped the
finished drive assemblies. Flender's invoice, which accompanied the drive assemblies,
provided "Conditions of Sale and Delivery" that attached conditions to Flender's
acceptance of Tippins's order. Flender's conditions provided as follows:

     [T]hese terms and conditions will govern all quotations covering purchase orders
     for and sales of Seller's products and are the sole terms and conditions on which
     the order of buyer will be accepted. Seller's acceptance of Buyer's order will not
     constitute an acceptance of printed provisions on Buyer's order form which are

______________________________________________________________________________

210  CHAPTER IV: ALTERNATIVE REGIMES
         inconsistent with or additional to these terms and conditions unless specifically
         accepted in writing by the Seller. Buyer's agreement and Buyer's form containing
         inconsistent or material terms shall not be deemed a specific objection to any terms
         hereof.

The invoice did not, however, require that Tippins accept these additional terms in
order for the parties to form a binding contract.

         The invoice also provided a mechanism for dispute resolution. The dispute
resolution clause required that "exclusive jurisdiction and venue of any dispute
arising out of or with respect to this Agreement or otherwise relating to the
commercial relationships of the parties shall be vested in the Federal and/or State
Courts located in Chicago, Illinois." Tippins accepted and installed the gear drives
but, subsequently, failed to pay the balance due on the shipment. Flender then
commenced this action in the Court of Common Pleas of Allegheny County seeking to
recover an amount outstanding of $238,663.15, plus $76,372.16 in service charges.

         In the trial court, Tippins filed preliminary objections to Flender's complaint
asserting that the parties' contract of sale required that Flender submit its claim to
arbitration in Vienna, Austria. The trial court, the Honorable Ronald W. Folino,
denied Tippins's objections, reasoning that the arbitration clause on which Tippins
relied had been "knocked out" because it was materially different from the dispute
resolution clause in Flender's invoice. The court concluded, in addition, that because
both parties proceeded with the transaction as if they had a contract, although
neither party had accepted the other's terms, the only contract they could be deemed
to have was established by course of conduct under section 2-207(3) of the UCC.

         All parties agree that UCC section 2-207 and cases applying it are dispositive
of the issue before us. They disagree sharply, however, concerning which subsections
apply and whether the difference in provisions governing dispute resolution apparent
in the parties' respective forms served to "knock out" both provisions. Accordingly, we
shall determine whether the trial court erred in interpreting section 2-207 to conclude
that Tippins's arbitration provision was, indeed, "knocked out" and that the contract
the parties formed did not compel arbitration.

         Where, as here, one party to an agreement seeks to prevent another from
proceeding to arbitration, "the trial court's inquiry is limited to determining
(1) whether a valid agreement to arbitrate exists between the parties and, if so,
(2) whether the dispute involved is within the scope of the arbitration provision."
Midomo Co., Inc. v. Presbyterian Housing Development Co., 739 A.2d 180, 188 (Pa.
Super. 1999). In this case, the trial court applied the "knockout rule" derived from the
Uniform Commercial Code to determine that the parties had not entered a valid
agreement to arbitrate because the respective dispute resolution clauses of the
parties' forms differed and therefore cancelled one another. The court concluded as

______________________________________________________________________________

UNIT 11: UCC MERCHANTS AND TERMS  211
well that the reservations each party attached to acceptance of the offer also cancelled
each other and defeated formation of a written contract.

         Tippins asserts, contrary to the court's conclusion, that because Flender did
not expressly reject the terms of Tippins's purchase order, the parties formed a
written contract under section 2-207(1), incorporating the purchase order's terms.
Tippins argues that different terms supplied in Flender's invoice were precluded by
operation of section 2-207(2) and therefore could not operate to "knock out" its own
contrary terms. Tippins concludes accordingly that the parties formed a written
contract that incorporated the arbitration clause at issue here.

         Tippins's argument poses a novel question in Pennsylvania, as neither our
Supreme Court nor we have determined when a written contract may be formed
based on differing terms in competing writings, the so-called "battle of the forms."
Nor have our courts considered whether, as the trial court concluded, the "knockout
rule" is properly applied to cancel conflicting terms in competing writings, thereby
creating a contract out of the terms on which the parties actually agree. The text of
UCC section 2-207 and decisions of the federal courts predicting adoption of the
"knockout" rule in Pennsylvania provide guidance on these questions.

         [The court then quotes UCC § 2-207 in its entirety.]

         Section 2-207(1) provides that an expression of acceptance may operate to
accept an offer even if it contains terms additional to or different from those stated in
the offer. Thus, mere non-conformance between competing forms will not undermine
the formation of a contract, so long as the parties demonstrate their mutual assent to
essential terms. See Daitom, Inc. v. Pennwalt Corp., 741 F.2d 1569, 1576 (10th Cir.
1984). Under such circumstances, a written contract is deemed to exist consisting of
the essential terms of the offer, to which the offeree's response has established its
agreement. The formation of a written contract is defeated only where the offeree
responds with different or additional terms and "explicitly communicate [s] his or her
unwillingness to proceed with the transaction" unless the offeror accepts those terms.
See id. (citing Dorton v. Collins & Aikman Corp., 453 F.2d 1161 (6th Cir.1972)).

         In this case, Flender, through its course of conduct and subsequent invoice,
accepted the essential terms of Tippins's offer. Although the invoice provided terms
that did not appear in Tippins's offer, Flender did not communicate its unwillingness
to proceed without them or condition the transaction on Tippins's acceptance of those
terms. See UCC § 2-207(1). Consequently, we agree with Tippins that the parties did
form a written contract under section 2-207(1). However, the content of that contract,
beyond essential terms, and whether it includes the arbitration clause on which
Tippins relies, remain to be determined.

         As noted, Flender, in its invoice, included terms that were either additional to
or different from the terms of the offer embodied in Tippins's purchase order. The
treatment of additional terms, i.e., those for which no comparable provisions appear

______________________________________________________________________________

212  CHAPTER IV: ALTERNATIVE REGIMES
in the offer, is addressed in section 2-207(2). Under that section "additional terms
become part of the contract unless: (a) the offer expressly limits acceptance to the
terms of the offer; (b) the inserted term materially alters the offer; or (c) notification
of objection to the inserted terms has been given or is given within a reasonable time."
Reilly Foam Corp. v. Rubbermaid Corp., 206 F. Supp. 2d 643, 652 (E.D. Pa. 2002). If
one of these circumstances occurs, the terms of the offer control and the additional
terms will be treated merely as proposals for incorporation into the contract subject
to the offeror's acceptance. See Daitom, 741 F.2d at 1578. If, however, none of those
circumstances occurs, the offeree's acceptance controls and the additional terms
become part of the parties' contract. See id.

         Nevertheless, the fate of different terms, i.e., those for which a comparable
provision does appear in the offer, is substantially less clear. Nowhere in its text does
§ 2-207(2) address them; rather, it confines its discussion to additional terms. Thus,
the language of the statute provides little guidance on the question of which set of
terms controls when an offeree's acceptance proposes terms different from those
included in the offer. See Daitom, 741 F.2d at 1578 ("It is unclear whether different
terms in the acceptance are intended to be included under the aegis of additional
terms in [§2-207(2)] and, therefore, fail to become part of the agreement if they
materially alter the contract.").

         This question of whether different terms are to be treated as additional terms
under section 2-207(2) has divided [UCC] scholars White and Summers and prompted
courts to adopt competing majority and minority views. In Reilly Foam, The
Honorable Berle Schiller, formerly a distinguished member of this Court, now a
federal trial judge, cogently explained these competing schools of thought:

         The minority view permits the terms of the offer to control. Because
         there is no rational distinction between additional terms and different
         terms, both are handled under § 2-207(2). For support, advocates of this
         position point to Official Comment 3: "Whether or not additional or
         different terms will become part of the agreement depends upon the
         provisions of subsection [2]." Professor Summers, the leading advocate
         of the minority rule, reasons that offerors have more reason to expect
         that the terms of their offer will be enforced than the recipient of an
         offer can hope that its inserted terms will be effective. The offeree at
         least had the opportunity to review the offer and object to its contents;
         if the recipient of an offer objected to a term, it should not have
         proceeded with the contract.

Reilly Foam, 206 F. Supp. 2d at 653 (internal citations and footnote omitted). This
approach treats "different" terms as "additional" terms addressed in section 2-207(2),
see Daitom, 741 F.2d at 1579, and is the approach advocated by Tippins in this case.

______________________________________________________________________________

UNIT 11: UCC MERCHANTS AND TERMS  213
         The alternate approach, recognized as preferable by the federal courts in both
Daitom and Reilly Foam, is known as the "knockout" rule, so called because
conflicting terms in the offer and acceptance cancel one another, i.e., are "knocked
out." "Different" terms are not treated as "additional" terms for disposition under
section 2-207(2), and section 2-207(2) is limited to its express language.

     Under this view the offeree's form is treated only as an acceptance of the
     terms in the offeror's form which did not conflict. The ultimate contract,
     then, includes those non-conflicting terms and any other terms supplied
     by the U.C.C., including terms incorporated by course of performance
     (§ 2-208), course of dealing (§ 1-205), usage of trade (§ 1-205), and other
     "gap fillers" or "off-the-rack" terms (e.g., implied warranty of fitness for
     particular purpose, § 2-315).

Daitom, 741 F.2d at 1579. In Reilly Foam, Judge Schiller explained the pragmatic
basis for this approach:

     This approach recognizes the fundamental tenet behind UCC § 2-207: to
     repudiate the "mirror-image" rule of the common law. One should not be
     able to dictate the terms of the contract merely because one sent the
     offer. Indeed, the knockout rule recognizes that merchants are
     frequently willing to proceed with a transaction even though all terms
     have not been assented to. It would be inequitable to lend greater force
     to one party's preferred terms than the other's. As one court recently
     explained, "An approach other than the knock-out rule for conflicting
     terms would result in ... [ ] any offeror ... [ ] always prevailing on its
     terms solely because it sent the first form. That is not a desirable result,
     particularly when the parties have not negotiated for the challenged
     clause." Richardson v. Union Carbide Indus. Gases, Inc., 347 N.J. Super.
     524, 790 A.2d 962, 968 (App. Div.2002).

Reilly Foam, 206 F. Supp. 2d at 653-54. Professor White advocates this approach as
the most fair and consistent with the purposes of section 2-207. It has now been
adopted by a strong majority of U.S. jurisdictions that have considered the issue, and
the federal courts have predicted its adoption in others. [The court cites authority
suggesting adoption of the "knockout" rule in at least 16 states]. In addition, the
United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit and the United States District
Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania have both predicted adoption of the
"knockout" rule by the Pennsylvania Supreme Court. See Daitom, Inc., 741 F.2d at
1579-80; Reilly Foam, 206 F. Supp. 2d at 653-55.

     Flender urges us to apply the "knockout" rule in this case. Upon review of the

substantial authority, supra, supporting application of the "knockout" rule, coupled

with the cogent discussions provided by the courts in Daitom and Reilly Foam

predicting its adoption in Pennsylvania, we now join the majority of courts that have

considered the issue in declaring that differing terms between a section 2-207 offer

______________________________________________________________________________

214  CHAPTER IV: ALTERNATIVE REGIMES
and acceptance are properly subject to the "knockout" rule. This approach finds
support . . . in the plain language of section 2-207.

         Applying the "knockout" rule espoused in the majority approach to the facts
before us, it is apparent that the arbitration clause upon which Tippins relies is not
part of the parties' contract. The dispute provision in Flender's acceptance, requiring
resolution of the parties' disagreements in state or federal courts in Chicago, is clearly
at odds with and quite "different" from the clause in Tippins's offer requiring
arbitration of disputes before the International Chamber of Commerce in Vienna. By
operation of the rule we adopt today, those provisions are both, quite clearly, "knocked
out." Neither became a part of the parties' contract. Accordingly, the trial court did
not err in refusing to compel arbitration in response to Tippins's preliminary
objections.

         For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the trial court's order.

                                          ______________________

         Review Question 8. What exactly is the "knockout" rule and when would it
apply in a UCC § 2-207 case? Can you describe a UCC § 2-207 offer and acceptance
situation where the knockout rule articulated in Flender would not apply?

         Review Question 9. As the Flender opinion clearly shows, different courts have
different views on how to treat additional and different terms under UCC § 2-207(2).
What is the point of having a Uniform Commercial Code if, in fact, the same case
facts would reach different results in different states?

         (a) Is Ivy League University a "merchant"? Consult UCC § 2-104(1) and its
Official Comment 2. Be prepared to argue both sides.

         (b) Assume instead that Ivy League University is actually "Ivy League
Consignment," a merchant that regularly sells used furniture, including (the coffee
table it acquired from the law school). Did Ivy League Consignment breach the
implied warranty of merchantability as to the coffee table it sold to Mr. Hart? Consult
UCC § 2-314 and its Official Comments 3 and 4. Be prepared to argue both sides.

Problem 11.2

         Reconsider the facts of the 1915 New York case of Poel v. Brunswick-Balke-
Collander Co., which you read--and should review again--in Unit 5 of the CONTRACT
FORMATION chapter of this casebook.

         Assume now that the Uniform Commercial Code (which was not widely
adopted until about a half-century after Poel) governs the case under its same facts.
Would Poel come out differently? If so, how and why? Consider UCC § 2-207 in
connection with this problem.

Problem 11.3

         Computer Manufacturer sent a signed purchase order to Supplier ordering
5,000 Mark-V electronic components for use in building its computers. The purchase
order contained several preprinted terms on the back, including (1) a provision that
all goods provided by Supplier must be warranted against all defects for five years,
and (2) a provision that all disputes under the contract will be settled by arbitration
in California. Supplier responds with an acknowledgment form that says, "We have
entered your order; please send us shipment details." Supplier's form contains
preprinted terms on the back which specify (1) all products provided by Supplier carry
a limited one-year repair-and-replace warranty, and (2) all disputes under the
contract will be settled by arbitration in Florida. Manufacturer subsequently sends a
message setting out the delivery schedule, which says "this delivery order is subject
to all terms and conditions set forth in our original purchase order." Nothing further
is said. Supplier ships the components. When some of them prove defective after two
years, Manufacturer wants to sue Supplier.

         Are the components still under warranty? And where (if anywhere) will the
dispute be arbitrated? Consider UCC § 2-207 in connection with this problem.

    United Nations Convention on Contracts for the
                   International Sale of Goods

                                           FOCUS OF THIS UNIT

         Commerce is Global, and so are Contracts. Trade between nations has been
a major part of world history since at least the time of the Babylonian Empire. But
obvious problems arise when transactions cross national borders because laws and
commercial practices change. A merchant doing business in another country also has
a potential problem in that the courts of one country might tend to favor that
country's own citizens in a dispute with merchants from other countries. Even if the
courts are completely unbiased, however, there is a more fundamental problem. If the
buyer is in the United States and the seller is in Italy and the goods are destined for
delivery in Russia, which body of law (U.S., Italian, Russian) will apply? And in which
jurisdiction can the suit be brought?

         A body of law that goes under the name of conflict of laws1 historically has tried
to deal with these issues by providing rules determining which jurisdiction's law will
apply. Also, under an international notion of "comity," courts of one country are
supposed to recognize and give effect to judgments from other countries. Still, despite
the best efforts of generations of lawyers, judges, and legal scholars, the system relies
a great deal on good faith and cooperation, as many more potential ways to evade
contract enforcement exist in a multinational setting than do with a domestic
contract.

         Welcome to the United Nations CISG. To help bring more certainty, many of
the world's largest trading nations--and a host of smaller ones--negotiated, signed,

1 ["Conflict of Laws" is sometimes the subject of its own law school course, and the topic of

multiple and conflicting laws otherwise comes up in courses with names like "Private International

Law" or "International Business Transactions." Both future commercial litigators and future business

transaction lawyers would benefit from a working knowledge of these areas. --Eds.]

UNIT 12: CONTRACTS FOR THE INTERNATIONAL SALE OF GOODS                              217
and ratified a treaty called the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the
International Sale of Goods, or "CISG" in contract-law parlance. Unlike some United
Nations pronouncements--the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, for
example--the CISG is not an aspirational or advisory document. As you will see from
the cases below, it is a multilateral treaty that was signed by the President and
ratified by the United States Senate, which makes the treaty the domestic law of the
United States. When a contract refers to "the law of Michigan" or "the law of Texas,"
that law literally includes the CISG. While American cases involving the CISG most
often end up in federal courts, the law would be just as applicable in an American
state court.

         The CISG is designed to be used as commercial law in a hundred different
jurisdictions. Because each of those jurisdictions has its own commercial law--some
derived from English common law but most from other sources, especially Roman-
derived civil law--the treaty is necessarily a compromise. Some of its rules are similar
to those in the United States; some are similar to those in other nations, including
those of the European Community. Thus the CISG tracks no single country's
commercial law. This means that a significant population of lawyers tends to dislike
the CISG in pretty much every country. (Lawyers tend to prefer law that matches
their own local law.) Nevertheless, even for purely American businesses, some aspects
of the CISG may be superior for some clients over domestic contract regimes like the
UCC. If you wish to be a practicing business lawyer in an era of global commerce, you
would be wise to make the CISG as part of your legal toolkit.

         When Does the CISG Apply? The CISG applies only to contracts between
parties that are residents of "Contracting States," which is the term used for countries
that have ratified the treaty. As of this writing, nearly 80 countries have ratified it,
including most of the larger players in international trade. Some notable countries
have not ratified the CISG, however, including India, the United Kingdom, much of
Southeast Asia, and most of Africa. Importantly for lawyers with clients in North
America, the CISG has been ratified by Mexico, Canada, and the United States.
Thus, a contract between a business in Laredo, Texas and a business in Nuevo
Laredo, Mexico would be governed by the CISG if the contract does not otherwise
specify governing law. The CISG's coverage is also generally limited to business-to-
business contracts, so as not to interfere with domestic consumer protection laws.

         A very important aspect of the CISG is that parties are free to opt out of it.
Thus, an American seller might specify that its transactions will not be governed by
the CISG, but by the Uniform Commercial Code in a particular state. A German
manufacturer might want to specify the law of one of the German states. Unless
these parties opt out, however, the CISG applies, because both the United States and
Germany are CISG signatories.

         Confusing Vocabulary: "State" and "Article." Right off the bat, the CISG
refers to parties in "different States." In this treaty context, the word "State" does

______________________________________________________________________________

218  CHAPTER IV: ALTERNATIVE REGIMES
not mean what it usually means in American law, which is one of the states
constituting the United States of America. Rather, a "State" under the CISG is a
sovereign nation, or perhaps more clearly, a nation state. Thus, for purposes of the
CISG, the United States is one "State." Canada, China, and Germany are also each
a "State." But a contract between residents of Oklahoma and Arkansas does not
involve "different States" under the CISG.

         Fresh off of dealing with Article 2 of the Uniform Commercial Code--a large,
chapter-like grouping of statutes--you will probably notice that an "article" of the
CISG is not at all the same thing. Indeed, to most American lawyers, what the CISG
calls an "article" is more like a "section." Do not be confused that the term "article"
refers to something different in the CISG than it does in the UCC.

         (1) This Convention applies to contracts of sale of goods between parties whose
places of business are in different States:

                  (a) when the States are Contracting States; or

                  (b) when the rules of private international law lead to the
         application of the law of a Contracting State.

______________________________________________________________________________

UNIT 12: CONTRACTS FOR THE INTERNATIONAL SALE OF GOODS  219
         (2) The fact that the parties have their places of business in different States is
to be disregarded whenever this fact does not appear either from the contract or from
any dealings between, or from information disclosed by, the parties at any time before
or at the conclusion of the contract.

         (3) Neither the nationality of the parties nor the civil or commercial character
of the parties or of the contract is to be taken into consideration in determining the
application of this Convention.

                                           CISG Article 2

     This Convention does not apply to sales:

              (a) of goods bought for personal, family or household use, unless
     the seller, at any time before or at the conclusion of the contract, neither
     knew nor ought to have known that the goods were bought for any such
     use;

              (b) by auction;

              (c) on execution or otherwise by authority of law;

              (d) of stocks, shares, investment securities, negotiable
     instruments or money;

              (e) of ships, vessels, hovercraft or aircraft;

              (f) of electricity.

                                               CISG Article 3

         (1) Contracts for the supply of goods to be manufactured or produced are to be
considered sales unless the party who orders the goods undertakes to supply a
substantial part of the materials necessary for such manufacture or production.

         (2) This Convention does not apply to contracts in which the preponderant part
of the obligations of the party who furnishes the goods consists in the supply of labour
or other services.

                                               CISG Article 4

         This Convention governs only the formation of the contract of sale and the
rights and obligations of the seller and the buyer arising from such a contract. In
particular, except as otherwise expressly provided in this Convention, it is not
concerned with:

                  (a) the validity of the contract or of any of its provisions or of any usage;

______________________________________________________________________________

220  CHAPTER IV: ALTERNATIVE REGIMES
         (b) the effect which the contract may have on the property in the goods
sold.

                                               CISG Article 5

         This Convention does not apply to the liability of the seller for death or
personal injury caused by the goods to any person.

                                               CISG Article 6

         The parties may exclude the application of this Convention or, subject to article
12, derogate from or vary the effect of any of its provisions.

                                               CISG Article 7

         (1) In the interpretation of this Convention, regard is to be had to its
international character and to the need to promote uniformity in its application and
the observance of good faith in international trade.

         (2) Questions concerning matters governed by this Convention which are not
expressly settled in it are to be settled in conformity with the general principles on
which it is based or, in the absence of such principles, in conformity with the law
applicable by virtue of the rules of private international law.

         Review Question 1. Based on CISG Articles 1 through 7, answer whether each
of the contracts below would be governed by the CISG. Assume that each contract is
silent as to what law governs the contract unless you are told otherwise. For all of
these fact patterns, you should determine whether the counties in question are
signatories to the CISG.

         a. Manufacturer in Mexico contracts to sell 5,000 shirts to a clothing Retailer
in Florida, and the contract specifies that it is governed by the law of Mexico.

         b. Same facts as the previous problem, except that the contract is silent as to
what law will apply.

         c. Seller in Japan contracts to sell a custom wall-sized, flat-panel television to
Buyer in Hawaii for use in Buyer's home.

         d. Same facts as the previous problem, except that Buyer is a museum that will
use the flat-panel television for presentation of an upcoming exhibit.

    ASANTE TECHNOLOGIES, INC. v. PMC-SIERRA, INC.
United States District Court for the Northern District of California

                    164 F. Supp. 2d 1142 (N.D. Cal. 2001)

WARE, U.S.D.J.

         This lawsuit arises out of a dispute involving the sale of electronic components.
Defendant asserts that Plaintiff's claims for breach of contract and breach of express
warranty are governed by the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the
International Sale of Goods ("CISG"). Plaintiff disputes jurisdiction and filed this
Motion to Remand.

         Plaintiff is a Delaware corporation having its primary place of business in
Santa Clara County, California. Plaintiff produces network switchers, a type of
electronic component used to connect multiple computers to one another and to the
Internet. Plaintiff purchases component parts from a number of manufacturers. In
particular, Plaintiff purchases application-specific integrated circuits ("ASICs"),
which are considered the control center of its network switchers, from Defendant.

         Defendant is also a Delaware corporation. Defendant asserts that, at all
relevant times, its corporate headquarters, inside sales and marketing office, public
relations department, principal warehouse, and most design and engineering
functions were located in Burnaby, British Columbia, Canada. Defendant also
maintains an office in Portland, Oregon, where many of its engineers are based.
Defendant's products are sold in California through Unique Technologies, which is

______________________________________________________________________________

UNIT 12: CONTRACTS FOR THE INTERNATIONAL SALE OF GOODS                223
an authorized distributor of Defendant's products in North America. It is undisputed
that Defendant directed Plaintiff to purchase Defendant's products through Unique,
and that Defendant honored purchase orders solicited by Unique. Unique is located
in California. Determining Defendant's "place of business" with respect to its contract
with Plaintiff is critical to the question of whether the Court has jurisdiction in this
case.

         Plaintiff's Complaint focuses on five purchase orders. Four of the five purchase
orders were submitted to Defendant through Unique as directed by Defendant.
However, Plaintiff does not dispute that one of the purchase orders, dated January
28, 2000, was sent by fax directly to Defendant in British Columbia, and that
Defendant processed the order in British Columbia. Defendant shipped all orders to
Plaintiff's headquarters in California. Upon delivery of the goods, Unique sent
invoices to Plaintiff, at which time Plaintiff tendered payment to Unique either in
California or in Nevada.

         The Parties do not identify any single contract embodying the agreement
pertaining to the sale. Instead, Plaintiff asserts that acceptance of each of its
purchase orders was expressly conditioned upon acceptance by Defendant of
Plaintiff's "Terms and Conditions," which were included with each Purchase Order.
Paragraph 20 of Plaintiff's Terms and Conditions provides "APPLICABLE LAW. The
validity [and] performance of this [purchase] order shall be governed by the laws of
the state shown on Buyer's address on this order." The buyer's address as shown on
each of the Purchase Orders is in San Jose, California. Alternatively, Defendant
suggests that the terms of shipment are governed by a document entitled "PMC-
Sierra TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF SALE." Paragraph 19 of Defendant's Terms
and conditions provides "APPLICABLE LAW: The contract between the parties is
made, governed by, and shall be construed in accordance with the laws of the Province
of British Columbia and the laws of Canada applicable therein, which shall be deemed
to be the proper law hereof."

         Plaintiff's Complaint alleges that Defendant promised in writing that the chips
would meet certain technical specifications.

         Defendant does not deny that Plaintiff maintained extensive contacts with
Defendant's facilities in Portland Oregon during the "development and engineering"
of the ASICs. These contacts included daily email and telephone correspondence and
frequent in-person collaborations between Plaintiff's engineers and Defendant's
engineers in Portland. Plaintiff contends that this litigation concerns the inability of
Defendant's engineers in Portland to develop an ASIC meeting the agreed-upon
specifications.

     Plaintiff now requests this Court to remand this action back to the Superior

Court of the County of Santa Clara pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1447(c), asserting lack of

subject matter jurisdiction. In addition, Plaintiff requests award of attorneys' fees

and costs for the expense of bringing this motion.

224                                                 CHAPTER IV: ALTERNATIVE REGIMES
         The Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods ("CISG") is
an international treaty which has been signed and ratified by the United States and
Canada, among other countries. The CISG was adopted for the purpose of
establishing "substantive provisions of law to govern the formation of international
sales contracts and the rights and obligations of the buyer and the seller." U.S.
Ratification of 1980 United Nations CISG: Official English Text, 15 U.S.C. App. at 52
(1997). The CISG applies "to contracts of sale of goods between parties whose places
of business are in different States . . . when the States are Contracting States." Article
10 of the CISG provides that "if a party has more than one place of business, the place
of business is that which has the closest relationship to the contract and its
performance."

         Defendant asserts that this Court has jurisdiction to hear this case pursuant
to 28 U.S.C. § 1331, which dictates that the "district courts shall have original
jurisdiction of all civil actions arising under the Constitution, laws, or treaties of the
United States." Specifically, Defendant contends that the contract claims at issue
necessarily implicate the CISG, because the contract is between parties having their
places of business in two nations which have adopted the CISG treaty.

         The CISG only applies when a contract is "between parties whose places of
business are in different States." If this requirement is not satisfied, Defendant
cannot claim jurisdiction under the CISG. It is undisputed that Plaintiff's place of
business is Santa Clara County, California, U.S.A. It is further undisputed that
during the relevant time period, Defendant's corporate headquarters, inside sales and
marketing office, public relations department, principal warehouse, and most of its
design and engineering functions were located in Burnaby, British Columbia,
Canada. However, Plaintiff contends that, pursuant to Article 10 of the CISG,
Defendant's "place of business" having the closest relationship to the contract at issue
is the United States.

         The Complaint asserts inter alia two claims for breach of contract and a claim
for breach of express warranty based on the failure of the delivered ASICS to conform
to the agreed upon technical specifications. In support of these claims, Plaintiff relies
on multiple representations allegedly made by Defendant regarding the technical
specifications of the ASICS products at issue. Among the representations are: (1) an
August 24, 1998 press release; (2) "materials" released by Defendant in September,
1998; (3) "revised materials" released by Defendant in November 1998; (4) "revised
materials" released by Defendant in January, 1999; (5) "revised materials" released
by Defendant in April, 1999; (6) a September, 1999 statement by Defendant which
included revised specifications indicating that its ASICS would comply with 802.1q
VLAN specifications; (7) a statement made by Defendant's President and Chief
Executive Officer on October 25, 1999; (8) a communication of December, 1999; and
(9) "revised materials" released by Defendant in January, 2000. It appears

______________________________________________________________________________

UNIT 12: CONTRACTS FOR THE INTERNATIONAL SALE OF GOODS  225
undisputed that each of these alleged representations regarding the technical
specifications of the product was issued from Defendant's headquarters in British
Columbia, Canada.

         Rather than challenge the Canadian source of these documents, Plaintiff shifts
its emphasis to the purchase orders submitted by Plaintiff to Unique Technologies, a
nonexclusive distributor of Defendant's products. Plaintiff asserts that Unique acted
in the United States as an agent of Defendant, and that Plaintiff's contacts with
Unique establish Defendant's place of business in the U.S. for the purposes of this
contract.

         Plaintiff has failed to persuade the Court that Unique acted as the agent of
Defendant. Plaintiff provides no legal support for this proposition. To the contrary, a
distributor of goods for resale is normally not treated as an agent of the manufacturer.
Restatement of the Law of Agency 2d § 14J (1957) ("One who receives goods from
another for resale to a third person is not thereby the other's agent in the
transaction."); Stansifer v. Chrysler Motors Corp., 487 F.2d 59, 64-65 (9th Cir. 1973)
(holding that nonexclusive distributor was not agent of manufacturer where
distributorship agreement expressly stated "distributor is not an agent"). Plaintiff's
dealings with Unique do not establish Defendant's place of business in the United
States.

         Plaintiff's claims concern breaches of representations made by Defendant from
Canada. Moreover, the products in question are manufactured in Canada, and
Plaintiff knew that Defendant was Canadian, having sent one purchase order directly
to Defendant in Canada by fax. Plaintiff supports its position with the declaration of
Anthony Contos, Plaintiff's Vice President of Finance and Administration, who states
that Plaintiff's primary contact with Defendant "during the development and
engineering of the ASICs at issue . . . was with [Defendant's] facilities in Portland,
Oregon." The Court concludes that these contacts are not sufficient to override the
fact that most if not all of Defendant's alleged representations regarding the technical
specifications of the products emanated from Canada. Moreover, Plaintiff directly
corresponded with Defendant at Defendant's Canadian address. Plaintiff relies on all
of these alleged representations at length in its Complaint. In contrast, Plaintiff has
not identified any specific representation or correspondence emanating from
Defendant's Oregon branch. For these reasons, the Court finds that Defendant's place
of business that has the closest relationship to the contract and its performance is
British Columbia, Canada. Consequently, the contract at issue in this litigation is
between parties from two different Contracting States, Canada and the United
States. This contract therefore implicates the CISG.

         Plaintiff next argues that, even if the Parties are from two nations that have
adopted the CISG, the choice of law provisions in the "Terms and Conditions" set
forth by both Parties reflect the Parties' intent to "opt out" of application of the treaty.
Article 6 of the CISG provides that "the parties may exclude the application of the

______________________________________________________________________________

226  CHAPTER IV: ALTERNATIVE REGIMES
Convention or, subject to Article 12, derogate from or vary the effect of any of its
provisions." Defendant asserts that merely choosing the law of a jurisdiction is
insufficient to opt out of the CISG, absent express exclusion of the CISG. The Court
finds that the particular choice of law provisions in the "Terms and Conditions" of
both parties are inadequate to effectuate an opt out of the CISG.

         Although selection of a particular choice of law, such as "the California
Commercial Code" or the "Uniform Commercial Code" could amount to implied
exclusion of the CISG, the choice of law clauses at issue here do not evince a clear
intent to opt out of the CISG. For example, Defendant's choice of applicable law
adopts the law of British Columbia, and it is undisputed that the CISG is the law of
British Columbia. International Sale of Goods Act ch. 236, 1996 S.B.C. 1 et seq. (B.C.).
Furthermore, even Plaintiff's choice of applicable law generally adopts the "laws of"
the State of California, and California is bound by the Supremacy Clause to the
treaties of the United States. U.S. Const. art. VI, cl. 2. Thus, under general California
law, the CISG is applicable to contracts where the contracting parties are from
different countries that have adopted the CISG. In the absence of clear language
indicating that both contracting parties intended to opt out of the CISG, and in view
of Defendant's Terms and Conditions which would apply the CISG, the Court rejects
Plaintiff's contention that the choice of law provisions preclude the applicability of
the CISG.

         For the foregoing reasons, Plaintiff's Motion to Remand is DENIED.

                                          ______________________

         Review Question 2. In Asante Technologies, neither party apparently wanted
the contract to be governed by the CISG, yet that is what happened. Given all the
previous things we have learned about "mutual assent," does it appear either party
"assented" to the CISG's application? What role should the legal system play in
determining matters that contracting parties did not choose for themselves?

         Review Question 3. Assume that you represent one of the contracting parties
in the Asante Technologies case, how would you draft a choice-of-law provision to
ensure that the CISG did not apply to the contract? Conversely, is there any way you
could add certainty that the CISG would apply, if that would benefit your client? In
connection with this last question, be aware that American courts have sometimes
been known to ignore the CISG and apply the Uniform Commercial Code if there is a
reasonable basis on which to do so. American courts, like American lawyers, are often
much more familiar (and comfortable) with the UCC.

         Treaty Text Note. Read Articles 18, 19, and 29 of the CISG, which are
excerpted below, before you read the Roser Technologies case that follows. These
articles deal with offer, acceptance, and modification, topics you have previously seen
both under the common law and the UCC.

                                              CISG Article 18

         (1) A statement made by or other conduct of the offeree indicating assent to an
offer is an acceptance. Silence or inactivity does not in itself amount to acceptance.

         (2) An acceptance of an offer becomes effective at the moment the indication of
assent reaches the offeror. An acceptance is not effective if the indication of assent
does not reach the offeror within the time he has fixed or, if no time is fixed, within a
reasonable time, due account being taken of the circumstances of the transaction,
including the rapidity of the means of communication employed by the offeror. An
oral offer must be accepted immediately unless the circumstances indicate otherwise.

         (3) However, if, by virtue of the offer or as a result of practices which the parties
have established between themselves or of usage, the offeree may indicate assent by
performing an act, such as one relating to the dispatch of the goods or payment of the
price, without notice to the offeror, the acceptance is effective at the moment the act
is performed, provided that the act is performed within the period of time laid down
in the preceding paragraph.

                                              CISG Article 19

         (1) A reply to an offer which purports to be an acceptance but contains
additions, limitations or other modifications is a rejection of the offer and constitutes
a counter-offer.

         (2) However, a reply to an offer which purports to be an acceptance but contains
additional or different terms which do not materially alter the terms of the offer
constitutes an acceptance, unless the offeror, without undue delay, objects orally to
the discrepancy or dispatches a notice to that effect. If he does not so object, the terms
of the contract are the terms of the offer with the modifications contained in the
acceptance.

         (3) Additional or different terms relating, among other things, to the price,
payment, quality and quantity of the goods, place and time of delivery, extent of one
party's liability to the other or the settlement of disputes are considered to alter the
terms of the offer materially.

                                              CISG Article 29

         (1) A contract may be modified or terminated by the mere agreement of the
parties.

         (2) A contract in writing which contains a provision requiring any modification
or termination by agreement to be in writing may not be otherwise modified or
terminated by agreement. However, a party may be precluded by his conduct from
asserting such a provision to the extent that the other party has relied on that
conduct.

ROSER TECHNOLOGIES, INC., v. CARL SCHREIBER GmbH
     U.S. District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania
               2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 129242 (Sept. 10, 2013)

ARTHUR J. SCHWAB, U.S.D.J.

         [CSN Metals ("CSN") sent quotations to Roser Technologies, Inc. ("RTI") for
the manufacture of copper plates. RTI responded with purchase orders that referred
to the CSN quotations. CSN then sent order confirmations to RTI which referenced
RTI's purchase orders. These confirmations included a new provision, not included in
the original quotes or purchase orders, which allowed CSN to ask for "guarantees or
payment in advance" in some situations. When CSN subsequently insisted on
invoking the payment term, and refused to deliver without it. RTI refused to comply
and subsequently bought its requirements elsewhere. RTI sued. CSN counterclaimed.
The key question before the court was whether a contract had been formed and
whether it included the payment term. The answer, said the court, depended on what
law applied to the transaction.]

         The parties agree that the choice is between the Uniform Commercial Code
("UCC"), and the United Nations Convention for the International Sale of Goods
("CISG").

         RTI argues that there is no choice-of-law issue because the UCC and CISG do
not differ with respect to the issue before the Court. CSN argues that there is a
difference and that the CISG applies.

[Under the CISG], additional terms are governed by Article 19.

Few American courts, either state or federal, have interpreted Article 19. The

United States District Court for the Southern District of Ohio has stated that "the

CISG applies the common law concept of mirror image." Miami Valley Paper, LLC v.

Lebbing Eng'g & Consulting GmbH, 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 25201, 2009 WL 818618,

______________________________________________________________________________

UNIT 12: CONTRACTS FOR THE INTERNATIONAL SALE OF GOODS             229
*4 (S.D. Ohio Mar. 26, 2009); see also CSS Antenna, Inc. v. Amphenol-Tuchel Elecs.,
GmbH, 764 F. Supp. 2d 745, 752-53 (D. Md. 2011) (applying Article 19 in a fashion
consistent with the mirror image rule).

         [The court noted that German court decisions regarding the CISG hold that a
new term sent in response to a standard form is a "counteroffer," and that
commentators on the law agree that "the CISG in fact adopts the old common law
`Mirror Image Rule.'"]

         Thus, with respect to the battle of the forms, the determinative factor under
the CISG is when the contract was formed. The terms of the contract are those
embodied in the last offer (or counteroffer) made prior to a contract being formed.
Once the contents of the original contract are determined, both parties must
affirmatively assent to any amendment to the terms of the contract for such
amendment to become part of the contract. See Chateau des Charmes Wines Ltd. v.
Sabate USA Inc., 328 F.3d 528, 531 (9th Cir. 2003).

         "[N]o provision of the [CISG] creates such diametrical opposition to the [UCC]
rule as does Article 19 in its clear adoption of the `mirror image' rule." 1 RONALD A.
BRAND, FUNDAMENTALS OF INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS TRANSACTIONS 75 (2013). Under
the UCC, standard conditions in an acceptance that materially alter the terms of the
agreement are disregarded. Under the CISG, an acceptance with different standard
conditions is not actually an acceptance, but rather is a rejection and counteroffer.

         The CISG "applies to contracts of sale of goods between parties whose places
of business are in different States . . . when the States are Contracting States."
Forestal Guarani S.A. v. Daros Int'l, Inc., 613 F.3d 395, 397 (3d Cir. 2010) (quoting
CISG Article 1(1)(a)). The United States ratified the CISG on December 11, 1986.
Germany is also a contracting state to the CISG. See It's Intoxicating, Inc. v. Maritim
Hotelgesellschaft mbH, 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 107149, 2013 WL 3973975, *17 (M.D.
Pa. July 31, 2013). The parties' places of business were in different states, as is
required by Article 1(2) of the CISG.

         "Because both the United States [and Germany] are signatories to the CISG
and the alleged contract at issue involves the sale of goods . . . the CISG governs."
Forestal Guarani, 613 F.3d at 397. However, just because the CISG governs does not
necessarily mean that it applies in this case. Under Article 6 of the CISG, the parties
may choose to exclude application of the CISG. In order for the contract to exclude
the CISG it must include language which affirmatively states that the CISG does not
apply. BP Oil Int'l, Ltd., v. Empresa Estatal Petroleos de Ecuador, 332 F.3d 333, 337
(5th Cir. 2003).

         Having determined that the CISG is the applicable law, the Court turns to the
formation of a contract between RTI and CSN. CSN argues that RTI's purchase
orders were offers and that CSN's order confirmations were rejections and
counteroffers under the CISG. RTI, on the other hand, argues that its purchase orders

______________________________________________________________________________

230  CHAPTER IV: ALTERNATIVE REGIMES
were offers and that CSN's order confirmations were in fact acceptances of the offers.

         [CSN's] order confirmations stated that, "If we have offered a payment target,
a sufficient coverage by our credit insurance company is assumed. In case this cannot
[be] obtained we have to ask for equivalent guarantees or payment in advance."

         [This language] was in regular print on the front of both order confirmations.
The language did not reference any other document but rather was an independent
additional term under Article 19 of the CISG. Furthermore, the additional term was
material under CISG Article 19(3), as it related to payment terms for the goods.

         RTI's sole argument against this additional term under the CISG is that the
additional term did not impose any duty on RTI but merely gave CSN the ability to
ask for equivalent guarantees or advance payment. This argument is without merit.
The word "ask" can mean "to expect or demand." AMERICAN HERITAGE DICTIONARY OF
THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE (4TH ED. 2000). When considered in the context that it was
used, this is the natural meaning of the word "ask" in the order confirmations. The
same sentence that the word "ask" appears in also uses the term "guarantees,"
evidencing the mandatory nature of the term ask. Furthermore, it is illogical to
include in a contract a provision by which one party would request another party
provide something as important as a guarantee regarding payment and then be fully
satisfied if the other party refused to provide such a guarantee or advance payment.
Any reasonable businessperson reading such a statement would have recognized that
this term was a requirement if CSN did not obtain sufficient coverage from its
insurance carrier.

         The additional term that was properly incorporated into CSN's order
confirmations was material under Article 19. Thus, the order confirmations were not
in fact acceptances but rather constituted counteroffers.

         The final step in determining if a contract was formed between RTI and CSN
is consideration of the emails that were exchanged between the parties in August
2011. CSN argues that these emails were acceptances by RTI and therefore a valid
contract was formed between the parties. [The court reviews the emails, including
one in which RTI noted that it had received the order confirmations and that CSN
should "please proceed with the manufacture of these plates."]

         Article 18(1) of the CISG provides that "A statement made by or other conduct
of the offeree indicating assent to an offer is an acceptance." RTI's acceptance of CSN's
counteroffer with respect to purchase order 6761 is evident from the email exchange.

         Having determined the parties obligations under the contract, the Court now
turns to whether either party breached its obligations under the contract. CSN argues
that RTI repudiated the contract and therefore was in material breach. Article 71 of
the CISG provides that: "A party may suspend the performance of his obligations if,
after the conclusion of the contract, it becomes apparent that the other party will not

______________________________________________________________________________

UNIT 12: CONTRACTS FOR THE INTERNATIONAL SALE OF GOODS  231
perform a substantial part of his obligations as a result of . . . his conduct in preparing
to perform or in performing the contract." In this case, there is no dispute that RTI
refused to perform on the contract. RTI sent a letter to CSN on October 24, 2011,
stating that it would procure the requested copper from an alternate supplier. CSN
responded stating, "please be informed the cancellation is NOT ACCEPTED by CSN."
RTI then sent a follow-up letter to CSN on October 28, 2011, stating that it would not
follow through with its obligations relating to advance payment or other forms of
guarantee. On November 4, 2011, RTI sent yet another letter confirming it was
canceling the purchase orders.

         It is hard to imagine a clearer repudiation. RTI sent repeated notices to CSN
over an 11 day period setting forth its reasons for not performing the contract. In
short, RTI believed that the terms of the contract were different than they actually
were. Thus, RTI breached its contractual obligations to CSN.

                                          ______________________

         Review Question 4. The CISG, says the court, adopts the "mirror image" rule,
which in the "battle of the forms" situation is the equivalent of the "last shot" rule--
whoever sends the last form wins. Under the UCC's rules of acceptance in
section 2-207, would the case have come out differently? If so, you should be prepared
to explain how. If CSN's payment clause had not become part of the contract, wouldn't
that mean that the UCC is a "first shot" rule--that whoever sends the first form wins?
Which rule makes more sense and why?

                  Problems

Problem 12.1

         Bulldog Motors PLC is a British corporation that manufactures high-end
motorcycles. Its principal place of business is Leeds, United Kingdom. It has a wholly
owned subsidiary, Bulldog North America, Inc. ("BNA"), a Delaware corporation with
its principal place of business in Huntsville, Alabama, where it operates an assembly
plant for motorcycles to be sold in the United States, Canada, and Mexico. Mei Guo
Products Ltd. (MGP) is a Swiss corporation with its principal place of business in
Singapore. It operates a wholly owned subsidiary, MGP-Thailand Corp. (MGPT),
which is a Swiss corporation with its principal place of business and its
manufacturing facilities for automotive parts in Bangkok, Thailand.

         On June 1, the purchasing manager for BNA, who is in Toronto, Canada, for a
regional corporate meeting, does a video conference call with the sales manager of
MGPT, who is in Bangkok. The purchasing manager and the sales manager agree

______________________________________________________________________________

232                                   CHAPTER IV: ALTERNATIVE REGIMES
orally that BNA will purchase 10,000 flex rotor assemblies from MGPT at a price of
£27.50 per unit, including shipping from Thailand to Los Angeles, California, or a
total contract price of £275,000 (roughly US$300,000 at the time of the transaction).
The transaction is subsequently confirmed in writing. Subsequently, a dispute arises
between the parties. MGPT refuses to ship the items, and BNA claims breach of
contract. What law applies to the transaction? Might there be something you have to
look up in connection with answering this question--something we discussed at the
beginning of this unit?

Problem 12.2

         Stuart is a successful lawyer who owns his own litigation firm in Detroit,
Michigan. He is a huge sports fan and firm's offices are decorated with sports
memorabilia. While at an online auction site, eBay, he sees a "Buy it Now" offer for
three framed, autographed hockey jerseys from Specialty Sports Ltd., a sports
memorabilia retailer in Windsor, Ontario, Canada. The jerseys are of three famous
players who all wore number 9: Gordie Howe (Detroit Red Wings), Maurice "Rocket"
Richard (Montreal Canadians), and Bobby Hull (Chicago Blackhawks). The price
listed is CAD3,000 (or about US$2,250 at the time of the offer). Stuart clicks on the
"Buy it Now" button and pays with his law firm credit card. He plans to feature the
framed jerseys in the waiting room in his law firm. Specialty Sports delivers the
jerseys to Stuart's office address. If a dispute develops, what law applies to the
transaction?

Problem 12.3

         LiveAction Toys, Inc. is a U.S. toy manufacturer with its main offices in White
Plains, New York. LiveAction does not do its own manufacturing, but rather buys
most of its products from China and Southeast Asia. At a trade show in London,
England, LiveAction's representatives enter into negotiations with Ausgezeichnete
Spielzeug GmbH ("ASG"), a German toy importer-distributor based in Worms,
Rheinland-Pfalz, for import of comic book action figures into the European Union.
There are extensive discussions of prices, delivery dates, promotional assistance, and
other terms.

A week after the trade show, ASG sends a Purchase Order to LiveAction, which

orders 100,000 action figures, at a total price of "US$326,000 Delivered at Place--

Worms." The ASG purchase order contains clauses which provide that the transaction

"will be governed by the laws of the Federal Republic of Germany," and that "all

disputes shall be settled by binding arbitration under the rules of the International

Chamber of Commerce in Frankfurt, Germany." LiveAction responds with an Order

Confirmation that restates all of the relevant terms, but provides that the transaction

"will be governed by the New York Uniform Commercial Code," and that "all disputes

______________________________________________________________________________

UNIT 12: CONTRACTS FOR THE INTERNATIONAL SALE OF GOODS  233
shall be settled by binding arbitration under the rules of the American Arbitration
Association in New York City." Nothing further is sent.

         LiveAction delivers the toys, accompanied by a shipping document that
reiterates the terms in the Order Confirmation. A dispute subsequently develops
when ASG claims that many of the toys are defective and refuses to pay. LiveAction
sues in New York district court. ASG moves to compel LiveAction to arbitrate under
ICC rules in Mainz. Should the court compel arbitration? If so, where? And what law
will apply to the dispute?

INTRODUCTION TO CONTRACT DEFENSES        235
           An Introduction to

     CONTRACT DEFENSES

         Where Are We Now? At this point, you have marched through the book far
enough to understand the concepts of formation and consideration. Pretend now that
a contract problem walks into your law office. You plainly find an exchange of
consideration. You plainly have an offer and an acceptance by the appropriate parties.
Under the section we called "Formation," has a contract been formed? At this point
you might be tempted to think that the answer is yes, but you probably are familiar
enough with the way law school works that the answer is likely to be "maybe." At this
point, we fairly can say there is a presumption that a contract has been formed, but
that the presumption can be rebutted.

         Assume, for example, that A and B--anonymous parties for the moment--sign
a written agreement under which A agrees to sell B her car for $5,000. We have a
signed agreement, so basic formation issues are not a problem. Also, both cash and
automobiles are things of value that can act as consideration. To decide if a contract
actually was formed, nonetheless, we may have to answer some other questions.
Would it matter, for example, if A was unwilling and B held a gun to her head to
make her sign the agreement? Would it matter that B was only six years old? Or that
A purportedly sold the car while knowing that it had actually been destroyed by a
meteor earlier that morning and was a smoking hunk of melted metal at the time of
the sale?

         Enter the Defenses. Your intuition may be that courts would not enforce
agreements in the above situations. But what are the reasons why not? As a matter
of policy, we do not want contract law to reward liars and thugs or to allow children
potentially to be exploited. For reasons such as these, contract law includes the
concept of defenses to formation. If a valid defense exists, no enforceable agreement
exists even though the rules of formation and consideration suggest otherwise. In
earlier times, lawyers generally would call these situations "unenforceable contracts."
Today, since the definition of contract includes enforceability, an unenforceable
contract is a bit of an oxymoron, so some prefer to say that there is no contract at all.
The terminology may vary, but the effect, no matter what we call it, is that the party
claiming breach cannot recover.

         Shifting Burdens of Proof. In contract litigation, the burden of the party
claiming the breach (usually the plaintiff) is to prove the existence of an agreement
and of consideration, where such matters are disputed issues. At that point, the
burden shifts to the alleged breaching party to raise any of the various defenses to
formation. That party will bear the burden of proof on that issue. The plaintiff does
not have to prove he did not brandish a gun; the defendant must prove he did. For
those litigating contract disputes, the burden of proof can be significant.

                       Capacity to Contract

                                           FOCUS OF THIS UNIT

         You may recall from the introduction to the course that one of the requirements
of a valid contract is "competent parties." A competent party, in legal parlance, is one
who has capacity to contract. The contracts of competent parties are valid, those of
incompetent parties are voidable--that is, they can be undone at the request of the
incompetent party (or, in some cases, that party's representative). The capacity
requirement is the subject of this unit.

         Voluntary and Involuntary Obligation. In general, tort law and criminal law
involuntarily impose legal duties on the persons subject to those laws. As an
individual member of society you do not, for instance, have the right to commit a
battery or rob a bank. Contract law, in contrast, usually involves taking on legal
duties that would not exist but for the voluntary entry into a contractual relationship.
A person has more legal obligations after entering into a contract than she has before
doing so. Is the ability to take on new duties, incur potential liability, and to limit
one's future legally really a valuable power? Perhaps counterintuitively (as least
when we frame the question that way), the answer is an emphatic yes. The ability of
parties to legally bind themselves has far-reaching economic and social consequences.
If you cannot legally bind yourself to repay a loan, for example, no one is going to give
you one, which means your future options (getting a car or a home or starting a
business) are limited. Similarly, the inability to enter into enforceable agreements
also has economic and social consequences--largely negative ones, as history
demonstrates.

         The Consequential Power to Contract. In many societies in history, the power
to contract has often been limited to a narrow class of people who use it to help
consolidate their political power. In early Rome, for example, only the head of a
family, known as the paterfamilias, had the power to make binding contracts. This
arrangement allowed the heads of the families to maintain their power and authority,

______________________________________________________________________________

UNIT 13: CAPACITY TO CONTRACT  239
which extended even to being able to sell or purchase family members (in a society
where debt-slavery was a widespread practice). In more recent eras, limiting the
rights of citizens to contract has been a feature of communist societies whose goal
was to keep people from accumulating money and (as a result) power. Historically,
the question whether particular classes of persons should be free to enter into
contracts has been a matter of profound political importance. The ability to enter into
contracts, and to have those contracts impartially enforced by state authorities,
means the ability to make money--and accumulating wealth has always been a good
way to increase one's political power.

         Capacity as an Oppressive Doctrine. Sadly, from the earliest history of the
common-law system until relatively recent times, the doctrine of capacity has been
used to exclude whole classes of persons from the ability to enter into legally binding
agreements. This exclusionary role was sometimes been justified by an explicit intent
to restrict certain people from the means to obtain power. Medieval European Jews
often were denied legal capacity to contract, for instance. Other justifications for
denying contractual capacity centered around the necessity to "protect" various
groups from their supposed "natural" inability to compete on equal terms. Nineteenth
century American cases are full of statements that, for example, women and African-
Americans should not be permitted to enter contracts because they would simply be
taken advantage of by "superior" white males.1 Not surprisingly, people legally
protected in such a way have disputed the need for such protection. Gaining freedom
to contract was accordingly an important goal of early civil rights movements.
Married (and white) women in the United States only acquired the legal right to
control their own property and enter into contracts without their husbands'
permission with the passage of Married Women's Property Acts, beginning in 1848.
African-Americans theoretically gained the right to contract with the adoption of the
14th Amendment to the United States Constitution in 1868. Still, neither women nor
African-Americans obtained full power to contract until well into the 20th century in
many instances, as vestigial rules, special legislation, and "Jim Crow" laws restricted
access to economic power that arises from the ability to contract.

         Capacity Today. Despite this history of abuses of the concept of capacity, you
should know that many of its uses are well-intentioned. Today, certain rules of
contract law take into account special categories of people (e.g., consumers and
employees) and restrict their ability to freely contract as to certain terms. By far,
however, the two most important categories of what the law calls "incapacity to
contract" are (1) minors, and (2) persons who are suffering from serious mental
disabilities. Yet even these categories are not without controversy. Minors, after all,

     1 [In one infamous Georgia case, Bryan v. Walton, 14 Ga. 185 (1853), the court held that a free

black slave owner was incompetent to sell the slaves he owned (which he had received by inheritance),

and that it was counterproductive to give him the right to contract because such freedom simply is

"impossible for him to exercise wisely for himself." As a result, he could only be permitted to enter into

contracts if a white "guardian" who was appointed for him approved.--Eds.]

play an increasingly important economic role in society, and enter into a vast number
of contracts every year. Moreover, the question of exactly who is too "mentally
disabled" to be allowed to contract is the subject of some dispute, as well. America,
after all, traditionally lets eccentric people make their own choices regardless of the
opinions of society at large. Drawing the line between "eccentric" and "unable to act
in a reasonable manner" can sometimes be difficult.

         In connection with these materials, you may find it helpful to review

Cases and Materials

        EX PARTE ODEM
   Supreme Court of Alabama
    537 So.2d 919 (Ala. 1988)

SHORES, J.

         We granted this petition for writ of certiorari in order to review the limited
issue of whether a minor who executes a contract for a "necessary" is obligated to
comply with the express terms of the entire contract, including those provisions
regarding attorney fees and waiver of personal exemptions.

         [Iris Odem's nineteen-day-old son was admitted to Children's Hospital of
Birmingham due to a serious illness. On the date of admission, March 15, 1985, Odem
completed and signed an inpatient registration form, whereby she agreed to be
responsible for all charges incurred in the hospital for the medical treatment
rendered to her child. The contract provided that in the event she failed to pay and
the hospital had to sue to collect, Odem would be liable for attorneys' fees. As of that
date, Odem was seventeen, and thus a minor under Alabama law. Odem did not pay
the charges, which totaled more than $5,000. The hospital sued. During the pendency
of the suit, Odem turned eighteen and shortly thereafter disaffirmed the contract
with the hospital. The trial court ordered summary judgment for the hospital.]

         We agree that medical services provided to an infant child of a minor are
"necessaries" for which the minor parent may be obligated to pay, but we hold that
the attorney fees for enforcing the contract are not "necessaries" for which the minor
is legally obligated to pay.

         The general rule of law is that contracts of minors are voidable. That is, the
contract may be avoided or ratified at the election of the minor. Flexner & Lichten v.

______________________________________________________________________________

UNIT 13: CAPACITY TO CONTRACT  241
Dickerson, 72 Ala. 318 (1882). In the instant case, Iris Odem disaffirmed, or avoided,
the contract she had executed with Children's Hospital. Consequently, Iris Odem's
obligation to pay for necessaries, i.e., the medical services rendered to her infant son,
is not the result of the express contract between the parties, but arises from a quasi-
contractual relationship created by operation of law which enforces the implied
contract to pay. 43 C.J.S. Infants § 180 (1978). Therefore, a minor is not liable on any
portion of the contract, or for what was agreed to be paid, except that the minor is
liable for the just value of the necessaries.

         In Wiggins Estate Co. v. Jeffery, 19 So. 2d 769 (Ala. 1944), this Court, with
approval, quoted the following:

                  It is for the court to determine, as a matter of law, in the first
         place, whether the things supplied may fall within the general classes
         of necessaries, and if so, whether there is sufficient evidence to warrant
         the jury in finding that they are necessary. If either of these preliminary
         inquiries be decided in the negative, it is the duty of the court to nonsuit
         the plaintiff who seeks to recover from the [minor]. If they be decided in
         the affirmative, it is then for the jury to determine whether, under all
         the circumstances, the things furnished were actually necessary to the
         position and condition of the [minor], as well as their reasonable value,
         and whether the [minor] was already sufficiently supplied . . . .

         Therefore, the class and character of articles that are necessaries are issues of
law.

         Do the attorney fees in this case fall within the general classes of necessaries?
Stated differently, are the attorney fees necessary to the position and condition of the
minor?

         Under Alabama law, attorney fees are recoverable from an opposing party only
when provided for by contract or by statute. Thus, any contractual provision
regarding the recovery of attorney fees in this case is for the benefit of Children's
Hospital, because the attorney fees would not otherwise be recoverable. Accordingly,
attorney fees are not necessary to the position and condition of the minor and are not
recoverable from Iris Odem. It is the policy of the law to protect infants against their
own mistakes or improvidence, and from designs of others, and to discourage adults
from contracting with an infant. 43 C.J.S. Infants § 180 (1978).

         Accordingly, when an infant executes a contract, the infant is liable only on his
implied promise to pay for necessaries, and all other provisions of the contract are
voidable at the election of the infant. Further, attorney fees are not necessaries,
because they are not necessary for the position and condition of the infant. We reverse
the judgment of the Court of Civil Appeals to the extent that it holds that Iris Odem
is obligated under all of the terms of the contract, and we affirm that portion of the

______________________________________________________________________________

242  CHAPTER V: CONTRACT DEFENSES
judgment that holds that she is obligated for the reasonable value of the medical
services rendered to her infant son.

                                          ______________________

         Review Question 1. The Odem decision uses the word "voidable" to describe a
contract. What exactly does that mean and what are the consequences for entering
into a voidable contract? How is "voidable" different than "void"? Consult section 7 of
the Restatement (Second) of Contracts (and a legal dictionary) in answering this
question. By the way, what exactly are "necessaries" and what is the rationale for
holding minors liable for them when they would not be liable for other purchases?

                         Secondary Sources

         Introductory Note. The basic analysis in infancy cases is: (1) contracts of
minors are voidable; (2) if the minor disaffirms the contract, the minor is not liable
under it; but (3) where a minor has received "necessaries" under a contract, the minor
will be required to pay for the reasonable value of what was provided. While the rules
are simple in theory, they have some twists and turns in actual practice. The
selections below summarize some of the capacity complexities of which you should be
aware.

W. E. Shipley, Infant's liability for use or depreciation of subject matter, in action
to recover purchase price upon his disaffirmance of contract to purchase goods,
12 A.L.R.3d 1174:

         Where a minor disaffirming a contract for the purchase of goods seeks to
recover payments that he has made, and the seller claims the right of recouping the
amount by which the goods in question have depreciated while in the minor's
possession, or the value of their use during that period, the courts are faced with a
troublesome choice between conflicting policies: (1) that of protecting the minor
against his own improvidence and the impositions of more mature and worldly adults,
by permitting the minor to freely avoid his contracts not for necessities, and (2) that
of doing equity to the normally innocent businessman who may otherwise be taxed
severely for the infant's benefit.

         Faced with such a choice, some courts have adopted the clear line of rigidly
enforcing the infant's right of avoidance, holding that his obligation is at most to
return such of the property purchased as remains in his hands at the time of
disaffirmance, in the condition in which it then is, and that the seller must bear any

______________________________________________________________________________

UNIT 13: CAPACITY TO CONTRACT  243
loss from the transaction, including the depreciation of the goods in question and the
value of their use while in the infant's possession.

         Other courts have gone to the opposite extreme and have conditioned the right
to disaffirmance upon the restoration of the innocent seller to status quo, holding that
in a proper case the infant's recovery must be diminished by the amount that the
property has depreciated while in his possession or (and?) the value of its use during
that period.2

         The courts or legislatures in other jurisdictions have, however, rejected both
these extreme views and have taken the position that depreciation or use may be
deducted from the minor's recovery under some circumstances but not others.

A. D. Kaufman, Infant's misrepresentation as to his age as estopping him from
disaffirming his voidable transaction, 29 A.L.R.3d 1270:

         The policy of the law to protect infants by permitting them to disaffirm
contracts into which they have entered, frequently seems to operate inequitably as to
the other contracting party who, having acted in all innocence, may be compelled to
bear the burden of his contract without being assured of any of its benefits. These
inequities are especially apparent in the situation where the other party contracted,
not only without knowledge of the infancy of his opposite number, but in reliance on
affirmative representations by the infant that he was in fact of proper age to contract.

         Faced with the dilemma of choosing between the policy of protecting infants
and that of not rewarding fraud, some courts have chosen to give overriding effect to
the rule that an infant cannot be bound by his contract and have held that
notwithstanding the fact that the contract may have been induced by the infant's
fraudulent misrepresentation of his age, it cannot be enforced against him, either at
law or in equity. Indeed, these courts have frequently gone further and held that the
infant, notwithstanding his fraud, may seek affirmative relief by suing at law to
recover such consideration as he may have paid, or by seeking a variety of equitable
remedies.

         This seemingly harsh result has usually been justified, theoretically, on the
ground that an infant without legal capacity to contract cannot be held to have

lists Alabama, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Connecticut, District of Columbia, Illinois, Minnesota,
New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Oregon, South Dakota, New

the rules vary widely, and even the rules within a single state are occasionally confusing and difficult
to ascertain.--Eds.]

244  CHAPTER V: CONTRACT DEFENSES
capacity to obtain the same result by his representations as to his age, and practically,
on the ground that to permit the other contracting party to obtain or retain benefits
under the contract on the ground of estoppel would be to emasculate the underlying
policy of protecting infants.

         Other courts, more tender toward the defrauded party, have held that a
fraudulent misrepresentation of age by an infant may estop him to disaffirm the
contract. This result has been reached more readily where the infant was seeking
affirmative relief, in a legal or equitable action to recover the consideration paid. The
courts finding an estoppel in such cases frequently advert to Lord Mansfield's dictum
that the defense of equity should be a shield and not a sword, or to such equitable
maxims as that he who seeks equity must do equity or that one coming into equity
must come with clean hands.

         Even where the infant has been made a defendant in an action on the contract,
estoppel has frequently been applied against him, in actions at law, but more
especially in equity.

         Statutes in a few jurisdictions have codified the rule that an infant may be
precluded from disaffirming where his fraudulent misrepresentations as to age
induced the contract.

Cheryl B. Preston & Brandon T. Crowther, Infancy Doctrine Inquiries, 52 SANTA
CLARA L. REV. 47 (2012):

         A minor is liable on a contract for necessaries. Society wants to allow minors
to obtain items necessary for their survival where the minor has no other means to
do so. We therefore encourage adults to enter such contracts by assuring merchants
that minors' contracts for necessities will be binding. Applicability of this exception
is based on the need of the infant at the time of contracting, rather than on the nature
of the item contracted for. This approach limits the exception dramatically, and puts
the burden on merchants to make a judgment whether an item is a necessity for a
particular minor. Although society requires such an exception, the law limits its
scope. Thus, if a minor contracts for what would generally be a necessity, but that
minor has already been provided for by his parents or his parents are willing to
provide for him, the contract is not binding and the minor is permitted to disaffirm
it. Further, even when validly contracting for necessities, the minor is never held
liable for more than the actual value of the necessities. And finally, a minor is not
bound to an executory contract to pay for necessities--only for the portion that has
been received.

         Deciding what a necessity is has been characterized by at least one court as a
two-step inquiry. First, the court must determine, as a matter of law, "whether the
subject of the contract is generally considered a necessity." This is still a nebulous
inquiry beyond the obvious categories such as food and clothing that are easily within

______________________________________________________________________________

UNIT 13: CAPACITY TO CONTRACT  245
this definition. Whether other areas, such as transportation and communication
devices, can be considered one of these categories is a more difficult inquiry. Second,
if the subject of the contract can be a necessity, the fact-finder must determine
whether it actually was a necessity to that specific minor.

         Determining what is a necessity for a minor is a fact-intensive inquiry,
although also a matter of law, and it is useful to look at what has been upheld and
rejected as a necessity in the past. Food, clothing, shelter, and medical expenses are
in the traditional category of necessities. Education also generally falls in this list.
Interestingly enough, "retaining counsel in criminal proceedings" has also been
upheld as a necessity and "under extraordinary circumstances," counsel in a civil suit
can be as well.

         The question of transportation is an interesting inquiry. Can transportation
ever constitute a necessity for an unemancipated minor? In Bowling v. Sperry, [184
N.E.2d 901 (Ind. Ct. App. 1962)], the court seemed to answer that question in the
affirmative. Although the court claimed that the car purchased by a teenager in that
case was not a necessity, the court commented that "every high school boy today
wants a car of his own, and many of them own automobiles which under given
circumstances may be considered necessaries." However, according to Bowling, a car
must be "vital to [the minor's] existence" to rise to such a level. Star Chevrolet Co. v.
Green, [473 So. 2d 157, 161 (Miss. 1985)], a more recent case, held that a car was not
a necessity for the minor. While that court seemed wary of ever allowing a car to be
a necessity, the fact that the minor had a car pool available for transportation also
factored prominently in the court's analysis. Of course, a second car would not qualify
as a necessity.

         Overall, the necessities exception to the infancy doctrine provides a consistent
and useful check on the infancy doctrine. It is unlikely to bind minors to very many
contracts, but serves as a way for minors to obtain essential goods and services
without requiring adults to take extra risks in providing them.

         Review Question 2. Certain other contracts made by minors are routinely
enforceable, including contracts to join the military, contracts to repay student loans
and contracts to provide support for the promisor's children. Why the difference in
treatment? Consider the rationale for treating certain contracts differently as you
read the following excerpt from the Credit CARD Act, passed by Congress and signed
by the President in 2009.

harmful or beneficial for college students of limited means who do not have people to
cosign for them? Should these adult students be protected from running up $5,000 in
credit card liability--which could be discharged in bankruptcy--when they are
empowered to run up $200,000 in student loans, which cannot be discharged?

their teens--including Bill Gates (Microsoft), Michael Dell (Dell Computer), and
Mark Zuckerberg (Facebook). Given that many small startup businesses rely on
credit cards for early financing, he argues that denying credit to those under 21 will
discourage entrepreneurship. Do you buy Professor Schwartz's argument, or is he
making too much out of a few exceptional examples?

                                       New York Court of Appeals

                   25 N.Y.2d 196, 250 N.E.2d 460, 303 N.Y.S.2d 362 (1969)

BREITEL, J., with whom FULD, C.J. and BURKE and BERGAN, JJ., concur:

         [Grace Ortelere was a 60-year-old teacher who had been married for 38 years.
She filed for retirement at age 60. The city's pension system allowed married retirees
to choose two options to receive benefits: (1) for the lifetime of the retiree or the
retiree's spouse, whoever lived longer, or (2) for the lifetime of the retiree alone. The
benefit for the second option was higher than for the first. Upon retirement, Ortelere
chose the second option. Unfortunately, she died just two months after retiring, which
meant that her pension payments terminated. Her husband sued to set aside her
benefit selection on the ground that at the time she made the benefit selection she
lacked mental capacity to do so. The New York Supreme Court (the trial court in that
state) found that Ortelere had been mentally incompetent; the Appellate Division
reversed. Ortelere's husband appealed to the Court of Appeals, the highest court in
New York.]

         Mrs. Ortelere, an elementary schoolteacher since 1924, suffered a "nervous
breakdown" in March, 1964 and went on a leave of absence expiring February 5, 1965.
She was then 60 years old and had been happily married for 38 years. On July 1, 1964
she came under the care of Dr. D'Angelo, a psychiatrist, who diagnosed her
breakdown as involutional psychosis, melancholia type.3 Dr. D'Angelo prescribed, and
for about six weeks decedent underwent, tranquilizer and shock therapy. Although
moderately successful, the therapy was not continued since it was suspected that she
also suffered from cerebral arteriosclerosis, an ailment later confirmed. However, the
psychiatrist continued to see her at monthly intervals until March, 1965. On March
28, 1965 she was hospitalized after collapsing at home from an aneurysm. She died
10 days later; the cause of death was "Cerebral thrombosis due to hypertensive heart
disease."

         Some years before, on June 28, 1958, she had executed a "Selection of Benefits
under Option One" naming her husband as beneficiary of the unexhausted reserve.
Under this option upon retirement her allowance would be less by way of periodic

          3 ["Involutional melancholia" is an old term for a kind of depression suffered primarily by post-
menopausal women, characterized by anxiety, feelings of guilt, despondency, and fear. At the time of
the case, the diagnosed condition was sometimes treated with electroshock therapy. The psychiatrist
who treated her, Dr. Ernani d'Angelo, was (according to his New York Times obituary) one of the first
psychiatrists in the country to do outpatient electroshock therapy for depression. Involutional
melancholia is no longer recognized by the American Psychiatric Association as a psychiatric
disorder.-Eds.]

______________________________________________________________________________

248  CHAPTER V: CONTRACT DEFENSES
retirement allowances, but if she died before receipt of her full reserve the balance of
the reserve would be payable to her husband. On June 16, 1960, two years later, she
had designated her husband as beneficiary of her service death benefits in the event
of her death prior to retirement.

         Then on February 11, 1965, when her leave of absence had just expired and
she was still under treatment, she executed a retirement application, the one here
involved, selecting the maximum retirement allowance payable during her lifetime
with nothing payable on or after death. She also, at this time, borrowed from the
system the maximum cash withdrawal permitted, namely, $8,760. Three days earlier
she had written the board, stating that she intended to retire on February 12 or 15
or as soon as she received "the information I need in order to decide whether to take
an option or maximum allowance." She then listed eight specific questions, reflecting
great understanding of the retirement system, concerning the various alternatives
available. An extremely detailed reply was sent, by letter of February 15, 1965,
although by that date it was technically impossible for her to change her selection.
However, the board's chief clerk, before whom Mrs. Ortelere executed the application,
testified that the questions were "answered verbally by me on February 11th." Her
retirement reserve totaled $62,165 (after deducting the $8,760 withdrawal), and the
difference between electing the maximum retirement allowance (no option) and the
allowance under "option one" was $901 per year or $75 per month. That is, had the
teacher selected "option one" she would have received an annual allowance of $4,494
or $375 per month, while if no option had been selected she would have received an
annual allowance of $5,395 or $450 per month. Had she not withdrawn the cash the
annual figures would be $5,247 and $6,148 respectively.

         Following her taking a leave of absence for her condition, Mrs. Ortelere had
become very depressed and was unable to care for herself. As a result, her husband
gave up his electrician's job, in which he earned $222 per week, to stay home and take
care of her on a full-time basis. She left their home only when he accompanied her.
Although he took her to the Retirement Board on February 11, 1965, he did not know
why she went, and did not question her for fear "she'd start crying hysterically that I
was scolding her. That's the way she was. And I wouldn't upset her."

         The Orteleres were in quite modest circumstances. They owned their own
home, valued at $20,000, and had $8,000 in a savings account. They also owned some
farm land worth about $5,000. Under these circumstances, as revealed in this record,
retirement for both of the Orteleres or the survivor of them had to be provided, as a
practical matter, largely out of Mrs. Ortelere's retirement benefits.

         According to Dr. D'Angelo, the psychiatrist who treated her, Mrs. Ortelere
never improved enough to "warrant my sending her back [to teaching]." A physician
for the Board of Education examined her on February 2, 1965 to determine her fitness
to return to teaching. Although not a psychiatrist but rather a specialist in internal

______________________________________________________________________________

UNIT 13: CAPACITY TO CONTRACT  249
medicine, this physician "judged that she had apparently recovered from the
depression" and that she appeared rational. However, before allowing her to return
to teaching, a report was requested from Dr. D'Angelo concerning her condition. It is
notable that the Medical Division of the Board of Education on February 24, 1965
requested that Mrs. Ortelere report to the board's "panel psychiatrist" on March 11,
1965.

         Dr. D'Angelo stated "[at] no time since she was under my care was she ever
mentally competent"; that "[mentally] she couldn't make a decision of any kind,
actually, of any kind, small or large." He also described how involutional melancholia
affects the judgment process: "They can't think rationally, no matter what the
situation is. They will even tell you, `I used to be able to think of anything and make
any decision. Now,' they say, `even getting up, I don't know whether I should get up
or whether I should stay in bed.' Or, `I don't even know how to make a slice of toast
any more.' Everything is impossible to decide, and everything is too great an effort to
even think of doing. They just don't have the effort, actually, because their nervous
breakdown drains them of all their physical energies."

         While the psychiatrist used terms referring to "rationality," it is quite evident
that Mrs. Ortelere's psychopathology did not lend itself to a classification under the
legal test of irrationality. It is undoubtedly, for this reason, that the Appellate
Division was unable to accept his testimony and the trial court's finding of
irrationality in the light of the prevailing rules as they have been formulated.

         The well-established rule is that contracts of a mentally incompetent person
who has not been adjudicated insane are voidable. Even where the contract has been
partly or fully performed it will still be avoided upon restoration of the status quo.
Verstandig v. Schlaffer, 70 N.E.2d 15 (N.Y. 1946).

         Traditionally, in this State and elsewhere, contractual mental capacity has
been measured by what is largely a cognitive test. Aldrich v. Bailey, 30 N.E. 264 (N.Y.
1892); 2 SAMUEL WILLISTON, LAW OF CONTRACTS § 256 (3D ED. 1960). Under this
standard the "inquiry" is whether the mind was "so affected as to render him wholly
and absolutely incompetent to comprehend and understand the nature of the
transaction." Aldrich v. Bailey, supra. A requirement that the party also be able to
make a rational judgment concerning the particular transaction qualified the
cognitive test. Paine v. Aldrich, 30 N.E. 725 (N.Y. 1892). Conversely, it is also well
recognized that contractual ability would be affected by insane delusions intimately
related to the particular transaction. Moritz v. Moritz, 138 N.Y.S. 124 (Sup. Ct. App.
Div. 1912), aff'd 105 N.E. 1090 (N.Y. 1914).

     These traditional standards governing competency to contract were formulated

when psychiatric knowledge was quite primitive. They fail to account for one who by

reason of mental illness is unable to control his conduct even though his cognitive

ability seems unimpaired. When these standards were evolving it was thought that

Green, Public Policies Underlying the Law of Mental Incompetency, 38 Mich. L. Rev.
1189, 1197-1202 (1940). This is no longer the prevailing view. Note, Mental Illness
and the Law of Contracts, 57 Mich. L. Rev. 1020, 1033-1036 (1959).

         Of course, the greatest movement in revamping legal notions of mental
responsibility has occurred in the criminal law. The nineteenth century cognitive test
embraced in the M'Naghten rules has long been criticized and changed by statute and
decision in many jurisdictions. See HENRY WEIHOFEN, MENTAL DISORDER AS A
CRIMINAL DEFENSE 65-68 (1954); A.L.I. Model Penal Code § 4.01.

         While the policy considerations for the criminal law and the civil law are
different, both share in common the premise that policy considerations must be based
on a sound understanding of the human mind and, therefore, its illnesses. Hence,
because the cognitive rules are, for the most part, too restrictive and rest on a false
factual basis they must be re-examined. Once it is understood that, accepting
plaintiff's proof, Mrs. Ortelere was psychotic and because of that psychosis could have
been incapable of making a voluntary selection of her retirement system benefits,
there is an issue that a modern jurisprudence should not exclude, merely because her
mind could pass a "cognition" test based on nineteenth century psychology.

         It is quite significant that Restatement (Second) of Contracts states the
modern rule on competency to contract. This is in evident recognition, and the
Reporter's Notes support this inference, that, regardless of how the cases formulated
their reasoning, the old cognitive test no longer explains the results. Thus, the new
Restatement section reads:

                  (1) A person incurs only voidable contractual duties by entering
         into a transaction if by reason of mental illness or defect * * * (b) he is
         unable to act in a reasonable manner in relation to the transaction and
         the other party has reason to know of his condition."

Restatement (Second) of Contracts § 18C (Tent. Draft No. No. 1, April 13, 1964).1 See
also RICHARD C. ALLEN, ELYCE ZENOFF FERSTER & HENRY WEIHOFEN, MENTAL
IMPAIRMENT AND LEGAL INCOMPETENCY 253, 260-282 (1968); Note, Mental Illness and
the Law of Contracts, 57 Mich. L. Rev. 1020, 1036 (1959), where it is recommended
"that a complete test for contractual incapacity should provide protection to those
persons whose contracts are merely uncontrolled reactions to their mental illness, as
well as for those who could not understand the nature and consequences of their
actions."

1 [In the final version of the Restatement (Second) of Contracts, this provision was renumbered

as section 15. As it happens, the author of this opinion, Charles Breitel, was a member of the committee

that drafted the Second Restatement, and Ortelere was the first case to rely on section 15. The drafters

promptly made the facts of the Ortelere case as "Illustration 1" to the new section.--Eds.]

UNIT 13: CAPACITY TO CONTRACT                                                                251
         The avoidance of duties under an agreement entered into by those who have
done so by reason of mental illness, but who have understanding, depends on
balancing competing policy considerations. There must be stability in contractual
relations and protection of the expectations of parties who bargain in good faith. On
the other hand, it is also desirable to protect persons who may understand the nature
of the transaction but who, due to mental illness, cannot control their conduct. Hence,
there should be relief only if the other party knew or was put on notice as to the
contractor's mental illness. Thus, the Restatement provision for avoidance
contemplates that "the other party has reason to know" of the mental illness.

         When, however, the other party is without knowledge of the contractor's
mental illness and the agreement is made on fair terms, the proposed Restatement
rule is:

     The power of avoidance under subsection (1) terminates to the extent
     that the contract has been so performed in whole or in part or the
     circumstances have so changed that avoidance would be inequitable. In
     such a case a court may grant relief on such equitable terms as the
     situation requires.

Restatement, supra, § 18C.

         The system was, or should have been, fully aware of Mrs. Ortelere's condition.
They, or the Board of Education, knew of her leave of absence for medical reasons
and the resort to staff psychiatrists by the Board of Education. Hence, the other of
the conditions for avoidance is satisfied.

         Lastly, there are no significant changes of position by the system other than
those that flow from the barest actuarial consequences of benefit selection.

         Nor should one ignore that in the relationship between retirement system and
member, and especially in a public system, there is not involved a commercial, let
alone an ordinary commercial, transaction. Instead the nature of the system and its
announced goal is the protection of its members and those in whom its members have
an interest. It is not a sound scheme which would permit 40 years of contribution and
participation in the system to be nullified by a one-instant act committed by one
known to be mentally ill. This is especially true if there would be no substantial harm
to the system if the act were avoided. On the record none may gainsay that her
selection of a "no option" retirement while under psychiatric care, ill with cerebral
arteriosclerosis, aged 60, and with a family in which she had always manifested
concern, was so unwise and foolhardy that a factfinder might conclude that it was
explainable only as a product of psychosis.

         On this analysis it is not difficult to see that plaintiff's evidence was sufficient
to sustain a finding that, when she acted as she did on February 11, 1965, she did so
solely as a result of serious mental illness, namely, psychosis. Of course, nothing less
serious than medically classified psychosis should suffice or else few contracts would

______________________________________________________________________________

252                         CHAPTER V: CONTRACT DEFENSES
be invulnerable to some kind of psychological attack. Mrs. Ortelere's psychiatrist
testified quite flatly that as an involutional melancholiac in depression she was
incapable of making a voluntary "rational" decision. Of course, as noted earlier, the
trial court's finding and perhaps some of the testimony attempted to fit into the
rubrics of the traditional rules. For that reason rather than reinstatement of the
judgment at Trial Term there should be a new trial under the proper standards
frankly considered and applied.

         Accordingly, the order of the Appellate Division should be reversed, without
costs, and the action remanded to Trial Term for a new trial.

JASEN, J., with whom SCILEPPI, J., concurs, dissenting:

         Where there has been no previous adjudication of incompetency, the burden of
proving mental incompetence is upon the party alleging it. I agree with the majority
at the Appellate Division that the plaintiff, the husband of the decedent, failed to
sustain the burden incumbent upon him of proving deceased's incompetence.

         The evidence conclusively establishes that the decedent, at the time she made
her application to retire, understood not only that she was retiring, but also that she
had selected the maximum payment during her lifetime.

         Indeed, the letter written by the deceased to the Teachers' Retirement System
prior to her retirement demonstrates her full mental capacity to understand and to
decide whether to take an option or the maximum allowance. The full text of the letter
reads as follows:

February 8, 1965

* * *

Gentlemen:

         I would like to retire on Feb. 12 or Feb. 15. In other words, just as soon as possible
after I receive the information I need in order to decide whether to take an option or
maximum allowance. Following are the questions I would like to have answered:

       1. What is my "average" five-year salary?

       2. What is my maximum allowance?

         3. I am 60 years old. If I select option four-a with a beneficiary (female) 27 years
younger, what is my allowance?

         4. If I select four-a on the pension part only, and take the maximum annuity, what
is my allowance?

         5. If I take a loan of 89% of my year's salary before retirement, what would my
maximum allowance be?

         6. If I take a loan of $5,000 before retiring, and select option four-a on both the
pension and annuity, what would my allowance be?

______________________________________________________________________________

UNIT 13: CAPACITY TO CONTRACT                            253
              7. What is my total service credit? I have been on a leave without pay since Oct.
     26, 1964.

     8. What is the `factor' used for calculating option four-a with the above beneficiary?

              Thank you for your promptness in making the necessary calculations. I will come
     to your office on Thursday afternoon of this week.

It seems clear that this detailed, explicit and extremely pertinent list of queries
reveals a mind fully in command of the salient features of the Teachers' Retirement
System. Certainly, it cannot be said that the decedent could possess sufficient
capacity to compose a letter indicating such a comprehensive understanding of the
retirement system, and yet lack the capacity to understand the answers.

         As I read the record, the evidence establishes that the decedent's election to
receive maximum payments was predicated on the need for a higher income to
support two retired persons--her husband and herself. Since the only source of
income available to decedent and her husband was decedent's retirement pay, the
additional payment of $75 per month which she would receive by electing the
maximal payment was a necessity. Indeed, the additional payments represented an
increase of 20% over the benefits payable under option 1. Under these circumstances,
an election of maximal income during decedent's lifetime was not only a rational, but
a necessary decision.

         Further indication of decedent's knowledge of the financial needs of her family
is evidenced by the fact that she took a loan for the maximum amount ($8,760)
permitted by the retirement system, at the time she made application for retirement.
Moreover, there is nothing in the record to indicate that the decedent had any
warning, premonition, knowledge or indication at the time of retirement that her life
expectancy was, in any way, reduced by her condition.

         Decedent's election of the maximum retirement benefits, therefore, was not so
contrary to her best interests so as to create an inference of her mental incompetence.
Indeed, concerning election of options under a retirement system, it has been held:
"Even where no previous election has been made, the court must make the election
for an incompetent which would be in accordance with what would have been his
manifest and reasonable choice if he were sane, and, in the absence of convincing
evidence that the incompetent would have made a different selection, it is presumed
that he would have chosen the option yielding the largest returns in his lifetime."
Schwartzberg v. Teachers' Retirement Bd., 76 N.Y.S.2d 488 (Sup. Ct. App. Div.), aff'd
83 N.E.2d 146 (N.Y. 1948) (emphasis supplied).

         Nor can I agree with the majority's view that the traditional rules governing
competency to contract "are, for the most part, too restrictive and rest on a false
factual basis."

         The issue confronting the courts concerning mental capacity to contract is
under what circumstances and conditions should a party be relieved of contractual

______________________________________________________________________________

254  CHAPTER V: CONTRACT DEFENSES
obligations freely entered. This is peculiarly a legal decision, although, of course,
available medical knowledge forms a datum which influences the legal choice. It is
common knowledge that the present state of psychiatric knowledge is inadequate to
provide a fixed rule for each and every type of mental disorder. Thus, the generally
accepted rules which have evolved to determine mental responsibility are general
enough in application to encompass all types of mental disorders, and phrased in a
manner which can be understood and practically applied by juries composed of
laymen.

         The generally accepted test of mental competency to contract which has thus
evolved is whether the party attempting to avoid the contract was capable of
understanding and appreciating the nature and consequences of the particular act or
transaction which he challenges. Schwartzberg, supra. This rule represents a balance
struck between policies to protect the security of transactions between individuals
and freedom of contract on the one hand, and protection of those mentally
handicapped on the other hand. In my opinion, this rule has proven workable in
practice and fair in result. In the final analysis, the lay jury will infer the state of the
party's mind from his observed behavior as indicated by the evidence presented at
trial. Each juror instinctively judges what is normal and what is abnormal conduct
from his own experience, and the generally accepted test harmonizes the competing
policy considerations with human experience to achieve the fairest result in the
greatest number of cases.

         As in every situation where the law must draw a line between liability and
nonliability, between responsibility and nonresponsibility, there will be borderline
cases, and injustices may occur by deciding erroneously that an individual belongs on
one side of the line or the other. To minimize the chances of such injustices occurring,
the line should be drawn as clearly as possible.

         The Appellate Division correctly found that the deceased was capable of
understanding the nature and effect of her retirement benefits, and exercised rational
judgment in electing to receive the maximum allowance during her lifetime. I fear
that the majority's refinement of the generally accepted rules will prove unworkable
in practice, and make many contracts vulnerable to psychological attack. Any benefit
to those who understand what they are doing, but are unable to exercise self-
discipline, will be outweighed by frivolous claims which will burden our courts and
undermine the security of contracts. The reasonable expectations of those who
innocently deal with persons who appear rational and who understand what they are
doing should be protected.

         Accordingly, I would affirm the order appealed from.

UNIT 13: CAPACITY TO CONTRACT  255
         Review Question 5. In McGovern v. Commonwealth, 512 Pa. 377, 517 A.2d 523
(1986), a case with nearly identical facts, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court rejected
Ortelere, and refused to adopt the Restatement § 15 test. The court reiterated the
traditional test:

         Under Pennsylvania law, it is presumed that an adult is competent to
         enter into an agreement, and a signed document gives rise to the
         presumption that it accurately expresses the state of mind of the signing
         party." Mere mental weakness, if it does not amount to inability to
         comprehend the contract, and is unaccompanied by evidence of
         imposition or undue influence, is insufficient to set aside a contract.
         Finally, a presumption of mental incapacity does not arise merely
         because of an unreasonable or unnatural disposition of property.

Both Ortelere and McGovern are 4-2 decisions with strong dissents. Which one is the
better approach and why?

Problem 13.1

         Steven is seventeen, is 6'2" and 230 pounds with a short goatee, and he looks
to be in his mid-20s. He has been married to his high school sweetheart Tabitha for
six months; they have a newborn daughter named Abby. Steven has just dropped out
of high school to take a good job in the oil fields, which allows him to support his new
family. He plans to get his GED in his spare time. For his job, however, he needs a
reliable car to get to and from the oilfields, where there is no public transportation.
His old Chevy Impala has not been suitable.

         Steven goes to Car Dealer, and signs a contract to purchase a new red Ford
Mustang for $22,000. In entering the transaction he shows Dealer a fake driver's
license which shows him as being 20 years old. Through Dealer, he secures a loan to
pay for the car, which gives him monthly payments of $423.

         A few days after he turns 18, Steven decides he no longer likes the Mustang.
Dust, grit, and particulate matter in the oilfields have already begun to scratch up
the paint, there are significant scratches on the bumpers, and he now thinks he would
prefer a pickup truck. He wants to disaffirm the contract and get his money back. He
returns the car to Dealer. The age of majority in the state is 18.

         What are Steven's arguments that he should be able to get out of the contract
and get his money back? What are the dealer's arguments that he should be required
to keep the car and make the payments he promised to make?

Problem 13.2

         Roman has just turned 17. His father has given him an old Honda Civic to
drive. The car is registered in Roman's name. Under state law, Roman is required to
buy auto insurance that provides for $30,000 of liability coverage. The policy has a
provision, standard in such contracts, providing that the claim will not be paid unless
notice is given to the insurance company within 60 days of the accident giving rise to
the claim. The provision is designed to permit the insurance company to investigate
the claim promptly and prior court decisions have held that it is reasonable. Roman
purchases the policy. He indicates on the policy that he is 18, but no identification is
required.

         A few weeks later Roman is driving when his car crosses the center divider and
hits an oncoming car. Both cars are totaled; two persons in the other vehicle are
injured, one of whom requires hospitalization for a week. Roman is ticketed for the
offense. He does not report the matter to his insurance company because he believes
his premiums will go up.

         Several months later, just before his eighteenth birthday, Roman he is sued by
the driver of the other car. He finally notifies the insurance company, which declines
coverage because he did not give the required notice. Roman tells the insurance
company that the accident was actually caused by the fact that the car for some
reason stopped responding to the steering wheel, probably due to some defect.
Roman's car was, however, taken to a scrap yard and junked six months after the
accident, so it is impossible to tell what happened.

         Can Roman make the insurance company pay? Why or why not?

Problem 13.3

         Sherman is a money manager in New York. He is brilliant and successful, but
he has always suffered from bipolar disorder, which means that his mood will often
swing sharply between almost manic enthusiasm and bouts of deep depression. In
recent years the disorder has become more severe. He has prescription medication to
deal with it, but he is not good about taking the medication regularly.

         One day, while playing golf at a private course where he was taken by a friend,
he starts chatting with the clubhouse manager. The manager mentions that the club
has not been profitable lately and that the property is for sale, perhaps to a developer
who will convert it into another use. Sherman is intensely interested. He immediately
calls the club president, who puts him in touch with the real estate broker who is
representing the property. He meets with the broker a few hours later, gets a few
more details. On the spot he agrees to buy the property. He tells the broker that he

______________________________________________________________________________

UNIT 13: CAPACITY TO CONTRACT  257
will pay the full listed price of $3.2 million provided they can get the deal done that
evening, saying that he does not want anyone else to have a chance at it.

         The broker is surprised by the speed of his decision. Sherman waves a hand,
gives her a business card, and explains what he does. As a high-level money manager,
he is used to making quick decisions, he says, and this is, for him, a relatively small-
potatoes deal. When you wait around, he says, you lose the chance for a great deal.
He who hesitates is lost. A couple of hundred thousand on the purchase price, he says
(waving a hand airily) will not make much of a difference in the success of the project
he has in mind. He does not say exactly what the project is he has in mind.

         The broker, excusing herself for a few minutes, ostensibly to go to the restroom,
does a quick Internet check and determines that Sherman is exactly who he says he
is. She finds him to be loud and overbearing and thinks he laughs too much--
sometimes for no apparent reason--but his credit is good. She quickly prepares a brief
memorandum which they both sign. Sherman hands her a personal check for $50,000
as earnest money. The next day she deposits the check and it clears without difficulty.

         Right about the same time, though, Sherman tries to kill himself with a
kitchen knife, slashing his wrists in the bathtub. He is not successful. Discovered by
his housekeeper, he is rushed to the hospital for treatment. He is examined
thoroughly. Physicians from the hospital will testify he had previously tried to kill
himself and had stopped taking his medication. On the night of the golf course deal,
they will testify, Sherman was under the influence of his disorder and unable to make
fully rational decisions.

         Sherman wants to get out of the golf course deal, saying that he was in the
manic stage of his disorder and should not be held to the deal. The golf course owners
want to hold him to it.

         Can Sherman void the deal on grounds of incapacity? How would this problem
come out if Pennsylvania law (see Review Question 5, above) or the approach of the
Ortelere dissent applied, rather than the New York law stated by the Ortelere
majority?

                       The Statute of Frauds

                                FOCUS OF THIS UNIT

         The thing that lawyers call the statute of frauds is actually misnamed. In the
United States, hundreds upon hundreds of statutes of frauds are in existence because
"statute of frauds" is the term that has come to be used for any requirement that
certain legal documents be in writing to be effective. The rules on the books today
(and the vast majority of them are in the form of a statute) do, however, all descend
from a single act of Parliament that we may correctly call the Statute of Frauds, and
it is the starting point to understand writing requirements in American contract law
today.

         Begin When Writing Was Rare. In the early days of English law--the first few
hundred years after the Norman Conquest, relatively few contracts were in writing
because relatively few people could write. In Property class, you may have heard
about conveying land by livery of seisin, the transfer or formally handing over a piece
of the sod in front of witnesses. In an age when almost no laymen (or nobles, for that
matter) could write, most deals were oral.

         Over time, however, growth in trade and education meant that writings
became more common and important, and more people sought to memorialize major
transactions with a writing. This was helped by a system of creating deeds that could
be recorded, so that people (especially the tax collectors) could tell who owned what.
Writing had obvious advantages over oral transactions, since the latter depended on
memory (which could be faulty) and on the honesty of the witnesses (which was not
always perfect). Because of the intricacies of British judicial procedure, a class of
professional witnesses would actually hang around courts of law waiting for work.
They would willingly swear to anything, so long as they were paid for doing so. This
situation created fertile grounds for fraud.

Parliament Acts. In 1677, Parliament passed (with the assent of King Charles

II) "An act for prevention of many Fraudulent Practices which are commonly

______________________________________________________________________________

UNIT 14: THE STATUTE OF FRAUDS                      259
endeavoured to be upheld by Perjury and Subornation of Perjury"--which became
known as the Statute of Frauds. It required that certain kinds of transactions--those
of most interest to the powerful landowners who dominated the Parliament of the
day--be put in writing or else be unenforceable.

         Land, for example, was the principal measure of wealth in England. A tenant
farmer could claim that his local landlord had promised to sell him the land he farmed
for £100. The farmer could bring in paid witnesses to swear to the deal, and the
landlord might lose. Landlords wanted these transactions in writing. Similarly, the
family structure of the upper classes meant that in important families there would
be a single head who, through primogeniture, would own most of the family property.
This means that anyone owed anything by a member of the family would always try
to seek some way of holding the rich head of the family liable. Thus, someone who
had loaned money to a younger son might try to prove that the head of the family had
agreed to stand surety for son's debts, which again could easily be proved by oral
testimony. Or when the head of the family was appointed executor for a junior
member of the family who died in debt, the decedent's creditors might claim that the
head of the family had promised to pay the creditors out of the head's own large
fortune, rather than the deceased's own small estate. Similarly, in a large household
with often hundreds of employees, it was easy for a butler or gardener to claim that
the head of the family had promised him a lifetime contract. Finally, given that most
marriages in upper-class families were arranged, and were accompanied by complex
financial arrangements, it was not uncommon for the family of the bride or groom to
claim that the other party's family had orally promised to provide the new couple
with some estate or with some amount of money.

         Thus, these heads of the family--who made up the House of Lords and most of
the House of Commons--required that these sorts of contracts be in writing to be
enforceable.

         The English Statute Comes to America. The first American states received
the original English statute of frauds because they were English colonies when the
law was passed. Later states legislatively or judicially adopted the rules from these
first colonies. Since 1677, the idea of a writing requirement for certain contracts has
been extremely popular with legislatures, who have crafted thousands of specific
requirements that certain legal documents be put in writing to be enforceable.

         The Statute FOR Frauds? A requirement of a writing sometimes does indeed
keep people from being bound by contracts to which they never agreed, and in that
regard, statutes of frauds live up to their name and prevent fraud. Consider, however,
that the writing requirement sometimes allows a party who actually has agreed to a
contract to escape liability because the agreement was not reduced to a writing. Even
if fifty eyewitnesses could accurately testify as to what the promisor orally contracted
to do, the contract would not be enforceable. Judges eventually found it irksome that
a party could escape liability on this kind of "technicality" when all the other

______________________________________________________________________________

260  CHAPTER V: CONTRACT DEFENSES
requirements of a contract were met. Over time judges began shrinking the scope of
the statute and inventing exceptions for certain sets of facts. While many judges
strongly support the idea of the statute, many others would like to see it abolished,
being convinced that it causes more fraud than it prevents. The Restatement (Second)
of Contracts has an entire chapter entitled the "The Statute of Frauds" covering
sections 110 through 150. Skimming that chapter will give you some idea of the scope
and extent of exceptions that have developed.

         The British Parliament effectively repealed the original Statute of Frauds in
1954, so it no longer applies in the place of its birth. The United Nations Convention
on the International Sale of Goods also does not contain a requirement that contracts
be in writing. Statutes of frauds are, however, alive and well in the United States,
creating an area where American contract law differs significantly both from civil
code countries (like most of Continental Europe, for instance) and even from other
common law countries. To be clear, contracts in other legal systems commonly are in
writing and those writings are given effect. Everyone recognizes that a writing can
add certainty to a transaction. The rest of the world is simply not as enamored with
the requirement of a writing as Americans are.

         What Does It Mean To Be Within the Statute? Samuel Goldwyn, the movie
mogul, allegedly once said that "An oral contract isn't worth the paper it's written
on." By now you should know that Goldwyn's statement is not entirely accurate. Oral
contracts are just as enforceable as written ones--unless they fall within the statute.
Notice that language. A contract is said to be "within the statute" if a writing is
required. If a contract is the kind for which no writing is required, such as an
employment contract for a year, it is not "within" the statute.

         Standing on MY LEGS. Two broad kinds of questions arise under the statute
of frauds. The first is which contracts are covered. The second is what counts as a
suitable signed writing. A complete list of contracts where writings are required
would vary greatly from state to state. Nonetheless, six "classic" categories derive
from the original English statute and are so common in American jurisdictions that
they are embodied in the overall list contained in section 110 of the Restatement
(Second) of Contracts and--for sales of goods--section 2-201 of the Uniform
Commercial Code. You should read those two legal authorities now.

         Law students for generations have memorized these six categories, many of
them using the mnemonic MY LEGS, which we offer you in the list below. We

         G Contracts for sales of GOODS above $500.1 Recall that the Uniform
Commercial Code defines goods are things that are "tangible" and "moveable," which
does not include real estate, services, and intangible legal rights. See Uniform
Commercial Code § 2-201.

         S SURETYSHIP contracts. These are contracts under which one party
agrees to be liable for the debts of someone else. The most common type is what you
know as a "co-signer" on a loan, but there are other types. See Restatement (Second)
of Contracts §§ 112-123.

If a contract falls into one of these categories, it is not enforceable unless it meets the
requirements of the statute.

         What Kind of Writing Satisfies the Statute? Once a contract is within the
Statute of Frauds, we must determine what exactly qualifies as a sufficient writing
for purposes of the statute. A writing that satisfies the statute might not, for example,
necessarily contain all the terms of the parties contract. A qualifying writing
generally must be signed or otherwise subscribed by the person who is said to be
bound by the deal.

         These issues were simple to address in 1677: all legal documents were
handwritten and either hand-signed or formally sealed by the parties. Introduction
of new technologies since that time--pre-printed forms, telegraphs, fax machines,
electronic mail, digital ordering systems, text messaging, and more--has made
statute of frauds issues more complicated at times. Both the U.S. Congress and state
legislatures have tried to bridge the gap between the statute of frauds and the digital
age with statutes providing for the treatment of electronic messages. Prominent
examples of legislation on point include the state-law Uniform Electronic
Transactions Act ("UETA"), excerpted later in these materials, and the federal

amount to $5,000. For reasons we won't bore you with at the moment, Revised Article 2 failed to gain

any traction in state legislatures was ultimately withdrawn by its drafters. Hence, the Article 2 statute

of frauds threshold remains at $500, capturing many smaller deals that the original statute wasn't

intended to reach. - Eds.]

                            McINERNEY v. CHARTER GOLF, INC.
                                         Supreme Court of Illinois

                               176 Ill. 2d 482, 680 N.E.2d 1347 (1997)

HEIPLE, J.

         From 1988 through 1992, Dennis McInerney worked as a sales representative
for Charter Golf, Inc., a company which manufactures and sells golf apparel and
supplies. Initially, McInerney's territory included Illinois but was later expanded to
include Indiana and Wisconsin. In 1989, McInerney allegedly was offered a position
as an exclusive sales representative for Hickey-Freeman, an elite clothier which
manufactured a competing line of golf apparel. Hickey-Freeman purportedly offered
McInerney an 8% commission.

         Intending to inform Charter Golf of his decision to accept the Hickey-Freeman
offer of employment, McInerney called Jerry Montiel, Charter Golf's president.
Montiel wanted McInerney to continue to work for Charter Golf and urged McInerney
to turn down the Hickey-Freeman offer. Montiel promised to guarantee McInerney a
10% commission on sales in Illinois and Wisconsin "for the remainder of his life," in
a position where he would be subject to discharge only for dishonesty or disability.
McInerney allegedly accepted Charter Golf's offer and, in exchange for the guarantee
of lifetime employment, gave up the Hickey-Freeman offer. McInerney then
continued to work for Charter Golf.

         In 1992, the relationship between Charter Golf and McInerney soured: Charter
Golf fired McInerney. McInerney then filed a complaint in the circuit court of Cook
County, alleging breach of contract. The trial court granted Charter Golf's motion for
summary judgment after concluding that the alleged oral contract was unenforceable
under the statute of frauds because the contract amounted to an agreement which
could not be performed within a year from its making. The appellate court affirmed,
but on a wholly different ground.2

         Charter Golf argues that the oral contract at issue in this case violates the
statute of frauds and is unenforceable because it is not capable of being performed
within one year of its making. By statute in Illinois, "no action shall be brought * * *

     2 [The intermediate appellate court held that there was no consideration for the promise of

lifetime employment. In a part of this opinion not included here, the court held that there was, in fact,

consideration for the promise. -Eds.]

upon any agreement that is not to be performed within the space of one year from the
making thereof, unless * * * [the agreement is] in writing and signed by the party to
be charged." 740 Ill. Cons. Stat. 80/1 (West 1994). Our statute tracks the language of
the original English Statute of Frauds and Perjuries. 29 Charles II ch. 3 (1676). The
English statute enacted by Parliament had as its stated purpose the prohibition of
those "many fraudulent practices, which are commonly endeavored to be upheld by
perjury and subordination of perjury." Illinois' statute of frauds seeks to do the same
by barring actions based upon nothing more that loose verbal statements.

         The period of one year, although arbitrary, recognizes that with the passage of
time evidence becomes stale and memories fade. The statute proceeds from the
legislature's sound conclusion that while the technical elements of a contract may
exist, certain contracts should not be enforced absent a writing. It functions more as
an evidentiary safeguard than as a substantive rule of contract. As such, the statute
exists to protect not just the parties to a contract, but also--perhaps more
importantly--to protect the fact finder from charlatans, perjurers and the problems
of proof accompanying oral contracts.

         There are, of course, exceptions to the statute of frauds' writing requirement
that permit the enforcement of certain oral contracts required by the statute to be in
writing. One such exception is the judicially created exclusion for contracts of
uncertain duration. In an effort to significantly narrow the application of the statute,
many courts have construed the words "not to be performed" to mean "not capable of
being performed" within one year. See Restatement (Second) of Contracts § 130
(1981). These cases hold that if performance is possible by its terms within one year,
the contract is not within the statute regardless of how unlikely it is that it will
actually be performed within one year. Under this interpretation, the actual course
of subsequent events and the expectations of the parties are entirely irrelevant.
Restatement (Second) of Contracts § 130, Comment a (1981). A contract for lifetime
employment would then be excluded from the operation of the statute because the
employee could, in theory, die within one year, and thus the contract would be
"capable of being performed."

         We find such an interpretation hollow and unpersuasive. A "lifetime"
employment contract is, in essence, a permanent employment contract. Inherently, it
anticipates a relationship of long duration--certainly longer than one year. In the
context of an employment-for-life contract, we believe that the better view is to treat
the contract as one "not to be performed within the space of one year from the making
thereof." To hold otherwise would eviscerate the policy underlying the statute of
frauds and would invite confusion, uncertainty and outright fraud. Accordingly, we
hold that a writing is required for the fair enforcement of lifetime employment
contracts.

UNIT 14: THE STATUTE OF FRAUDS  265
NICKELS, J., dissenting.

         I disagree with the majority's holding that the employment contract in the case
at bar must be in writing because it falls within the requirements of the Statute of
Frauds.

         The writing requirement applies to "any agreement that is not to be performed
within the space of one year from the making thereof." Commenting on this language,
the Restatement (Second) of Contracts observes:

     [T]he enforceability of a contract under the one-year provision does not
     turn on the actual course of subsequent events, nor on the expectations
     of the parties as to the probabilities. Contracts of uncertain duration are
     simply excluded; the provision covers only those contracts whose
     performance cannot possibly be completed within a year.

Rest. 2d. Contracts § 130, cmt. a.

         A contract of employment for life is necessarily one of uncertain duration. Since
the employee's life may end within one year, and, as the majority acknowledges, the
contract would be fully performed upon the employee's death, the contract is not
subject to the statute of frauds' one-year provision. See Rest. 2d § 130, illus. 2; see also
72 AM. JUR. 2D, Statute of Frauds § 14 (1974) ("The rule generally accepted by the
authorities is that an agreement or promise the performance or duration of which is
contingent on the duration of human life is not within the statute"); JOHN D.
CALAMARI & JOSEPH M. PERILLO, THE LAW OF CONTRACTS § 19-20 (3d ed. 1987) ("if A
promises *** to employ X for life, the promise is not within the Statute because it is
not for a fixed term and the contract by its terms is conditioned upon the continued
life of X and the condition may cease to exist within a year because X may die within
a year"). It is irrelevant whether the parties anticipate that the employee will live for
more than a year or whether the employee actually does so.

         The majority acknowledges that "many courts" subscribe to this view. More
accurately, the Restatement rule represents "the prevailing interpretation" of the
statute of frauds' one-year provision. Restatement (Second) of Contracts § 130,
Comment a, at 328 (1981). Only a "distinct minority" of cases have ascribed
significance to whether the parties expected that a contract would take more than a
year to perform. CALAMARI & PERILLO, § 19-18, at 808. According to Williston on
Contracts:

              It is well settled that the oral contracts invalidated by the Statute
     because not to be performed within a year include only those which
     cannot be performed within that period. A promise which is not likely to
     be performed within a year, and which in fact is not performed within a
     year, is not within the Statute if at the time the contract is made there
     is a possibility in law and in fact that full performance such as the
     parties intended may be completed before the expiration of a year.

                  In the leading case on this section of the Statute the Supreme
         Court of the United States said: "The parties may well have expected
         that the contract would continue in force for more than one year; it may
         have been very improbable that it would not do so; and it did in fact
         continue in force for a much longer time. But they made no stipulation
         which in terms, or by reasonable inference, required that result. The
         question is not what the probable, or expected, or actual performance of
         the contract was; but whether the contract, according to the reasonable
         interpretation of its terms, required that it should not be performed
         within the year."

3 W. JAEGER, WILLISTON ON CONTRACTS § 495 at 575-79 (3d ed. 1960), quoting Warner
v. Texas & Pacific Ry. Co., 164 U.S. 418 (1896).

         Although the majority brands this interpretation "hollow and unpersuasive,"
it has a sound basis in the plain language of the statute. Corbin notes:

         [Courts] have observed the exact words of [the one-year] provision and
         have interpreted them literally and very narrowly. The words are
         "agreement that is not to be performed." They are not "agreement that
         is not in fact performed" or "agreement that may not be performed" or
         "agreement that is not at all likely to be performed." To fall within the
         words of the provision, therefore, the agreement must be one of which it
         can truly be said at the very moment that it is made, "This agreement
         is not to be performed within one year"; in general, the cases indicate
         that there must not be the slightest possibility that it can be fully
         performed within one year."

2 ARTHUR L. CORBIN, CORBIN ON CONTRACTS § 444, at 535 (1950).

         Courts have tended to give the one-year provision a narrow construction
precisely because of the lack of a discernable rationale for it. See Rest. 2d § 130, cmt.
a ("The design was said to be not to trust to the memory of witnesses for a longer time
than one year, but the statutory language was not appropriate to carry out that
purpose. The result has been a tendency to construction narrowing the application of
the statute"). I am inclined to do likewise. Since the one-year provision is so poorly
suited to the aims it was ostensibly designed to accomplish, I see no compelling reason
to expand the provision's scope beyond the class of contracts to which it applies by its
terms. The narrow and literal interpretation that most courts have given to the
language of the one-year provision is entirely appropriate under these circumstances.

prove the existence of a contract in another way, is it fair to require a writing? Should
the legal system reward formality and penalize less formal deal-making? If you think
the answer to the previous question is "yes," then does that make you part of the
problem many people have with transactional lawyers--that they slow down deals

                        305 N.Y. 48, 110 N.E.2d 551 (1953)

FULD, J.

         In September of 1947, Nate Crabtree entered into preliminary negotiations
with Elizabeth Arden Sales Corporation, manufacturers and sellers of cosmetics,
looking toward his employment as sales manager. Interviewed on September 26th,
by Robert P. Johns, executive vice-president and general manager of the corporation,
who had apprised him of the possible opening, Crabtree requested a three-year
contract at $25,000 a year. Explaining that he would be giving up a secure well-
paying job to take a position in an entirely new field of endeavor--which he believed
would take him some years to master--he insisted upon an agreement for a definite
term. And he repeated his desire for a contract for three years to Miss Elizabeth
Arden, the corporation's president.3 When Miss Arden finally indicated that she was
prepared to offer a two-year contract, based on an annual salary of $20,000 for the
first six months, $25,000 for the second six months and $30,000 for the second year,
plus expenses of $5,000 a year for each of those years, Crabtree replied that that offer
was "interesting." Miss Arden thereupon had her personal secretary make this
memorandum4 on a telephone order blank that happened to be at hand:

         A few days later, Crabtree "phoned Mr. Johns and telegraphed Miss Arden; he
accepted the `invitation to join the Arden organization,'" and Miss Arden wired back
her "welcome." When he reported for work, a "pay-roll change" card was made up and
initialed by Mr. Johns, and then forwarded to the payroll department. Reciting that
it was prepared on September 30, 1947, and was to be effective as of October 22d, it
specified the names of the parties, Crabtree's "Job Classification" and, in addition,
contained the notation that

"This employee is to be paid as follows:

First six months of employment $20,000. per annum

Next six months of employment 25,000. per annum

After one year of employment 30,000. per annum

Approved by RPJ [initialed]"

         After six months of employment, Crabtree received the scheduled increase
from $20,000 to $25,000, but the further specified increase at the end of the year was
not paid. Both Mr. Johns and the comptroller of the corporation, Mr. Carstens, told
Crabtree that they would attempt to straighten out the matter with Miss Arden, and,
with that in mind, the comptroller prepared another "pay-roll change" card, to which
his signature is appended, noting that there was to be a "Salary increase" from
$25,000 to $30,000 a year, "per contractual arrangements with Miss Arden." The
latter, however, refused to approve the increase and, after further fruitless
discussion, plaintiff left defendant's employ and commenced this action for breach of
contract.

______________________________________________________________________________

UNIT 14: THE STATUTE OF FRAUDS                     269
         At the ensuing trial, defendant denied the existence of any agreement to
employ plaintiff for two years, and further contended that, even if one had been made,
the statute of frauds barred its enforcement. The trial court found against defendant
on both issues and awarded plaintiff damages of about $14,000, and the Appellate
Division, two justices dissenting, affirmed. Since the contract relied upon was not to
be performed within a year, the primary question for decision is whether there was a
memorandum of its terms, subscribed by defendant, to satisfy the statute of frauds.

         Each of the two payroll cards--the one initialed by defendant's general
manager, the other signed by its comptroller--unquestionably constitutes a
memorandum under the statute. That they were not prepared or signed with the
intention of evidencing the contract, or that they came into existence subsequent to
its execution, is of no consequence. See Marks v. Cowdin, 123 N.E. 139 (N.Y. 1919). It
is enough, to meet the statute's demands, that they were signed with intent to
authenticate the information contained therein and that such information does
evidence the terms of the contract. Those two writings contain all of the essential
terms of the contract--the parties to it, the position that plaintiff was to assume, the
salary that he was to receive--except that relating to the duration of plaintiff's
employment. Accordingly, we must consider whether that item, the length of the
contract, may be supplied by reference to the earlier unsigned office memorandum,
and, if so, whether its notation, "2 years to make good," sufficiently designates a
period of employment.

         The statute of frauds does not require the "memorandum * * * to be in one
document. It may be pieced together out of separate writings, connected with one
another either expressly or by the internal evidence of subject matter and occasion."
Marks v. Cowdin, supra; see also Restatement, Contracts, § 208(a) (1932).5 Where
each of the separate writings has been subscribed by the party to be charged, little if
any difficulty is encountered. Where, however, some writings have been signed, and
others have not--as in the case before us--there is basic disagreement as to what
constitutes a sufficient connection permitting the unsigned papers to be considered
as part of the statutory memorandum. The courts of some jurisdictions insist that
there be a reference, of varying degrees of specificity, in the signed writing to that
unsigned, and, if there is no such reference, they refuse to permit consideration of the
latter in determining whether the memorandum satisfies the statute. See, e.g.,
Osborn v. Phelps, 19 Conn. 63 (1848) ; Hewitt Grain & Provision Co. v. Spear, 193
N.W. 291 (Mich. 1923). That conclusion is based upon a construction of the statute
which requires that the connection between the writings and defendant's
acknowledgment of the one not subscribed, appear from examination of the papers

     5 [This reference is to the First Restatement of Contracts. You can (and should) locate the rules

on what constitutes a sufficient memorandum to satisfy the statute of frauds in the Restatement

(Second) of Contracts §§ 131-137. Section 132 is the one that specifically addresses the point raised

here by the court- Eds.]

alone, without the aid of parol evidence. The other position--which has gained
increasing support over the years--is that a sufficient connection between the papers
is established simply by a reference in them to the same subject matter or transaction.
See, e.g., Frost v. Alward, 169 P. 379 (Cal. 1917); Lerned v. Wannemacher, 91 Mass.
412. (1864). The statute is not pressed "to the extreme of a literal and rigid logic,"
Marks v. Cowdin, supra, and oral testimony is admitted to show the connection
between the documents and to establish the acquiescence, of the party to be charged,
to the contents of the one unsigned. See Beckwith v. Talbot, 95 U.S. 289 (1877).

         The view last expressed impresses us as the more sound, and, indeed--
although several of our cases appear to have gone the other way, see, e.g., Newbery v.
Wall, 65 N.Y. 484 (1875); Wilson v. Lewiston Mill Co., 44 N.E. 959 (N.Y. 1896)--this
court has on a number of occasions approved the rule, and we now definitively adopt
it, permitting the signed and unsigned writings to be read together, provided that
they clearly refer to the same subject matter or transaction. See, e.g., Peabody v.
Speyers, 56 N.Y. 230 (1874); Raubitschek v. Blank, 80 N.Y. 478 (1880); Peck v.
Vandemark, 1 N.E. 41 (N.Y. 1885); Coe v. Tough, 22 N.E. 550 (N.Y. 1889); Delaware
Mills v. Carpenter Bros., 139 N.E. 725 (N.Y. 1923).

         The language of the statute--"Every agreement * * * is void, unless * * * some
note or memorandum thereof be in writing, and subscribed by the party to be
charged"--does not impose the requirement that the signed acknowledgment of the
contract must appear from the writings alone, unaided by oral testimony. The danger
of fraud and perjury, generally attendant upon the admission of parol evidence, is at
a minimum in a case such as this. None of the terms of the contract are supplied by
parol. All of them must be set out in the various writings presented to the court, and
at least one writing, the one establishing a contractual relationship between the
parties, must bear the signature of the party to be charged, while the unsigned
document must on its face refer to the same transaction as that set forth in the one
that was signed. Parol evidence--to portray the circumstances surrounding the
making of the memorandum--serves only to connect the separate documents and to
show that there was assent, by the party to be charged, to the contents of the one
unsigned. If that testimony does not convincingly connect the papers, or does not
show assent to the unsigned paper, it is within the province of the judge to conclude,
as a matter of law, that the statute has not been satisfied. True, the possibility still
remains that, by fraud or perjury, an agreement never in fact made may occasionally
be enforced under the subject matter or transaction test. It is better to run that risk,
though, than to deny enforcement to all agreements, merely because the signed
document made no specific mention of the unsigned writing. As the United States
Supreme Court declared, in sanctioning the admission of parol evidence to establish
the connection between the signed and unsigned writings.

UNIT 14: THE STATUTE OF FRAUDS  271
         There may be cases in which it would be a violation of reason and
         common sense to ignore a reference which derives its significance from
         such [parol] proof. If there is ground for any doubt in the matter, the
         general rule should be enforced. But where there is no ground for doubt,
         its enforcement would aid, instead of discouraging, fraud.

Beckwith v. Talbot, supra.

         Turning to the writings in the case before us--the unsigned office memo, the
payroll change form initialed by the general manager Johns, and the paper signed by
the comptroller Carstens--it is apparent, and most patently, that all three refer on
their face to the same transaction. The parties, the position to be filled by plaintiff,
the salary to be paid him, are all identically set forth; it is hardly possible that such
detailed information could refer to another or a different agreement. Even more, the
card signed by Carstens notes that it was prepared for the purpose of a "Salary
increase per contractual arrangements with Miss Arden." That certainly constitutes
a reference of sorts to a more comprehensive "arrangement," and parol is permissible
to furnish the explanation.

         The corroborative evidence of defendant's assent to the contents of the
unsigned office memorandum is also convincing. Prepared by defendant's agent, Miss
Arden's personal secretary, there is little likelihood that that paper was fraudulently
manufactured or that defendant had not assented to its contents. Furthermore, the
evidence as to the conduct of the parties at the time it was prepared persuasively
demonstrates defendant's assent to its terms. Under such circumstances, the courts
below were fully justified in finding that the three papers constituted the
"memorandum" of their agreement within the meaning of the statute.

         The judgment should be affirmed, with costs.

         Review Question 4. Assume the same facts as in Crabtree v. Elizabeth Arden
Sales Corp. except that Crabtree decided at the six-month mark he did not like
working for Elizabeth Arden, so he quit to join a competitor. Elizabeth Arden then
sued to prevent him from leaving and to get damages for his breach of the two-year
contract. What result in that case? Consider section 135 of the Restatement (Second)
of Contracts in connection with your answer.

272  CHAPTER V: CONTRACT DEFENSES
                         STEVENS v. PUBLICIS S.A.
Supreme Court of New York, Appellate Division, First Department

      50 A.D.3d 253, 854 N.Y.S.2d 690 (Sup. Ct. App. Div. 2008)

LIPPMAN, P.J., TOM, WILLIAMS, and ACOSTA, JJ.

         In October 1999, plaintiff sold his New York-based public relations firm,
Lobsenz-Stevens (L-S), to defendant Publicis S.A., a French global communications
company. The sale involved two contracts: a stock purchase agreement, pursuant to
which plaintiff sold all the stock of L-S to defendants, and an employment agreement,
pursuant to which plaintiff was to continue as chairman and CEO of the new
company, named Publicis-Dialog, Public Relations, New York (PDNY), for three
years. Plaintiff's duties were to be the "customary duties of a Chief Executive Officer."

         Under the stock purchase agreement (SPA), plaintiff received an initial
payment of $3,044,000, and stood to earn "earn-out" payments of up to $4 million
contingent upon PDNY achieving certain levels of earnings before interest and taxes
during the three calendar years after closing.

         Within six months of the acquisition, signs of financial problems appeared.
Plaintiff admits that revenue and profit targets were not met. Further, PDNY lost L-
S's largest preacquisition client, Pitney Bowes. On March 5, 2001, plaintiff had a
meeting with Jon Johnson, former CEO of Publicis Dialog, a related entity, at which
he was shown financial statements and told that the business had lost approximately
$900,000 in the year 2000. Plaintiff was removed as CEO of the business, and was
given several options, including leaving the firm, staying and working on new
business, and a third option to come up with another alternative. Thereafter, Bob
Bloom, former chairman and CEO of Publicis USA, became involved in the matter.
Bloom and plaintiff exchanged a series of e-mails, culminating in a March 28 message
from Bloom setting forth his understanding of the parties' terms regarding plaintiff's
new role at PDNY:

          Thus I suggested an allocation of your time that would permit the
          majority of your effort to go against new business development
          (70%). I also suggested that the remaining time be allocated to
          maintaining/growing the former Lobsenz Stevens clients (20%) and
          involvement in management/operations of the unit (10%). This
          option, it would seem, is in your best interest because it offers
          the best opportunity for you to achieve your stated goal of a full
          earn-out. When I suggested this option, you seemed to have
          considerable enthusiasm for it and expressed your satisfaction with
          it so I, of course, assumed that it was an option you preferred."

(Emphasis added.) By e-mail the next day, plaintiff wrote:

          Bob, to begin with, I want to thank you again for helping me restore
          the dignity and respect that I'm entitled to as a senior

______________________________________________________________________________

UNIT 14: THE STATUTE OF FRAUDS                                   273
          professional. Things were really getting out of hand until you
          intervened.

          What's happened since the lunch you and I had has been almost
          cathartic . . . .

          That being said, I accept your proposal with total enthusiasm and
          excitement . . . .

          I'm psyched again and will do everything in my power to generate
          business, maintain profits, work well with others and move forward.

(Emphasis added.)

         Bloom replied the same day: "I am thrilled with your decision. You have my
personal assurance that all of us will continue to work in the spirit of partnership to
achieve our mutual goal and function together as close senior collaborators in a
climate of respect and dignity for all." Each of the e-mail transmissions bore the typed
name of the sender at the foot of the message.

         In denying plaintiff's motion for partial summary judgment prior to trial, the
court found that the parties had agreed in writing to modify plaintiff's duties under
the employment agreement. In so ruling, the court properly relied on the e-mail
exchange between the parties in which both sides expressed their unqualified
acceptance of the modification to the agreement.

         The series of e-mails beginning with Bloom's March 26, 2001 message setting
forth the terms of the proposed modification, together with plaintiff's March 29
acceptance of the terms of the agreement and Bloom's immediate reply, memorialized
the terms of the parties' agreement to change plaintiff's responsibilities under the
employment agreement. The agreement is further confirmed in another e-mail sent
to Andrew Hopson, chief operating officer of PDNY, in which plaintiff reaffirmed his
unconditional acceptance of the modified agreement.

         The e-mails from plaintiff constitute "signed writings" within the meaning of
the statute of frauds, since plaintiff's name at the end of his e-mail signified his intent
to authenticate the contents. Similarly, Bloom's name at the end of his e-mail
constituted a "signed writing" and satisfied the requirement of section 13(d) of the
employment agreement that any modification be signed by all parties.

                                          ______________________

         Review Question 5. In many respects, the expanded view of "signed writings"
reflected in Stevens seems like an appropriate accommodation of the law to changes
in technology and business practices. On the other hand, given the ease with which a
"signed writing" can be generated under the Stevens approach, can you foresee any
downsides?

UNIT 14: THE STATUTE OF FRAUDS  275
                    GUENTHER v. AMER-TEX CONSTRUCTION CO.
                     Court of Civil Appeals of Texas, Third District, Austin

                              534 S.W.2d 396 (Tex. App.--Austin 1976)

SHANNON, J.

         Appellee, Amer-Tex Construction Company, filed suit in the district court of
Comal County against Rosalie M. McClure for specific performance of a contract to
convey land. Before trial, Rosalie M. McClure died, and the independent executor of
her estate, Jack Guenther, was made defendant. After trial to the court, the district
court entered judgment for specific performance. The contract to convey contained
the following description of the land:

         Reference is made to that certain tract of land adjoining
         Potter's Creek Park at Canyon Lake in Comal County,
         Texas, as shown on the attached Exhibit A, herein called
         "the land."

         Appellant's principal contention is that the contract to convey did not describe
the land with sufficient certainty to meet the requirements of the Statute of Frauds.
Tex. Bus. & Comm. Code § 26.01 (1968).6

         To comply with the requirements of the Statute of Frauds, the writing must
furnish within itself, or by reference to some other existing writing, the means or data
by which the land to be conveyed may be identified with reasonable certainty. Morrow
v. Shotwell, 477 S.W.2d 538 (Tex. 1972).

     6 [We have quoted the Texas statute immediately in these materials following this case.--Eds.]

______________________________________________________________________________

276  CHAPTER V: CONTRACT DEFENSES
         We are of the opinion that the contract to convey did not furnish within itself,
or by reference to some other existing writing, the means or data by which the land
to be conveyed could be identified with reasonable certainty. The only description of
the land, other than that the land adjoined "Potter's Creek Park at Canyon Lake in
Comal County, Texas," consisted of "Exhibit A," a sketch or map not drawn to scale.
The map did not show the width or length of the boundary lines, nor was there any
indication that the boundary lines were to be parallel. The map did not show the
approximate size of the tract or the number of acres contained therein. There was no
recitation in the contract that Rosalie M. McClure owned or resided on the property.
There was no reference in the contract to recorded deeds or other instruments from
which the land might be identified.

         Appellant argues that a "reasonable" man could take the map and locate the
land on the ground. We are unable to agree. Most probably one could locate the fence
at the corner of Potter's Creek Road and Potter's Creek Park. It would probably be
possible to trace the fence westward to the "US Govt Pk Rd." At or about the "US Gvt
Pk Rd" there is shown some kind of utility line, perhaps an electric line, a telephone
line, or a gas pipeline. If one could find the utility line, one is supposed to follow that
line north for an undetermined distance to a "fence" which runs in an easterly
direction. We conclude that from an examination of the map only the southeastern
corner of the tract at Potter's Creek Road and Potter's Creek Park could be
established with any reasonable certainty.

         Doubtless the parties to the contract to convey knew and understood what land
was intended to be conveyed. Moreover, two of appellee's witnesses testified that
sometime after the contract was signed a surveyor located the land and made a metes
and bounds description thereof. However, the knowledge and intent of the parties will
not give validity to the contract, and neither will a plat made up from extrinsic
evidence. Matney v. Odom, 210 S.W.2d 980 (Tex. 1948).

The judgment is reversed and judgment is here rendered that appellee take nothing.

         Review Question 6. "Doubtless the parties to the contract to convey knew"
says the Guenther court, "and understood what land was intended to be conveyed." A
surveyor also located the land and made a complete metes-and-bounds description of
its location. Given those facts, exactly what interests are being served by the court
not enforcing this contract?

Problem 14.1

         Seth is a student in the Master of Business Administration program at Elite

the famous investment bank, Morgan Sacks & Co., in New York City. He also has

several other offers at locations around the country. Ultimately he decides that the
opportunity is best at Morgan, so he accepts the job on March 1. After graduating, he
packs up his few belongings, flies to New York, rents a small apartment in the Tribeca
area, and on July 1 he starts work. He never signs any written employment
agreement with Morgan. Two months later, on September 1, he is fired for
incompetence and insubordination. Seth sues, claiming that when he was being
recruited he was orally promised that his initial contract term would be two years,
and that he would not be fired within that time. Morgan responds by denying any
such statements were made, that it has never made any such promises to any new
employee, and it moves to dismiss because the alleged contract is not in writing. What
result and why? Consider Restatement (Second) of Contracts § 139 in connection with
this problem.

Problem 14.2

         Lucy and Zehmer are sitting in the bar of the Zehmer's restaurant, the Olde
Virginnie, in Kopperl, Texas. Lucy offers $500,000 for a piece of property that Zehmer
owns called the "Ferguson Farm." After negotiation, Zehmer handwrites the following
on the back of one of his customer bar tab checks: "I agree to sell to W.O. Lucy the
Ferguson Farm complete for $500,000.00, title satisfactory to buyer." Beneath it he
writes the date and signs his name, "A.H. Zehmer." Lucy leaves, taking the document
with him. The next day Zehmer calls Lucy and says, "I changed my mind, I don't want
to sell the farm." He refuses to convey the property or take Lucy's payment. Lucy
sues.

         Zehmer argues that the written memorandum does not satisfy the Statute of
Frauds and thus the contract is unenforceable because it does not contain reasonably
certain terms. Lucy has witnesses to testify that people in Bosque County, Texas,
understand that "the Ferguson Farm" is a particular piece of property located at 1042
Route FM-56. That farm consists of 403 acres of land, on which are a small house,
several outbuildings, livestock facilities, an irrigation system for the grass, two large
tractors, and a herd of 200 purebred Charolais cattle.

         Does the Texas Statute of Frauds (quoted immediately before the problems)
prevent Lucy from enforcing the agreement?

Onondaga Mills LLC, the operator of a major upscale shopping mall near Syracuse,
New York, for a 10-year-lease. Les and his counterpart at Onondaga, Alice Sells, have
been exchanging communications and draft agreements for about a month. On June
1, Alice sends Les a revised "Lease Agreement" that incorporates the results of their
various discussions. The lease is 19 pages long and very detailed. It has blocks for the

VRUSA never actually signs the contract. Three weeks later, not having responded
to Alice despite several attempts by her to contact Les, the company decides it does
not want to enter the Syracuse market at Onondaga Mills, and refuses to go forward.
Les notifies Alice that the deal is off. Onondaga Mills, meanwhile, had turned down
an offer by another clothing store, Aéropostale, Inc., for the same space, which is now
going to be vacant. It has also had its employees begin getting the space cleared away
for the renovations Le Corbusier will need for its store, although no work has been
started to date.

         Onondaga Mills sues VRUSA, claiming VRUSA is in breach of the contract.
Are the New York statutes of frauds quoted below a bar to Onodaga Mills enforcing
the agreement?

Assent-Based Defenses

                                FOCUS OF THIS UNIT

         Contract law exists largely to enforce voluntary transactions. As a result, when
facts suggest that a transaction was not voluntary in some serious way, contract law
provides for defenses to be raised against enforcement of the agreement. Reasons to
attack a contract based on the lack of true assent include fraud or misrepresentation,
a party's failure to disclose important facts, threats of violence, irresistible pressure,
or even an honest mistake of fact. Just as the statute of frauds can prevent
enforcement of an otherwise enforceable contract, so can these matters that we here
label "assent-based defenses."

         Fraud and Misrepresentation. You may have run across fraud in your Torts
class because it is an intentional tort. In broad terms, fraud occurs when one party
makes a false statement with the intent to mislead the other, and the other
reasonably believes the statement and is damaged as a result. As a defense to
enforcing a contract, fraud is easy to understand: a contact is always voidable by the
defrauded party. More difficult questions arise when the false statement is not
deliberate and misrepresentation occurs instead. Here, a party simply fails to disclose
information that would be critical to the other party's decision.

         Duress. The threat of force or other unlawful action to induce a party to
consent is called duress. Consider the scene in the Godfather movie, where a
bandleader has refused to release singer Johnny Fontaine from his contract. Don Vito
successfully obtains the bandleader's assent with "an offer he couldn't refuse,"
namely, having a gun held to his head and telling him that either "his brains or his
signature" will be on the contract release. The "gun to the head" fact pattern is the
classic (and easy) example case of duress, but pressure that is much less than that
can also render a contract voidable for duress. Just how much is enough?

         Undue Influence. Somewhat related to duress is the concept of undue
influence. Improper pressure to enter a contract is sometimes not the result of direct
threats. Instead, an overwhelming influence by a more powerful party is overriding

______________________________________________________________________________

UNIT 15: ASSENT-BASED DEFENSES                      283
the judgment of a vulnerable party. In a claim of undue influence, lawyers call these
the "dominant" and "servient" parties. Undue influence most typically occurs in two
broad categories. The first is the one in which a party in a position of trust--e.g.,
lawyers, physicians, trustees, guardians, and so on, often called "fiduciaries"--abuses
a "confidential relationship" to steer the trusting other party into bad deals, including
deals that personally benefit the fiduciary. The less-sophisticated party was harmed
because he reasonably relied on the fiduciary's advice. The second situation is when
a party who is not actually a fiduciary has developed a position of dominance over
another and effectively imposes his will on the other party. A typical situation
involves a family member, neighbor, or servant who so insinuates himself into the
life of an elderly and often incapacitated person, and then exploits that position to
obtain gifts or promises to rewrite a will. While this is perhaps the most common
category of undue influence, the doctrine can be used in a wide range of situations.

         Mistake. Yet another ground for voiding contracts is mistake. In most
agreements, each party knows at some level that her knowledge is incomplete. The
parties do not necessarily know everything about the current situation of the world,
and they know even less about the future. Almost by definition, a party who signs a
contract that turns out to be a bad deal was "mistaken" in some sense. The old toy we
sell at a yard sale may turn out to be an incredibly valuable "Sheriff Woody" action
figure. The stock we buy with every expectation that it will go up suddenly drops like
a rock. One popular television show features auction attendees who are given only
minutes to appraise a storage locker full of flotsam for five minutes and then bid on
it. The excitement comes from knowing that there may nothing but trash, but that
there may also be a lost Rembrandt drawing worth millions. This uncertainly is
involved in a large number of contracts--even buying gasoline for your car today
involves taking a gamble, because the price tomorrow might be much less or much
more. Being wrong about the normal uncertainties of life does not establish the
defense of mistake.

         Some mistakes, in contrast, are so fundamental to the nature of the deal that
the law will allow the contract to be avoided. An obvious and uncontroversial example
would be a contract to build and install a swimming pool where both parties assume
that the yard consists only of dirt that can be excavated cheaply. If, in fact, a massive
granite boulder six inches below the surface requires costly blasting, or if the area
turns out to be a major archaeological site or to contain dozens of buried and
extremely hazardous World War I chemical weapons that require hundreds of
thousands of dollars to remove, the doctrine of mistake would protect the pool
installers from extraordinary costs that neither party anticipated. Unsurprisingly,
the difficult question with the doctrine of mistake is determining which mistakes are
so fundamental that they will allow avoidance of the contract, and which mistakes
are ones where a party simply came out on the bad side of the contract's allocation of
risk.

provisions on fraud and misrepresentation (§§ 159-164), duress and undue influence
(§§ 174-177) and mistake (§§ 151-154).

                        Cases and Materials

                                   ALABI v. DHL AIRWAYS, INC.
                              Superior Court of Delaware, New Castle

                                    583 A.2d 1358 (Del. Super. 1990)

HERLIHY, J.

         [DHL was an express package delivery service. In Philadelphia, Mabayomije
Alabi--who had regularly used DHL's services for more than two years--allegedly
put $15,000 in cash in a DHL envelope to be sent to London. DHL required customers
to generally describe the contents of envelopes in a box on the shipping contract.
Because DHL's terms and conditions prohibited accepting or shipping cash, Alabi
wrote "documents relating to school bills" in the box, and sealed the package before
handing it over to DHL, which was otherwise unaware of its contents. Alabi was
required to certify that "the article in the shipment is properly described and is not
an item "which DHL has declared to be unacceptable" for shipment. Alabi inquired if
the package could be insured for $15,000; DHL said that its maximum insurance
value was $10,000. Alabi paid $76 for shipment and for the $10,000 in insurance.
When the envelope arrived in London, it disappeared from the DHL storage area.
Police were called in, but the package and its contents were never found. Alabi
claimed that DHL was negligent, and demanded the $15,000, plus punitive damages.]

         DHL seeks summary judgment claiming plaintiff's contracts with it are
voidable due to his alleged misrepresentation of the contents of the envelope. A
contract may be voidable on the basis of misrepresentation, be it a fraudulent or an
innocent misrepresentation. Norton v. Poplos, 443 A.2d 1 (Del. Super. 1982);
Restatement (Second) of Contracts § 164. As such, misrepresentation can be asserted
as an affirmative defense to an action on the contract.

         The Restatement (Second) of Contracts provides probably the clearest
discussion of the elements that need be shown to prevail when asserting
misrepresentation as a defense. In order for a contract to be voidable, a party must
show all four of the following elements: (1) that there was a misrepresentation; (2)
that the misrepresentation was either fraudulent or material; (3) that the
misrepresentation induced the recipient to enter into the contract; and (4) that the
recipient's reliance on the misrepresentation was reasonable. Rest. 2d § 164.

______________________________________________________________________________

UNIT 15: ASSENT-BASED DEFENSES  285
         The first issue is whether the labeling of the envelope, allegedly containing
$15,000 in cash, as "documents regarding school bills" constitutes a
misrepresentation. A misrepresentation is "an assertion that is not in accordance
with the facts." Plaintiff asserts that "documents" suffices as a general description of
currency. This is an untenable position. The term "documents regarding school bills"
does not indicate that the contents are inherently valuable to third-party interlopers
or others in DHL's position. Plaintiff's description is not in accord with the now
alleged fact that there was cash in the envelope and, consequently, is a
misrepresentation of the contents.

         The second element is whether the misrepresentation was fraudulent or
material. If the misrepresentation was non-fraudulent or innocent, it must be
material for the contract to be voidable. Rest. 2d § 164 cmt b. On the other hand, if
the misrepresentation was fraudulent, it is not required to be material for the
contract to be voidable.

                  (1) A misrepresentation is fraudulent if the maker intends his assertion
         to induce a party to manifest his assent and the maker

                  (a) knows or believes that the assertion is not in accord with the facts,
         or

                  (b) does not have the confidence that he states or implies in the truth of
         the assertion, or

                  (c) knows that he does not have the basis that he states or implies for
         the assertion.

Rest. 2d § 162. The plaintiff claims that the description was as accurate as he felt it
could be without inviting theft. By making such an assertion, to some extent plaintiff
purposely misled DHL about the contents of the shipment. However, plaintiff also
claims that he was unaware that DHL would not ship cash. In considering the
requirement to view the record in a light most favorable to the non-moving party, the
Court is simply unwilling at this point to rule that the misrepresentation was
fraudulent as a matter of law.

         The alternative factor to be considered under the second element is, if the
misrepresentation is not fraudulent, is it, nevertheless, material.

                  (2) A misrepresentation is material if it would be likely to induce a
         reasonable person to manifest his assent, or if the maker knows that it would
         be likely to induce the recipient to do so.

Rest. 2d § 162. "The materiality of a misrepresentation is determined from the
viewpoint of the maker." Id. cmt c.

         In the instant case, plaintiff had in his possession airbills which are bills of
lading. Based on this long-time use of DHL's services, plaintiff cannot now be heard

______________________________________________________________________________

286  CHAPTER V: CONTRACT DEFENSES
to complain that he was unaware of the terms and conditions contained on the Airway
bill. Therefore, plaintiff is bound by those terms and conditions, as he signed the
Airway bill.

         Given that plaintiff must be charged with the knowledge that DHL does not
accept cash for delivery, the misrepresentation becomes material. It is material
because "the maker [plaintiff] knows that for some special reason it is likely to induce
the particular recipient to manifest his assent." Rest. 2d § 162 cmt c. Put simply, the
plaintiff had reason to know DHL would not accept cash and describing the shipment
as otherwise, he induced DHL to enter into a contract to which it would not otherwise
assent to.

         The third element to be considered is whether the misrepresentation induced
DHL to enter into the contract. "A misrepresentation induces a party's manifestation
of assent if it substantially contributes to his decision to manifest his assent." Rest.
2d § 167. It is not necessary that this party's reliance on the misrepresentation be
"the sole or even the predominant factor in influencing his conduct." Id. cmt a. "It is
assumed, in absence of facts showing the contrary, that the recipient attached
importance to the truth of the misrepresentation if it was material, but not if it was
immaterial." Id. cmt b.

         In the instant case, the misrepresentation was material. Further, there is
nothing in the record to indicate that DHL did not attach importance to the
misrepresentation. In fact, it is just the opposite. As noted before, the shipper's1
signature block of the Airway bill contains the following statement, "I warrant that
all details given herein are true and correct," plus paragraph 2 on the back of the bill,
relating to giving an accurate description of the contents, reflects DHL's concern as
to the accuracy of the description of the shipment, as does the blank the shipper uses
to describe the contents. Therefore, it is clear that the misrepresentation was a
substantial factor in DHL's decision to enter into the contracts at issue.

         The fourth element to be considered is whether DHL's reliance on the
misrepresentation is reasonable. A misrepresentation will have no legal effect unless
the recipient's reliance is justified. Prior to shipping and giving the envelope to DHL,
plaintiff twice inquired as to the availability of $15,000 worth of insurance. This
would indicate that the documents' value belied the description on the Airway bill.
DHL argues that plaintiff attempts to impose a duty to inspect every envelope.

         This may or may not be plaintiff's intent but that is of no moment. What is
important is the fact that DHL does reserve the right to inspect the envelopes it
accepts for delivery. DHL would not reserve such a right if it did not believe that at

1 [Be careful with the terminology here, as it sometimes confuses students. In a transportation

contract, the "carrier" is the entity that transports the goods (in this case, DHL), and the "shipper" is

the person (Alabi) who has delivered the goods to the carrier for shipment.--Eds.]

some point or on some occasion it would want to check the contents because it has
reason to believe the description is inaccurate. DHL realizes that it is not always
reasonable to rely on the description supplied by a shipper. Where that point or
occasion falls is a question of fact that should be left to the trier of fact. Therefore, the
Court finds that a material issue of fact exists as to the reasonableness of DHL's
reliance on the description supplied by plaintiff.

         Since all four elements have not been established as a matter of law, granting
summary judgment would not be proper.

                                           _____________________

         Review Question 1. At one point in the opinion (discussing whether the
representation was "fraudulent") the court says that it cannot say that Alabi knew
that DHL would not accept cash for shipment. At another point (discussing
"materiality") the court says that we have to assume that Alabi knew that DHL would
not accept cash. Why the difference?

                              STANDARD FINANCE CO. v. ELLIS
                              Intermediate Court of Appeals of Hawaii
                     3 Haw. App. 614, 657 P.2d 1056 (Haw. Ct. App. 1983)

TANAKA, J.
         In an action on a promissory note, defendant Betty Ellis appeals from the

summary judgment in favor of plaintiff Standard Finance Company, Limited.
         The only issue is whether the granting of summary judgment was proper. We

hold that it was and affirm.
         The record shows that on September 30, 1976, defendant and her then husband

W. G. Ellis (hereinafter "Ellis"), executed and delivered to plaintiff a promissory note
in the amount of $2,800. Nothing having been paid on the note, plaintiff filed a
collection suit on May 15, 1980.2 On January 15, 1981, the trial court entered its order
granting plaintiff's motion for summary judgment. On March 9, 1981, judgment in
the amount of $5,413.35 was filed. Defendant's timely appeal followed.

          2 [By the court] Ellis was not named a party defendant in the case. Defendant states that
shortly after the execution and delivery of the note, Ellis filed for and was declared a bankrupt.

______________________________________________________________________________

288  CHAPTER V: CONTRACT DEFENSES
         On appeal, defendant claims that plaintiff was not entitled to summary
judgment because there were genuine issues of material fact as to whether duress
was involved in obtaining defendant's signature. We disagree.

         In her answers to interrogatories, defendant states that she was "forced" to
sign the note under duress. "[P]hysical beatings" of and "psychological pressure" on
her by Ellis" "[f]or at least the 3 yrs. prior to signing of note" constituted the duress.
She argues that her execution of the note which was compelled by duress was not a
manifestation of her assent. Thus, the note is void and unenforceable.

         The law concerning duress resulting in void or voidable contracts is discussed
in Restatement (Second) of Contracts §§ 174 and 175(1) (1981). Section 174 reads:

         If conduct that appears to be a manifestation of assent by a party who
         does not intend to engage in that conduct is physically compelled by
         duress, the conduct is not effective as a manifestation of assent.

Comment a to § 174 provides in part:

         This Section involves an application of that principle to those relatively
         rare situations in which actual physical force has been used to compel a
         party to appear to assent to a contract. . . . The essence of this type of
         duress is that a party is compelled by physical force to do an act that he
         has no intention of doing. He is, it is sometimes said, "a mere mechanical
         instrument." The result is that there is no contract at all, or a "void
         contract" as distinguished from a voidable one.

Section 175(1) states:

         If a party's manifestation of assent is induced by an improper threat by
         the other party that leaves the victim no reasonable alternative, the
         contract is voidable by the victim.

         We hold that as a matter of law the facts in the record do not constitute the
type of duress which renders the note void under § 174. Such duress involves the use
of actual physical force to compel a person to sign a document. It may include the
example given in comment 6 to [Uniform Commercial Code] § 3-305 of an "instrument
signed at the point of a gun" being void.

         Here, the only evidence of duress is "physical beatings" and "psychological
pressure" by Ellis on defendant over a course of three years prior to defendant's
signing of the note. Without more, such evidence does not constitute § 174 duress
resulting in the voiding of the note. From such evidence it cannot reasonably be
inferred that the physical beatings by Ellis directly resulted in defendant signing the
note in question.

______________________________________________________________________________

UNIT 15: ASSENT-BASED DEFENSES  289
         As a matter of law, based on the facts in the record, the note was not voidable
by defendant under § 175(1).

         Defendant relies heavily on Furnish v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, 262
F.2d 727 (9th Cir. 1958). In Furnish, a wife had signed blank income tax forms at the
request of her husband. The court of appeals reversed the judgment imposing a
deficiency against the wife and remanded the case for a determination of duress
stating that it is "harshly inequitable for the wife to be forced to pay a penalty for
fraud arising out of nothing she had done, save signing a blank return required of her
by a dominating husband."

         Furnish is distinguishable from this case. There duress was discussed in
regards to its validity as a defense to a tax liability created by 26 U.S.C. § 51(b) (1939).
Here, under the Uniform Commercial Code, comment 6 to § 3-305 states in part,
"They [duress and illegality] are primarily a matter of local concern and local policy.
All such matters are therefore left to the local law." Hawaii has adopted the
Restatement's definition of duress that "where a party's manifestation of assent is
induced by an improper threat that leaves him no reasonable alternative, the contract
is voidable by that party." Penn v. Transportation Lease Hawaii, Ltd., 630 P.2d 646,
649 (Haw. Ct. App. 1981).

         Plaintiff did not threaten defendant. In his affidavit, Ron Higa makes the
following uncontradicted statement:

         At no time prior to or contemporaneously with the execution of said note
         did Defendant Ellis state or indicate in any manner that she was acting
         under coercion or duress in the execution of said note.

Thus, contrary to defendant's contention, no genuine issue of material fact existed.
The facts and their inferences viewed in the light most favorable to defendant do not
constitute valid defenses to the action, and summary judgment was properly granted.

         Affirmed.

                                           _____________________

         Review Question 2. How can the Standard Finance court determine that there
was not a "genuine issue of material fact" whether Betty was really free to make a
voluntary decision while under the influence of an abusive husband. The court seems
to say that even if we assume she was, she is liable on her contracts. How exactly
does the law allow for such a result?

         Review Question 3: The opinion discusses Furnish, a 1958 case where the wife
won, while in Standard Finance the 1983 wife loses. The latter case even involves
physical beatings. The court explains the difference as a distinction between federal

______________________________________________________________________________

290  CHAPTER V: CONTRACT DEFENSES
law and one state law. Perhaps. Can you think of any reasons why a 1983 court would
be less likely to excuse a wife who was "dominated" by her husband than a 1958 court
would have. Can you think of any reasons why a court today might approach the
situation differently yet again?

 AUSTIN INSTRUMENT, INC. v. LORAL CORP.
                 Court of Appeals of New York

29 N.Y.2d 124, 272 N.E.2d 533, 324 N.Y.S.2d 22 (1971)

FULD, C.J.:

         [In 1965, Loral Corp. won a $6,000,000 from the Navy to produce radar sets for
use in the then-escalating Vietnam War. The contract contained a schedule of
deliveries and allowed the Navy to penalize Loral or cancel the contract if there were
delays or failures to deliver. Loral signed a contract with Austin Instruments to make
23 of the 40 precision gear components needed for the radar set. (The contracts were
awarded to the low bidders on each individual component. The remainder went to
other subcontractors.) The subcontract turned out to be unprofitable for Austin. In
May, 1966, Loral was awarded a second Navy contract for the production of more
radar sets, and again sought bids on the components. Austin bid on all 40, but was
told it would be awarded contracts only on those items on which it was low bidder.
Austin threatened to stop delivering components under the 1965 contract unless
Loral agreed to (a) award it all of the components on the 1966 contact whether it was
low bidder or not, and (b) retroactively increase the price on the items already
delivered under the 1965 contract. Loral "feverishly" contacted all other available
suppliers but because of war requirements they were all unable to promise delivery
on the time scheduled demanded by the Navy. Loral therefore agreed to Austin's
demands. Loral finished the radar sets and delivered them to the Navy, but then
informed Austin that it would seek to recover the extra amounts paid to Austin. It
also withheld payment under the 1966 contract after deliveries were made. Austin
sued, seeking $17,750 allegedly due under the 1966 contract; the same day, Loral
sued, seeking $22,250 for extra payments under the 1965 contract.]

         The applicable law is clear and, indeed, is not disputed by the parties. A
contract is voidable on the ground of duress when it is established that the party
making the claim was forced to agree to it by means of a wrongful threat precluding
the exercise of his free will. See Allstate Medical Laboratories v. Blaivas, 229 N.E.2d
50 (N.Y. 1967). The existence of economic duress or business compulsion is
demonstrated by proof that "immediate possession of needful goods is threatened"
Mercury Machine Importing Corp. v. City of New York, 144 N.E.2d 400 (N.Y. 1957),

______________________________________________________________________________

UNIT 15: ASSENT-BASED DEFENSES                         291
or, more particularly, in cases such as the one before us, by proof that one party to a
contract has threatened to breach the agreement by withholding goods unless the
other party agrees to some further demand. See, e.g., E.I. du Pont de Nemours & Co.
v. Hass Co., 103 N.E.2d 896 (N.Y. 1954). However, a mere threat by one party to
breach the contract by not delivering the required items, though wrongful, does not
in itself constitute economic duress. It must also appear that the threatened party
could not obtain the goods from another source of supply and that the ordinary
remedy of an action for breach of contract would not be adequate.

         It is manifest that Austin's threat to stop deliveries unless the prices were
increased deprived Loral of its free will. As bearing on this, Loral's relationship with
the Government is most significant. As mentioned above, its contract called for
staggered monthly deliveries of the radar sets, with clauses calling for liquidated
damages and possible cancellation on default. Because of its production schedule,
Loral was, in July, 1966, concerned with meeting its delivery requirements in
September, October and November, and it was for the sets to be delivered in those
months that the withheld gears were needed. Loral had to plan ahead, and the
substantial liquidated damages for which it would be liable, plus the threat of default,
were genuine possibilities. Moreover, Loral did a substantial portion of its business
with the Government, and it feared that a failure to deliver as agreed upon would
jeopardize its chances for future contracts. These genuine concerns do not merit the
label "self-imposed, undisclosed and subjective," which the Appellate Division
majority placed upon them. It was perfectly reasonable for Loral, or any other party
similarly placed, to consider itself in an emergency, duress situation.

         We find unconvincing Austin's contention that Loral, in order to meet its
burden, should have contacted the Government and asked for an extension of its
delivery dates so as to enable it to purchase the parts from another vendor. Aside
from the consideration that Loral was anxious to perform well in the Government's
eyes, it could not be sure when it would obtain enough parts from a substitute vendor
to meet its commitments. The only promise which it received from the companies it
contacted was for commencement of deliveries, not full supply, and, with vendor delay
common in this field, it would have been nearly impossible to know the length of the
extension it should request. It must be remembered that Loral was producing a
needed item of military hardware. Moreover, there is authority for Loral's position
that nonperformance by a subcontractor is not an excuse for default in the main
contract. See, e.g., JOHN COSGROVE MCBRIDE & ISIDORE H. WACHTEL, GOVERNMENT
CONTRACTS § 35.10 (1962). In light of all this, Loral's claim should not be held
insufficiently supported because it did not request an extension from the
Government.

         Loral, as indicated above, also had the burden of demonstrating that it could
not obtain the parts elsewhere within a reasonable time, and there can be no doubt
that it met this burden. The 10 manufacturers whom Loral contacted comprised its

______________________________________________________________________________

292  CHAPTER V: CONTRACT DEFENSES
entire list of "approved vendors" for precision gears,3 and none was able to commence
delivery soon enough. As Loral was producing a highly sophisticated item of military
machinery requiring parts made to the strictest engineering standards, it would be
unreasonable to hold that Loral should have gone to other vendors, with whom it was
either unfamiliar or dissatisfied, to procure the needed parts. Loral "contacted all the
manufacturers whom it believed capable of making these parts," and this was all the
law requires.

         It is hardly necessary to add that Loral's normal legal remedy of accepting
Austin's breach of the contract and then suing for damages would have been
inadequate under the circumstances, as Loral would still have had to obtain the gears
elsewhere with all the concomitant consequences mentioned above. In other words,
Loral actually had no choice, when the prices were raised by Austin, except to take
the gears at the "coerced" prices and then sue to get the excess back.

         Austin's final argument is that Loral, even if it did enter into the contract
under duress, lost any rights it had to a refund of money by waiting until July, 1967,
long after the termination date of the contract, to disaffirm it. It is true that one who
would recover moneys allegedly paid under duress must act promptly to make his
claim known. See Oregon Pacific R. R. Co. v. Forrest, 28 N.E. 137 (N. Y. 1891). In this
case, Loral delayed making its demand for a refund until three days after Austin's
last delivery on the second subcontract. Loral's reason for waiting until that time is
that it feared another stoppage of deliveries which would again put it in an untenable
situation. Considering Austin's conduct in the past, this was perfectly reasonable, as
the possibility of an application by Austin of further business compulsion still existed
until all of the parts were delivered.

         In sum, the record before us demonstrates that Loral agreed to the price
increases in consequence of the economic duress employed by Austin. Accordingly,
the matter should be remanded to the trial court for a computation of its damages.

contract because Austin's obligations under that contract did not change?

misplaced. The real issue should be whether or not Austin was acting in good faith--
that is, whether it was trying to take advantage of Loral rather than merely trying
to keep from losing a large amount of money on the contract. What do you think of
that approach as compared to what the court says?

                    ODORIZZI v. BLOOMFIELD SCHOOL DISTRICT
                    Court of Appeal of California, Second Appellate District
                     246 Cal. App. 2d 123, 54 Cal. Rptr. 533 (2d Dist. 1966)

FLEMING, J.:

         Appeal from a judgment dismissing plaintiff's amended complaint on
demurrer.

         Plaintiff Donald Odorizzi was employed during 1964 as an elementary school
teacher by defendant Bloomfield School District and was under contract with the
district to continue to teach school the following year as a permanent employee. On
June 10 he was arrested on criminal charges of homosexual activity, and on June 11
he signed and delivered to his superiors his written resignation as a teacher, a
resignation which the district accepted on June 13. In July the criminal charges
against Odorizzi were dismissed under Cal. Penal Code § 995,4 and in September he
sought to resume his employment with the district. On the district's refusal to
reinstate him he filed suit for declaratory and other relief.

         Odorizzi's amended complaint asserts his resignation was invalid because
obtained through duress, fraud, mistake, and undue influence and given at a time
when he lacked capacity to make a valid contract. Specifically, Odorizzi declares he
was under such severe mental and emotional strain at the time he signed his
resignation, having just completed the process of arrest, questioning by the police,
booking, and release on bail, and having gone for 40 hours without sleep, that he was
incapable of rational thought or action. While he was in this condition and unable to
think clearly, the superintendent of the district and the principal of his school came
to his apartment. They said they were trying to help him and had his best interests
at heart, that he should take their advice and immediately resign his position with
the district, that there was no time to consult an attorney, that if he did not resign
immediately the district would suspend and dismiss him from his position and
publicize the proceedings, his "afore-described arrest" and cause him "to suffer

     4 [That is, dismissed for insufficient evidence.--Eds.]

extreme embarrassment and humiliation"; but that if he resigned at once the incident
would not be publicized and would not jeopardize his chances of securing employment
as a teacher elsewhere. Odorizzi pleads that because of his faith and confidence in
their representations they were able to substitute their will and judgment in place of
his own and thus obtain his signature to his purported resignation. A demurrer to his
amended complaint was sustained without leave to amend.

         By his complaint plaintiff in effect seeks to rescind his resignation pursuant to
Civil Code, section 1689,5 on the ground that his consent had not been real or free
within the meaning of Civil Code, section 1567,6 but had been obtained through
duress, menace, fraud, undue influence, or mistake.

         We agree with respondent's contention that neither duress nor menace was
involved in this case, because the action or threat in duress or menace must be
unlawful, and a threat to take legal action is not unlawful unless the party making
the threat knows the falsity of his claim.

         Nor do we find a cause of action for fraud, either actual or constructive. Actual
fraud involves conscious misrepresentation, or concealment, or non-disclosure of a
material fact which induces the innocent party to enter the contract. While the
amended complaint charged misrepresentation, it failed to assert the elements of
knowledge of falsity, intent to induce reliance, and justifiable reliance. A cause of
action for actual fraud was therefore not stated.

         Constructive fraud arises on a breach of duty by one in a confidential or
fiduciary relationship to another which induces justifiable reliance by the latter to
his prejudice. Plaintiff, however, sets forth no facts to support his conclusion of a
confidential relationship between the representatives of the school district and
himself, other than that the parties bore the relationship of employer and employee
to each other. Under prevailing judicial opinion no presumption of a confidential
relationship arises from the bare fact that parties to a contract are employer and
employee. We think the allegations of constructive fraud were inadequate.

          5 ["A party to a contract may rescind the contract in the following cases . . . If the consent of
the party rescinding, . . . was given by mistake, or obtained through duress, menace, fraud, or undue

party to the contract jointly interested with such party." CALIF. CIV. CODE § 1689(b)(1).--Eds.]

          6 [An apparent consent is not real or free when obtained through:

UNIT 15: ASSENT-BASED DEFENSES                                               295
         As to mistake, the amended complaint fails to disclose any facts which would
suggest that consent had been obtained through a mistake of fact or of law. The
material facts of the transaction were known to both parties. Neither party was
laboring under any misapprehension of law of which the other took advantage.

         However, the pleading does set out a claim that plaintiff's consent to the
transaction had been obtained through the use of undue influence.

         Undue influence, in the sense we are concerned with here, is a shorthand legal
phrase used to describe persuasion which tends to be coercive in nature, persuasion
which overcomes the will without convincing the judgment. The hallmark of such
persuasion is high pressure, a pressure which works on mental, moral, or emotional
weakness to such an extent that it approaches the boundaries of coercion. In this
sense, undue influence has been called overpersuasion. Misrepresentations of law or
fact are not essential to the charge, for a person's will may be overborne without
misrepresentation. Undue influence includes "taking an unfair advantage of
another's weakness of mind, or . . . taking a grossly oppressive and unfair advantage
of another's necessities or distress." While most reported cases of undue influence
involve persons who bear a confidential relationship to one another, a confidential or
authoritative relationship between the parties need not be present when the undue
influence involves unfair advantage taken of another's weakness or distress.

         In essence undue influence involves the use of excessive pressure to persuade
one vulnerable to such pressure, pressure applied by a dominant subject to a servient
object. In combination, the elements of undue susceptibility in the servient person
and excessive pressure by the dominating person make the latter's influence undue,
for it results in the apparent will of the servient person being in fact the will of the
dominant person.

         In the present case plaintiff has pleaded that such weakness at the time he
signed his resignation prevented him from freely and competently applying his
judgment to the problem before him. Plaintiff declares he was under severe mental
and emotional strain at the time because he had just completed the process of arrest,
questioning, booking, and release on bail and had been without sleep for forty hours.
It is possible that exhaustion and emotional turmoil may wholly incapacitate a person
from exercising his judgment. As an abstract question of pleading, plaintiff has
pleaded that possibility and sufficient allegations to state a case for rescission.

     Undue influence in its second aspect involves an application of excessive

strength by a dominant subject against a servient object. Judicial consideration of

this second element in undue influence has been relatively rare, for there are few

cases denying persons who persuade but do not misrepresent the benefit of their

bargain. Yet logically, the same legal consequences should apply to the results of

excessive strength as to the results of undue weakness. Whether from weakness on

one side, or strength on the other, or a combination of the two, undue influence occurs

whenever there results "that kind of influence or supremacy of one mind over another

______________________________________________________________________________

296  CHAPTER V: CONTRACT DEFENSES
by which that other is prevented from acting according to his own wish or judgment,

and whereby the will of the person is overborne and he is induced to do or forbear to

do an act which he would not do, or would do, if left to act freely."  Whether a

person of subnormal capacities has been subjected to ordinary force or a person of

normal capacities subjected to extraordinary force, the match is equally out of

balance. If will has been overcome against judgment, consent may be rescinded.

         Overpersuasion is generally accompanied by certain characteristics which tend
to create a pattern. The pattern usually involves several of the following elements:
(1) discussion of the transaction at an unusual or inappropriate time, (2)
consummation of the transaction in an unusual place, (3) insistent demand that the
business be finished at once, (4) extreme emphasis on untoward consequences of
delay, (5) the use of multiple persuaders by the dominant side against a single
servient party, (6) absence of third-party advisers to the servient party, (7)
statements that there is no time to consult financial advisers or attorneys. If a
number of these elements are simultaneously present, the persuasion may be
characterized as excessive. The cases are illustrative:

         In Moore v. Moore, 22 P. 589, 874 (Cal. 1890), the pregnant wife of a man who
had been shot to death on October 30 and buried on November 1 was approached by
four members of her husband's family on November 2 or 3 and persuaded to deed her
entire interest in her husband's estate to his children by a prior marriage. In finding
the use of undue influence on Mrs. Moore, the court commented:

         It was the second day after her late husband's funeral. It was at
a time when she would naturally feel averse to transacting any business,
and she might reasonably presume that her late husband's brothers
would not apply to her at such a time to transact any important
business, unless it was of a nature that would admit of no delay. And as
it would admit of delay, the only reason which we can discover for their
unseemly haste is, that they thought that she would be more likely to
comply with their wishes then than at some future time, after she had
recovered from the shock which she had then so recently experienced. If
for that reason they selected that time for the accomplishment of their
purpose, it seems to us that they not only took, but that they designed
to take, an unfair advantage of her weakness of mind. If they did not,
they probably can explain why they selected that inappropriate time for
the transaction of business which might have been delayed for weeks
without injury to anyone. In the absence of any explanation, it appears
to us that the time was selected with reference to just that condition of
mind which she alleges that she was then in. Taking an unfair
advantage of another's weakness of mind is undue influence, and the
law will not permit the retention of an advantage thus obtained.

UNIT 15: ASSENT-BASED DEFENSES                                                  297
         In Weger v. Rocha, 32 P.2d 417 (Cal. Ct. App. 1934), plaintiff, while confined
in a cast in a hospital, gave a release of claims for personal injuries for a relatively
small sum to an agent who spent two hours persuading her to sign. At the time of
signing plaintiff was in a highly nervous and hysterical condition and suffering much
pain, and she signed the release in order to terminate the interview. The court held
that the release had been secured by the use of undue influence.

         The difference between legitimate persuasion and excessive pressure, like the
difference between seduction and rape,7 rests to a considerable extent in the manner
in which the parties go about their business. For example, if a day or two after
Odorizzi's release on bail the superintendent of the school district had called him into
his office during business hours and directed his attention to those provisions of the
Education Code compelling his leave of absence and authorizing his suspension on
the filing of written charges, had told him that the district contemplated filing written
charges against him, had pointed out the alternative of resignation available to him,
had informed him he was free to consult counsel or any adviser he wished and to
consider the matter overnight and return with his decision the next day, it is
extremely unlikely that any complaint about the use of excessive pressure could ever
have been made against the school district.

         But, according to the allegations of the complaint, this is not the way it
happened, and if it had happened that way, plaintiff would never have resigned.

         Plaintiff has thus pleaded both subjective and objective elements entering the
undue influence equation and stated sufficient facts to put in issue the question
whether his free will had been overborne by defendant's agents at a time when he
was unable to function in a normal manner.

         We express no opinion on the merits of plaintiff's case, or the propriety of his
continuing to teach school. We do hold that his pleading, liberally construed, states a
cause of action for rescission of a transaction to which his apparent consent had been
obtained through the use of undue influence.

         The judgment is reversed.

                                          ______________________

         Review Question 6. The Odorizzi case allows for the possibility on remand
that the school district officials exercised undue influence in procuring Odorrizzi's
resignation. Were they acting in bad faith in putting pressure on Odorizzi? Do bad-
faith motivations matter for purposes of undue influence analysis? Should the
motives of the alleged influencer matter?

          7 [An offensive example, but then again, this case is a reminder that courts and other officials
were much less sensitive to many issues forty years ago.--Eds.]

______________________________________________________________________________

298  CHAPTER V: CONTRACT DEFENSES
         Review Question 7. Odorizzi strikes many students today as a case that
should be more about civil rights than about contract defenses. To what extent should
the role of a lawyer be to change the law (which Mr. Odorizzi's lawyers did not do)
rather than to obtain a good result for an individual client (which Mr. Odorizzi's
lawyers did do)? Do you value one role more than the other? If so, why?

TAYLOR, J.

         The defendants are partners in the jewelry business. On the trial it appeared
that on and before the 28th of December, 1883, the plaintiff was the owner of and in
the possession of a small stone of the nature and value of which she was ignorant;
that on that day she sold it to one of the defendants for the sum of one dollar.
Afterwards it was ascertained that the stone was a rough diamond, and of the value
of about $700. After learning this fact the plaintiff tendered the defendants the one
dollar, and ten cents as interest, and demanded a return of the stone to her. The
defendants refused to deliver it, and therefore she commenced this action.

         The plaintiff testified to the circumstances attending the sale of the stone to
Mr. Samuel B. Boynton, as follows:

                  The first time Boynton saw that stone he was talking about
         buying the topaz, or whatever it is, in September or October. I went into
         his store to get a little pin mended, and I had it in a small box--the pin,
         a small ear-ring; . . . this stone, and a broken sleeve-button were in the
         box. Mr. Boynton turned to give me a check for my pin. I thought I would
         ask him what the stone was, and I took it out of the box and asked him
         to please tell me what that was. He took it in his hand and seemed some
         time looking at it. I told him I had been told it was a topaz, and he said
         it might be. He says, "I would buy this; would you sell it?" I told him I
         did not know but what I would. What would it be worth? And he said he
         did not know; he would give me a dollar and keep it as a specimen, and
         I told him I would not sell it; and it was certainly pretty to look at. He
         asked me where I found it, and I told him in Eagle. He asked about how
         far out, and I said right in the village, and I went out. Afterwards, and
         about the 28th of December, I needed money pretty badly, and thought
         every dollar would help, and I took it back to Mr. Boynton and told him

______________________________________________________________________________

UNIT 15: ASSENT-BASED DEFENSES  299
         I had brought back the topaz, and he says, "Well, yes; what did I offer
         you for it?" and I says, "One dollar;" and he stepped to the change drawer
         and gave me the dollar, and I went out.

In another part of her testimony she says:

         Before I sold the stone I had no knowledge whatever that it was a
         diamond. I told him that I had been advised that it was probably a topaz,
         and he said probably it was. The stone was about the size of a canary
         bird's egg, nearly the shape of an egg--worn pointed at one end; it was
         nearly straw color--a little darker.

She also testified that before this action was commenced she tendered the defendants
$1.10, and demanded the return of the stone, which they refused. This is substantially
all the evidence of what took place at and before the sale to the defendants, as testified
to by the plaintiff herself. She produced no other witness on that point.

         In this case, upon the plaintiff's own evidence, there can be no just ground for
alleging that she was induced to make the sale she did by any fraud or unfair dealings
on the part of Mr. Boynton. Both were entirely ignorant at the time of the character
of the stone and of its intrinsic value. Mr. Boynton was not an expert in uncut
diamonds, and had made no examination of the stone, except to take it in his hand
and look at it before he made the offer of one dollar, which was refused at the time,
and afterwards accepted without any comment or further examination made by Mr.
Boynton. The appellant had the stone in her possession for a long time, and it appears
from her own statement that she had made some inquiry as to its nature and
qualities. If she chose to sell it without further investigation as to its intrinsic value
to a person who was guilty of no fraud or unfairness which induced her to sell it for a
small sum, she cannot repudiate the sale because it is afterwards ascertained that
she made a bad bargain.

         When this sale was made the value of the thing sold was open to the
investigation of both parties, neither knew its intrinsic value, and, so far as the
evidence in this case shows, both supposed that the price paid was adequate. How
can fraud be predicated upon such a sale, even though after-investigation showed
that the intrinsic value of the thing sold was hundreds of times greater than the price
paid? It certainly shows no such fraud as would authorize the vendor to rescind the
contract and bring an action at law to recover the possession of the thing sold.

         We can find nothing in the evidence from which it could be justly inferred that
Mr. Boynton, at the time he offered the plaintiff one dollar for the stone, had any
knowledge of the real value of the stone, or that he entertained even a belief that the
stone was a diamond. It cannot, therefore, be said that there was a suppression of
knowledge on the part of the defendant as to the value of the stone which a court of
equity might seize upon to avoid the sale.

______________________________________________________________________________

300  CHAPTER V: CONTRACT DEFENSES
         However unfortunate the plaintiff may have been in selling this valuable stone
for a mere nominal sum, she has failed entirely to make out a case either of fraud or
mistake in the sale such as will entitle her to a rescission of such sale so as to recover
the property sold in an action at law.

         Review Question 8. The rule here seems pretty straightforward, does it not?
Absent fraud, the court ultimately leaves the risk of the unknown and uncertain to
fall upon the contracting parties. Can you, however, square the reasoning and result
in Wood with the outcome of next case, which was decided only two years later in a
neighboring state?

         Replevin for a cow. Suit commenced in justice's court. Judgment for plaintiff.
Appealed to circuit court of Wayne County, and verdict and judgment for plaintiff in
that court. The defendants bring error, and set out 25 assignments of the same.

         The defendants reside at Detroit, but are in business at Walkerville, Ontario,
and have a farm at Greenfield, in Wayne County, upon which were some blooded
cattle supposed to be barren as breeders.8 The Walkers are importers and breeders of
polled Angus cattle.

         The plaintiff is a banker living at Plymouth, in Wayne County. He called upon
the defendants at Walkerville for the purchase of some of their stock, but found none
there that suited him. Meeting one of the defendants afterwards, he was informed
that they had a few head upon this Greenfield farm. He was asked to go out and look
at them, with the statement at the time that they were probably barren, and would
not breed.

Canadian Club whiskey and other alcoholic beverages. Importing polled Angus cattle from Scotland

was a side business; Walker used the left-over mash from whiskey production as cattle feed. He also

himself raised the grain used in the distilling process. Hiram Walker himself founded the "model town"

of Walkerville, Ontario, a planned community where his workers lived.--Eds.]

         May 5, 1886, plaintiff went out to Greenfield and saw the cattle. A few days
thereafter, he called upon one of the defendants with the view of purchasing a cow,
known as "Rose 2d of Aberlone." After considerable talk, it was agreed that
defendants would telephone Sherwood at his home in Plymouth in reference to the
price. The second morning after this talk he was called up by telephone, and the terms
of the sale were finally agreed upon. [Sherwood] requested defendants to confirm the
sale in writing, which they did by sending him the following letter:

     Walkerville, May 15, 1886.

     T.                          C.                    Sherwood,

     Dear Sir: We confirm sale to you of the cow Rose 2d of Aberlone, lot 56 of our
     catalogue, at five and a half cents per pound, less fifty pounds shrink. We inclose
     herewith order on Mr. Graham for the cow. You might leave check with him, or mail
     to us here, as you prefer.

     Yours truly,

                                 Hiram Walker & Sons.

         On the twenty-first of the same month the plaintiff went to defendants' farm
at Greenfield, and presented the order and letter to Graham, who informed him that
the defendants had instructed him not to deliver the cow. Soon after, the plaintiff
tendered to Hiram Walker, one of the defendants, $80, and demanded the cow.
Walker refused to take the money or deliver the cow. The plaintiff then instituted
this suit.

         The defendants then introduced evidence tending to show that at the time of
the alleged sale it was believed by both the plaintiff and themselves that the cow was
barren and would not breed; that she cost $850, and if not barren would be worth
from $750 to $1,000; that after the date of the letter, and the order to Graham, the
defendants were informed by said Graham that in his judgment the cow was with
calf, and therefore they instructed him not to deliver her to plaintiff, and on the
twentieth of May, 1886, telegraphed to the plaintiff what Graham thought about the
cow being with calf, and that consequently they could not sell her. The cow had a calf
in the month of October following.

         It appears from the record that both parties supposed this cow was barren and
would not breed, and she was sold by the pound for an insignificant sum as compared
with her real value if a breeder. She was evidently sold and purchased on the relation
of her value for beef, unless the plaintiff had learned of her true condition, and
concealed such knowledge from the defendants. Before the plaintiff secured
possession of the animal, the defendants learned that she was with calf, and therefore
of great value, and undertook to rescind the sale by refusing to deliver her. The
question arises whether they had a right to do so.

         The circuit judge ruled that this fact did not avoid the sale, and it made no
difference whether she was barren or not. I am of the opinion that the court erred in
this holding. I know that this is a close question, and the dividing line between the
adjudicated cases is not easily discerned. But it must be considered as well settled
that a party who has given an apparent consent to a contract of sale may refuse to
execute it, or he may avoid it after it has been completed, if the assent was founded,
or the contract made, upon the mistake of a material fact such as the subject-matter
of the sale, the price, or some collateral fact materially inducing the agreement; and
this can be done when the mistake is mutual. 1 JUDAH P. BENJAMIN, TREATISE ON THE
LAW OF SALE OF PERSONAL PROPERTY §§ 605, 606 (1868);9 STEPHEN MARTIN LEAKE,
ELEMENTS OF THE LAW OF CONTRACTS 339 (1867). See also Allen v. Hammond, 36 U.S.
63 (1837).

         If there is a difference or misapprehension as to the substance of the thing
bargained for, if the thing actually delivered or received is different in substance from
the thing bargained for and intended to be sold, then there is no contract; but if it be
only a difference in some quality or accident, even though the mistake may have been
the actuating motive to the purchaser or seller, or both of them, yet the contract
remains binding.

         "The difficulty in every case is to determine whether the mistake or
misapprehension is as to the substance of the whole contract, going, as it were, to the
root of the matter, or only to some point, even though a material point, an error as to
which does not affect the substance of the whole consideration." Kennedy v. Panama,
etc., Mail Co., L.R. 2 Q.B. 580, 588.

         It has been held, in accordance with the principles above stated, that where a
horse is bought under the belief that he is sound, and both vendor and vendee
honestly believe him to be sound, the purchaser must stand by his bargain, and pay
the full price, unless there was a warranty.

         It seems to me, however, in the case made by this record, that the mistake or
misapprehension of the parties went to the whole substance of the agreement. If the
cow was a breeder, she was worth at least $750; if barren, she was worth not over
$80. The parties would not have made the contract of sale except upon the
understanding and belief that she was incapable of breeding, and of no use as a cow.
It is true she is now the identical animal that they thought her to be when the contract
was made; there is no mistake as to the identity of the creature. Yet the mistake was
not of the mere quality of the animal, but went to the very nature of the thing. A

barren cow is substantially a different creature than a breeding one. There is as much
difference between them for all purposes of use as there is between an ox and a cow
that is capable of breeding and giving milk. She was not a barren cow, and, if this fact
had been known, there would have been no contract. The mistake affected the
substance of the whole consideration, and it must be considered that there was no
contract to sell or sale of the cow as she actually was. The thing sold and bought had
in fact no existence. She was sold as a beef creature would be sold; she is in fact a
breeding cow, and a valuable one.

         The judgment of the court below must be reversed, and a new trial granted,
with costs of this Court to defendants.

Problem 15.2

         The town of Amity Beach is a bustling summer seaside resort near Martha's
Vineyard. Its economy is based wholly on three months of summer tourism.

         Recently a great white shark of unusual size and tenacity has been eating
bathers along the shore, creating a great deal of bad publicity and driving tourists
away. At a town meeting, everyone is distressed over the potential loss of revenue for
the summer. The town council tries to calm the citizens down, but it is difficult. No
one has any good suggestions for what to do. Eventually, a local fisherman, Quint,
stands up. He makes the following statement:

                  Y'all know me. Know how I earn a livin'. I'll catch this bird for
         you, but it ain't gonna be easy. Bad fish. Not like going down the pond
         chasin' bluegills and tommycods. This shark, swallow you whole. Little
         shakin', little tenderizin', an' down you go. And we gotta do it quick,
         that'll bring back your tourists, put all your businesses on a payin' basis.
         But it's not gonna be pleasant. I value my neck a lot more than three
         thousand bucks, chief. I'll find him for three, but I'll catch him, and kill
         him, for one hundred. But you've gotta make up your minds. If you want
         to stay alive, then ante up. If you want to play it cheap, be on welfare
         the whole winter. I don't want no volunteers, I don't want no mates,
         there's just too many captains on this island. One hundred thousand
         dollars for me by myself. For that you get the head, the tail, the whole
         damn thing.

Quint adds that this is the deal, take it or leave it, and if he leaves the room without
an agreement the town can starve to death as far as he's concerned. As there are no
other options on the table, the council reluctantly agrees to hire Quint.

         Quint eventually catches the shark and brings it back. The town's summer is
saved. The council refuses, however, to pay him the $100,000. The reasonable fee for
his boat and services would be $1,500, but the City offers $10,000. Quint sues. What
result and why?

Problem 15.3

         Buyer is a regular attendee at garage sales in her town. While at a sale at the
home of Seller, Buyer sees a rather dull and dirty landscape painting in a rather
gaudy modern frame. Buyer, who thinks that the colors in the painting would go well
in her living room (once the thing is cleaned up) offers $50, and after some negotiation
she and Seller agree to a sale at $85. The painting is subsequently proved to be a lost
painting by American luminist artist Sanford Robinson Gifford (1823-1880). The
Sotheby's auction house appraises the painting at $100,000 to $130,000. At no time

Problem 15.4

         Tyson Foods, Inc., signs a contract to deliver 50,000 frozen chickens to
Nördliche Geflügelzuch GmbH, a German poultry processor. The contract specifies:

         each all chicken individually wrapped in cryovac, packed in secured fiber cartons
         or wooden boxes, suitable for export, 200,000 lbs. 2 1/2-3 lbs @$ 82.15 per 100
         lbs. FAS New York

         Tyson ships the chicken. When it receives the shipment, Nördliche objects,
claiming that it was expecting "broiling or frying chickens" (which are young and
tender) but instead received "stewing chickens" (which are old and tough). Tyson
says that it understood that any fresh frozen chicken that met the weight
requirements would be suitable under the contract. Assume that both parties are
telling the truth and that neither knew of the meaning attached by the other.
Nördliche rejects the chicken and refuses to pay. Tyson sues. Nördliche raises several
defenses, among them mutual mistake.

         Will the mutual mistake defense work? Why or why not?

                                           FOCUS OF THIS UNIT

         Enforceability is what makes a contract different from a mere agreement.
Enforceability means that the parties can enlist the coercive power of the government
to make the breaching party do what it promised to do (in some cases), or pay
damages for failing to do so (in far more cases). As a consequence, the "private"
agreement between the parties has a "public" aspect to it. While the private ordering
agreed to by the parties predominates, the public at large actually has some interest
in those things to which the private parties can and cannot agree. For these reasons
several defenses to otherwise enforceable contracts are what we call "policy-based."
There is some enforcement that the government simply will not do.

         Enforcement is Good, Except When It Isn't. The common-law system of
contracts rests on a general premise that enforcing private agreements is a good thing
and is therefore an important public policy of the state. Governments have many
other policies, however, and sometimes those policies conflict with the policy that
parties should be free to contract as they see fit.

         Illegal Contracts. Very early on, for example, courts would not uphold
contracts that were themselves illegal (such as contracts to fix prices in violation of
antitrust law), or that called for the commission of crimes or torts (such as murder or
property damage), or that violated public morals (such as gambling or prostitution).
The basic rule with respect to such contracts is that they are void (not merely
voidable). This means that if A has paid B $10,000 to kill C, and B fails to do so, A
cannot bring a contract claim to recover the payment. If a customer fails to pay a
prostitute or a drug dealer for goods or services, or a prostitute or drug dealer fails to
deliver what was promised, no contract remedy generally exists. We will see later
that in some cases courts may order restitution of benefits conferred in some more
technical categories of illegality (which would not include murder, prostitution, or
illegal drugs).

______________________________________________________________________________

UNIT 16: POLICY-BASED DEFENSES  307
         Against Public Policy. In many situations, a particular contract is not
specifically illegal, but enforcing the deal would require the court--an agency of the
government--to act contrary to other important government interests.

         For purposes of analyzing these "public policy" types of cases, it is useful to
start with a simple framework. First, is there a significant public policy involved?
Such policies may be found in statutes or in the common law, but the initial step is to
figure out exactly what the policy is. Second, would enforcement of the contract
conflict with that policy? What exactly is the interference that is threatened? Third,
do the public policy concerns outweigh the public interest in enforcing contracts
generally? These situations can vary a great deal from one jurisdiction to the next,
making it difficult to make any categorical statements about American law here.
Consider, for instance, the In re Baby M surrogacy contract from the beginning of the
course. What New Jersey found unenforceable might find a welcome home in another
state. Review Chapter 8 ("Unenforceability on Grounds of Public Policy") of the
Restatement (Second) of Contracts (§§ 178 - 199) to get a general feel for the current
state of public-policy analysis in contract law.

         As you might gather, public policy is often in the mind of the beholder. Courts
(and legislatures, too) can and do strongly disagree amongst themselves over the
existence of particular policies, over whether particular contracts conflict with those
policies, and over how conflicting policies should be weighed against one another.
Three of the most common and important categories of contracts that involve public
policies are (1) contracts that restrict competition, (2) contracts that limit tort
liability, and (3) contracts that impair family law obligations. We already saw the
third category in the Baby M case, so the readings below will address the first two.

         Unconscionability: Policing Fairness. Beyond the long-established concept of
contracts against public policy is the much more recent doctrine of unconscionability.
Historically, the common law did not let people out of bad bargains unless they fell
under one of the assent-based defenses--fraud, misrepresentation, duress, undue
influence, or mistake. In some contracts, no one has lied, no threat has been made,
no party's free will has been taken away, and no party has made a fundamental
mistake. Despite the absence of traditional defenses, the deal itself seems so unfair
that courts will refuse to enforce it. These were sometimes said to be contracts that
"no honest man would offer and no sane man would sign." Despite its noble intentions,
unconscionability doctrine has proven to be a particular challenge in its actual
application.

        Cases and Materials

               WILLIAM L. CLARK, JR.
HANDBOOK OF THE LAW OF CONTRACTS

            (2d ed. Francis B. Tiffany 1904)

         154. Any agreement which is contrary to the policy of the law, or public policy,
because of its mischievous nature or tendency, is illegal and void, though the acts
contemplated may not be expressly prohibited either by the common law or by
statute.

         155. The test of public policy must be applied in each case as it arises, and
therefore agreements which have been or may be declared contrary to public policy
cannot be exactly classified. The most general are:

                  (a) Agreements tending to injure the public service.

                  (b) Agreements involving or tending to the corruption of private
         citizens with respect to public matters.

                  (c) Agreements tending to pervert or obstruct public justice.

                  (d) Agreements tending to encourage litigation.

                  (e) Agreements of immoral tendency.

                  (f) Gambling transactions.

                  (g) Agreements tending to induce fraud and breach of trust.

                  (h) Agreements affecting the freedom or security of marriage, or
         otherwise in derogation of the marriage relationship.

                  (i) Agreements in derogation of the parental relation.

                  (j) Agreements in unreasonable restraint of trade, including
         combinations to prevent competition, control prices, and prevent
         monopolies.

                  (k) Agreements exempting a person or corporation from liability
         for negligence.

                                           _____________________

         Review Question 1. As the 1904 Clark treatise demonstrates, the roots of the
public policy defense go back fairly far and have covered a broad range of topics. Do
you think any of the listed categories of suspect contracts would not be categorized as
against public policy today? Which ones? Can you think of any categories of contract
not in Clark's list where a court today might consider their enforcement to be against
public policy?

     HANKS v. POWDER RIDGE RESTAURANT CORP.
                       Supreme Court of Connecticut
                          885 A.2d 734 (Conn. 2005)

SULLIVAN, C. J.

         The defendants operate a facility in Middlefield, known as Powder Ridge, at
which the public, in exchange for a fee, is invited to ski, snowboard and snowtube. On
February 16, 2003, the plaintiff brought his three children and another child to
Powder Ridge to snowtube. Neither the plaintiff nor the four children had ever
snowtubed at Powder Ridge, but the snowtubing run was open to the public generally,
regardless of prior snowtubing experience, with the restriction that only persons at
least six years old or forty-four inches tall were eligible to participate. Further, in
order to snowtube at Powder Ridge, patrons were required to sign a "Waiver, Defense,
Indemnity and Hold Harmless Agreement, and Release of Liability." The plaintiff
read and signed the agreement on behalf of himself and the four children. While
snowtubing, the plaintiff's right foot became caught between his snow tube and the
man-made bank of the snowtubing run, resulting in serious injuries that required
multiple surgeries to repair.

         Thereafter, the plaintiff filed the present negligence action against the
defendants.

         The defendants moved for summary judgment, claiming that the agreement
barred the plaintiff's negligence claim as a matter of law. The trial court, relying on
Hyson v. White Water Mountain Resorts of Connecticut, Inc., 829 A.2d 827 (Conn.
2003), agreed and rendered summary judgment in favor of the defendants. This
appeal followed.

         We first address the plaintiff's claim that the agreement does not expressly
release the defendants from liability for personal injuries incurred as a result of their
own negligence as required by Hyson. Specifically, the plaintiff maintains that an
ordinary person of reasonable intelligence would not understand that, by signing the
agreement, he or she was releasing the defendants from liability for future
negligence. We disagree.

     The agreement at issue in the present case provides in relevant part:

     I understand that there are inherent risks involved in snowtubing, including the risk
     of serious physical injury or death and I fully assume all risks associated with
     snowtubing, even if due to the NEGLIGENCE of [the defendants] including but not
     limited to: variations in the snow conditions; steepness and terrain; the presence
     of ice, moguls, bare spots and objects beneath the snowtubing surface such as
     rocks, debris and tree stumps; collisions with objects both on and off the
     snowtubing chutes such as hay bales, trees, rocks, snowmaking equipment,
     barriers, lift cables and equipment, lift towers, lift attendants, employees,
     volunteers, other patrons and spectators or their property; equipment or lift

______________________________________________________________________________

condition or failure; lack of safety devices or inadequate safety devices; lack of
warnings or inadequate warnings; lack of instructions or inadequate instructions;
use of any lift; and the like. . . . I hereby release, and agree that I will not sue [the
defendants] for money damages for personal injury or property damage sustained
by me while using the snowtubing facilities and equipment even if due to the
NEGLIGENCE of [the defendants].

(Emphasis in original.)

         We conclude that the agreement expressly and unambiguously purports to
release the defendants from prospective liability for negligence. An ordinary person
of reason able intelligence would understand that, by signing the agreement, he or
she was releasing the defendants from liability for their future negligence.

         We next address the issue we explicitly left unresolved in Hyson, namely,
whether the enforcement of a well drafted exculpatory agreement purporting to
release a snowtube operator from prospective liability for personal injuries sustained
as a result of the operator's negligent conduct violates public policy.

         Although it is well established that parties are free to contract for whatever
terms on which they may agree, it is equally well established that contracts that
violate public policy are unenforceable. The question of whether a contract is against
public policy is a question of law dependent on the circumstances of the particular
case, over which an appellate court has unlimited review.

         The law does not favor contract provisions which relieve a person from his own
negligence. This is because exculpatory provisions undermine the policy
considerations governing our tort system. The fundamental policy purposes of the
tort compensation system are compensation of innocent parties, shifting the loss to
responsible parties or distributing it among appropriate entities, and deterrence of
wrongful conduct. It is sometimes said that compensation for losses is the primary
function of tort law but it is perhaps more accurate to describe the primary function
as one of determining when compensation is required. An equally compelling function
of the tort system is the prophylactic factor of preventing future harm. The courts are
concerned not only with compensation of the victim, but with admonition of the
wrongdoer. Thus, it is consistent with public policy to posit the risk of negligence upon
the actor and, if this policy is to be abandoned, it has generally been to allow or
require that the risk shift to another party better or equally able to bear it, not to
shift the risk to the weak bargainer.

         Although this court previously has not addressed the enforceability of a release
of liability for future negligence, the issue has been addressed by many of our sister
states. A frequently cited standard for determining whether exculpatory agreements
violate public policy was set forth by the Supreme Court of California in Tunkl v.
Regents of the University of California, 383 P.2d 441 (Cal. 1963). In Tunkl, the court
concluded that exculpatory agreements violate public policy if they affect the public

______________________________________________________________________________

UNIT 16: POLICY-BASED DEFENSES                                                             311
interest adversely, and identified six factors (Tunkl factors) relevant to this
determination: [1] The agreement concerns a business of a type generally thought
suitable for public regulation. [2] The party seeking exculpation is engaged in
performing a service of great importance to the public, which is often a matter of
practical necessity for some members of the public. [3] The party holds himself out as
willing to perform this service for any member of the public who seeks it, or at least
for any member coming within certain established standards. [4] As a result of the
essential nature of the service, in the economic setting of the transaction, the party
invoking exculpation possesses a decisive advantage of bar gaining strength against
any member of the public who seeks his services. [5] In exercising a superior
bargaining power the party confronts the public with a standardized adhesion
contract of exculpation, and makes no provision whereby a purchaser may pay
additional reasonable fees and obtain protection against negligence. [6] Finally, as a
result of the transaction, the person or property of the purchaser is placed under the
control of the seller, subject to the risk of carelessness by the seller or his agents. The
court clarified that an exculpatory agreement may affect the public interest adversely
even if some of the Tunkl factors are not satisfied.

         Various states have adopted the Tunkl factors to determine whether
exculpatory agreements affect the public interest adversely and, thus, violate public
policy. See, e.g., Anchorage v. Locker, 723 P.2d 1261, 1265 (Alaska 1986); Olson v.
Molzen, 558 S.W.2d 429, 431 (Tenn. 1977); Wagenblast v. Odessa School District, 758
P.2d 968 (Wash. 1988). Other states have developed their own variations of the Tunkl
factors; see, e.g., Jones v. Dressel, 623 P.2d 370, 376 (Colo. 1981) Rawlings v. Layne &
Bowler Pump Co., 465 P.2d 107 (Idaho 1970), while still others have adopted a totality
of the circumstances approach. See, e.g., Wolf v. Ford, 644 A.2d 522 (Md. 1994);
Dalury v. S-K-I, Ltd., A.2d 795 (Vt. 1995). The Virginia Supreme Court, however, has
determined that all exculpatory agreements purporting to release tortfeasors from
future liability for personal injuries are unenforceable because "to hold that it was
competent for one party to put the other parties to the contract at the mercy of its
own misconduct can never be law fully done where an enlightened system of
jurisprudence prevails. Public policy forbids it." Hiett v. Lake Barcroft Community
Ass'n, 418 S.E.2d 894 (Va. 1992).

         Having reviewed the various methods for determining whether exculpatory
agreements violate public policy, we conclude, as the Tunkl court itself acknowledged,
that "no definition of the concept of public interest can be contained within the four
corners of a formula." Accordingly, we agree with the Supreme Courts of Maryland
and Vermont that "the ultimate determination of what constitutes the public interest
must be made considering the totality of the circumstances of any given case against
the backdrop of current societal expectations." Thus, our analysis is guided, but not
limited, by the Tunkl factors, and is informed by any other factors that may be
relevant given the factual circumstances of the case and current societal expectations.

312  CHAPTER V: CONTRACT DEFENSES
         We now turn to the merits of the plaintiff's claim. The defendants are in the
business of providing snowtubing services to the public generally, regardless of prior
snowtubing experience, with the minimal restriction that only persons at least six
years old or forty-four inches tall are eligible to participate. Given the virtually
unrestricted access of the public to Powder Ridge, a reasonable person would presume
that the defendants were offering a recreational activity that the whole family could
enjoy safely. Indeed, this presumption is borne out by the plaintiff's own testimony.
Specifically, the plaintiff testified that he "trusted that [the defendants] would, within
their good conscience, operate a safe ride."

         The societal expectation that family oriented recreational activities will be
reasonably safe is even more important where, as in the present matter, patrons are
under the care and control of the recreational operator as a result of an economic
transaction. The plaintiff, in exchange for a fee, was permitted access to the
defendants' snowtubing runs and was provided with snowtubing gear. As a result of
this transaction, the plaintiff was under the care and control of the defendants and,
thus, was subject to the risk of the defendants' carelessness. Specifically, the
defendants designed and maintained the snowtubing run and, therefore, controlled
the steepness of the incline, the condition of the snow and the method of slowing down
or stopping patrons. Further, the defendants provided the plaintiff with the requisite
snowtubing supplies and, therefore, controlled the size and quality of the snow tube
as well as the provision of any necessary protective gear. Accordingly, the plaintiff
voluntarily relinquished control to the defendants with the reasonable expectation of
an exciting, but reasonably safe, snowtubing experience.

         Moreover, the plaintiff lacked the knowledge, experience and authority to
discern whether, much less ensure that, the defendants' snowtubing runs were
maintained in a reasonably safe condition. As the Vermont Supreme Court observed,
in the context of the sport of skiing, it is consistent with public policy

to place responsibility for maintenance of the land on those who own or
control it, with the ultimate goal of keeping accidents to the minimum
level possible. [The] defendants, not recreational skiers, have the
expertise and opportunity to foresee and control hazards, and to guard
against the negligence of their agents and employees. They alone can
properly maintain and inspect their premises, and train their employees
in risk management. They alone can insure against risks and effectively
spread the costs of insurance among their thousands of customers.
Skiers, on the other hand, are not in a position to discover and correct
risks of harm, and they cannot insure against the ski area's negligence.

         If the defendants were permitted to obtain broad waivers of their
liability, an important incentive for ski areas to manage risk would be
removed, with the public bearing the cost of the resulting injuries. It is

         illogical, in these circumstances, to undermine the public policy
         underlying business invitee law and allow skiers to bear risks they have
         no ability or right to control.1

Dalury v. S-K-I, Ltd., supra.

         Further, the agreement at issue was a standardized adhesion contract offered
to the plaintiff on a "take it or leave it" basis. The most salient feature of adhesion
contracts is that they are not subject to the normal bargaining processes of ordinary
contracts. See BLACK'S LAW DICTIONARY (7TH ED. 1999) (defining adhesion contract as
"[a] standard form contract prepared by one party, to be signed by the party in a
weaker position, [usually] a consumer, who has little choice about the terms"). Not
only was the plaintiff unable to negotiate the terms of the agreement, but the
defendants also did not offer him the option of procuring protection against negligence
at an additional reasonable cost. See Restatement (Third), Torts, Apportionment of
Liability § 2, comment (e), p. 21 (2000) (factor relevant to enforcement of contractual
limit on liability is "whether the party seeking exculpation was willing to provide
greater protection against tortious conduct for a reasonable, additional fee").
Moreover, the defendants did not inform prospective snowtubers prior to their arrival
at Powder Ridge that they would have to waive important common-law rights as a
condition of participation. Thus, the plaintiff, who traveled to Powder Ridge in
anticipation of snowtubing that day, was faced with the dilemma of either signing the
defendants' proffered waiver of prospective liability or forgoing completely the
opportunity to snowtube at Powder Ridge. Under the present factual circumstances,
it would ignore reality to conclude that the plaintiff wielded the same bargaining
power as the defendants.

         In the present case, the defendants held themselves out as a provider of a
healthy, fun, family activity. After the plaintiff and his family arrived at Powder
Ridge eager to participate in the activity, however, the defendants informed the
plaintiff that, not only would they be immune from claims arising from the inherent
risks of the activity, but they would not be responsible for injuries resulting from their
own carelessness and negligence in the operation of the snowtubing facility. We
recognize that the plaintiff had the option of walking away. We cannot say, however,
that the defendants had no bargaining advantage under these circumstances.

          1 [By the court] Exculpatory agreements, like the one at issue in the present matter, shift the
costs of injuries from the tortfeasor to the person injured. As a consequence, health care insurance
providers or the state, through its provision of medicaid benefits, absorb the costs of the tortfeasor's
negligence. These costs necessarily are passed on to the population of the state through higher health
care premiums and state taxes. Accordingly, in the present matter, it ultimately would be the
population generally, and not the snowtube operators and their patrons, who would bear the costs if
these agreements were to be enforced.

______________________________________________________________________________

314  CHAPTER V: CONTRACT DEFENSES
         For the foregoing reasons, we conclude that the agreement in the present
matter affects the public interest adversely and, therefore, is unenforceable because
it violates public policy. Accordingly, the trial court improperly rendered summary
judgment in favor of the defendants.

         The defendants and the dissent point out that our conclusion represents the
"distinct minority view" and is inconsistent with the majority of sister state authority
upholding exculpatory agreements in similar recreational settings. We acknowledge
that most states uphold adhesion contracts releasing recreational operators from
prospective liability for personal injuries caused by their own negligent conduct. Put
simply, we disagree with these decisions for the reasons already explained in this
opinion.

         The judgment is reversed and the case is remanded for further proceedings
according to law.

NORCOTT, J., dissenting.

         I would follow the overwhelming majority of our sister states and would
conclude that prospective releases from liability for negligence are permissible in the
context of recreational activities. Accordingly, I respectfully dissent from the
majority's decision to take a road that is, for many persuasive reasons, far less
traveled.

         [The dissent applies the Tunkl factors, noting that snowtubing, unlike skiing,
is not generally regulated in Connecticut; that snowtubing, unlike medical services,
child care, banking, and real estate services, is not an "important public service"; that
snowboarding is a purely personal, recreational activity that causes no harm if not
engaged in; and that the essence of snowtubing is that one races down a hill without
being under the control of the provider.]

         In sum, I conclude that, under the Tunkl factors, the defendants' release at
issue in this case does not violate public policy with respect to the sport of snowtubing.
This conclusion is consistent with the vast majority of sister state authority, which
upholds releases of liability in a variety of recreational or athletic settings that are
akin to snowtubing as not violative of public policy. It also is consistent with the view
of the American Law Institute, as embodied in Restatement (Second) of Contracts §
195 (1981).2 I, therefore, respectfully dissent.

2 [By the court] Restatement (Second) of Contracts § 195 (1981) provides in relevant part:

(2) A term exempting a party from tort liability for harm caused negligently is

unenforceable on grounds of public policy if

(a) the term exempts an employer from liability to an employee for

injury in the course of his employment;

         Review Question 2. The dissent, a majority of states, and section 195 of the
Restatement (Second) of Contracts take a position under which the release in Hanks
would be enforced. What would the policies be that favor enforcement of a contract
excusing negligence? If parties have the ability to contract around the duty not to be
negligent, how much does that undermine a fundamental purpose of tort law?

     VALLEY MEDICAL SPECIALISTS v. FARBER
                      Supreme Court of Arizona

          194 Ariz. 363, 982 P.2d 1277 (en banc 1999)

FELDMAN, J.

         In 1985, Valley Medical Specialists ("VMS"), a professional corporation, hired
Steven S. Farber, D.O., an internist and pulmonologist who, among other things,
treated AIDS and HIV-positive patients and performed brachytherapy--a procedure
that radiates the inside of the lung in lung cancer patients. Brachytherapy can only
be performed at certain hospitals that have the necessary equipment. A few years
after joining VMS, Dr. Farber became a shareholder and subsequently a minority
officer and director. In 1991, the three directors, including Dr. Farber, entered into
new stock and employment agreements. The employment agreement contained a
restrictive covenant, the scope of which was amended over time.

         In 1994, Dr. Farber left VMS and began practicing within the area defined by
the restrictive covenant, which at that time read as follows:

         The parties recognize that the duties to be rendered under the terms of this Agreement by
         the Employee are special, unique and of an extraordinary character. The Employee, in
         consideration of the compensation to be paid to him pursuant to the terms of this
         Agreement, expressly agrees to the following restrictive covenants:

                   (a) The Employee shall not, directly or indirectly:

                   . . .

                   (ii) Either separately, jointly, or in association with others, establish, engage in, or
                   become interested in, as an employee, owner, partner, shareholder or otherwise,

               (b) the term exempts one charged with a duty of public service from
     liability to one to whom that duty is owed for compensation for breach of that
     duty, or

               (c) the other party is similarly a member of a class protected against
     the class to which the first party belongs.

         or furnish any information to, work for, or assist in any manner, anyone competing
         with, or who may compete with the Employer in the practice of medicine.

         . . .

         (iv) Either separately, jointly or in association with others to provide medical care
         or medical assistance for any person or persons who were patients or [sic]
         Employer during the period that Employee was in the hire of Employer.

         . . .

         (d) The restrictive covenants set forth herein shall continue during the term of this
Agreement and for a period of three (3) years after the date of termination, for any reason,
of this Agreement. The restrictive covenants set forth herein shall be binding upon the
Employee in that geographical area encompassed within the boundaries measured by a
five (5) mile radius of any office maintained or utilized by Employer at the time of execution
of the Agreement or at any time thereafter.

         VMS filed a complaint against Dr. Farber seeking (1) preliminary and
permanent injunctions enjoining Dr. Farber from violating the restrictive covenant,
(2) liquidated damages for breach of the employment agreement, and (3) damages for
breach of fiduciary duty, conversion of patient files and confidential information, and
intentional interference with contractual and/or business relations.

         Following six days of testimony and argument, the trial court denied VMS's
request for a preliminary injunction, finding that the restrictive covenant violated
public policy.

         The court of appeals reversed, concluding that a modified covenant was
reasonable.

         A brief reference to basic principles is appropriate. Historically, covenants not
to compete were viewed as restraints of trade and were invalid at common law.
Eventually, ancillary restraints, such as those incident to employment or partnership
agreements, were enforced under the rule of reason. See Restatement (Second) of
Contracts § 188 (1981).

         A covenant not to compete is invalid unless it protects some legitimate interest
beyond the employer's desire to protect itself from competition. The legitimate
purpose of post-employment restraints is to prevent competitive use, for a time, of
information or relationships which pertain peculiarly to the employer and which the
employee acquired in the course of the employment. Despite the freedom to contract,
the law does not favor restrictive covenants.

         We first address the level of scrutiny that should be afforded to this restrictive
covenant. Dr. Farber argues that this contract is simply an employer-employee
agreement and thus the restrictive covenant should be strictly construed against the
employer. See Amex Distributing Co. v. Mascari, 724 P.2d 596, 600 (Ariz. Ct. App.
1986) (noting employer-employee restrictive covenants are disfavored and strictly

______________________________________________________________________________

UNIT 16: POLICY-BASED DEFENSES  317
construed against the employer). This was the approach taken by the trial court. VMS
contends that this is more akin to the sale of a business; thus, the noncompete
provision should not be strictly construed against it. See id. (courts more lenient in
enforcing restrictive covenants connected to sale of business because of need to
effectively transfer goodwill). Finding the agreement here not on all fours with either
approach, the court of appeals applied a standard "somewhere between" the two.

         Although this agreement is between partners, it is more analogous to an
employer-employee agreement than a sale of a business. See Restatement § 188 cmt.
h ("A rule similar to that applicable to an employee or agent applies to a partner who
makes a promise not to compete that is ancillary to the partnership agreement or to
an agreement by which he disposes of his partnership interest."). Many of the
concerns present in the sale of a business are not present or are reduced where, as
here, a physician leaves a medical group, even when that physician is a partner.
When a business is sold, the value of that business's goodwill usually figures
significantly into the purchase price. The buyer therefore deserves some protection
from competition from the former owner. A restraint accompanying the sale of a
business is necessary for the buyer to get the full goodwill value for which it has paid.

         It is true that in this case, unlike typical employer-employee agreements, Dr.
Farber may not have been at a bargaining disadvantage, which is one of the reasons
such restrictive covenants are strictly construed. Unequal bargaining power may be
a factor to consider when examining the hardship on the departing employee. But in
cases involving the professions, public policy concerns may outweigh any protectable
interest the remaining firm members may have. Thus, this case does not turn on the
hardship to Dr. Farber.

         By restricting a physician's practice of medicine, this covenant involves strong
public policy implications and must be closely scrutinized. Although stopping short of
banning restrictive covenants between physicians, the American Medical Association
("AMA") "discourages" such covenants, finding they are not in the public interest.

                  The Council on Ethical and Judicial Affairs discourages any
         agreement between physicians which restricts the right of a physician
         to practice medicine for a specified period of time or in a specified area
         upon termination of employment or a partnership or a corporate
         agreement. Such restrictive agreements are not in the public interest.

1989 CURRENT OPINIONS OF THE COUNCIL ON ETHICAL AND JUDICIAL Affairs § 9.02
(hereinafter "AMA Opinions"). In addition, the AMA recognizes that free choice of
doctors is the right of every patient, and free competition among physicians is a
prerequisite of optimal care and ethical practice. See AMA OPINIONS § 9.06.

         For similar reasons, restrictive covenants are prohibited between attorneys. In
1969, the American Bar Association adopted a code of professional conduct that

______________________________________________________________________________

318  CHAPTER V: CONTRACT DEFENSES
contained a disciplinary rule prohibiting restrictive covenants between attorneys.
The ethical rules adopted by this court provide:

A lawyer shall not participate in offering or making:

         (a) a partnership or employment agreement that restricts the
rights of a lawyer to practice after termination of the relationship except
an agreement concerning benefits upon retirement; or

         (b) an agreement in which a restriction on the lawyers right to
practice is part of the settlement of a controversy between private
parties.

Ethical Rule ("ER") 5.6, Arizona Rules of Professional Conduct, Rule 42.

         Restrictive covenants between lawyers limit not only their professional
autonomy but also the client's freedom to choose a lawyer. We do not, of course, enact
ethical rules for the medical profession, but given the view of the AMA to which we
have previously alluded, we believe the principle behind prohibiting restrictive
covenants in the legal profession is relevant.

         Commercial standards may not be used to evaluate the reasonableness of
lawyer restrictive covenants. Strong public policy considerations preclude their
applicability. In that sense lawyer restrictions are injurious to the public interest. A
client is always entitled to be represented by counsel of his own choosing. The
attorney-client relationship is consensual, highly fiduciary on the part of counsel, and
he may do nothing which restricts the right of the client to repose confidence in any
counsel of his choice. No concept of the practice of law is more deeply rooted.

         We therefore conclude that the doctor-patient relationship is special and
entitled to unique protection. It cannot be easily or accurately compared to
relationships in the commercial context. In light of the great public policy interest
involved in covenants not to compete between physicians, each agreement will be
strictly construed for reasonableness.

         Reasonableness is a fact-intensive inquiry that depends on the totality of the
circumstances. A restriction is unreasonable and thus will not be enforced: (1) if the
restraint is greater than necessary to protect the employer's legitimate interest; or
(2) if that interest is outweighed by the hardship to the employee and the likely injury
to the public. Thus, in the present case, the reasonableness inquiry requires us to
examine the interests of the employer, employee, patients, and public in general.
Balancing these competing interests is no easy task and no exact formula can be used.

         VMS contends, and the court of appeals agreed, that it has a protectable
interest in its patients and referral sources. In the commercial context, it is clear that
employers have a legitimate interest in retaining their customer base. The employer's
point of view is that the company's clientele is an asset of value which has been

______________________________________________________________________________

UNIT 16: POLICY-BASED DEFENSES                                               319
acquired by virtue of effort and expenditures over a period of time, and which should
be protected as a form of property. In the medical context, however, the personal
relationship between doctor and patient as well as the patient's freedom to see a
particular doctor, affects the extent of the employer's interest. The practice of a
physician is a thing so purely personal, depending so absolutely on the confidence
reposed in his personal skill and ability, that when he ceases to exist it necessarily
ceases also.

         These facts support the trial judge's conclusion that VMS's interest in
protecting its patient base was outweighed by other factors.

[    Moreover,] the restriction cannot be greater than necessary to protect VMS's

legitimate interests. A restraint's scope is defined by its duration and geographic

area. The frequency of contact between doctors and their patients affects the

permissible length of the restraint. The idea is to give the employer a reasonable

amount of time to overcome the former employee's loss, usually by hiring a

replacement and giving that replacement time to establish a working relationship.

When the restraint is for the purpose of protecting customer relationships, its

duration is reasonable only if it is no longer than necessary for the employer to put a

new man on the job and for the new employee to have a reasonable opportunity to

demonstrate his effectiveness to the customers.

         In this case, the trial judge found that the three-year period was an
unreasonable duration because

     all of the experts agree that the practice of pulmonology entails treating
     patients with chronic conditions which require more hospital care than
     office care and which requires regular contact with the treating
     physician at least once within each six-month period so that any
     provision over six months is onerous and unnecessary to protect VMS's
     economic interests where virtually all of Dr. Farber's VMS patients had
     an opportunity by late 1994 or early 1995 (Farber left September 12,
     1994) to decide which pulmonologist . . . they would consult for their
     ongoing treatment[.]

On this record, we cannot say this factual finding was clearly erroneous. The three-
year duration is unreasonable.

         The court of appeals held that the restrictive covenant does not violate public
policy, pointing out that the record contains nothing to suggest there will be a lack of
pulmonologists in the restricted area if Dr. Farber is precluded from practicing there.
Even if we assume other pulmonologists will be available to cover Dr. Farber's
patients, we disagree with this view. It ignores the significant interests of individual
patients within the restricted area. A court must evaluate the extent to which
enforcing the covenant would foreclose patients from seeing the departing physician
if they desire to do so.

______________________________________________________________________________

320                                              CHAPTER V: CONTRACT DEFENSES
         Concluding that patients' right to see the doctor of their choice is entitled to
substantial protection, VMS's protectable interests here are comparatively minimal.
The geographic scope of this covenant encompasses approximately 235 square miles,
making it very difficult for Dr. Farber's existing patients to continue treatment with
him if they so desire. After six days of testimony, the trial judge concluded that this
restrictive covenant was unreasonably broad and against public policy. Given the
facts and the principles discussed, that finding is well supported factually and legally.

         This contract contains a severance clause.2 The court of appeals accepted a
stipulation by VMS that the restriction would not prohibit Dr. Farber from treating
HIV-positive and AIDS patients or from performing brachytherapy. On its face,
however, the restriction is broader than that, restricting him from providing "medical
care or medical assistance for any person or persons who were patients or [sic]
Employer during the period that Employee was in the hire of Employer." Arizona
courts will "blue pencil" restrictive covenants, eliminating grammatically severable,
unreasonable provisions. Here, however, the modifications go further than cutting
grammatically severable portions. The court of appeals, in essence, rewrote the
agreement in an attempt to make it enforceable. This goes too far. Where the
severability of the agreement is not evident from the contract itself, the court cannot
create a new agreement for the parties to uphold the contract.

         Even the blue pencil rule has its critics. For every agreement that makes its
way to court, many more do not. Thus, the words of the covenant have an in terrorem
effect on departing employees. Employers may therefore create ominous covenants,
knowing that if the words are challenged, courts will modify the agreement to make
it enforceable. Although we will tolerate ignoring severable portions of a covenant to
make it more reasonable, we will not permit courts to add terms or rewrite provisions.

         We hold that the restrictive covenant between Dr. Farber and VMS cannot be
enforced. Valley Medical Specialists' interest in enforcing the restriction is
outweighed by the likely injury to patients and the public in general.

2 [By the court: The severance clause in the Agreement provides:] Since it is the agreement and

desire of the parties hereto that the provisions of this Paragraph 17 be enforced to the fullest extent

possible under the laws and public policies applied in each jurisdiction in which enforcement is sought,

should any particular provision of this Paragraph 17 be deemed invalid or unenforceable, the same

shall be deemed reformed and amended to delete herefrom that portion thus adjudicated invalid, and

the deletion shall apply only with respect to the operation of said provision and, to the extent a

provision of this Paragraph 17 would be deemed unenforceable by virtue of its scope, but may be made

unenforceable by limitation thereof, each party agrees that this Agreement shall be reformed and

amended so that the same shall be enforceable to the fullest extent permissible under the laws and

public policies applied in the jurisdiction in which enforcement is sought, the parties hereto

acknowledging that the covenants contained in this Paragraph 17 are an indispensable part of the

transactions contemplated herein.

         Review Question 3. Suppose you are a transactional attorney hired by Valley
Medical Specialists following this case. How might you rewrite the covenant-not-to-
compete terms quoted in the case to improve the chances that an Arizona court would
enforce them? Consult section 188 of the Second Restatement in connection with
answering this question. Incidentally, what exactly is the "blue pencil rule" and how
might it impact the way you draft non-competition provisions?

         Review Question 4. The Valley Medical Specialists court notes that an
"ominous" and unenforceable covenant not to compete may have "an in terrorem effect
on departing employees." What does that mean? Do attorneys--who like doctors are
government-licensed professionals with public obligations--drafting a contract have
any ethical or moral obligation to not include contract terms that they know to be
unenforceable? Why or why not?

         Plaintiff sued defendant to recover $2,000 with interest at the rate of 8% per
annum from April 2, 1942, alleged to be due on the following instrument, being a
translation from the original, which is written in the Greek language:

Trial to the court without the intervention of a jury resulted in a judgment in favor
of plaintiff for $750.00 principal, and interest at the rate of 8% per annum from April
2, 1942 to the date of judgment, totaling $1,163.83, with interest thereon at the rate
of 8% per annum until paid. Plaintiff has perfected his appeal.

         [Defendant] avers that on or about April 2, 1942 she owned money and
property and had credit in the United States of America, but was then and there in
the Kingdom of Greece in straitened financial circumstances due to the conditions
produced by World War II and could not make use of her money and property and
credit existing in the United States of America. That in the circumstances the
plaintiff agreed to and did lend to defendant the sum of 500,000 drachmae, which at
that time, on or about April 2, 1942, had the value of $25.00 in money of the United
States of America. That the said plaintiff, knowing defendant's financial distress and
desire to return to the United States of America, exacted of her the written
instrument plaintiff sues upon, which was a promise by her to pay to him the sum of
$2,000.00 of United States of America money.

         Defendant testified that she did receive 500,000 drachmas from plaintiff. It is
not clear whether she received all the 500,000 drachmas or only a portion of them
before she signed the instrument in question. Her testimony clearly shows that the
understanding of the parties was that plaintiff would give her the 500,000 drachmas
if she would sign the instrument. She testified:

                  Q. Who suggested the figure of $2,000.00?

                  A. That was how he asked me from the beginning. He said he will give
         me five hundred thousand drachmas provided I signed that I would pay him
         $2,000.00 American money.

The transaction amounted to a sale by plaintiff of the 500,000 drachmas in
consideration of the execution of the instrument sued on, by defendant. It is not
contended that the drachmas had no value. Indeed, the judgment indicates that the
trial court placed a value of $750 on them or on the other consideration which plaintiff
gave defendant for the instrument if he believed plaintiff's testimony. Therefore the
plea of want of consideration was unavailing. A plea of want of consideration amounts
to a contention that the instrument never became a valid obligation in the first place.

         Defendant got exactly what she contracted for according to her own testimony.
The court should have rendered judgment in favor of plaintiff against defendant for
the principal sum of $2,000.00 evidenced by the instrument sued on, with interest as
therein provided. We construe the provision relating to interest as providing for
interest at the rate of 8% per annum. The judgment is reformed so as to award
appellant a recovery against appellee of $2,000.00 with interest thereon at the rate
of 8% per annum from April 2, 1942. Such judgment will bear interest at the rate of
8% per annum until paid on $2,000.00 thereof and on the balance interest at the rate
of 6% per annum. As so reformed, the judgment is affirmed.

         Review Question 5. Hang on. The Batsakis case is a discussion of
consideration. Didn't we already cover that? Why on earth did your casebook authors
include this case here and now?

         Review Question 6. In April 1941, the Axis powers (led by Nazi Germany) had
occupied Greece. Estimates are that some 300,000 people died of starvation in Athens
during the occupation. April 1942--when Demotsis asked Batsakis for money--was
perhaps the high-water mark for the Axis. Much of the American fleet had been
destroyed at Pearl Harbor; England was still suffering bombing raids; the Philippines
and much of southeast Asia had fallen to the Japanese; hundreds of American
merchant ships were being sunk right off the country's coasts; German troops had
captured Kiev, encircled Leningrad, and reached the outskirts of Moscow; British
troops in North Africa were retreating back to Egypt and their Mediterranean supply
lines were in a shambles. In that context, Eugenia Demotsis borrowed the value of
$25 in exchange for a promise to pay George Batsakis $2,000 "plus interest." If we
generally believe in freedom of contract, what possible problems are there with
Batsakis reaping the benefit of a shrewd business deal?

         Review Question 7. Before you read the next case, Williams v. Walker-Thomas
Furniture Co., read section 2-302 of the Uniform Commercial Code. Imagine you are
a judge with a strong "textualist" view of statutory interpretation--i.e., you believe
that the meaning of a statute should be predominantly or exclusively derived from its
enacted text and not its legislative history (such as the UCC Official Comments). If
you were tasked with resolving a claim that a particular contract was
"unconscionable," how would you determine what the term means?

324  CHAPTER V: CONTRACT DEFENSES
                   WILLIAMS v. WALKER-THOMAS FURNITURE CO.
            United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit

                            121 U.S. App. D.C. 315, 350 F.2d 445 (1965)

J. SKELLY WRIGHT, Circuit Judge

         Appellee, Walker-Thomas Furniture Company, operates a retail furniture
store in the District of Columbia. During the period from 1957 to 1962 each appellant
in these cases purchased a number of household items from Walker-Thomas, for
which payment was to be made in installments. The terms of each purchase were
contained in a printed form contract which set forth the value of the purchased item
and purported to lease the item to appellant for a stipulated monthly rent payment.
The contract then provided, in substance, that title would remain in Walker-Thomas
until the total of all the monthly payments made equaled the stated value of the item,
at which time appellants could take title. In the event of a default in the payment of
any monthly installment, Walker-Thomas could repossess the item.

         The contract further provided that "the amount of each periodical installment
payment to be made by [purchaser] to the Company under this present lease shall be
inclusive of and not in addition to the amount of each installment payment to be made
by [purchaser] under such prior leases, bills or accounts; and all payments now and
hereafter made by [purchaser] shall be credited pro rata on all outstanding leases,
bills and accounts due the Company by [purchaser] at the time each such payment is
made." (Emphasis added.) The effect of this rather obscure provision was to keep a
balance due on every item purchased until the balance due on all items, whenever
purchased, was liquidated. As a result, the debt incurred at the time of purchase of
each item was secured by the right to repossess all the items previously purchased
by the same purchaser, and each new item purchased automatically became subject
to a security interest arising out of the previous dealings.

         On May 12, 1962, appellant Thorne purchased an item described as a Daveno
[sofa], three tables, and two lamps, having total stated value of $391.10. Shortly
thereafter, he defaulted on his monthly payments and appellee sought to replevy all
the items purchased since the first transaction in 1958. Similarly, on April 17, 1962,
appellant Williams bought a stereo set of stated value of $514.95.3 She too defaulted
shortly thereafter, and appellee sought to replevy all the items purchased since
December, 1957. The Court of General Sessions granted judgment for appellee. The

          3 [By the court] At the time of this purchase her account showed a balance of $164 still owing
from her prior purchases. The total of all the purchases made over the years in question came to $1,800.
The total payments amounted to $1,400.

______________________________________________________________________________

UNIT 16: POLICY-BASED DEFENSES  325
District of Columbia Court of Appeals affirmed, and we granted appellants' motion
for leave to appeal to this court.4

         Appellants' principal contention, rejected by both the trial and the appellate
courts below, is that these contracts, or at least some of them, are unconscionable
and, hence, not enforceable. In its opinion, the District of Columbia Court of Appeals
explained its rejection of this contention as follows:

         Appellant's second argument presents a more serious question. The record
reveals that prior to the last purchase appellant had reduced the balance in her
account to $164. The last purchase, a stereo set, raised the balance due to $678.
Significantly, at the time of this and the preceding purchases, appellee was aware of
appellant's financial position. The reverse side of the stereo contract listed the name
of appellant's social worker and her $218 monthly stipend from the government.
Nevertheless, with full knowledge that appellant had to feed, clothe and support both
herself and seven children on this amount, appellee sold her a $514 stereo set.

         We cannot condemn too strongly appellee's conduct. It raises serious questions
of sharp practice and irresponsible business dealings. A review of the legislation in
the District of Columbia affecting retail sales and the pertinent decisions of the
highest court in this jurisdiction disclose, however, no ground upon which this court
can declare the contracts in question contrary to public policy. We note that were the
Maryland Retail Installment Sales Act, or its equivalent, in force in the District of
Columbia, we could grant appellant appropriate relief. We think Congress should
consider corrective legislation to protect the public from such exploitive contracts as
were utilized in the case at bar.

         We do not agree that the court lacked the power to refuse enforcement to
contracts found to be unconscionable. In other jurisdictions, it has been held as a
matter of common law that unconscionable contracts are not enforceable.5 While no
decision of this court so holding has been found, the notion that an unconscionable
bargain should not be given full enforcement is by no means novel. In Scott v. United
States, 79 U.S. 443 (1870), the Supreme Court stated:

          4 [In 1970, Congress made the D.C. Court of Appeals the highest court in the District,
equivalent to a state supreme court. Like the highest courts of other states, determinations of state
(or District) law are final, and appeals related to federal or constitutional issues now go directly to the
U.S. Supreme Court. Prior to that date, the D.C. Court of Appeals acted as a mid-level appellate court
whose decisions were appealed to the D.C. Circuit. - Eds.]

______________________________________________________________________________

326  CHAPTER V: CONTRACT DEFENSES
         If a contract be unreasonable and unconscionable, but not void for fraud, a
court of law will give to the party who sues for its breach damages, not according to
its letter, but only such as he is equitably entitled to.

         Since we have never adopted or rejected such a rule, the question here
presented is actually one of first impression.

         Congress has recently enacted the Uniform Commercial Code,6 which
specifically provides that the court may refuse to enforce a contract which it finds to
be unconscionable at the time it was made. 28 D.C. Code § 2-302 (Supp. IV 1965). The
enactment of this section, which occurred subsequent to the contracts here in suit,
does not mean that the common law of the District of Columbia was otherwise at the
time of enactment, nor does it preclude the court from adopting a similar rule in the
exercise of its powers to develop the common law for the District of Columbia. In fact,
in view of the absence of prior authority on the point, we consider the congressional
adoption of § 2-302 persuasive authority for following the rationale of the cases from
which the section is explicitly derived. Accordingly, we hold that where the element
of unconscionability is present at the time a contract is made, the contract should not
be enforced.

         Unconscionability has generally been recognized to include an absence of
meaningful choice on the part of one of the parties together with contract terms which
are unreasonably favorable to the other party. Whether a meaningful choice is
present in a particular case can only be determined by consideration of all the
circumstances surrounding the transaction. In many cases the meaningfulness of the
choice is negated by a gross inequality of bargaining power. The manner in which the
contract was entered is also relevant to this consideration. Did each party to the
contract, considering his obvious education or lack of it, have a reasonable
opportunity to understand the terms of the contract, or were the important terms
hidden in a maze of fine print and minimized by deceptive sales practices? Ordinarily,
one who signs an agreement without full knowledge of its terms might be held to
assume the risk that he has entered a one-sided bargain. But when a party of little
bargaining power, and hence little real choice, signs a commercially unreasonable
contract with little or no knowledge of its terms, it is hardly likely that his consent,
or even an objective manifestation of his consent, was ever given to all the terms. In
such a case the usual rule that the terms of the agreement are not to be questioned
should be abandoned and the court should consider whether the terms of the contract
are so unfair that enforcement should be withheld.

6 [Be careful not to misunderstand Judge Wright's statement that "Congress . . . enacted the

Uniform Commercial Code." The UCC, as you have previously learned, is state law, not national law.

This action by Congress was in its Constitutionally-enumerated power to govern the District of

Columbia. Thus, it was effectively enacting state-like law for Washington D.C. Congress did not enact

the UCC as federal law for the United States. - Eds.]

UNIT 16: POLICY-BASED DEFENSES                         327
         In determining reasonableness or fairness, the primary concern must be with
the terms of the contract considered in light of the circumstances existing when the
contract was made. The test is not simple, nor can it be mechanically applied. The
terms are to be considered "in the light of the general commercial background and
the commercial needs of the particular trade or case." Corbin suggests the test as
being whether the terms are "so extreme as to appear unconscionable according to
the mores and business practices of the time and place." 1 ARTHUR LINTON CORBIN,
CORBIN ON CONTRACTS § 128 (1963). We think this formulation correctly states the
test to be applied in those cases where no meaningful choice was exercised upon
entering the contract.

         Because the trial court and the appellate court did not feel that enforcement
could be refused, no findings were made on the possible unconscionability of the
contracts in these cases. Since the record is not sufficient for our deciding the issue
as a matter of law, the cases must be remanded to the trial court for further
proceedings.

         So ordered.

Arthur Allen Leff, Unconscionability and the Code: The Emperor's New Clause,
115 U. PA. L. REV. 485 (1967):

         Let us begin the story the way so many good stories begin, with ritual
incantation: to make a contract one needs (i) parties with capacity, (ii) manifested
assent, and (iii) consideration. This is all very simple. If these criteria are met, a party
to the resulting nexus who has made promises is obligated to carry them out, unless
he can maintain successfully one of the standard contract-law defenses, such as fraud,
duress, mistake, impossibility or illegality. These "defenses" might be classified in
divers ways to serve various analytical purposes. For our particular needs, however,
there is a simple way of grouping them which is signally illuminating: some of these
defenses have to do with the process of contracting and others have to do with the
resulting contract. When fraud and duress are involved, for instance, the focus of
attention is on what took place between the parties at the making of the contract.
With illegality, on the other hand, the material question is instead the content of the
contract once "made." The law may legitimately be interested both in the way
agreements come about and in what they provide. A "contract" gotten at gunpoint
may be avoided; a classic dicker over Dobbin may come to naught if horse owning is
illegal. Hereafter, to distinguish the two interests, I shall often refer to bargaining
naughtiness as "procedural unconscionability," and to evils in the resulting contract
as "substantive unconscionability."

     If reading [UCC § 2-302] makes anything clear it is that reading this section

alone makes nothing clear about the meaning of "unconscionable" except perhaps that

______________________________________________________________________________

328  CHAPTER V: CONTRACT DEFENSES
it is pejorative. More particularly, one cannot tell from the statute whether the key
concept is something to be predicated on the bargaining process or on the bargain or
on some combination of the two, that is, to use our terminology, whether it is
procedural or substantive. Nonetheless, determining whether the section's target is
a species of quasi-fraud or quasi-duress, or whether it is a species of quasi-illegality,
is obviously the key to the bite and scope of the provision.

         [The author discusses the drafting history of UCC § 2-302 and the Comments
to it, noting that over time they grew less and less precise with respect to what the
term "unconscionable" meant.]

         The draftsmen [ultimately] were faced with several possibilities. They could
have said that if a certain level of bargaining elaborateness were reached, any
resulting contract (short of illegality) would be invulnerable to later judicial
meddling. That, however, would most likely have necessitated some fuller description
of what type of bargaining procedure was envisioned as sufficiently immunizing.
This, as the earliest draft itself showed, presented exceedingly difficult drafting
problems. Alternatively, the draftsmen could have espoused the position that there
were some contractual provisions, presently unspecifiable, which could not be
permitted under the Code no matter how fully bargained between the parties. This
position, however, might well have been unacceptable to important backers of the
Code (not to mention to legislatures) if it had been set forth in high relief. Thus faced
with a dilemma, the difficulty of the first alternative and the unpopularity of the
second, the draftsmen opted for a third solution. They fudged.

                                           _____________________

         Review Question 8. Professor Leff's article has been enormously influential in
defining the somewhat nebulous concept of unconscionability. Almost all discussions
of contractual unconscionability today rely on his "procedural" and "substantive"
categorizations. Most jurisdictions require both procedural and substantive
unconscionability. Some use a sliding scale where having more of one means less of
the other is needed. Some states have even taken the position that if the substantive
unfairness is great enough, then only it is required. Can you explain to your
classmates (and professor) Professor Leff's argument as to what the two prongs of
unconscionability are and how they are distinct?

              Problems

Problem 16.1

         The California Talent Agencies Act requires that any "talent agency"--which
means "a person or corporation who engages in the occupation of procuring, offering,
promising, or attempting to procure employment or engagements for an artist or
artists"--obtain a license from the state. "Artist" under the statute includes actors
and actresses. The statute requires licensed talent agencies to meet certain
experience qualifications, adhere to certain standards, maintain client trust funds, to
post bonds, and disclose their fee schedules. It also provides that any contract with
an unlicensed agent for these "talent agency" services is void as a matter of law.

         There is a distinction, however, between agents who procure employment for
their clients, who must be licensed, and managers who counsel, advise, handle
investments, and help artists develop their careers. Managers do not have to be
licensed.

         Actress is an aspiring television and film performer. She enters into a
"Personal Management Agreement" with Manager. Under the agreement Manager is
to provide personal and career counseling and representation to Actress in all aspects
of her career. He is to receive 5 percent of all income she makes from television, film,
radio, and other media. The contract runs for 5 years.

         Manager becomes actively involved in Actress's career, making suggestions,
helping her meet the right people, even loaning her money at times, although in the
first year of the contract she earns very little and Manager gets virtually no income
from her. At the beginning of the second year of the contract, Manager becomes aware
that Giant Studios is casting Deep Six, a new undercover crime drama, and that it is
looking for "new faces." Manager has a longstanding relationship with his next-door
neighbor, the producer of the new series, and lobbies heavily to get Actress the lead
role in the show. Although the studio is initially uninterested, the producer finally
agrees to test her, and Actress eventually gets the part, based primarily on the work
that Manager has done.

         The series becomes a huge hit. Actress wins a Golden Globe, is nominated for
an Emmy, and becomes a household name whose every move makes tabloid
headlines. Giant Studios announces plans to make a Deep Six theatrical film, in
which Actress will star. Her original salary for the TV series--originally $25,000 per
episode--is quickly boosted to $200,000, and her fee for the film will be $15 million.
Manager plays no part in the actual negotiation of the contracts, which are handled
by a licensed talent agency.

330                     CHAPTER V: CONTRACT DEFENSES
         After signing the film contract, Actress tells manager she will not pay manager
any part of the income received from the Deep Six series and film because he was
operating as an unlicensed talent agent and therefore her contract with him is void.
She immediately signs a new management contract with a new manager. Manager
sues, claiming his commissions for all of her television and film earnings for the five-
year period.

Problem 16.2

         Employee, a veterinarian licensed in Texas, enters into a contract of
employment on with Employer. Also a licensed veterinarian, Employer owns and
operates two animal clinics in the Dallas-Fort Worth (DFW) area. Employer hires
Employee to manage and to provide veterinary services at his Pethouse Pet Clinic in
Arlington, Texas. (Employer himself manages a second animal clinic in Plano, Texas,
about 40 miles away.) At the time Employee is hired, the Pethouse clinic has been in
operation for 15 years and has a large and stable customer base. Employee has moved
from Amarillo--where his own practice had not been terribly successful--to take the
job. The contract provides Employee with a base salary, plus a bonus based on the
profitability of the Pethouse Pet Clinic. The contract provides that either party may
terminate the agreement upon 120 days' notice to the other party. The written
employment contract also contains the following provisions:

         Voluntary Termination. (a) Employee agrees that upon his voluntary
termination of the Employee-Employer relationship, Employee will not practice
veterinary medicine in Arlington, Texas or within a ten (10) mile radius of the
Pethouse Pet Clinic in Arlington [which is 1007 North Cooper Street, Arlington,
Texas] for a period of three (3) years.

         (b) Employee agrees not to advertise within the City of Arlington his
departure from the Pethouse Pet Clinic or send any written announcements or
announcements of any sort notifying clients that he is leaving the practice of
veterinary medicine at the Pethouse Pet Clinic.

         (c) Employee further agrees that he will not notify present or past clients of
the Pethouse Pet Clinic of new location within three (3) years after his voluntary
termination.

Each year the contract is renewed with a change in the compensation scheme,
increasing Employee's salary and adding a provision giving him a percentage of the
profits. Otherwise, each the new contract is identical to the first, particularly with
regard to the noncompete clause.

         After practicing at Employer's clinic for five years and becoming popular with
Pethouse customers, Employee resigns to go to work for more money at Pethouse's
major competitor, Furry Friends Animal Care. Furry Friends is approximately 2.2
miles from Pethouse Pet Clinic. Employee immediately sends notice of his new

against its enforcement?

Problem 16.3

         Latke is a recent immigrant to the United States. He speaks very little English,
but gets a job working days as a cleaning person at a hotel, and another washing
dishes in the evening at a restaurant. Each week sends a small amount of money
back home to his family in Ruritania. One Saturday, Latke, who is a big music fan,
goes into Discount Electronics, a retailer. He falls into conversation with a clerk,
another Ruritanian immigrant, who speaks fluent Ruritanian. The clerk shows him
an excellent music system that can be purchased for $500 in cash, or can be purchased
on a rent-to-own basis at $12 a week for two years. Latke signs the rent-to-own
contract, which is printed in both English and Spanish. Other than the price and the
length of the contract, the clerk does not translate any of the terms for Latke, who
does not ask for any translation.

         The contract provides that Latke can terminate the contract at any time by
returning the music system, but Discount will keep all payments previously made. It
also provides that if Latke fails to pay but keeps possession of the stereo, all
remaining weekly payments are due immediately to Discount and Latke becomes the
owner of the music system. Finally, the contract provides that if Discount is required
to sue Latke to get its money, Latke will be liable for reasonable collection and
attorneys' fees.

         Latke takes the system home and makes payments for more than a year. At
this point, the music system breaks down. Latke, who thinks he's already paid more
than the original $500 selling price, stops making payments, but does not return the
music system. Discount brings in a collection agency, which is unable to collect from
Latke. It then sues Latke for the 45 remaining payments ($540), along with $150 in
collection costs and $750 in attorneys' fees for filing the suit. In this jurisdiction,
attorneys' fees in contract cases are only recoverable if they are provided for in the
contract.

         Latke defends arguing that the contract is unconscionable. What are the
arguments for and against a finding of unconscionability in this case? As this case
involves a sale of goods, be sure to use UCC § 2-302 in your analysis.

                 An Introduction to

     TERMS AND INTERPRETATION

         Having determined that an enforceable agreement exists and that none of the
contract defenses apply, we turn to what is, from a transactional perspective at least,
the most important part of the Contracts course, the question of what exactly does the
contract require? Along with issues of damages, raised later in these materials, the
interpretation of contract language is probably litigated more often than any other
issues. One federal judge remarked that by a rough estimate about 80 percent of the
breach-of-contract cases before him involved disputes over the meaning of terms.

         An Imperfect Tool? Language by and large is a reasonably good tool for
conveying meaning. But it is not perfect. Most contracts are clear enough that no one
has concerns with what they mean. If your apartment lease requires payment every
first of the month and prohibits pets, we will most of the time understand what it
means. Most contracts are routinely performed without any dispute between the
parties. But when a problem arises in a contract, it is very often due to the fact that
the parties simply do not agree as to what they were supposed to do. Only after we
have decided on what the terms of the agreement are, and what obligations the
parties have assumed, can we determine whether one of the parties has breached.

Even in carefully written contracts, disputes can arise over what particular language
means. And when contracts are oral--and have to be reconstructed from unreliable
memories by biased litigants months or years after the events occurred--there is even
more chance of misunderstanding.

         Interpretation . . . and Managing It at the Outset. Lawyers and judges in
general use much the same interpretive tool kit that ordinary humans do in ordinary
life--what exactly was said, how was it said, what was the context in which it was
said, what other people mean when they say the same thing, what the parties did
after it was said, and so on. Lawyers who draft and litigate contracts develop two
great but almost opposite skills: (1) the ability to craft language that says exactly
what the parties meant to say, and (2) the ability to develop alternative
interpretations of language that seems on its face to be plain.

     Interpretation, however, includes much more than simply determining what

the language means. The law itself puts certain obligations on contracting parties.

Some of these can be changed or eliminated by agreement memorialized by careful

drafting, but some of them cannot. Moreover, on many issues that come up in contract

litigation the parties never actually discussed the issue. If you agree to purchase

Burge's car, for example, the two of you may never discuss whether Burge is obliged

to deliver it to you, or you are obliged to pick it up from him. In these cases the law

(especially the UCC) often provides "default" terms that become part of the contract.

Every contract thus contains far more terms than the ones the parties have actually

______________________________________________________________________________

334  CHAPTER VI: TERMS AND INTERPRETATION
discussed. What those terms are and how parties deal with them is an important part
of this discussion.

         In this part of the book, we will take the issues of interpretation in four phases.
First, we explore the role of the writing in situations where all or part of the
agreement is written. Under what circumstances can parties argue that other terms
are also part of the agreement? This is the topic lawyers call the "parol evidence rule."
Second, once we have determined what language the parties have used, we must
determine what it means. We sometimes call this the lawyer's interpretive "tool kit."
Third, we explore terms that may into the contract even though the parties did not
discuss them and one or both parties would have objected to them. These are known
as "implied terms." And fourth, we explore the issue of when certain promises
(historically called "covenants" need not be performed because they are subject to
trigger mechanisms that we call "conditions."

For transactional lawyers, this is the area where you can do your clients a great deal
of good by avoiding misunderstandings through careful drafting. For litigators, it is
the place where you will exercise you skill and ingenuity to the utmost.

         Written Contracts with Oral Terms? Contracts come in many forms. Some are
simple and oral. Some are complex and written. Some involve both oral and written
terms. If a contract is completely written out and intended by the parties to be the
expression of their final deal--a complex, negotiated merger deal between
multinational corporations, for example--the natural tendency is to rely solely on the
writing. On the other hand, if there is no writing at all, oral testimony or other
evidence is necessary to prove the nature of the deal. But what about situations where
some parts of the deal are in writing and some are not?

         You have experienced this directly. When you buy something at a local store
and sign a receipt, there is a writing that shows at least the price of the item. But
most of the other terms of the deal--can you carry it out or will it be delivered, what
warranty does it carry, can it be returned to the store, and so forth--will either have
been discussed orally or not discussed at all. If the goods turn out to be defective, you
will have a contract and there will be a writing evidencing it--but all the rest of the
terms will have to be supplied by oral testimony or other evidence--categories that
the law traditionally calls "parol evidence."

         Parol is for Contracts; Parole is for Convicts. The word "parol" --please note
the lack of a final "e"1 so you can avoid looking silly to other lawyers--is a French
term for "oral." Nonetheless, parol evidence as used in contract law does not solely
mean "oral" evidence, it means any evidence other than what is in the written

          1 [The English word "parole," despite its different meaning, is also related to the French word
for "oral." The term in criminal law came from the oral promises that soldiers or prisoners would make
to their captors if they were released, such as a promise not to engage in future hostilities, or to act on
good behavior, hence being "out on parole." Now that you know the difference, we beg you not to
embarrass us by referring to a "parole evidence rule" in contract law. No such thing exists.--Eds.]

UNIT 17: THE PAROL EVIDENCE RULE  337
contract itself. Thus written documents that are not the contract document can be
"parol" evidence to the same extent as oral testimony.

         Given that certain cases involve both a written agreement and parol evidence
that tries to contradict or supplement the written agreement, an important question
arises as to how much credit to give the writing. To what extent can a party try to
prove that a contract means something very different from a written document? Are
parties bound by what they sign, or are they free to claim that the contract is
something else entirely?

         The Rule. To deal with these issues, English common law over the years
developed what came to be known as the "parol evidence rule," under which oral
agreements that seem to conflict with a writing the parties have adopted will be
refused enforcement. It rests on at least two assumptions. The first assumption is
that what the parties did at the time of the contract--that is, what they wrote and
signed--is likely to be better evidence of what their actual deal was than is their
subsequent self-serving testimony. The second assumption is that litigation is
expensive and parties should be able to rely on written agreements. If the written
contract requires delivery by August 15, for example, but one party now wants to
argue that the parties really intended delivery "any time so long as it is before
Christmas," the parol evidence starts with the assumption that what the parties
wrote at the time is more likely to be the "true" agreement as to the delivery date
than what one party now claims--after a dispute has developed--the parties really
intended. Both the legal system and contracting parties benefit if they can know for
certain that "by August 15" means "by August 15" rather than "any time so long as it
is before Christmas." Neither courts nor parties will then spend time, effort, and
money litigating over the issue.

         Downsides to the Rule. Even if we grant these two assumptions, situations
arise in which enforcing the terms of a written agreement can result in injustice. It
would be absurd, for example, to prohibit a party who signed an agreement at
gunpoint from being able to prove the gunman's threats merely because the contract
says, "The parties are entering this agreement freely and not under compulsion."
Similarly, if two parties agree to the sale of a motorcycle totaled in a wreck for $50,
and the parties, intending to write $50.00 instead write $5000 (forgetting the
decimal) hardly anyone would argue that a court should force the buyer to pay the
larger amount. Thus, over the years some exceptions have been crafted to the strict
application of the rule. You will meet some in the materials that follow.

         Statutory Parol Evidence Rules and Other Variants. While the parol evidence
rule arose as a common law innovation, there are various versions embodied in
statutes, such as UCC § 2-202. Even beyond the UCC, some states have codified their
general rules regarding admissibility of parol evidence, but others have left the rule
as a matter of common law. Each jurisdiction's exceptions to the parol evidence rule
have developed more or less independently, creating great variation among the

______________________________________________________________________________

338  CHAPTER VI: TERMS AND INTERPRETATION
states. Even within a given state, rules can be confusing because courts sometimes
use different words to mean the same thing, and sometimes us the same words to
mean different thing. Two states might use the same language but come to different
results while two other states might use different language but come to the same
result.

         You will ultimately find that the parol evidence rule is seldom ironclad.
Evidence of prior and contemporaneous parol agreements will sometimes be admitted
despite what seems to be a straightforward bar.

               Court of Appeals of New York
             247 N.Y. 377, 160 N.E. 646 (1928)

ANDREWS, J.

         In the fall of 1923 the Laths owned a farm. This they wished to sell. Across the
road, on land belonging to Lieutenant-Governor Lunn, they had an ice house which
they might remove. Mrs. Mitchill looked over the land with a view to its purchase.
She found the ice house objectionable. Thereupon "the defendants orally promised
and agreed, for and in consideration of the purchase of their farm by the plaintiff, to
remove the said ice house in the spring of 1924." Relying upon this promise, she made
a written contract to buy the property for $8,400, for cash and a mortgage and
containing various provisions usual in such papers. Later receiving a deed, she
entered into possession and has spent considerable sums in improving the property
for use as a summer residence. The defendants have not fulfilled their promise as to
the ice house and do not intend to do so. We are not dealing, however, with their
moral delinquencies. The question before us is whether their oral agreement may be
enforced in a court of equity.

         This requires a discussion of the parol evidence rule--a rule of law which
defines the limits of the contract to be construed. It is more than a rule of evidence
and oral testimony even if admitted will not control the written contract unless
admitted without objection. It applies, however, to attempts to modify such a contract
by parol. It does not affect a parol collateral contract distinct from and independent
of the written agreement. It is, at times, troublesome to draw the line. Williston, in
his work on Contracts points out the difficulty. "Two entirely distinct contracts," he
says, "each for a separate consideration may be made at the same time and will be
distinct legally. Where, however, one agreement is entered into wholly or partly in

______________________________________________________________________________

UNIT 17: THE PAROL EVIDENCE RULE                339
consideration of the simultaneous agreement to enter into another, the transactions
are necessarily bound together. . . . Then if one of the agreements is oral and the other
is written, the problem arises whether the bond is sufficiently close to prevent proof
of the oral agreement." SAMUEL WILLISTON, THE LAW OF CONTRACTS § 637 (1920).

         That is the situation here. It is claimed that the defendants are called upon to
do more than is required by their written contract in connection with the sale as to
which it deals.

         The principle may be clear, but it can be given effect by no mechanical rule. As
so often happens, it is a matter of degree, for as Professor Williston also says where
a contract contains several promises on each side it is not difficult to put any one of
them in the form of a collateral agreement. If this were enough, written contracts
might always be modified by parol. Not form, but substance is the test.

         In applying this test the policy of our courts is to be considered. We have
believed that the purpose behind the rule was a wise one not easily to be abandoned.
Notwithstanding injustice here and there, on the whole it works for good. Old
precedents and principles are not to be lightly cast aside unless it is certain that they
are an obstruction under pre-sent conditions. New York has been less open to
arguments that would modify this particular rule, than some jurisdictions elsewhere.
Thus in Eighmie v. Taylor, 98 N. Y. 288 (1885), it was held that a parol warranty
might not be shown although no warranties were contained in the writing.

         Under our decisions before such an oral agreement as the present is received
to vary the written contract at least three conditions must exist: (1) the agreement
must in form be a collateral one; (2) it must not contradict express or implied
provisions of the written contract; (3) it must be one that parties would not ordinarily
be expected to embody in the writing; or put in another way, an inspection of the
written contract, read in the light of surrounding circumstances must not indicate
that the writing appears "to contain the engagements of the parties, and to define the
object and measure the extent of such engagement." Or again, it must not be so clearly
connected with the principal transaction as to be part and parcel of it.

     The respondent does not satisfy the third of these requirements. It may be, not

the second. We have a written contract for the purchase and sale of land. The buyer

is to pay $8,400 in the way described. She is also to pay her portion of any rents,

interest on mortgages, insurance premiums and water meter charges. She may have

a survey made of the premises. On their part the sellers are to give a full covenant

deed of the premises as described, or as they may be described by the surveyor if the

survey is had, executed and acknowledged at their own expense; they sell the

personal property on the farm and represent they own it; they agree that all amounts

paid them on the contract and the expense of examining the title shall be a lien on

the property; they assume the risk of loss or damage by fire until the deed is delivered;

and they agree to pay the broker his commissions. Are they to do more? Or is such a

claim inconsistent with these precise provisions? It could not be shown that the

______________________________________________________________________________

340  CHAPTER VI: TERMS AND INTERPRETATION
plaintiff was to pay $500 additional. Is it also implied that the defendants are not to
do anything unexpressed in the writing?

         That we need not decide. At least, however, an inspection of this contract shows
a full and complete agreement, setting forth in detail the obligations of each party.
On reading it one would conclude that the reciprocal obligations of the parties were
fully detailed. Nor would his opinion alter if he knew the surrounding circumstances.
The presence of the ice house, even the knowledge that Mrs. Mitchill thought it
objectionable would not lead to the belief that a separate agreement existed with
regard to it. Were such an agreement made it would seem most natural that the
inquirer should find it in the contract. Collateral in form it is found to be, but it is
closely related to the subject dealt with in the written agreement--so closely that we
hold it may not be proved.

         Where the line between the competent and the incompetent is narrow the
citation of authorities is of slight use. Each represents the judgment of the court on
the precise facts before it. How closely bound to the contract is the supposed collateral
agreement is the decisive factor in each case. But reference may be made to Johnson
v. Oppenheim, 55 N. Y. 280 (1873); Love v. Hamel, 69 N.Y.S. 251 (Sup. Ct. App. Div.
1901); Daly v. Piza, 94 N.Y.S. 154 (Sup. Ct. App. Div. 1905). Johnson v. Oppenheim
and the two [cases from] the Appellate Division relate to collateral contracts said to
have been the inducing cause of the main contract. All hold that an oral stipulation,
said to have been the inducing cause for the subsequent execution of the lease itself,
concerning some act to be done by the landlord, or some condition as to the leased
premises, might not be shown. In principle they are not unlike the case before us.
Attention should be called also to Taylor v. Hopper, 62 N. Y. 649 (1875), where it is
assumed that evidence of a parol agreement to remove a barn, which was an
inducement to the sale of lots, was improper.

         We do not ignore the fact that authorities may be found that would seem to
support the contention of the appellant. Such are Erskine v. Adeane, [1873] LR 8
Exch. 756, and Morgan v. Griffith [1871] L. R. 6 Exch. 70, where although there was
a written lease a collateral agreement of the landlord to [remove the rabbits that had
overrun the field] was admitted. In this State, Wilson v. Deen, supra, might lead to
the contrary result. Neither are they approved in New Jersey. See Naumberg v.
Young, 44 N.J.L. 331 (1882). A line of cases in Massachusetts, of which Durkin v.
Cobleigh, 30 N.E. 474 (1892), is an example, have to do with collateral contracts made
before a deed is given. But the fixed form of a deed makes it inappropriate to insert
collateral agreements, however closely connected with the sale.2 Here we deal with

2 [As you may have learned in your Property course, the deed is the formal document that

actually conveys the property. A real estate contract usually requires a party to provide a deed at the

time of closing, but the deed is not the contract itself.--Eds.]

the contract on the basis of which the deed to Mrs. Mitchill was given subsequently,
and we confine ourselves to the question whether its terms may be modified.

         Our conclusion is that the judgment of the Appellate Division and that of the
Special Term should be reversed and the complaint dismissed, with costs in all courts.

LEHMAN, J., dissenting.

         I accept the general rule as formulated by Judge Andrews. I differ with him
only as to its application to the facts shown in the record. The plaintiff contracted to
purchase land from the defendants for an agreed price. A formal written agreement
was made between the sellers and the plaintiff's husband. It is on its face a complete
contract for the conveyance of the land. It describes the property to be conveyed. It
sets forth the purchase price to be paid. All the conditions and terms of the
conveyance to be made are clearly stated. I concede at the outset that parol evidence
to show additional conditions and terms of the conveyance would be inadmissible.
There is a conclusive presumption that the parties intended to integrate in that
written contract every agreement relating to the nature or extent of the property to
be conveyed, the contents of the deed to be delivered, the consideration to be paid as
a condition precedent to the delivery of the deeds, and indeed all the rights of the
parties in connection with the land. The conveyance of that land was the subject-
matter of the written contract and the contract completely covers that subject.

         The parol agreement which the court below found the parties had made was
collateral to, yet connected with, the agreement of purchase and sale. It has been
found that the defendants induced the plaintiff to agree to purchase the land by a
promise to remove an ice house from land not covered by the agreement of purchase
and sale. No independent consideration passed to the defendants for the parol
promise. To that extent the written contract and the alleged oral contract are bound
together. The same bond usually exists wherever attempt is made to prove a parol
agreement which is collateral to a written agreement. Hence "the problem arises
whether the bond is sufficiently close to prevent proof of the oral agreement."

         Judge Andrews has formulated a standard to measure the closeness of the
bond. Three conditions, at least, must exist before an oral agreement may be proven
to increase the obligation imposed by the written agreement. I think we agree that
the first condition that the agreement "must in form be a collateral one" is met by the
evidence. I concede that this condition is met in most cases where the courts have
nevertheless excluded evidence of the collateral oral agreement. The difficulty here,
as in most cases, arises in connection with the two other conditions.

         The second condition is that the "parol agreement must not contradict express
or implied provisions of the written contract." Judge Andrews voices doubt whether
this condition is satisfied. The written contract has been carried out. The purchase
price has been paid; conveyance has been made, title has passed in accordance with

______________________________________________________________________________

342                      CHAPTER VI: TERMS AND INTERPRETATION
the terms of the written contract. The mutual obligations expressed in the written
contract are left unchanged by the alleged oral contract. When performance was
required of the written contract, the obligations of the parties were measured solely
by its terms. By the oral agreement the plaintiff seeks to hold the defendants to other
obligations to be performed by them thereafter upon land which was not conveyed to
the plaintiff. The assertion of such further obligation is not inconsistent with the
written contract unless the written contract contains a provision, express or implied,
that the defendants are not to do anything not expressed in the writing. Concededly
there is no such express provision in the contract, and such a provision may be
implied, if at all, only if the asserted additional obligation is "so clearly connected
with the principal transaction as to be part and parcel of it," and is not "one that the
parties would not ordinarily be expected to embody in the writing." The hypothesis
so formulated for a conclusion that the asserted additional obligation is inconsistent
with an implied term of the contract is that the alleged oral agreement does not
comply with the third condition as formulated by Judge Andrews. In this case,
therefore, the problem reduces itself to the one question whether or not the oral
agreement meets the third condition.

         I have conceded that upon inspection the contract is complete. "It appears to
contain the engagements of the parties, and to define the object and measure the
extent of such engagement;" it constitutes the contract between them and is
presumed to contain the whole of that contract. Eighmie v. Taylor, 98 N. Y. at 294-
95. That engagement was on the one side to convey land; on the other to pay the price.
The plaintiff asserts further agreement based on the same consideration to be
performed by the defendants after the conveyance was complete, and directly
affecting only other land. It is true, as Judge Andrews points out, that "the presence
of the ice house, even the knowledge that Mrs. Mitchill thought it objectionable, would
not lead to the belief that a separate agreement existed with regard to it;" but the
question we must decide is whether or not, assuming an agreement was made for the
removal of an unsightly ice house from one parcel of land as an inducement for the
purchase of another parcel, the parties would ordinarily or naturally be expected to
embody the agreement for the removal of the ice house from one parcel in the written
agreement to convey the other parcel. Exclusion of proof of the oral agreement on the
ground that it varies the contract embodied in the writing may be based only upon a
finding or presumption that the written contract was intended to cover the oral
negotiations for the removal of the ice house which lead up to the contract of purchase
and sale. To determine what the writing was intended to cover "the document alone
will not suffice. What it was intended to cover cannot be known till we know what
there was to cover. The question being whether certain subjects of negotiation were
intended to be covered, we must compare the writing and the negotiations before we
can determine whether they were in fact covered." JOHN HENRY WIGMORE, A TREATISE
ON THE SYSTEM OF EVIDENCE IN TRIALS AT COMMON LAW § 2430 (2d. ed. 1923).

______________________________________________________________________________

UNIT 17: THE PAROL EVIDENCE RULE  343
         The subject-matter of the written contract was the conveyance of land. The
contract was so complete on its face that the conclusion is inevitable that the parties
intended to embody in the writing all the negotiations covering at least the
conveyance. The promise by the defendants to remove the ice house from other land
was not connected with their obligation to convey, except that one agreement would
not have been made unless the other was also made. The plaintiff's assertion of a
parol agreement by the defendants to remove the ice house was completely
established by the great weight of evidence. It must prevail unless that agreement
was part of the agreement to convey and the entire agreement was embodied in the
writing.

         The fact that in this case the parol agreement is established by the
overwhelming weight of evidence is, of course, not a factor which may be considered
in determining the competency or legal effect of the evidence. Hardship in the
particular case would not justify the court in disregarding or emasculating the
general rule. It merely accentuates the outlines of our problem. The assumption that
the parol agreement was made is no longer obscured by any doubts. The problem then
is clearly whether the parties are presumed to have intended to render that parol
agreement legally ineffective and non-existent by failure to embody it in the writing.
Though we are driven to say that nothing in the written contract which fixed the
terms and conditions of the stipulated conveyance suggests the existence of any
further parol agreement, an inspection of the contract, though it is complete on its
face in regard to the subject of the conveyance, does not, I think, show that it was
intended to embody negotiations or agreements, if any, in regard to a matter so
loosely bound to the conveyance as the removal of an ice house from land not
conveyed.

         The rule of integration undoubtedly frequently prevents the assertion of
fraudulent claims. Parties who take the precaution of embodying their oral
agreements in a writing should be protected against the assertion that other terms
of the same agreement were not integrated in the writing. The limits of the
integration are determined by the writing, read in the light of the surrounding
circumstances. A written contract, however complete, yet covers only a limited field.
I do not think that in the written contract for the conveyance of land here under
consideration we can find an intention to cover a field so broad as to include prior
agreements, if any such were made, to do other acts on other property after the
stipulated conveyance was made.

         In each case where such a problem is presented, varying factors enter into its
solution. Citation of authority in this or other jurisdictions is useless, at least without
minute analysis of the facts. The analysis I have made of the decisions in this State
leads me to the view that the decision of the courts below is in accordance with our
own authorities and should be affirmed.

         Review Question 1. Judge Lehman begins his dissent stating that he
essentially agrees with Judge Andrews regarding the substance of the legal rules at
issue in the case. Why exactly do the two judges reach different results while
ostensibly following the same law?

         Review Question 2. Judge Andrews thinks that removing the ice house was
something that the parties naturally would have included in the written contract.
Judge Lehman disagrees. Who do you think is correct and why? And what exactly do
the judges mean when they refer to agreements as being "collateral"?

         Review Question 3. Read through sections 209-213 of the Restatement
(Second) of Contracts. Would the buyers' evidence in Mitchill be excluded under the
Restatement approach? Now consider the exceptions to the parol evidence rule stated
in sections 214-218. Which exceptions, if any, might apply in a case like Mitchill?

         [Dallas Masterson and his wife Rebecca owned a ranch. They sold the ranch to
Dallas's sister Medora and her husband Lu Sine. In the deed, Dallas and Rebecca
(the "grantors") reserved an option to repurchase the property. Dallas went bankrupt.
Rebecca and Dallas's trustee sought to exercise the option to purchase the land
(whose price had presumably increased) and pay off creditors. Dallas tried to testify
that the option given to Medora and Lu was personal to him--that is, that he had no
legal right to assign it to anyone else--and therefore it did not pass to his estate. The
trial court excluded the testimony under the parol evidence rule.]

         When the parties to a written contract have agreed to it as an "integration"--
a complete and final embodiment of the terms of an agreement--parol evidence
cannot be used to add to or vary its terms. When only part of the agreement is
integrated, the same rule applies to that part, but parol evidence may be used to prove
elements of the agreement not reduced to writing.

         The crucial issue in determining whether there has been an integration is
whether the parties intended their writing to serve as the exclusive embodiment of
their agreement. The instrument itself may help to resolve that issue. It may state,
for example, that "there are no previous understandings or agreements not contained
in the writing," and thus express the parties' "intention to nullify antecedent

understandings or agreements." 3 ARTHUR LINTON CORBIN, CORBIN ON CONTRACTS
§ 578 at 411 (1960). Any such collateral agreement itself must be examined, however,
to determine whether the parties intended the subjects of negotiation it deals with to
be included in, excluded from, or otherwise affected by the writing. Circumstances at
the time of the writing may also aid in the determination of such integration.

         In formulating the rule governing parol evidence, several policies must be
accommodated. One policy is based on the assumption that written evidence is more
accurate than human memory. This policy, however, can be adequately served by
excluding parol evidence of agreements that directly contradict the writing. Another
policy is based on the fear that fraud or unintentional invention by witnesses
interested in the outcome of the litigation will mislead the finder of facts. McCormick
has suggested that the party urging the spoken as against the written word is most
often the economic underdog, threatened by severe hardship if the writing is enforced.
In his view the parol evidence rule arose to allow the court to control the tendency of
the jury to find through sympathy and without a dispassionate assessment of the
probability of fraud or faulty memory that the parties made an oral agreement
collateral to the written contract, or that preliminary tentative agreements were not
abandoned when omitted from the writing. CHARLES T. MCCORMICK, EVIDENCE § 210
(1954).

         Evidence of oral collateral agreements should be excluded only when the fact
finder is likely to be misled. The rule must therefore be based on the credibility of the
evidence. One such standard, adopted by section 240(1)(b) of the [First] Restatement
of Contracts, permits proof of a collateral agreement if it "is such an agreement as
might naturally be made as a separate agreement by parties situated as were the
parties to the written contract." The draftsmen of the Uniform Commercial Code
would exclude the evidence in still fewer instances: "If the additional terms are such
that, if agreed upon, they would certainly have been included in the document in the
view of the court, then evidence of their alleged making must be kept from the trier
of fact." UCC § 2-202, cmt. 3.

         The option clause in the deed in the present case does not explicitly provide
that it contains the complete agreement, and the deed is silent on the question of
assignability. Moreover, the difficulty of accommodating the formalized structure of
a deed to the insertion of collateral agreements makes it less likely that all the terms
of such an agreement were included. The statement of the reservation of the option
might well have been placed in the recorded deed solely to preserve the grantors'
rights against any possible future purchasers, and this function could well be served
without any mention of the parties' agreement that the option was personal. There is
nothing in the record to indicate that the parties to this family transaction, through
experience in land transactions or otherwise, had any warning of the disadvantages
of failing to put the whole agreement in the deed. This case is one, therefore, in which
it can be said that a collateral agreement such as that alleged "might naturally be

______________________________________________________________________________

346  CHAPTER VI: TERMS AND INTERPRETATION
made as a separate agreement." A fortiori, the case is not one in which the parties
"would certainly" have included the collateral agreement in the deed.

         It is contended, however, that an option agreement is ordinarily presumed to
be assignable if it contains no provisions forbidding its transfer or indicating that its
performance involves elements personal to the parties. Mott v. Cline, 253 P. 718 (Cal.
1927). The fact that there is a written memorandum, however, does not necessarily
preclude parol evidence rebutting a term that the law would otherwise presume.

         In the present case defendants offered evidence that the parties agreed that
the option was not assignable in order to keep the property in the Masterson family.
The trial court erred in excluding that evidence.

The judgment is reversed.

BURKE, J., dissenting.

I dissent. The majority opinion:

         (1) Undermines the parol evidence rule as we have known it in this state since
at least 1872 by declaring that parol evidence should have been admitted by the trial
court to show that a written option, absolute and unrestricted in form, was intended
to be limited and nonassignable;

(2) Renders suspect instruments of conveyance absolute on their face;

         (3) Materially lessens the reliance which may be placed upon written
instruments affecting the title to real estate; and

         (4) Opens the door, albeit unintentionally, to a new technique for the
defrauding of creditors.

         The opinion permits defendants to establish by parol testimony that their
grant to their brother (and brother-in-law) of a written option, absolute in terms, was
nevertheless agreed to be nonassignable by the grantee (now a bankrupt), and that
therefore the right to exercise it did not pass, by operation of the bankruptcy laws, to
the trustee for the benefit of the grantee's creditors.

         And how was this to be shown? By the proffered testimony of the bankrupt
optionee himself! Thereby one of his assets (the option to purchase defendants'
California ranch) would be withheld from the trustee in bankruptcy and from the
bankrupt's creditors. Understandably the trial court, as required by the parol
evidence rule, did not allow the bankrupt by parol to so contradict the unqualified
language of the written option.

[In this case,] the grantor husband (the bankrupt businessman) testified that

as none of the parties were attorneys "we wanted to contact my attorney . . . which

we did. . . . The wording in the option was obtained from [the attorney]. . . . I told him

what my discussion was with the Sines [defendant grantees] and he wanted . . . a

little time to compose it . . . . And, then this [the wording provided by the attorney]
was taken to the title company at the time Mr. and Mrs. Sine and I went in to
complete the transaction." The witness was an experienced businessman who thus
demonstrated awareness of the wisdom of seeking legal guidance and advice in this
business transaction, and who did so. Wherein lies the naïve family transaction
postulated by the majority?

         I would hold that the trial court ruled correctly on the proffered parol evidence,
and would affirm the judgment.

                                           _____________________

         Review Question 4. The so-called "collateral agreement" exception to the parol
evidence rule recognizes the reality that parties may actually have multiple, separate
contracts between themselves. Thus, assuming that all agreements between the
parties were merged into the most recent one could undermine the parties' actual
intent to have separate contracts. How should courts balance the collateral
agreement exception recognized by the Masterson majority with the bad-faith
concerns expressed by the dissent? Is it possible to accommodate both problems, or
must we simply choose among the lesser of two evils?

         Review Question 5. Masterson is a case involving real property. But suppose
it was instead a sale of goods, like the family's luxury yacht. Carefully read UCC § 2-
202? Would a case like Masterson come out the same way if section 2-202 applied?
Why or why not?

         Review Question 6. You might be interested to know that Karl Llewellyn, the
chief drafter of Article 2, was not a fan of the parol evidence rule and would have
gotten rid of it entirely if other drafters (backed by the merchant representatives who
were on the drafting committee) had permitted him to do so. Do you get the sense
from Masterson that Chief Justice Traynor might also not have cared for the parol
evidence rule? What reasons would famous legal minds like Llewellyn and Traynor
possibly have for disliking the parol evidence rule? What reasons would merchants
have for liking it?

VOLLACK, C.J.

         [Mel Nelson owned two car dealerships, Metro Auto and Metro Toyota, both of
which were in financial difficulty. His business was financed by General Motors
Acceptance Corp. (GMAC), to which Nelson owed $3 million. Nelson was in default

on the debt and thus GMAC had acquired rights to some control over the business,
including a veto power over any sale of the dealerships. In 1991, Nelson discussed
selling the dealerships John Elway--then the quarterback for the Denver Broncos
and the owner of other dealerships--and Rodney Buscher. Nelson wanted more for
the dealerships than Elway and Buscher were willing to pay, so the parties orally
negotiated a deal (which the court calls the "Service Agreement") under which the
sale price would be dropped and Nelson would get a fee of $50 per car sold over the
ensuing seven years.3

         GMAC agreed to approve the sale, but insisted that Nelson not get any of the
proceeds of the sale, which would instead go to pay off GMAC. GMAC specifically
stated it would not approve the deal if the Service Agreement were in place.
Accordingly, the parties went through with the sale at the agreed-upon price without
the Service Agreement. Nelson later testified that Elway and Buscher both orally
promised that even though GMAC had vetoed the Service Agreement, they would
honor it by making the $50-per-car payments to Nelson. When he was not paid, he
sued.]

         The issue with regard to the breach of contract claim is whether the merger
clauses in the Buy-Sell Agreements precluded the consideration of evidence that the
parties intended the Service Agreement to be part of the overall agreement to sell the
dealerships.4

         We agree that the merger clauses preclude consideration of extrinsic evidence
to ascertain the intent of the parties. Integration clauses generally allow contracting
parties to limit future contractual disputes to issues relating to the express provisions
of the contract. Therefore, the terms of a contract intended to represent a final and
complete integration of the agreement between the parties are enforceable, and
extrinsic evidence offered to prove the existence of prior agreements is inadmissible.
Sentinel Acceptance Corp. v. Colgate, 424 P.2d 380, 382 (Colo. 1967). Even when
extrinsic evidence is admissible to ascertain the intent of the parties, such evidence
may not be used to demonstrate an intent that contradicts or adds to the intent

          3 [This is a common type of agreement in a sale of business case. The seller (Nelson) usually
thinks the business is worth more than the buyer (Elway) does. The seller often makes rosy predictions
of future sales and bases the price on that. Under this arrangement, the buyer pays a lower price but
if it turns out the seller is correct about future sales, the seller gets more money. If the seller turns out
to be wrong, the buyer pays less.--Eds.]

         4 [By the court:] Paragraph 14 [i.e., the merger clause] of both of the Buy-Sell Agreements

for Metro Toyota and Metro Auto, both signed on March 16, 1991, by Nelson, Elway, and Buscher,
states:

This Agreement constitutes the entire Agreement between the parties pertaining to

the subject matter contained herein, and supersedes all prior agreements,

representations and understandings of the parties. No modification or amendment of

this Agreement shall be binding unless in writing and signed by the parties . . . .

______________________________________________________________________________

UNIT 17: THE PAROL EVIDENCE RULE                                                     349
expressed in the writing. KN Energy, Inc. v. Great Western Sugar Co., 698 P.2d 769,
777 n.9 (Colo. 1985).

         In this case, the merger clauses plainly and unambiguously manifest the intent
of the parties that the Buy-Sell Agreements executed on March 16, 1991 constitute
the entire agreement between the parties pertaining to the subject matter contained
therein. Where, as here, sophisticated parties who are represented by counsel have
consummated a complex transaction and embodied the terms of that transaction in a
detailed written document, it would be improper for this court to rewrite that
transaction by looking to evidence outside the four corners of the contract to
determine the intent of the parties.

         The petitioners and respondents signed the March 16, 1991 Buy-Sell
Agreements after extensive negotiation and numerous drafts of documents. By doing
so, all parties expressly agreed, pursuant to the merger clauses, that the terms of
those Buy-Sell Agreements would control the transaction and that all other
agreements, oral or written, would be void. We will not step into a commercial
transaction after the fact and attempt to ascertain the intent of the parties when that
intent is clearly manifested by an express term in a written document. We thus
conclude that the merger clauses in the March 16, 1991, Buy-Sell Agreements are
dispositive as to the intent of the parties in this case. As there is no dispute as to any
material fact with regard to this issue, the court of appeals correctly affirmed the trial
court's order of summary judgment in favor of the respondents on this issue.

LOHR, J., with whom KIRSHBAUM and SCOTT, JJ., dissenting.

         I respectfully dissent. Summary judgment is a severe remedy. As the majority
notes, in summary judgment proceedings courts must resolve all doubts as to the
existence of genuine issues of material fact against the moving party. In view of the
record and the procedural posture of this case, I would hold that Nelson's claims were
improperly dismissed. The parties disagree as to why Elway did not sign the service
agreement. Elway contends that GMAC refused to approve the sale if the service
agreement was executed. Nelson, on the other hand, alleges that Pico and Elway
prompted GMAC to impose such conditions. Nelson proceeded with the sale of the
dealerships because he already had turned control over to GMAC and thereby
eliminated a bankruptcy reorganization alternative that was previously under
consideration.

     Merger clauses preclude consideration of extrinsic evidence only where the

parties intend that the document containing the merger is exclusive. ARB, Inc. v. E-

Systems, Inc., 663 F.2d 189, 199 (D.C. Cir. 1980). The very essence of this case is a

dispute regarding whether the parties intended the service agreement to be part and

parcel of the overall deal. Because Nelson's position is adequately supported in the

record, the intention of the parties regarding the exclusivity of the document

containing the merger agreement is a disputed issue of material fact. As a result, this

case is inappropriate for summary judgment disposition.

______________________________________________________________________________

350  CHAPTER VI: TERMS AND INTERPRETATION
         The parties' intention that the buy-sell agreements constituted entire
contracts, allegedly evidenced by the merger clauses within, was by no means clearly
manifested. See Sierra Diesel Injection Serv. v. Burroughs Corp., 874 F.2d 653, 657
(9th Cir. 1989) ("the presence of a merger clause while often taken as a strong sign of
the parties' intent is not conclusive in all cases"). In this case, despite the disclaimer
in both merger clauses that each buy-sell agreement constituted the entire
agreement, the overall deal involved two buy-sell agreements and two real estate
contracts. Furthermore, each buy-sell agreement made reference to the real estate
contracts despite the exclusivity disclaimer. Regardless of the standard merger and
integration language in the buy-sell agreements, it is clear that the parties intended
their ultimate bargain to encompass other agreements, although the substantive
weight of the alleged service agreement remains unclear.

         When the parties disagree as to whether a document expresses the complete
agreement of the parties, and a court subsequently finds that the evidence is
conflicting or admits of more than one inference, the resolution of the parties' dispute
requires a factual determination.

         In short, this case is singularly inappropriate for resolution in a summary
judgment proceeding.

                                           _____________________

         Review Question 7. As you should have observed, the two contracts discussed
by the Nelson court contained the following merger clause:

         This Agreement constitutes the entire Agreement between the parties pertaining
         to the subject matter contained herein, and supersedes all prior agreements,
         representations and understandings of the parties. No modification or amendment
         of this Agreement shall be binding unless in writing and signed by the parties[.]

What is the basis for the dissent's argument that, in the face of this language, the
buy-sell agreements were in fact not fully integrated? Put another way, what changes
to the facts of the case could have resulted in a unanimous decision that the contracts
were, in fact, fully integrated?

         Review Question 8. The parol evidence rule is ostensibly designed to increase
certainty by allowing parties to rely on the written word. But in Mitchill, Masterson,
and Nelson, the judges could not even agree among themselves on whether the rule
applied. Can the majority opinions in these three cases be reconciled?

a tile manufacturer in Italy. Monzon, the president of MCC, met D'Agostino
representatives at a trade fair. Through a translator, the parties negotiated a
purchase, which was memorialized on one of D'Agostino's standard sales forms. The
form set out the price, quality, quantity, delivery, and payment terms. Later,
according to Monzon, the parties subsequently entered into a related but separate
oral "requirements" contract under which D'Agostino agreed to provide MCC with
discounts. Several further orders were placed, each written on a form that did not
mention the alleged discount term. D'Agostino made several deliveries, but stopped
when MCC refused to pay the invoice amount but demanded the alleged discount.
MCC sued D'Agostino for failing to fill several orders. The purchase orders signed by
Monzon on behalf of MCC stated that they reflected the entire deal of the two parties.
At trial, MCC sought to prove that the parties had the oral side deal with respect to
discounts.]

         We must address a question of first impression in this circuit: whether the
parol evidence rule, which bars evidence of an earlier oral contract that contradicts
or varies the terms of a subsequent or contemporaneous written contract, plays any
role in cases involving the CISG.

______________________________________________________________________________

352        CHAPTER VI: TERMS AND INTERPRETATION
         The CISG itself contains no express statement on the role of parol evidence. It
is clear, however, that the drafters of the CISG were comfortable with the concept of
permitting parties to rely on oral contracts because they eschewed any statutes of
fraud provision and expressly provided for the enforcement of oral contracts.
Moreover, article 8(3) of the CISG expressly directs courts to give "due consideration
. . . to all relevant circumstances of the case including the negotiations . . ." to
determine the intent of the parties. Given article 8(1)'s directive to use the intent of
the parties to interpret their statements and conduct, article 8(3) is a clear instruction
to admit and consider parol evidence regarding the negotiations to the extent they
reveal the parties' subjective intent.

         Although jurisdictions in the United States have found the parol evidence rule
helpful to promote good faith and uniformity in contract, as well as an appropriate
answer to the question of how much consideration to give parol evidence, a wide
number of other States Party to the CISG have rejected the rule in their domestic
jurisdictions. One of the primary factors motivating the negotiation and adoption of
the CISG was to provide parties to international contracts for the sale of goods with
some degree of certainty as to the principles of law that would govern potential
disputes and remove the previous doubt regarding which party's legal system might
otherwise apply. See Letter of Transmittal from Ronald Reagan, President of the
United States, to the United States Senate, reprinted at 15 U.S.C. app. 70, 71 (1997).
Courts applying the CISG cannot, therefore, upset the parties' reliance on the
Convention by substituting familiar principles of domestic law when the Convention
requires a different result.

         This is not to say that parties to an international contract for the sale of goods
cannot depend on written contracts or that parol evidence regarding subjective
contractual intent need always prevent a party relying on a written agreement from
securing summary judgment. To the contrary, most cases will not present a situation
(as exists in this case) in which both parties to the contract acknowledge a subjective
intent not to be bound by the terms of a pre-printed writing. In most cases, therefore,
article 8(2) of the CISG will apply, and objective evidence will provide the basis for
the court's decision. Consequently, a party to a contract governed by the CISG will
not be able to avoid the terms of a contract and force a jury trial simply by submitting
an affidavit which states that he or she did not have the subjective intent to be bound
by the contract's terms. Moreover, to the extent parties wish to avoid parol evidence
problems they can do so by including a merger clause in their agreement that
extinguishes any and all prior agreements and understandings not expressed in the
writing.

contracts or that parol evidence regarding subjective contractual intent need always
prevent a party relying on a written agreement from securing summary judgment."
How might a party to a CISG contract help ensure that the writing controls?

         Review Question 10. Compare Article 8 of the CISG with UCC section 2-202.
Which law is better for a party to a sale of goods who wants to rely solely on a written
contract? Which law is better for a party who wants to prove terms outside of a
writing?

Problem 17.1

         Thelma agrees to sell her Ford Thunderbird convertible to Louise for $19,000.
The parties orally agree that Louise will pay $7,000 down, and will pay the remainder
in 12 equal payments of $1,000. The parties draw up a bill of sale. Because the
jurisdiction in which they live levies a sales tax and personal property tax on the price
of the vehicle, Louise asks Thelma to make the bill of sale out for $10,000. Thelma
agrees. There is no mention of the payment plan in the bill of sale. Both sign the bill
of sale, and, and Louise gives Thelma a check for the $7,000. Louise makes two
monthly $1,000 payments on the car, but is then killed in a traffic accident. Thelma
petitions the estate for the remaining money due on the car, but the estate refuses to
pay more than another $1,000, since the bill of sale is for $10,000 and Louise had paid
$9,000 before she died. In contesting the claim in the probate court, Thelma wants to
introduce evidence that the original deal was for $19,000. The estate objects to the
introduction of Thelma's testimony. What arguments should each side make as to
Thelma's testimony?

Problem 17.2

         International Shoe Co. is an importer and distributor of footwear based in
North Carolina. It buys shoes from foreign suppliers and routinely pays in the local
currency. To avoid problems with currency fluctuations, International regularly
engages in foreign currency futures transactions through Commerce Bank, a large
bank headquartered in New York. International sometimes buys currencies and
sometimes sells them, depending on the deal that it has entered with a particular
customer. On August 1, International enters into a contract to buy i175,000 worth of

luxury footwear from Modo di Roma, an Italian company. The shoes will be delivered
and paid for on February 1 of the coming year.

         To protect itself from a change in value of the Euro over the six months until
February 1, International calls Commerce Bank. International says it agreed to buy
175,000, to be delivered on February 1, at an exchange rate of 1.4268 Euros to the

______________________________________________________________________________

354           CHAPTER VI: TERMS AND INTERPRETATION
dollar, for the Modo di Roma transaction. The Bank claims that International asked
to sell 175,000,5 and claims that no mention of the Modo di Roma transaction was
ever made. Shortly after, Commerce Bank sends a "confirmation" of the trade to
International, which states:

         WE [THE BANK] HAVE BOUGHT FROM YOU [INTERNATIONAL] EURO 175,000
         AND WE HAVE SOLD TO YOU USD 246,690, AT EXCHANGE RATE 1.4268
         EUROS PER USD, FOR DELIVERY ON FEBRUARY 1. PLEASE SIGN AND
         RETURN THIS CONFIRMATION.

         Later that same day, a clerk in International's office signs the slip and returns
it to the Bank. The clerk is willing to testify that he did not notice that the
confirmation had the terms exactly reversed--International was not selling Euros, it
was supposed to be buying them.

         After a significant drop in the value of the dollar--so that buying Euros was
more expensive--International allegedly discovered the error and announced that it
was refusing to go through with the transaction. To cover the transaction, the Bank
had to go on the open market and buy euros at a higher price, which cost it
approximately $50,000. The Bank has now sued International. International seeks to
introduce evidence of the original oral transaction to show that the contract was all a
mistake. The Bank opposes such evidence. Can International get its evidence
admitted? What should each side argue here?

Problem 17.3

         Corvallis Rendering Co. is a plant that turns waste animal tissue into useful
products. It purchases scraps from slaughterhouses, animals that have died from
natural causes, spoiled meat from grocery stores, carcasses of dead horses and pets
from animal shelters, etc., and turns them into valuable products like grease, tallow,
and bone meal. One of Corvallis's biggest suppliers is Oregon Meat Packers, Inc.
(OMP), which operates a beef slaughtering and packing house. OMP and Corvallis
sign a contract under which OMP will sell all of its scraps and offal to Corvallis. The
contract is a detailed agreement which is a standard form supplied by the Oregon
State Meat Packing and Rendering Association (of which both Corvallis and OMP are
members). It provides a number of terms and includes a merger clause. The contract
provides that for each load of material that OMP sends to Corvallis, Corvallis will
pay 27¢ per pound "provided that the protein content of the material is at least fifty

Euros at the lower rate and pockets the difference as a profit.--Eds.]

         When OMP delivers several loads of material that test at 49.5% protein,
Corvallis sends a check reflecting the 24.5¢ price. OMP argues that it should have
been paid at the higher 27¢ amount, since trade usage in the Oregon rendering trade
is that 49.5 percent is always rounded up to 50 percent. Corvallis insists that the
parties agreed to the 50% number, not 49.5%. OMP seeks to introduce testimony by
its employees of the trade usage. What are the arguments for each side on whether
such testimony should be allowed?

The Interpretive Toolbox

FOCUS OF THIS UNIT

         Issues of formation, consideration, capacity, and defenses all go to the question
of whether the parties actually have an enforceable contract. In the great majority of
disputes, however, parties agree that they have a contract. They may even agree on
the precise text contained in the contract. Their disagreement is on what it means.

         Context-Dependent Clarity. Most of the time, words in a contract do not create
interpretation disputes. A contract that requires delivery of the British paperback
edition of J. K. Rowling's book Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone in exchange
for $8.99 plus $2.50 shipping and handling means precisely that, and there is very
little room for the parties to argue that the parties actually meant Jane Austen's book
Emma and that the price was supposed to be $4.00 with free shipping.

         Even when the words themselves are perfectly clear, their meaning can differ
substantially based on the context in which they are said or even from tone of voice.
We intuitively understand the importance of context and tone even when we do not
actively think about such matters. The sarcastic "Nooooooo" from a teenager might,
in context, mean "Yes, of course, you moron. Duh!" Many words also carry more than
one common meaning which may have to be deduced from the context. The word
"greens," for example, will obviously mean something different in a contract that
refers to "tees, fairways, roughs, and greens" than it will in a contract that refers to
"reds, yellows, blues, and greens."

         Objective or Subjective Meaning? When interpreting contracts, a tension
frequently exists between "objective" and "subjective" meanings of certain terms.
When two parties have expressed an agreement in words, one approach is simply to
enforce what they wrote as the terms would appear to an ordinary reasonable person.
You may recall that formation of contracts occurs based on an objective
understanding of the parties' actions. Objective standards value simplicity and
predictability. If the parties have used a writing, the plain language of which does
not really reflect their actual bargain, then it is the parties' fault when they do not

______________________________________________________________________________

UNIT 18: THE INTERPRETIVE TOOLBOX  357
get the deal they intended, and the solution is to express themselves more clearly in
the future.

         The alternative approach is to look at the words as merely part of the overall
transaction, and to try to determine not what the document says to a reasonable
reader, but what the parties subjectively meant it to say. The goal in the subjective
approach is to carry out the "real" bargain of the parties, which may be different than
what they wrote. The benefit, when this approach works correctly, is that the parties
get what they really intended. The downside, of course, is the uncertainty inherent
in proving subjective meaning.

         Subjectivity in Action. Note that if both parties agree that the contract's
language is inaccurate and they agree as to what it should be, no problem exists.
Courts will always enforce an agreed subjective meaning, and the parties are less
likely to have gone to court in the first place. Much more often, however, one party
claims that the deal means exactly what was written, and the other party claims that,
in the context of their deal, the parties meant something else entirely. The question
is not whether the parties' "real" meaning should control. The question is, rather,
whether we are more likely to find the real meaning in what the parties wrote at the
time, or what they now say they meant.

         Since no perfect answer to that question exists and since what two parties
"really" meant is impossible to know with complete certainty--even assuming that
they both meant the same thing1--courts and other decisionmakers naturally
struggle with interpretation. Given this landscape, a principal goal of transactional
lawyers is to do their best to remove possible uncertainties and ambiguities from
contracts. Careful drafting can go a long way in avoiding problems. In contrast,
contract litigators, who are typically called to service once the parties are already in
a dispute, will seek either to exploit or to patch over these uncertainties, depending
on their particular client's position.

         The Interpretive Toolbox. When a dispute arises, and a choice of meanings
exists, how does the interpreter of a contract choose the "correct" meaning? We all
make this sort of judgment dozens of times each day, as we interpret the words people
say in light of their context--a handy word encompassing all the surrounding facts
that help give words meaning. If the heroine in the romance novel snarls, "I hate
you!" at the hero with whom she has been adventuring for the last 200 pages, context
may suggest she means something very different from her literal words. We deduce
such things from all the circumstances so often that we scarcely realize we are doing
it.

     1 [This assumption is a huge one. The idea that there is some kind of "real" deal between the

parties depends on the premise that they meant the same thing at the outset. We have seen the parties

sometimes have very different ideas about what they agreed to.--Eds.]

______________________________________________________________________________

358  CHAPTER VI: TERMS AND INTERPRETATION
         Lawyers, of course, are frequently in the business of convincing people (e.g.,
judges, clients, other parties) as to what things mean, and that means that requires
the ability to explain things that many people do subconsciously. Thus over the years
a variety of "rules" of interpretation have made their way into the lawyer's toolbox.
They are not really "rules" in the sense that they prescribe conduct to be followed.
They are, rather, guidelines for interpreting meaning.

         Selecting the Right Tools. If you have spent any substantial time in your law
school experience dealing with statutory interpretation, you will notice a great deal
of methodological overlap with contract interpretation. For example, courts often say
that when the plain meaning of a contract is evident, they will enforce that plain
meaning. You will, however, also see many cases where courts state that they will
not allow "blind" or "rigid" adherence to plain meaning to defeat the "true intent" of
the parties. If those principles seem directly opposed to each other, that is because
they generally are. Such contradictions are not unique to contract (or statutory)
interpretation, as paradox seems inherent in the human condition. We have all heard
that he who hesitates is lost, but also that it is also best to look before you leap.
Likewise, "absence makes the heart grow fonder," yet one who is "out of sight" is "out
of mind." Both principles are true depending on the particular circumstances. The
same is true for our rules of interpretation. Sometimes we will use plain meaning and
sometimes we will very nearly ignore the plain meaning.

         To get a sense of the interpretive rules used by courts, read sections 200
through 203 of the Restatement (Second) of Contracts. You will, for example, find the
traditional plain meaning rule nestled within section 202.

         Case Roadmap. The cases in this unit will take you through several important
issues involved in contract interpretation. The first two, W.W.W. Associates and
Estate of Soper, illustrate the deceptively titled "plain meaning" rule. Precisely when
is meaning plain enough that we do not look past what the words say? PPG v. Shell
takes up the issue of grammar and its importance in interpretation. Tropes in writing
such as the joke about the difference between "Let's eat, Grandpa!" and "Let's eat
Grandpa!" are actually not that far off the mark; a missing comma or a grammatical
error can be costly. What about ambiguous terms, where language is inherently
susceptible to multiple plausible meanings? The Frigaliment decision, famously
known in law school circles as the "chicken case," is literally a textbook example of
how to deal with ambiguity. Finally, the Random House case illustrates a problem
increasingly relevant in the 21st century: What happens when technology changes
while old contract boilerplate terms do not?

       W.W.W. ASSOCIATES, INC. v. GIANCONTIERI
                       Court of Appeals of New York

     77 N.Y.2d 157, 566 N.E.2d 639, 565 N.Y.S.2d 440 (1990)

KAYE, J.

         [This was a dispute over the sale of a parcel of land. The parties signed a form
Contract of Sale, supplemented by several additional provisions. One of them
("paragraph 31") read:

         The parties acknowledge that Sellers have been served with process instituting an
         action concerned with the real property which is the subject of this agreement. In
         the event the closing of title is delayed by reason of such litigation it is agreed that
         closing of title will in a like manner be adjourned until after the conclusion of such
         litigation provided, in the event such litigation is not concluded, by or before 6-1-
         87 either party shall have the right to cancel this contract whereupon the down
         payment shall be returned and there shall be no further rights hereunder.

Also in the contract was a merger clause:

         All prior understandings and agreements between seller and purchaser are
         merged in this contract [and it] completely expresses their full agreement. It has
         been entered into after full investigation, neither party relying upon any statements
         made by anyone else that are not set forth in this contract.

         The litigation in fact was not concluded by June 1, and the defendant sellers
refused to go forward. The purchaser sued, arguing that the clause in italics had been
added for its benefit and it had been understood that only the purchaser could use
the clause to back out of the deal. The plaintiff purchaser had provided evidentiary
facts in support of its position.]

         Defendants made no response to these factual assertions. Rather, its summary
judgment motion rested entirely on the language of the Contract of Sale, which it
argued was, under the law, determinative of its right to cancel.

         The trial court granted defendants' motion and dismissed the complaint,
holding that the agreement unambiguously conferred the right to cancel on
defendants as well as plaintiff. The Appellate Division, however, reversed and, after
searching the record and adopting the facts alleged by plaintiff in its affidavit,
granted summary judgment to plaintiff directing specific performance of the contract.
We now reverse and dismiss the complaint.

         Critical to the success of plaintiff's position is consideration of the extrinsic
evidence that paragraph 31 was added to the contract solely for its benefit. The
Appellate Division made clear that this evidence was at the heart of its decision.

______________________________________________________________________________

360  CHAPTER VI: TERMS AND INTERPRETATION
         We conclude, however, that the extrinsic evidence tendered by plaintiff is not
material. In its reliance on extrinsic evidence, plaintiff ignores a vital first step in the
analysis: before looking to evidence of what was in the parties' minds, a court must
give due weight to what was in their contract.

         A familiar and eminently sensible proposition of law is that, when parties set
down their agreement in a clear, complete document, their writing should as a rule
be enforced according to its terms. Evidence outside the four corners of the document
as to what was really intended but unstated or misstated is generally inadmissible to
add to or vary the writing. See, e.g., Mercury Bay Boating Club v San Diego Yacht
Club, 557 N.E.2d 87 (N.Y. 1990). That rule imparts "stability to commercial
transactions by safeguarding against fraudulent claims, perjury, death of witnesses,
infirmity of memory, [and] the fear that the jury will improperly evaluate the
extrinsic evidence." EDITH L. FISCH, NEW YORK EVIDENCE § 42 at 22 (2d ed 1987). Such
considerations are all the more compelling in the context of real property
transactions, where commercial certainty is a paramount concern.

         Whether or not a writing is ambiguous is a question of law to be resolved by
the courts . Van Wagner Advertising Corp. v S & M Enterprises, 492 N.E.2d 756 (N.Y.
1986). In the present case, the contract, read as a whole to determine its purpose and
intent, plainly manifests the intention that defendants, as well as plaintiff, should
have the right to cancel after June 1, 1987 if the litigation had not concluded by that
date; and it further plainly manifests the intention that all prior understandings be
merged into the contract, which expresses the parties' full agreement.

         Thus, we conclude there is no ambiguity as to the cancellation clause in issue,
read in the context of the entire agreement, and that it confers a reciprocal right on
both parties to the contract.

         The question next raised is whether extrinsic evidence should be considered in
order to create an ambiguity in the agreement. That question must be answered in
the negative. It is well settled that "extrinsic and parol evidence is not admissible to
create an ambiguity in a written agreement which is complete and clear and
unambiguous upon its face." Intercontinental Planning v Daystrom, Inc., 248 N.E.2d
576 (N.Y. 1969).

         Here, sophisticated businessmen reduced their negotiations to a clear,
complete writing. In the paragraphs immediately surrounding paragraph 31, they
expressly bestowed certain options on the purchaser alone, but in paragraph 31 they
chose otherwise, explicitly allowing both buyer and seller to cancel in the event the
litigation was unresolved by June 1, 1987. By ignoring the plain language of the
contract, plaintiff effectively rewrites the bargain that was struck. An analysis that
begins with consideration of extrinsic evidence of what the parties meant, instead of
looking first to what they said and reaching extrinsic evidence only when required to

______________________________________________________________________________

UNIT 18: THE INTERPRETIVE TOOLBOX  361
do so because of some identified ambiguity, unnecessarily denigrates the contract and
unsettles the law.

         Accordingly, the Appellate Division order should be reversed, with costs,
defendants' motion for summary judgment granted, and the complaint dismissed.

                                           _____________________

         Review Question 1. Notice that the W.W.W. Associates case is resolved on
summary judgment, meaning (in typical summary judgment language) that the court
determined there was "no genuine issue of material fact" and that defendant sellers
were "entitled to judgment as a matter of law." How can that possibly be right when
the only evidence of what the parties meant by the words of the contract was filed by
the plaintiff? If anyone wins the case on summary judgment, shouldn't it be the
plaintiff who actually had interpretive evidence?

        IN RE ESTATE OF SOPER
         Supreme Court of Minnesota
     196 Minn. 60, 264 N.W. 427 (1935)

JULIUS J. OLSON, J.

         Ira Soper married Adeline Westphal in 1911. They lived in Louisville, and had
three daughters. In 1921, Soper faked his own suicide and disappeared, abandoning
his wife and children. Soper changed his name to John Young, moved to Minneapolis,
went into business, and eventually married Gertrude Whitby, a marriage that was
bigamous because his marriage to Adeline had never ended. Soper/Young prospered,
and took out an insurance policy which provided that the money should be paid on
his death to "the wife of the deceased [insured] if living." When he died, the insurance
company paid the money to Gertrude. Adeline discovered the facts, and she and
Soper/Young's executor sued to recover the money. Adeline's theory was that, in law,
she was the only lawful "wife of the deceased" and thus was entitled to the money.
Gertrude argued that Soper/Young had intended for her to have the money, not
Adeline.]

         Gertrude neither did nor could take anything as the "wife" of Young.2 As a
matter of law she never became such. But this conclusion does not solve our problem
because she does not lay claim to the insurance merely as his lawful wife, but as the
person intended to be the beneficiary under the escrow agreement as fully as if her
name had been written into that contract instead of the word "wife." Plaintiffs

     2 [That is, Gertrude was not a lawful wife because Soper/Young was already married, and so

she could not inherit under Minnesota law. Adeline was the lawful spouse and heir.--Eds.]

______________________________________________________________________________

362  CHAPTER VI: TERMS AND INTERPRETATION
claim that the written instrument is free from ambiguity, latent or otherwise, and
that as such it was improper for the trial court to permit oral evidence to show who
was intended thereby to be such beneficiary. They strenuously assert that the
agreement is not subject to construction, that it is perfectly plain in its language, and
that the only thing for the court to determine is whether Mrs. Soper was the lawful
wife of the deceased husband or if Gertrude was such.

         From the facts and circumstances hereinbefore related the conclusion seems
inescapable that Gertrude was intended. She was the only one known or considered
by the contracting parties. True, Young knew otherwise, but that he did not intend
his real wife to take anything as beneficiary seems obvious. From the time he left
Louisville and came to Minneapolis, and until some time after his death, no one
amongst his business or social acquaintances knew anything of or concerning his true
wife. Gertrude alone answered the descriptive designation of "wife." Public records
disclosed her and her alone to be such. There was no one else.

         The question of identification of the individual intended by the written
instrument very often involves and requires oral proof. That is the situation here.
The right to the money here involved is claimed by both Adeline Soper and Gertrude
Young. In what manner may either establish relationship to the decedent as his
"wife" except by means of oral testimony? Ira Collins Soper and John W. Young, in
the absence of proof contra, would likely lead an inquirer to the view that two
different men were involved. Adeline, to establish her relationship, was necessarily
required to and did furnish proof, principally oral, that her husband, Ira Collins
Soper, was in fact the same individual as John W. Young. Gertrude by similar means
sought to establish her claim. Of course the proof was such as to require a finding
sustaining Adeline's claim. No one questions that result. But until such proof was
adduced it is equally clear, both from public records in Hennepin county and general
repute, that Gertrude had been duly married to John W. Young. All friends and
acquaintances knew and recognized her as his wife. There was nothing in
Minneapolis or in this state indicating otherwise. Were we to award the insurance
fund to plaintiff Adeline, it is obvious that we would thereby be doing violence to the
contract entered into by the decedent Young with his associate [the insurance agent]
Mr. Karstens. That agreement points to no one else than Gertrude as Young's "wife."
To hold otherwise is to give the word "wife" "a fixed symbol," as "something inherent
and objective, not subjective and personal." Dean Wigmore in his excellent work on
evidence, has this to say:

         The ordinary standard, or "plain meaning," is simply the meaning of the
         people who did not write the document. The fallacy consists in assuming
         that there is or ever can be someone real or absolute meaning. In truth,
         there can be only some person's meaning; and that person, whose
         meaning the law is seeking, is the writer of the document.

______________________________________________________________________________

UNIT 18: THE INTERPRETIVE TOOLBOX  363
         The truth is that whatever virtue and strength lies in the argument for
         the antique rule leads not to a fixed rule of law, but only to a general
         maxim of prudent discretion. In the felicitous alliteration of that great
         judge, Lord Justice Bowen, it is "not so much a canon of construction as
         a counsel of caution."

5 JOHN HENRY WIGMORE, WIGMORE ON EVIDENCE § 2462 at 378-79 (2 ed. 1923).

         In Wilmot v. Minneapolis Automobile Trade Assn., 210 N.W. 861 (Minn. 1926),
this court said:

         The duty of courts is to apply contracts to their subject matter and so
         effect the purpose of the parties. Their interpretation is incidental. To
         accomplish the main object resort may and frequently must be had to
         the circumstances under which the contract was made and, if there be
         need for resort to extraneous aids to construction, it is immaterial
         whether such need arises from an uncertainty in the instrument itself
         or, that being clear standing alone, it ceases to be so and ambiguity
         arises when the contract is applied to its subject matter. In either case
         construction must follow and resort must be had to the aids furnished
         by extrinsic circumstances.

         After all, as we said in City of Marshall v. Gregoire, 259 N.W. 377, 381-382
(Minn. 1935):

         A written contract is little more than a scrap of writing save as it
         operates with legal effect on matters extraneous to itself. Construction
         deals with the dynamic rather than the static phase of the instrument.
         The question is not just what words mean literally but how they are
         intended to operate practically on the subject matter. Thus, seemingly
         plain language becomes susceptible of construction, and frequently
         requires it, if ambiguity appears when attempt is made to operate the
         contract.

         That is the situation here. The trust agreement has become "susceptible of
construction" because "ambiguity appears when attempt is made to operate the
contract."

         The order is affirmed.

I. M. OLSEN, J., dissenting.3

         I am unable to agree that this court should make a new contract for the parties

done to the innocent woman whom he purported to marry. Nothing is said about the
wrong done to the lawful wife.

         The contract in this case designates the "wife" as the one to whom the money
was to be paid. I am unable to construe this word to mean anyone else than the only
wife of Soper then living.

         Review Question 2. If, in the abstract, you read the word "wife" in an
insurance policy, would you believe that it had a plain meaning? If the term does have
a plain meaning, then what business does the court have in construing the contract
any other way?

         Review Question 3. The W.W.W. Enterprises court says that it is improper to
look at extrinsic evidence to determine whether a term is "ambiguous." The Soper
court seems to say that it is practically inevitable to do so. Can the cases be reconciled,
or are we just looking at two different judicial philosophies? Incidentally, are the
purported ambiguities in these two cases "latent" or are they "patent"? Why might
the category of ambiguity involved matter?

                                    727 F. Supp. 285 (E.D. La. 1989)

HENRY A. MENTZ, U.S.D.J.

         On May 3, 1983, Shell and PPG entered into a contract for the sale of ethylene
by Shell to PPG. On May 5, 1988, an explosion occurred at the Shell oil refinery in
Norco, Louisiana. As a result of that explosion, Shell reduced the quantity of ethylene
being delivered to PPG. Thereafter, on May 2, 1989, PPG instituted the present suit
against Shell. PPG claims that Shell breached its contract by failing to deliver the
specified quantities of ethylene following the Norco explosion. PPG seeks to recover
its economic losses allegedly suffered as a result of Shell's inability to perform under
the contract.

         A federal court sitting in diversity must apply the choice of law principles of
the forum state. Thus, this Court is bound to apply the Louisiana choice of law rules.

______________________________________________________________________________

UNIT 18: THE INTERPRETIVE TOOLBOX  365
Absent strong public policy considerations, Louisiana allows parties to stipulate in
their contracts which state's law are to govern them.

         In the instant case, section 13 of the contract in question specifies that Texas
law will govern the interpretation of the contract. No showing has been made that
applying Texas law would violate any strong public policy considerations.
Accordingly, Texas law controls PPG's breach of contract claim.

         Under Texas law, interpretation of an unambiguous contract is a question of
law. A determination of ambiguity is reserved to the Court.

         The contract between PPG and Shell contained an "excuses for
nonperformance" clause. Section 8 of the contract reads:

     EXCUSES FOR NONPERFORMANCE

     Either Seller or Buyer will be excused from the obligations of this Contract to the
     extent that performance is delayed or prevented by any circumstances (except
     financial) reasonably beyond its control or by fire, explosion, mechanical
     breakdown, strikes or other labor trouble, plant shutdown, unavailability of raw
     materials or unavailability of or interference with the usual means of transporting
     the Product or compliance with any law, regulation, order, recommendation, or
     request of any governmental authority.

(Emphasis added.)

         PPG maintains that the phrase "reasonably beyond its control" qualifies the
rest of the contract clause, making the exculpation of Shell dependent upon whether
the explosion was reasonably beyond its control. However, under the law of Texas,

contract language should be given its "plain grammatical meaning." Simply stated,
"or" is disjunctive, or alternative in its effect. Lyons v. Montgomery, 701 S.W.2d 641,

643 (Tex. 1985). In other words, "or" means or, not "and." However, PPG argues that
the Court is required to determine whether reading "or" as disjunctive would defeat
the intentions of the parties, and whether the context requires the Court to determine
if a conjunctive meaning is more appropriate. PPG misconstrues Texas law. These

inquiries are necessary only if the Court were to determine as a matter of law that
the contract language is ambiguous. See Board of Insurance Comm'rs v. Guardian
Life Ins. Co., 180 S.W.2d 906 (Tex. 1944). If that were the case, only then would the
Court use the two-step inquiry suggested by PPG in order to determine whether there

was a genuine issue of material fact with respect to the parties intentions, and
whether any compelling reasons existed for using the conjunctive "or." However, as

noted previously, this Court finds that there is no genuine issue of material fact
regarding the plain language of the contract. As a matter of law the contract is
unambiguous. "Or" is disjunctive and, therefore, Shell is exculpated under Section 8

of the contract, because of the explosion, regardless of whether the explosion was
"reasonably beyond its control." See Eastern Airlines, Inc. v. McDonnell Douglas
Corp., 532 F.2d 957, 992 (5th Cir. 1976). This is not an absurd result, as suggested by
PPG, because commercially it would make no sense for Shell to intentionally blow up

______________________________________________________________________________

366                              CHAPTER VI: TERMS AND INTERPRETATION
its own refinery in order to avoid delivering ethylene to PPG. Indeed, it would not
make commercial sense for Shell to intentionally bring about any of the contingencies
enumerated in Section 8 of the contract.

         As noted previously, PPG contends that the term "reasonably beyond its
control" modifies the enumerated events which follow "or" in Section 8 of the contract.
This interpretation is not in keeping with the plain grammatical meaning of the
disjunctive. However, there are cases in this circuit which apply a conjunctive
meaning to such a clause. Although, [in these cases,] it is important to note, the
"reasonably beyond its control" language follows and clearly modifies by reference the
enumerated contingencies. In Jon-T Chemicals, Inc. v. Freeport Chemical Co., 704
F.2d 1412, 1414 (5th Cir. 1983), the excuse clause read in pertinent part:

         Seller shall not be liable for any failure or delay in performance hereunder which
         may be due, in whole or in part, to fire, explosion, earthquake, storm, flood, drought
         . . . or any contingency or delay or failure or cause of any nature beyond the
         reasonable control of Seller, whether or not of the kind hereinabove specified. . . .

In Nissho-Iwai Co., Ltd. v. Occidental Crude Sales, 729 F.2d 1530 (5th Cir. 1984), the
"force majeure" clause excused nonperformance caused by:

         executive or administrative orders or acts [of the Libyan Government], . . . or by
         breakdown or injury to . . . producing . . . or delivering facilities, . . . or by any other
         event, whether or not similar to the causes specified above . . . , which shall not
         reasonably be within the control of the party against whom the claim would
         otherwise be made . . . .

         In these two cases, the reasonable control language and the enumerated events
are plainly and grammatically tied together. However, in Section 8 of the Shell-PPG
contract these same two portions are not tied together conjunctively, and should not
now be read that way. The language is clear and unambiguous. There is no genuine
issue of material fact regarding the wording of the contract, particularly Section 8 of
the contract. Therefore, Shell is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.

                                           _____________________

         Review Question 4. The PPG Industries court puts a great deal of emphasis
on grammar. Note the clause at issue in this case and compare it to the two clauses
quoted from the earlier Jon-T Chemicals and Nissho-Iwai decisions. Can you
describe exactly why the court found the differences in the particular language to be
compelling?

         Review Question 5. What is a force majeure clause and what does it do? That,
incidentally, is the sort of thing lawyers in all types of practice are expected to
understand as part of their general knowledge.

UNIT 18: THE INTERPRETIVE TOOLBOX  367
                  FRIGALIMENT IMPORTING CO. v. B.N.S.
                         INTERNATIONAL SALES CORP.

     United States District Court for the Southern District of New York
                            190 F. Supp. 116 (S.D.N.Y. 1960)

FRIENDLY, J.:4

         The issue is, what is chicken? Plaintiff says "chicken" means a young chicken,
suitable for broiling and frying. Defendant says "chicken" means any bird of that
genus that meets contract specifications on weight and quality, including what it calls
"stewing chicken" and plaintiff pejoratively terms "fowl." Dictionaries give both
meanings, as well as some others not relevant here. Assuming that both parties were
acting in good faith, the case nicely illustrates Holmes's remark "that the making of
a contract depends not on the agreement of two minds in one intention, but on the
agreement of two sets of external signs--not on the parties' having meant the same
thing but on their having said the same thing." Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr., The Path
of the Law, 10 Harv. L. Rev. (1897). I have concluded that plaintiff has not sustained
its burden of persuasion that the contract used "chicken" in the narrower sense.

         The action is for breach of the warranty that goods sold shall correspond to the
description. Two contracts are in suit. In the first, dated May 2, 1957, defendant, a
New York sales corporation, confirmed the sale to plaintiff, a Swiss corporation, of

         US Fresh Frozen Chicken, Grade A, Government Inspected, Eviscerated 2½-3 lbs.
         and 1½-2 lbs. each all chicken individually wrapped in cryovac, packed in secured
         fiber cartons or wooden boxes, suitable for export

     75,000 lbs   2 1/2-3 lbs. . . .   " $33.00
     25,000 lbs.  1 1/2 -2 lbs. . . .  " $36.50

         per 100 lbs. FAS New York

         scheduled May 10, 1957 pursuant to instructions from Penson & Co., New York.

         The second contract, also dated May 2, 1957, was identical save that only
50,000 lbs. of the heavier "chicken" were called for, the price of the smaller birds was
$37 per 100 lbs., and shipment was scheduled for May 30. When the initial shipment
arrived in Switzerland, plaintiff found, on May 28, that the 2½-3 lbs. birds were not
young chicken suitable for broiling and frying but stewing chicken or "fowl"; indeed,
many of the cartons and bags plainly so indicated. Protests ensued. Nevertheless,

          4 [This was Henry J. Friendly, actually a Second Circuit Court of Appeals judge who had been
appointed to the appellate bench year before but had no prior judicial experience. He had been a
commercial lawyer and in-house counsel at Pan American Airways. Judge Friendly was voluntarily
presiding over some trials in district court to see what they were like, and this opinion was one of the
results of his endeavor. - Eds.]

368                                    CHAPTER VI: TERMS AND INTERPRETATION
shipment under the second contract was made on May 29, the 2½-3 lbs. birds again
being stewing chicken. Defendant stopped the transportation of these at Rotterdam.

         This action followed. Plaintiff says that, notwithstanding that its acceptance
was in Switzerland, New York law controls; defendant does not dispute this, and
relies on New York decisions. I shall follow the apparent agreement of the parties as
to the applicable law.

         Since the word "chicken" standing alone is ambiguous, I turn first to see
whether the contract itself offers any aid to its interpretation. Plaintiff says the 1½-
2 lbs. birds necessarily had to be young chicken since the older birds do not come in
that size, hence the 2½-3 lbs. birds must likewise be young. This is unpersuasive--a
contract for "apples" of two different sizes could be filled with different kinds of apples
even though only one species came in both sizes. Defendant notes that the contract
called not simply for chicken but for "US Fresh Frozen Chicken, Grade A,
Government Inspected." It says the contract thereby incorporated by reference the
Department of Agriculture's regulations, which favor its interpretation; I shall return
to this after reviewing plaintiff's other contentions.

         The first hinges on an exchange of cablegrams which preceded execution of the
formal contracts. The negotiations leading up to the contracts were conducted in New
York between defendant's secretary, Ernest R. Bauer, and a Mr. Stovicek, who was
in New York for the Czechoslovak government at the World Trade Fair. A few days
after meeting Bauer at the fair, Stovicek telephoned and inquired whether defendant
would be interested in exporting poultry to Switzerland. Bauer then met with
Stovicek, who showed him a cable from plaintiff dated April 26, 1957, announcing
that they "are buyer" of 25,000 lbs. of chicken 2½-3 lbs. weight, Cryovac packed, grade
A Government inspected, at a price up to 33 cents per pound, for shipment on May
10, to be confirmed by the following morning, and were interested in further offerings.
After testing the market for price, Bauer accepted, and Stovicek sent a confirmation
that evening. Plaintiff stresses that, although these and subsequent cables between
plaintiff and defendant, which laid the basis for the additional quantities under the
first and for all of the second contract, were predominantly in German, they used the
English word "chicken"; it claims this was done because it understood "chicken"
meant young chicken whereas the German word, "Huhn," included both "Brathuhn"
(broilers) and "Suppenhuhn" (stewing chicken), and that defendant, whose officers
were thoroughly conversant with German, should have realized this. Whatever force
this argument might otherwise have is largely drained away by Bauer's testimony
that he asked Stovicek what kind of chickens were wanted, received the answer "any
kind of chickens," and then, in German, asked whether the cable meant "Huhn" and
received an affirmative response. Plaintiff attacks this as contrary to what Bauer
testified on his deposition in March, 1959, and also on the ground that Stovicek had
no authority to interpret the meaning of the cable. The first contention would be

______________________________________________________________________________

UNIT 18: THE INTERPRETIVE TOOLBOX  369
persuasive if sustained by the record, since Bauer was free at the trial from the threat
of contradiction by Stovicek as he was not at the time of the deposition; however,
review of the deposition does not convince me of the claimed inconsistency. As to the
second contention, it may well be that Stovicek lacked authority to commit plaintiff
for prices or delivery dates other than those specified in the cable; but plaintiff cannot
at the same time rely on its cable to Stovicek as its dictionary to the meaning of the
contract and repudiate the interpretation given the dictionary by the man in whose
hands it was put.

         Plaintiff's next contention is that there was a definite trade usage that
"chicken" meant "young chicken." Defendant showed that it was only beginning in
the poultry trade in 1957, thereby bringing itself within the principle that "when one
of the parties is not a member of the trade or other circle, his acceptance of the
standard must be made to appear" by proving either that he had actual knowledge of
the usage or that the usage is "so generally known in the community that his actual
individual knowledge of it may be inferred." 9 JOHN HENRY WIGMORE, WIGMORE ON
EVIDENCE § 2464 (3d ed. 1940). Here there was no proof of actual knowledge of the
alleged usage; indeed, it is quite plain that defendant's belief was to the contrary. In
order to meet the alternative requirement, the law of New York demands a showing
that "the usage is of so long continuance, so well established, so notorious, so
universal and so reasonable in itself, as that the presumption is violent that the
parties contracted with reference to it, and made it a part of their agreement." Walls
v. Bailey, 49 N.Y. 464, 472-473 (1872).

         Plaintiff endeavored to establish such a usage by the testimony of three
witnesses and certain other evidence. Strasser, resident buyer in New York for a large
chain of Swiss cooperatives, testified that "on chicken I would definitely understand
a broiler." However, the force of this testimony was considerably weakened by the
fact that in his own transactions the witness, a careful businessman, protected
himself by using "broiler" when that was what he wanted and "fowl" when he wished
older birds. Indeed, there are some indications, dating back to a remark of Lord
Mansfield, Edie v. East India Co., 97 Eng. Rep. 797 (K.B. 1761), that no credit should
be given "witnesses to usage, who could not adduce instances in verification." While
Wigmore thinks this goes too far, a witness's consistent failure to rely on the alleged
usage deprives his opinion testimony of much of its effect. Niesielowski, an officer of
one of the companies that had furnished the stewing chicken to defendant, testified
that "chicken" meant "the male species of the poultry industry. That could be a
broiler, a fryer or a roaster," but not a stewing chicken; however, he also testified that
upon receiving defendant's inquiry for "chickens," he asked whether the desire was
for "fowl or frying chickens" and, in fact, supplied fowl, although taking the
precaution of asking defendant, a day or two after plaintiff's acceptance of the
contracts in suit, to change its confirmation of its order from "chickens," as defendant
had originally prepared it, to "stewing chickens." Dates, an employee of Urner-Barry
Company, which publishes a daily market report on the poultry trade, gave it as his

______________________________________________________________________________

370  CHAPTER VI: TERMS AND INTERPRETATION
view that the trade meaning of "chicken" was "broilers and fryers." In addition to this
opinion testimony, plaintiff relied on the fact that the Urner-Barry service, the
Journal of Commerce, and Weinberg Bros. & Co. of Chicago, a large supplier of
poultry, published quotations in a manner which, in one way or another, distinguish
between "chicken," comprising broilers, fryers and certain other categories, and
"fowl," which, Bauer acknowledged, included stewing chickens. This material would
be impressive if there were nothing to the contrary. However, there was, as will now
be seen.

         Defendant's witness Weininger, who operates a chicken eviscerating plant in
New Jersey, testified "Chicken is everything except a goose, a duck, and a turkey.
Everything is a chicken, but then you have to say, you have to specify which category
you want or that you are talking about." Its witness Fox said that in the trade
"chicken" would encompass all the various classifications. Sadina, who conducts a
food inspection service, testified that he would consider any bird coming within the
classes of "chicken" in the Department of Agriculture's regulations to be a chicken.
The specifications approved by the General Services Administration include fowl as
well as broilers and fryers under the classification "chickens." Statistics of the
Institute of American Poultry Industries use the phrases "Young chickens" and
"Mature chickens," under the general heading "Total chickens," and the Department
of Agriculture's daily and weekly price reports avoid use of the word "chicken" without
specification.

         Defendant advances several other points which it claims affirmatively support
its construction. Primary among these is the regulation of the Department of
Agriculture, 7 C.F.R. § 70.300-70.370 (1960), entitled, "Grading and Inspection of
Poultry and Edible Products Thereof," and in particular 70.301 which recited:

         Chickens. The following are the various classes of chickens:

         (a) Broiler or fryer . . .

         (b) Roaster . . .

         (c) Capon . . .

         (d) Stag . . .

         (e) Hen or stewing chicken or fowl . . .

         (f) Cock or old rooster . . .

         Defendant argues, as previously noted, that the contract incorporated these
regulations by reference. Plaintiff answers that the contract provision related simply
to grade and Government inspection and did not incorporate the Government
definition of "chicken," and also that the definition in the Regulations is ignored in
the trade. However, the latter contention was contradicted by Weininger and Sadina;

______________________________________________________________________________

UNIT 18: THE INTERPRETIVE TOOLBOX  371
and there is force in defendant's argument that the contract made the regulations a
dictionary, particularly since the reference to Government grading was already in
plaintiff's initial cable to Stovicek.

         Defendant makes a further argument based on the impossibility of its
obtaining broilers and fryers at the 33 cents price offered by plaintiff for the 2½-3 lbs.
birds. There is no substantial dispute that, in late April, 1957, the price for 2½-3 lbs.
broilers was between 35 and 37 cents per pound, and that when defendant entered
into the contracts, it was well aware of this and intended to fill them by supplying
fowl in these weights. It claims that plaintiff must likewise have known the market
since plaintiff had reserved shipping space on April 23, three days before plaintiff's
cable to Stovicek, or, at least, that Stovicek was chargeable with such knowledge. It
is scarcely an answer to say, as plaintiff does in its brief, that the 33 cents price
offered by the 2½3 lbs. "chickens" was closer to the prevailing 35 cents price for
broilers than to the 30 cents at which defendant procured fowl. Plaintiff must have
expected defendant to make some profit--certainly it could not have expected
defendant deliberately to incur a loss.

         Finally, defendant relies on conduct by the plaintiff after the first shipment
had been received. On May 28 plaintiff sent two cables complaining that the larger
birds in the first shipment constituted "fowl." Defendant answered with a cable
refusing to recognize plaintiff's objection and announcing "We have today ready for
shipment 50,000 lbs. chicken 2½-3 lbs. 25,000 lbs. broilers 1½-2 lbs.," these being the
goods procured for shipment under the second contract, and asked immediate answer
"whether we are to ship this merchandise to you and whether you will accept the
merchandise." After several other cable exchanges, plaintiff replied on May 29
"Confirm again that merchandise is to be shipped since resold by us if not enough
pursuant to contract chickens are shipped the missing quantity is to be shipped
within ten days stop we resold to our customers pursuant to your contract chickens
grade A you have to deliver us said merchandise we again state that we shall make
you fully responsible for all resulting costs." Defendant argues that if plaintiff was
sincere in thinking it was entitled to young chickens, plaintiff would not have allowed
the shipment under the second contract to go forward, since the distinction between
broilers and chickens drawn in defendant's cablegram must have made it clear that
the larger birds would not be broilers. However, plaintiff answers that the cables
show plaintiff was insisting on delivery of young chickens and that defendant shipped
old ones at its peril. Defendant's point would be highly relevant on another disputed
issue--whether if liability were established, the measure of damages should be the
difference in market value of broilers and stewing chicken in New York or the larger
difference in Europe, but I cannot give it weight on the issue of interpretation.
Defendant points out also that plaintiff proceeded to deliver some of the larger birds
in Europe, describing them as "poulets"; defendant argues that it was only when
plaintiff's customers complained about this that plaintiff developed the idea that

______________________________________________________________________________

372  CHAPTER VI: TERMS AND INTERPRETATION
"chicken" meant "young chicken." There is little force in this in view of plaintiff's
immediate and consistent protests.

         When all the evidence is reviewed, it is clear that defendant believed it could
comply with the contracts by delivering stewing chicken in the 2½-3 lbs. size.
Defendant's subjective intent would not be significant if this did not coincide with an
objective meaning of "chicken." Here it did coincide with one of the dictionary
meanings, with the definition in the Department of Agriculture Regulations to which
the contract made at least oblique reference, with at least some usage in the trade,
with the realities of the market, and with what plaintiff's spokesman had said.
Plaintiff asserts it to be equally plain that plaintiff's own subjective intent was to
obtain broilers and fryers; the only evidence against this is the material as to market
prices and this may not have been sufficiently brought home. In any event it is
unnecessary to determine that issue. For plaintiff has the burden of showing that
"chicken" was used in the narrower rather than in the broader sense, and this it has
not sustained.

         This opinion constitutes the Court's findings of fact and conclusions of law.
Judgment shall be entered dismissing the complaint with costs.

         Review Question 6. Frigaliment (usually pronounced frih-gah-le-MAHN) is a
very popular case in contracts classes because it is an excellent example of a court
carefully interpreting an ambiguous term. More than most cases, this one is an
opinion you should carefully go through and outline it. What evidence does the court
consider? How does it go about evaluating the evidence? Why ultimately does the
seller win? If you cannot answer those questions, you have not read the case carefully
enough.

         Review Question 7. Judge Friendly says that "Defendant's subjective intent
would not be significant if this did not coincide with an objective meaning of `chicken.'"
What does this statement suggest to you about how subjective and objective
understandings of contract language relate to each other?

                    RANDOM HOUSE, INC. v. ROSETTA BOOKS LLC
            United States District Court for the Southern District of New York

                                 150 F. Supp. 2d 613 (S.D.N.Y. 2001)

SIDNEY H. STEIN, U.S.D.J.

         In the year 2000 and the beginning of 2001, Rosetta Books contracted with
several authors to publish certain of their works--including The Confessions of Nat
Turner and Sophie's Choice by William Styron; Slaughterhouse-Five, Breakfast of
Champions, The Sirens of Titan, Cat's Cradle, and Player Piano by Kurt Vonnegut;
and Promised Land by Robert B. Parker--in digital format over the internet. On
February 26, 2001 Rosetta Books launched its ebook business, offering those titles
and others for sale in digital format. The next day, Random House filed this complaint
accusing Rosetta Books of committing copyright infringement and tortiously
interfering with the contracts Random House had with Messrs. Parker, Styron and
Vonnegut by selling its ebooks. It simultaneously moved for a preliminary injunction
prohibiting Rosetta from infringing plaintiff's copyrights.

         Ebooks are "digital book[s] that you can read on a computer screen or an
electronic device." Although the text of the ebook is exactly the same as the text of
the original work, the ebook contains various features that take advantage of its
digital format.

         [Random House had entered into contracts with Styron in 1961 and 1977. with
Vonnegut in 1967 and 1970, and with Parker in 1982. Each contract gave Random
House the rights to publish the books, along with various other rights (film, Braille,
television, condensed book, foreign translations, overseas sales, etc.) that varied
somewhat from contract to contract. Each contract, though, specified--and this is the
key language in the case--that Random House had the exclusive right, within the
particular territory, to "print, publish and sell the work in book form" (emphasis
added). Random House claimed that an ebook involved publishing "in book form."
Rosetta claimed it was not "in book form."

         In New York, a written contract is to be interpreted so as to give effect to the
intention of the parties as expressed in the contract's language. The court must
consider the entire contract and reconcile all parts, if possible, to avoid an
inconsistency.

         Determining whether a contract provision is ambiguous is a question of law to
be decided by the court. See W.W.W. Associates, Inc. v. Giancontieri, 566 N.E.2d 639,
642 (N.Y. 1990). Pursuant to New York law, "contract language is ambiguous if it is
capable of more than one meaning when viewed objectively by a reasonably
intelligent person who has examined the context of the entire integrated agreement
and who is cognizant of the customs, practices, usages and terminology as generally

______________________________________________________________________________

understood in the particular trade or business." Sayers v. Rochester Telephone Corp.
Supplemental Management Pension Plan, 7 F.3d 1091, 1095 (2d Cir. N.Y. 1993).

         These principles are in accord with the approach the U.S. Court of Appeals for
the Second Circuit uses in analyzing contractual language in disputes, such as this
one, "about whether licensees may exploit licensed works through new marketing
channels made possible by technologies developed after the licensing contract--often
called `new use' problems." Boosey & Hawkes Music Publishers, Ltd v. Walt Disney
Co., 145 F.3d 481, 486 (2d Cir. 1998). The two leading cases in this Circuit on how to
determine whether "new uses" come within prior grants of rights are Boosey and
Bartsch v. Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, Inc., 391 F.2d 150 (2d Cir. 1968), decided three
decades apart.

         In Bartsch, the author of the play "Maytime" granted Harry Bartsch in 1930
"the motion picture rights throughout the world," including the right to "copyright,
vend, license and exhibit such motion picture photoplays throughout the world;
together with the further sole and exclusive rights by mechanical and/or electrical
means to record, reproduce and transmit sound, including spoken words." He in turn
assigned those rights to Warner Bros. Pictures, which transferred them to MGM. In
1958 MGM licensed its motion picture "Maytime" for viewing on television. Bartsch
sued, claiming the right to transmit the play over television had not been given to
MGM.

         Judge Henry Friendly, for the Second Circuit,5 wrote in 1968 that "any effort
to reconstruct what the parties actually intended nearly forty years ago is doomed to
failure." He added that the words of the grant by Bartsch "were well designed to give
the assignee [i.e., MGM] the broadest rights with respect to its copyrighted property."
The words of the grant were broad enough to cover the new use--i.e. viewing on
television--and Judge Friendly interpreted them to do so. This interpretation, he
wrote, permitted the licensee to "properly pursue any uses which may reasonably be
said to fall within the medium as described in the license." That interpretation also
avoided the risk "that a deadlock between the grantor and the grantee might prevent
the work's being shown over the new medium at all."

         In Boosey, the plaintiff was the assignee of Igor Stravinsky's copyrights in the
musical composition, "The Rite of Spring." In 1939, Stravinsky had licensed Disney's
use of "The Rite of Spring" in the motion picture "Fantasia." Fifty-two years later, in
1991, Disney released "Fantasia" in video format and Boosey brought an action
seeking, among other relief, a declaration that the grant of rights did not include the
right to use the Stravinsky work in video format. In Boosey, just as in Bartsch, the

          5 [Yes, the same judge who decided Frigaliment, this time sitting on the Second Circuit Court
of Appeals rather than handling a trial. - Eds.]

______________________________________________________________________________

UNIT 18: THE INTERPRETIVE TOOLBOX  375
language of the grant was broad, enabling the licensee "to record in any manner,
medium or form, and to license the performance of, the musical composition [for use]
in a motion picture."

         At the Second Circuit, a unanimous panel focused on "neutral principles of
contract interpretation rather than solicitude for either party." Id. at 487. "What
governs," Judge Pierre Leval wrote, "is the language of the contract. If the contract is
more reasonably read to convey one meaning, the party benefitted by that reading
should be able to rely on it; the party seeking exception or deviation from the meaning
reasonably conveyed by the words of the contract should bear the burden of
negotiating for language that would express the limitation or deviation. This
principle favors neither licensors nor licensees. It follows simply from the words of
the contract."6

         Relying on "the language of the license contract and basic principles of
interpretation," this Court finds that the most reasonable interpretation of the grant
in the contracts at issue to "print, publish and sell the work in book form" does not
include the right to publish the work as an ebook. At the outset, the phrase itself
distinguishes between the pure content--i.e. "the work" --and the format of display--
"in book form." The Random House Webster's Unabridged Dictionary defines a "book"
as "a written or printed work of fiction or nonfiction, usually on sheets of paper
fastened or bound together within covers" and defines "form" as "external appearance
of a clearly defined area, as distinguished from color or material; the shape of a thing
or person." Manifestly, paragraph #1 of each contract--entitled either "grant of
rights" or "exclusive publication right" --conveys certain rights from the author to
the publisher. In that paragraph, separate grant language is used to convey the rights
to publish book club editions, reprint editions, abridged forms, and editions in Braille.
This language would not be necessary if the phrase "in book form" encompassed all
types of books. That paragraph specifies exactly which rights were being granted by
the author to the publisher. Indeed, many of the rights set forth in the publisher's
form contracts were in fact not granted to the publisher, but rather were reserved by
the authors to themselves. For example, each of the authors specifically reserved
certain rights for themselves by striking out phrases, sentences, and paragraphs of
the publisher's form contract. This evidences an intent by these authors not to grant
the publisher the broadest rights in their works.

          6 [The Random House opinion is not entirely clear on what then happened in Boosey.
Ultimately, the Boosey court held that "[n]either the plain terms of the 1939 Agreement nor the
sparse and contradictory extrinsic evidence require the conclusion that Disney's license is limited
to theatrical performance of the composition." Boosey & Hawkes Music Publishers, Ltd. v. Walt
Disney Co., 145 F.3d 481, 491 (2d Cir. 1998). Accordingly, the district court's summary judgment
against Disney on interpretation of the licensing agreement was "inappropriate," and the case was
remanded al court for further proceedings. Id. - Eds.]

______________________________________________________________________________

376  CHAPTER VI: TERMS AND INTERPRETATION
         Random House contends that the phrase "in book form" means to faithfully
reproduce the author's text in its complete form as a reading experience and that,
since ebooks concededly contain the complete text of the work, Rosetta cannot also
possess those rights. While Random House's definition distinguishes "book form"
from other formats that require separate contractual language--such as audio books
and serialization rights--it does not distinguish other formats specifically mentioned
in paragraph #1 of the contracts, such as book club editions and reprint editions.
Because the Court must, if possible, give effect to all contractual language in order to
"safeguard against adopting an interpretation that would render any individual
provision superfluous," Sayers, 7 F.3d at 1095, Random House's definition cannot be
adopted.

         [Some, but not all, of the contracts contained an additional clause that
provided: "The Author agrees that during the term of this agreement he will not,
without the written permission of the Publisher, publish or permit to be published
any material in book or pamphlet form, based on the material in the work, or which
is reasonably likely to injure its sale."]

         Random House cites the non-compete clauses as evidence that the authors
granted it broad, exclusive rights in their work. Random House reasons that because
the authors could not permit any material that would injure the sale of the work to
be published without Random House's consent, the authors must have granted the
right to publish ebooks to Random House. This reasoning turns the analysis on its
head. First, the grant of rights follows from the grant language alone. Second, non-
compete clauses must be limited in scope in order to be enforceable in New York.
Third, even if the authors did violate this provision of their Random House
agreements by contracting with Rosetta Books--a point on which this Court does not
opine--the remedy is a breach of contract action against the authors, not a copyright
infringement action against Rosetta Books.

         The photocopy clause--giving Random House the right to "Xerox and other
forms of copying, either now in use or hereafter developed" --similarly does not
bolster Random House's position. Although the clause does appear in the grant
language paragraph, taken in context, it clearly refers only to new developments in
xerography and other forms of photocopying. Stretching it to include new forms of
publishing, such as ebooks, would make the rest of the contract superfluous because
there would be no reason for authors to reserve rights to forms of publishing "now in
use." This interpretation also comports with the publishing industry's trade usage of
the phrase.

         Not only does the language of the contract itself lead almost ineluctably to the
conclusion that Random House does not own the right to publish the works as ebooks,
but also a reasonable person "cognizant of the customs, practices, usages and
terminology as generally understood in the particular trade or business," Sayers, 7

UNIT 18: THE INTERPRETIVE TOOLBOX  377
F.3d at 1095, would conclude that the grant language does not include ebooks. "To
print, publish and sell the work in book form" is understood in the publishing industry
to be a "limited" grant. See Field v. True Comics, 89 F. Supp. 611, 613-14 (S.D.N.Y.
1950);7 see also MELVILLE B. NIMMER & DAVID NIMMER, NIMMER ON COPYRIGHT, §
10.14[C] (2001) (citing Field).

         Boosey and Bartsch, which apply to new uses within the same medium, do not
control this case. See, e.g., Raine v. CBS, Inc., 25 F. Supp. 2d 434, 445 (S.D.N.Y. 1998)
(finding that the right to "television broadcasts" did not include broadcasts on cable
television or videocassettes); General Mills, Inc. v. Filmtel Int'l Corp., 599 N.Y.S.2d
820, 821-22 (Sup. Ct. App. Div. 1993) (same); Tele-Pac, Inc. v. Grainger, 570 N.Y.S.2d
521 (Sup. Ct. App. Div. 1991) (distinguishing Second Circuit "new use" doctrine by
holding that right to "broadcast[] by television or any other similar device now known
or hereafter to be made known" was so dissimilar from display on videocassette and
videodisc "as to preclude consideration of video rights as even falling within the
`ambiguous penumbra' of the terms used in the agreement").

         Employing the most important tool in the armamentarium of contract
interpretation--the language of the contract itself--this Court has concluded that
Random House is not the beneficial owner of the right to publish the eight works at
issue as ebooks.

                                           _____________________

         Review Question 8. Why exactly, according to the Random House court, is an
"ebook" not something "in book form," while "motion picture rights" do include a
television broadcast? Are these results self-evident under the analytical framework
articulated by the Second Circuit, or could you argue for the cases to come out
differently while using the same rule? If asked to do so, would you be able to apply
the Random House test to a media format that did not exist at the time of an earlier
contract?

                                Problems

Problem 18.1

         Pantera's is a chain of "café-style" restaurants. It enters into a contract with
Shopping Center to put a Pantera café in the center. As part of the negotiations,
Pantera's insists that it wants to limit competition within the center. The Center has
other tenants, however, who also serve food. After negotiation, the parties agree to
the following language:

         Center agrees not to enter into a lease, occupancy agreement or license
         affecting space in the Shopping Center or consent to an amendment to an
         existing lease permitting use . . . for a bakery or restaurant reasonably
         expected to have annual sales of sandwiches greater than ten percent
         (10%) of its total sales or primarily for the sale of high quality coffees or teas,
         such as, but not limited to, Starbucks, Tea-Luxe, Pete's Coffee and Tea,
         and Finagle a Bagle. The foregoing shall not apply to (i) a business serving
         near-Eastern food and related products, (ii) restaurants primarily for
         sit-down table service, (iii) a KFC restaurant, and (iv) a Papa Gino's
         restaurant (provided the same continues to operate with substantially the
         same categories of menu items as now apply to its stores and franchisees
         generally).

         The parties sign the contract, the Pantera café opens, and it becomes
successful. Subsequently, Shopping Center is approached by Adoba, a national chain
of "Mexican Grills" that serve various items in a café-style setting that does not
involve sit-down table service. On learning of these discussions, Panera's protests,
claiming that burritos, tacos, and quesadillas are "sandwiches" and that they account
for more than 10 percent of Adoba's sales. Pantera's sues, asking for an injunction
against its claimed violation of the lease. What result and why?

Problem 18.2

         Homeowner lives in a coastal community that is sometimes subject to
hurricanes. She has a "homeowner's insurance" policy on her home, issued by
Arcturus Life & Casualty Co., an insurer licensed in Homeowner's state. The
Arcturus policy, a standard form used by many different insurers, provides that it
will cover "direct physical loss to structures on the property" from any cause, except
for "excluded perils." Among the list of "excluded perils" is:

         Damage from . . . flood, surface water, waves, tidal water, overflow of a
         body of water, or spray from any of these, whether or not driven by wind.

______________________________________________________________________________

UNIT 18: THE INTERPRETIVE TOOLBOX  379
         When Hurricane Rubin strikes the local community, the storm causes a breach
in the levee system that protects the community. A storm surge inundates the
neighborhood and Homeowner's house is destroyed. Homeowner argues that the levee
was negligently designed and maintained, and that her loss was caused by this
negligence, not by the storm. Arcturus argues that the levees were wrecked by "tidal
water" and "wind" and that the house was inundated by water, which by definition
means "flood." Is the loss covered by Arcturus's policy? Why or why not?

Problem 18.3

         Giada has negotiated a restaurant lease with Lessor to open her new
restaurant. The restaurant has both gas and electric lines running into it, and at the
time the building is leased it has a non-functional and non-repairable gas cooking
range. The lease provides:

                  The Lessor shall furnish free to and for the use of the Lessee in
         connection with the use and occupancy of the premises, herein demised,
         electric power, electric light, heat, electric light bulbs . . . . but [Giada] shall
         pay for all gas or fuel used in the preparation of food.

         Giada installs a new electric range and various microwave and electric
convection ovens. When Lessor gets the electric bill, it refuses to pay for the electricity
used in cooking because it is "fuel used in the preparation of food."

         What are the arguments both parties could raise on interpreting that phrase?
Is either side's position stronger than the other's?

Problem 18.4

         Delta Barge Co. is a company in the business of transporting bulk cargoes
(grain, coal, stone, bulk chemicals, scrap metal, etc.) on the Mississippi River through
its fleet of barges and tugboats. Delta has a policy of insurance with Inland Marine
Insurance that covers its barges and cargoes. The policy specifically excludes coverage
for loss caused by "fire or explosion," but covers all losses resulting from "perils of the
river." When one its barges, carrying tanks of kerosene, accidentally rams a sunken
obstruction, it begins to take on water. Worse, the accident ruptures the kerosene
tanks and the liquid spills out, catching fire. Ultimately one of the kerosene tanks
explodes, destroying the barge and all its cargo. Delta files a claim, which Inland
denies. Is the loss covered by the Inland policy?

__________________________________________________________________

                     Conditions

                     FOCUS OF THIS UNIT

         Conditional Obligations. Parties to contracts make promises that they will do
things. But sometimes those promises are supposed to be performed only if something
happens to trigger a duty. Suppose, for example, you buy a single-premium life
insurance policy, which costs you $100,000 but will pay your estate $2 million
whenever you die. You, the insured, have no obligation to die. But the insurance
company has no obligation to pay money to your estate until you do. The contract is
in force, and you have fully performed, but the insurer's duty is conditional on the
occurrence of your death. If for some reason you to manage to live forever, the contract
will last forever but you will never get the money. The best way to think of conditions
is as triggers to obligations that occur within contracts.

         Two broad categories of conditions exist: express and implied. In both, the party
refusing to perform claims its duty was never triggered because the other party did
not satisfy the condition. The party seeking performance may claim variously that (1)
properly interpreted, the claimed condition is not a condition at all; (2) that there is
a condition, but it was in fact complied with; (3) even if the condition was not strictly
complied with, there is a good excuse for not doing so; or (4) some or all of the above.

         Spotting Express Conditions. You can often recognize express conditions by
phrases like "if . . . then," "provided that," "upon the occurrence of," and the like. The
established hornbook law, repeated by many courts, is that express conditions like
these must be complied with strictly. But, as you will also see in this unit, there are
ways that a party can get by with something less than strict compliance.

         Unseen Implied Conditions. Implied or constructive conditions are those read
into the contract by courts, in much the same way as other implied terms. Conditions
are usually implied when it appears that the parties intended that performance occur
in a particular sequence. The leading English case is Kingston v. Preston, 99 Eng.
Rep. 437 (K.B. 1773), which involved the sale of a business. The seller agreed to
convey the business, and the buyer agreed to put up a bond to ensure payment for

______________________________________________________________________________

UNIT 19: CONDITIONS                      381
the business. The contract was silent, however, as to which was supposed to happen
first. The King's Bench held that, by the nature of things, the seller should not have
to convey the business until after the bond had been posted--to do it the other way
around would have been absurd, as the whole point of the bond was to protect the
seller.

         Courts tend to be rather cautious about implying conditions, but when it seems
clear that the parties must have intended that one performance be contingent on
another, they will do so.

         Sections 224 through 230 of the Restatement (Second) of Contracts attempt to
distill the common--and common law--rules regarding conditions. Reviewing those
sections could provide you some helpful context. As with all sections of the
Restatement, we caution you be careful not to take these as stating exclusive or
universal rules on point. As with all areas of judge-made common law, only the case
authority from that jurisdiction is controlling. Thus, you should always read cases
carefully to determine any state's actual version of a legal rule.

          Court of Appeals of Texas, Fourteenth District--Houston
                               2003 Tex. App. LEXIS 9185

LESLIE BROCK YATES, J.:

         [North Houston International owned an office building, and sought a
commercial mortgage on the property from Paine Webber Real Estate Investments
("PW"). PW and North Houston subsequently entered into a letter agreement for a
loan commitment, and North Houston paid PW $45,000 to cover its application fee
and expenses in the process. The Commitment Letter expressly required that North
Houston obtain estoppel certificates1 from all tenants, including the building's anchor

          1 [When lender is refinancing the mortgage on a building that is leased to another, the lender
wants to be sure there are no hidden problems with the lease that might allow the tenant to pay less
or escape the lease entirely--which might endanger the lender's chance of getting repaid. The lender
wants to be aware of any disputes between owner and tenant, of any alleged modifications to the lease,
of the amount of prepaid rent, and so forth. Thus, commercial leases usually provide that tenants, on
proper request from the landlord, must execute an "estoppel certificate" covering such issues. These
certificates state that the lender is entitled to rely on the tenant's representations, and that the tenant
thus would be estopped from raising these arguments later.--Eds.]

tenant, the U.S. Customs Service. Unfortunately, when North Houston agreed to
provide these certificates it was unaware of 48 C.F.R. § 552.270-24, which prohibits
federal agencies and employees from signing estoppel certificates. North Houston
instead provided uncertified letters from the Custom Services confirming that the
leases were in effect. PW refused to close and fund the loan, and refused to return
North Houston's money on the basis that North Houston did not provide the estoppel
certificate.]

         The parties are in agreement that the choice-of-law provision in the
Commitment Letter dictates that New York substantive law applies to North
Houston's claims based on construction and enforcement of the contract.

         This lawsuit revolves around express conditions precedent2 in the parties'
Commitment Letter. As the movant for summary judgment, PW had the burden to
produce conclusive summary judgment evidence that proved North Houston failed to
comply with a condition precedent in the Commitment Letter, thereby relieving PW
of the obligation to fund the loan. Where contractual language is plain on its face, it
should be so construed as a matter of law in the summary judgment context.

         Two conditions precedent in the Commitment Letter are at issue. The first one,
under the heading of "Closing Requirements," reads, in pertinent part, as follows:

         PaineWebber shall not be obligated to close or fund the Mortgage Loan unless
         and until PaineWebber has received the following, at the sole cost and expense of
         Borrower: . . .

         H. At PaineWebber's request, Borrower shall deliver, prior to closing and from time
         to time thereafter, estoppel certificates in form and substance satisfactory to
         PaineWebber, from all tenants under then existing commercial leases covering
         any portion of the property which PaineWebber in its discretion designates.

         The first addendum to the Commitment Letter adds, as a condition precedent,
the following: "Subject to the receipt and review of an estoppel showing U.S. Customs
paying the full new rental amount of $461,608 annually on 31,835 square feet."

Pursuant to the Commitment Letter's express terms, PW and North Houston, both
sophisticated parties with experience in commercial real estate transactions, agreed
that North Houston's performance of these conditions was a prerequisite to the
funding of the loan. Giving these conditions precedent their plain meaning (neither

unless the condition is excused, must occur before a duty to perform a promise in the agreement

see also Lindenbaum v. Royco Prop. Corp., 567 N.Y.S.2d 218, 220 (Sup. Ct. App. Div. 1991). "Express
conditions are those agreed to and imposed by the parties themselves. [Generally, such] conditions
must be literally performed." Oppenheimer, 660 N.E.2d at 418. The parties do not dispute that the
conditions in the Commitment Letter were express conditions.

party argues ambiguity), the loan funding was contingent upon North Houston
delivering tenant estoppel certificates in form and substance satisfactory to PW, and,
in particular, showing the U.S. Customs Service paying the full new rental amount
and leasing the specified square footage. See Facilities Dev. Corp. v. Nautilus Constr.
Corp., 550 N.Y.S.2d 127, 128 (App. Div. 1989) (noting that a condition precedent
exists when the contract shows an intent by the parties to have one party's
performance precede any obligation by the other party). Without the required
estoppel certificate from the U.S. Customs Service, PW had no obligation to close or
fund the mortgage loan.

         Here, Scott Leitman, a PW employee, testified in his affidavit that, to the best
of his knowledge, North Houston did not provide an estoppel certificate showing the
U.S. Customs Service in occupancy paying the full new rental amount of $461,608
annually on 31,835 square feet. North Houston argues that the U.S. Customs Service
could not have supplied that information in its statement of lease due to
governmental regulations.

         In its first issue, North Houston contends the two letters from the U.S.
Customs Service addressed to it and forwarded to PW, coupled with the U.S. Customs
leases that PW had received and approved, satisfy the conditions precedent or at least
raise a fact question regarding North Houston's compliance. We disagree. The express
terms of the Commitment Letter required North Houston to produce to PW an
estoppel certificate from the U.S. Customs Service with the full amount of rent and
the total amount of leased square footage. Because the terms are express, PW is not
required to waive them or accept other forms of documentation to satisfy them. See,
e.g., Preferred Mortgage Brokers, Inc. v. Byfield, 723 N.Y.S.2d 230, 231 (Sup. Ct. App.
Div. 2001) (holding that when an express condition precedent is not met, the other
party is not obligated to perform).

                                           _____________________

         Review Question 1. Shouldn't North Houston have been excused from
performing the condition precedent of obtaining an estoppel certificate from its
largest tenant based on the legal impossibility of fulfilling the condition? If not, then
what lessons does this case hold for future lawyers (like you) who may one day be
drafting documents in a real estate transaction?

         Review Question 2. Neither of the parties in North Houston International
disputed the fact that the estoppel certificates were express conditions. Read the
definition in Restatement (Second) of Contracts § 224 and see if you can explain why
no one argued the point.

         Review Question 3. In the famous case of Clark v. West that follows, the
parties--unlike those in North Houston International--do not agree whether the
promises in question were conditional. As you read Clark, can you understand (and

not) a condition of his payment?

                                     193 N.Y. 349, 86 N.E. 1 (1908)

         On February 12th, 1900, the plaintiff [Clark] and defendant [West] entered
into a written contract under which the former was to write and prepare for
publication for the latter a series of law books the compensation for which was
provided in the contract.3 After the plaintiff had completed a three-volume work
known as Clark & Marshall on Corporations, the parties disagreed. The plaintiff
claimed that the defendant had broken the contract. The defendant demurred to the
complaint on the ground that it did not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of
action. The Special Term overruled the demurrer, but upon appeal to the Appellate
Division, that decision was reversed and the demurrer sustained.

         Those portions of the contract which are germane to the present stage of the
controversy are as follows: The plaintiff agreed to write a series of books relating to
specified legal subjects; the manuscript furnished by him was to be satisfactory to the
defendant; the plaintiff was not to write or edit anything that would interfere with
the sale of books to be written by him under the contract and he was not to write any
other books unless requested so to do by the defendant, in which latter event he was
to be paid $3,000 a year. The contract contained a clause which provided that

         The first party (the plaintiff) agrees to totally abstain from the use of intoxicating
         liquors during the continuance of this contract, and that the payment to him in

3 [William Lawrence Clark, Jr., was one of the most successful legal treatise writers of all time.

He started publishing with John Briggs West, the 8th-grade-educated former grocery clerk and

traveling salesman who--while still living in his parents' house--founded West Publishing Co. West

revolutionized legal practice, creating the North Western Reporter (and the subsequent National

Reporter System) in 1877 and the American Digest System (with its revolutionary key numbers) ten

years later. West expanded into legal treatises, and Clark was hired to write West's first "Hornbooks"

on Criminal Law and Criminal Procedure, which at $3.75 each--then about the average day's wage

for a male teacher--sold like hotcakes to American law students. In 1894, West published Clark on

Contracts, which also became very popular, and also Clark on Corporations. In 1899 Clark was hired

as a law professor at Washington & Lee University, but after engaging in what seems to have been a

course of unusually public drunkenness, he was fired after only a month or two. (His antics at W&L

were apparently notable enough that his firing was noted in newspapers as far away as Baltimore and

New York.) Meanwhile, John West had abruptly left West Publishing in 1899 and had launched a new

venture, Keefe-Davidson Law Book Co. West was looking for authors, and Clark was looking for

income. West wanted Clark to come over to Keefe-Davidson to write a new edition of an earlier Keefe-

Davidson book, Marshall on Corporations.--Eds.]

         accordance with the terms of this contract of any money in excess of $2 per page
         is dependent on the faithful performance of this as well as the other conditions of
         this contract.

In a later paragraph it further recited that,

         In consideration of the above promises of the first party (the plaintiff), the second
         party (the defendant) agrees to pay to the first party $2 per page, on each book
         prepared by the first party under this contract and accepted by the second party,
         and if said first party abstains from the use of intoxicating liquor and otherwise
         fulfills his agreements as hereinbefore set forth, he shall be paid an additional $4
         per page in manner hereinbefore stated.

         [The contract further provided for progress payments at the $2 level upon
delivery of every 125 pages, not to exceed $250 a month. If the final manuscript was
acceptable to West and were published, Clark would be paid 1/6 of the net receipts of
the books until he reached the level of $6 a page, at which point he would get no
further royalties.]

         The plaintiff in his complaint alleges completion of the work on corporations
and publication thereof by the defendant; the sale of many copies thereof from which
the defendant received large net receipts; the number of pages it contained (3,469),
for which he had been paid at the rate of $2 per page, amounting to $6,938; and that
defendant has refused to pay him any sum over and above that amount, or any sum
in excess of $2 per page. Full performance of the agreement on plaintiff's part is
alleged, except that he "did not totally abstain from the use of intoxicating liquor
during the continuance of said contract, but such use by the plaintiff was not
excessive and did not prevent or interfere with the due and full performance by the
plaintiff of all the other stipulations in said contract." The complaint further alleges
a waiver on the part of the defendant of the plaintiff's stipulation to totally abstain
from the use of intoxicating liquors,

WERNER, J.

         The contract before us, stripped of all superfluous verbiage, binds the plaintiff
to total abstention from the use of intoxicating liquors during the continuance of the
work which he was employed to do. The stipulations relating to the plaintiff's
compensation provide that if he does not observe this condition he is to be paid at the
rate of $2 per page, and if he does comply therewith he is to receive $6 per page. The
plaintiff has written one book under the contract known as "Clark & Marshall on
Corporations," which has been accepted, published and copies sold in large numbers
by the defendant. The plaintiff admits that while he was at work on this book he did
not entirely abstain from the use of intoxicating liquors. He has been paid only $2 per
page for the work he has done. He claims that, despite his breach of this condition,
he is entitled to the full compensation of $6 per page because the defendant, with full
knowledge of plaintiff's non-observance of this stipulation as to total abstinence, has
waived the breach thereof and cannot now insist upon strict performance in this

______________________________________________________________________________

386         CHAPTER VI: TERMS AND INTERPRETATION
regard. This plea of waiver presents the underlying question which determines the
answers to the questions certified.

         Briefly stated, the defendant's position is that the stipulation as to plaintiff's
total abstinence is the consideration for the payment of the difference between $2 and
$6 per page and therefore could not be waived except by a new agreement to that
effect based upon a good consideration; that the so-called waiver alleged by the
plaintiff is not a waiver but a modification of the contract in respect of its
consideration. The plaintiff on the other hand argues that the stipulation for his total
abstinence was merely a condition precedent intended to work a forfeiture of the
additional compensation in case of a breach and that it could be waived without any
formal agreement to that effect based upon a new consideration.

         The compensation for the work specified in the contract was to be $6 per page,
unless the plaintiff failed to totally abstain from the use of intoxicating liquors during
the continuance of the contract, in which event he was to receive only $2 per page.
That is the obvious import of the contract construed in the light of the purpose for
which it was made, and in accordance with the ordinary meaning of plain language.
It is not a contract to write books in order that the plaintiff shall keep sober, but a
contract containing a stipulation that he shall keep sober so that he may write
satisfactory books. When we view the contract from this standpoint it will readily be
perceived that the particular stipulation is not the consideration for the contract, but
simply one of its conditions which fits in with those relating to time and method of
delivery of manuscript, revision of proof, citation of cases, assignment of copyrights,
keeping track of new cases and citations for new editions, and other details which
might be waived by the defendant, if he saw fit to do so. This is made clear, it seems
to us, by the provision that, "In consideration of the above promises," the defendant
agrees to pay the plaintiff $2 per page on each book prepared by him, and if he
"abstains from the use of intoxicating liquor and otherwise fulfills his agreements as
hereinbefore set forth, he shall be paid an additional $4 per page in manner
hereinbefore stated." The compensation of $2 per page, not to exceed $250 per month,
was an advance or partial payment of the whole price of $6 per page, and the payment
of the two-thirds which was to be withheld pending the performance of the contract,
was simply made contingent upon the plaintiff's total abstention from the use of
intoxicants during the life of the contract. It is obvious that the parties thought that
the plaintiff's normal work was worth $6 per page. That was the sum to be paid for
the work done by the plaintiff and not for total abstinence. If the plaintiff did not keep
to the condition as to total abstinence, he was to lose part of that sum. Precisely the
same situation would have risen if the plaintiff had disregarded any of the other
essential conditions of the contract. The fact that the particular stipulation was
emphasized did not change its character. It was still a condition which the defendant
could have insisted upon, as he has apparently done in regard to some others, and
one which he could waive just as he might have waived those relating to the amount

______________________________________________________________________________

UNIT 19: CONDITIONS  387
of the advance payments, or the number of pages to be written each month. This, we
think, is the fair interpretation of the contract, and it follows that the stipulation as
to the plaintiff's total abstinence was nothing more nor less than a condition
precedent. If that conclusion is well founded there can be no escape from the corollary
that this condition could be waived; and if it was waived the defendant is clearly not
in a position to insist upon the forfeiture which his waiver was intended to annihilate.
The forfeiture must stand or fall with the condition. If the latter was waived, the
former is no longer a part of the contract. Defendant still has the right to counterclaim
for any damages which he may have sustained in consequence of the plaintiff's
breach, but he cannot insist upon strict performance.

         This whole discussion is predicated of course upon the theory of an express
waiver. We assume that no waiver could be implied from the defendant's mere
acceptance of the books and his payment of the sum of $2 per page without objection.
It was the defendant's duty to pay that amount in any event after acceptance of the
work. The plaintiff must stand upon his allegation of an express waiver and if he fails
to establish that he cannot maintain his action.

         The theory upon which the defendant's attitude seems to be based is that even
if he has represented to the plaintiff that he would not insist upon the condition that
the latter should observe total abstinence from intoxicants, he can still refuse to pay
the full contract price for his work. The inequity of this position becomes apparent
when we consider that this contract was to run for a period of years, during a large
portion of which the plaintiff was to be entitled only to the advance payment of $2 per
page, the balance being contingent, among other things, upon publication of the books
and returns from sales. Upon this theory the defendant might have waived the
condition while the first book was in process of production, and yet when the whole
work was completed, he would still be in a position to insist upon the forfeiture
because there had not been strict performance. Such a situation is possible in a case
where the subject of the waiver is the very consideration of a contract but not where
the waiver relates to something that can be waived. In the case at bar, as we have
seen, the waiver is not of the consideration or subject-matter, but of an incident to
the method of performance. The consideration remains the same. The defendant has
had the work he bargained for, and it is alleged that he has waived one of the
conditions as to the manner in which it was to have been done. He might have insisted
upon literal performance and then he could have stood upon the letter of his contract.
If, however, he has waived that incidental condition, he has created a situation to
which the doctrine of waiver very precisely applies.

         A waiver has been defined to be the intentional relinquishment of a known
right. It is voluntary and implies an election to dispense with something of value, or
forego some advantage which the party waiving it might at its option have demanded
or insisted upon. 2 HENRY M. HERMAN, COMMENTARIES ON THE LAW OF ON ESTOPPEL

definition is supported by many cases in this and other states. See, e.g. Draper v.
Oswego County Fire Relief Assn., 82 N.E. 755 (N.Y. 1907),

         It remains to be determined whether the plaintiff has alleged facts which, if
proven, will be sufficient to establish his claim of an express waiver by the defendant
of the plaintiff's breach of the condition to observe total abstinence. In the 12th
paragraph of the complaint, the plaintiff alleges facts and circumstances which we
think, if established, would prove defendant's waiver of plaintiff's performance of that
contract stipulation. These facts and circumstances are that long before the plaintiff
had completed the manuscript of the first book undertaken under the contract, the
defendant had full knowledge of the plaintiff's non-observance of that stipulation, and
that with such knowledge he not only accepted the completed manuscript without
objection, but repeatedly avowed and represented to the plaintiff that he was entitled
to and would receive said royalty payments (i.e., the additional $4 per page), and
plaintiff believed and relied upon such representations and at all times during the
writing of said treatise on corporations, and after as well as before publication thereof
as aforesaid, it was mutually understood, agreed and intended by the parties hereto
that notwithstanding plaintiff's said use of intoxicating liquors, he was nevertheless
entitled to receive and would receive said royalty as the same accrued under said
contract.

         The demurrer not only admits the truth of these allegations, but also all that
can by reasonable and fair intendment be implied therefrom. We think it cannot be
doubted that the allegations contained in the 12th paragraph of the complaint, if
proved upon the trial, would be sufficient to establish an express waiver by the
defendant of the stipulation in regard to plaintiff's total abstinence.4

                               437 Pa. Super. 41, 648 A.2d 1218 (1994)

HESTER, J:

         Acme Markets, Inc., appeals from the order entered in the Court of Common
Pleas of Montgomery County on December 21, 1993, which granted Federal Armored
Express, Inc. summary judgment. For the reasons set forth below, we reverse that
order and remand the matter for further proceedings.

         [Federal supplied armored-car services to Acme, for the transportation of
Acme's receipts to its bank. One day in the regular course of business Federal's
armored car arrived at the Acme store. A Federal employee entered and was handed
$62,544 in a "cashbag." The Federal employee took the cash and started to leave the
store, but was robbed before he could do so. The contract provided that Federal would
be liable for any robbery after the money had been received and a receipt had been
issued. Acme demanded that Federal cover the loss. Federal refused. Acme sued. Both
parties moved for summary judgment.]

         The fifth paragraph of the agreement provides, "Responsibility of Federal
under this contract shall begin when said [cash]bags or packages have been accepted
and receipted for by Federal or its authorized employees, and shall terminate upon
delivery to consignee or upon return to shipper." Federal claimed that it bore no
responsibility for the loss since neither it nor any of its employees had accepted the
bag or provided the necessary receipt prior to the robbery.

         Federal acknowledged that one of its employees possessed appellant's cashbag
at the time of the robbery. In addition, Federal noted that neither party disputed the
fact that the employee in question had not provided a receipt for the bag prior to its
loss. Consequently, relying upon both the fifth paragraph of the agreement and an
affidavit demonstrating that the receipt requirement conformed with the custom of
the armored car industry, Federal requested the entrance of judgment in its favor.
On December 21, 1993, the trial court concluded that the fifth paragraph constituted
a condition precedent to Federal's liability under the agreement. Thus, the court
denied appellant's summary judgment motion and granted Federal relief. This timely
appeal followed.

         Appellant asserts that the trial court erroneously concluded that the fifth
paragraph of the agreement constituted a condition precedent to Federal's liability

______________________________________________________________________________

390         CHAPTER VI: TERMS AND INTERPRETATION
for the lost bag. Specifically, appellant argues that since the paragraph was not
labeled a condition precedent and does not contain other language normally
associated with such a condition, "there is no means by which to state with the
certainty required by Pennsylvania law that it creates a condition precedent." We
find appellant's claim devoid of merit.

         Initially, we note that a condition precedent may be defined as a condition
which must occur before a duty to perform under a contract arises. While the parties
to a contract need not utilize any particular words to create a condition precedent, an
act or event designated in a contract will not be construed as constituting one unless
that clearly appears to have been the parties' intention. In addition, we note that the
purpose of any condition set forth in a contract must be determined in accordance
with the general rules of contractual interpretation. Those rules may be summarized
as follows.

         When construing agreements involving clear and unambiguous terms,
         this Court need only examine the writing itself to give effect to the
         parties' understanding. The court must construe the contract only as
         written and may not modify the plain meaning of the words under the
         guise of interpretation. When the terms of a written contract are clear,
         this Court will not re-write it to give it a construction in conflict with the
         accepted and plain meaning of the language used. Conversely, when the
         language is ambiguous and the intention of the parties cannot be
         reasonably ascertained from the language of the writing alone, the parol
         evidence rule does not apply to the admission of oral testimony to show
         both the intent of the parties and the circumstances attending the
         execution of the contract.

Creeks v. Creeks, 619 A.2d 754, 756 (Pa. Super. Ct. 1993).

         In the present case, the contested paragraph indicates that Federal's
responsibility under the contract "shall begin when bags or packages have been
accepted and receipted for by Federal or its employees." Our reading of this plain
language demonstrates that it clearly and unambiguously conditions Federal's
performance under the contract upon both the acceptance of bags or packages and
the granting of a receipt for them. Thus, it unquestionably delineates a condition
precedent involving those requirements.

         Since we have found that Federal's liability under the contract was subject to
a condition precedent and neither party disputes that the receipt portion of the
condition remained unfulfilled at the time of the robbery, we must determine whether
satisfaction of that requirement may be excused. Apparently arguing that strict
application of the condition would be unfair, appellant asserts that the receipt
requirement was immaterial and could only be seen as incidental to the far more

______________________________________________________________________________

UNIT 19: CONDITIONS  391
significant satisfied requirement of possession and acceptance by Federal's employee
of appellant's property.

         Restatement (Second) of Contracts § 229 discusses the excuse of a condition to
avoid unfairness in connection with its strict enforcement. More specifically, that
section relates to the excuse of a condition leading to a forfeiture, a term referring to
"the denial of compensation that results when the obligee loses his right to the agreed
exchange after he has relied substantially, as by preparation or performance on the
expectation of that exchange." Section 229 provides

     To the extent that the non-occurrence of a condition would cause
     disproportionate forfeiture, a court may excuse the non-occurrence of
     that condition unless its occurrence was a material part of the agreed
     exchange.

         Since Pennsylvania law "abhors forfeitures and penalties and enforces them
with the greatest reluctance when a proper case is presented," Fogel Refrigerator Co.
v. Oteri, 137 A.2d 225, 231 (Pa. 1958), section 229 is consistent with the law of this
Commonwealth. Consequently, we will apply it in the present case.

         There can be little doubt that the operation of the condition in question will
lead to a forfeiture since the condition's nonoccurrence results in the denial of
compensation for the loss of a cashbag possessed by Federal for transportation in
accordance with the contract. Thus, the question becomes whether the forfeiture
would be disproportionate.

     In determining whether the forfeiture is "disproportionate," [the] court
     must weigh the extent of the forfeiture by the obligee against the
     importance to the obligor of the risk from which he sought to be
     protected and the degree to which that protection will be lost if the
     nonoccurrence of the condition is excused to the extent required to
     prevent forfeiture.

Restatement (Second) of Contracts § 229 cmt b.

         In the present case, appellant obviously entered into the armored car service
contract so that it would have a secure method of transporting cash and checks to the
bank. Strict application of the condition precedent would result in the loss of
appellant's ability to recover from Federal for the theft of the bag entrusted to
Federal's care. Moreover, we believe that the receipting requirement was intended to
provide Federal with proof that it accepted, at a specific time, a certain number of
cashbags for shipment. Thus, in our opinion, the requirement probably was little
more than an accounting device designed to track bags picked up in accordance with
the agreement. Under such circumstances, the receipt primarily would serve to
protect Federal rather than Acme from, among other things, theft by its own
employees and disputes regarding the number of bags accepted. Those are two risks
not at issue herein.

         While we believe that the receipt requirement probably was an accounting
device which had little impact upon the situation presently at issue, our examination
of the certified record reveals that it is devoid of any evidence demonstrating the
requirement's actual purpose. Thus, even though we have speculated on the matter,
the record is inadequate to determine whether our speculation is accurate. In view of
the inadequate record, we may not conduct the critical weighing analysis required by
the Restatement or determine whether fulfillment of the condition may be excused.
Indeed, we note that the trial court erroneously believed that its analysis ended upon
concluding that a receipt was required to fulfill the condition precedent. Thus, the
court did not consider whether the forfeiture would be disproportionate, decide if the
receipt requirement constituted a material part of the exchange, or require the
parties to provide an adequate record either for resolving those issues or deciding
whether summary judgment in favor of Federal would be appropriate. Accordingly,
we must reverse the trial court's grant of summary judgment and remand the matter
for further proceedings.

         On remand, the trial court should conduct an evidentiary hearing to determine
the purpose of the receipt requirement and engage in the necessary weighing
analysis. In addition, the court should determine whether the contested requirement
constituted a material part of the agreement. While this determination rests to a
large extent on the analysis of the requirement's purpose, it also involves a
consideration of the negotiations of the parties along with all other circumstances
relevant to the formation of the contract or to the requirement itself, including the
circumstances surrounding the theft.

         Order reversed.  Case remanded for further     proceedings.  Jurisdiction
relinquished.                    _____________________

         Review Question 6. Notice the statement that on remand of the Acme Markets
case, "the trial court should conduct an evidentiary hearing to determine the purpose
of the receipt requirement and engage in the necessary weighing analysis" for
determining whether the forfeiture would be disproportionate. What kinds of
evidence should the lawyers on both sides be tracking down in advance of the
anticipated hearing before the trial judge on remand?

                             TOWN OF FAIRFIELD v. D'ADDARIO
                                     Supreme Court of Connecticut

                                  149 Conn. 358, 179 A.2d 826 (1961)

BALDWIN, C.J.

         The town of Fairfield brought this action against F. Francis D'Addario, doing
business as The D'Addario Construction Company, to recover $5,750, with interest
and attorneys' fees, expended by the town in the settlement of an action for personal
injuries brought against it by Edmund Kant.

         The material findings of the trial court can be stated in summary as follows:
On February 10, 1951, the town entered into a contract with D'Addario to construct
a sewerage system. The contract provided that D'Addario would indemnify the town
against loss or damage arising out of any cause connected with the contract, save the
town harmless from all claims and liability for any loss, damage or injury sustained
by any person by reason of, or in any way arising out of, the contract, and defend any
suit brought against the town by reason of, or connected with, the work or materials
furnished.5 On May 11, 1953, Edmund Kant brought an action against the town to
recover for personal injuries allegedly suffered by him on March 21, 1953, because of
a defective highway in an area where D'Addario had been working. Kant alleged that
the roadway was broken and uneven and contained a deep hole and depression, and
also that a manhole cover was elevated above the road surface. A police investigation
of the alleged occurrence was completed and a report made to the town counsel on or
about May 14, 1953. This report called attention to D'Addario's operations on the
highway and stated that the manhole referred to in Kant's complaint had been
constructed by D'Addario. On June 2, 1953, the town counsel entered an appearance
in court in Kant's action. The town failed to give D'Addario any notice of Kant's claim
or of his suit until June 22, 1956, when the town requested that D'Addario assume
the defense of Kant's action and hold the town harmless from all liability therefor.
On several occasions thereafter, up to February 8, 1957, this request was repeated,
but D'Addario refused. On February 8, 1957, the town stipulated with Kant that in
his action a judgment of $5750 would be entered in his favor.

          5 [By the court:] "The Contractor shall pay and make good all losses or damages arising out of
any cause connected with the Contract and shall indemnify and save harmless the Municipality from
any and all claims and any and all liability or responsibility of every nature and kind for any loss,
damage or injury which any person or persons may sustain or suffer by reason of or in anywise arising
out of the Contract and shall defend every suit of any nature which may be brought against the
Municipality or any of its officers or agents, by reason of, or connected with the work or materials
furnished under the Contract and shall pay all costs and expenses of every kind, character, and nature
whatsoever, accruing upon or arising out of the Contract."

______________________________________________________________________________

394  CHAPTER VI: TERMS AND INTERPRETATION
         On these facts, the court concluded that the Kant action arose out of the
contract between the town and D'Addario, that D'Addario was prejudiced by reason
of the fact that the town did not notify him of the Kant action until three years had
elapsed, and that the notice given then was not given within a reasonable time.
Judgment was rendered for D'Addario, and the town has appealed.

         The crucial questions in the case are (1) whether the town was required, under
the terms of the indemnity provision, to give any notice of Kant's action to D'Addario,
and (2) whether, if it was, the notice given was timely.

         The agreement contains no specific language requiring the town to give
D'Addario notice of any action brought against it which it might claim arose out of
the contract. But the parties could not have contemplated otherwise than that such
notice would be given. The construction of the sewerage system was a broad
undertaking necessitating the disturbance of highways for which the town was
responsible. If the town was to have the full measure of protection which the
indemnity provision afforded and D'Addario was to have the opportunity of effectively
discharging his part of the obligation, notice to him was indispensable. "Conditions
upon which the right to require performance of a contract obligation depends may
often be implied where not to do so would defeat the clear intention of the parties and
the object of the contract." Rifkin v. Safenovitz, 415, 40 A.2d 188 (Conn. 1944). The
circumstances under which the contract was made, as well as all the other provisions
of the contract, are determinative factors in ascertaining intent. Avco Manufacturing.
Corp. v. Connelly, 140 A.2d 479 (Conn. 1958).

         The indemnity provision of this contract contemplated that suits might be
brought against the town for highway defects which it could claim were caused by
D'Addario. The town would have peculiar knowledge of these suits and therefore was
obligated to notify D'Addario of them. It can be fairly implied that the giving of
reasonable notice was a condition precedent to D'Addario's duty to defend and
indemnify. 3 SAMUEL WILLISTON, THE LAW OF CONTRACTS § 887B (rev. ed. 1936).
Furthermore, when a party to a contract assumes an express obligation to do certain
things--in this case, to defend and indemnify the plaintiff--the law implies a
corresponding obligation on the other party to allow him all reasonable opportunity
to perform. Rockwell v. New Departure Manufacturing Co., 128 A. 302 (Conn. 1926).
The cooperation required may be, as in the instant case, the giving of timely notice.
3A ARTHUR L. CORBIN, CORBIN ON CONTRACTS 386 (1950); 3 WILLISTON, supra, § 887B.

         Kant sued the town on May 11, 1953. The town did not inform D'Addario of the
suit until June 22, 1956. He was entitled to employ his own counsel to investigate the
facts and prepare his defense. He was not, as the town claims, required to accept a
report, made to it three years before, of an investigation by its police department. An
independent investigation by D'Addario three years after the occurrence would have
been of little, if any, use in the defense against Kant's claims as to either liability or

______________________________________________________________________________

UNIT 19: CONDITIONS  395
damages. The notice of Kant's action came altogether too late to be called reasonable.
That term is a relative one. Its meaning is affected by the circumstances under which
it is called into use. E. M. Loew's Enterprises, Inc. v. Surabian, 153 A.2d 463 (1959).
The notice was not timely in this case. The court did not err in rendering judgment
for D'Addario.

         There is no error.

                                           _____________________

         Review Question 7. "Notice" is a condition precedent common to many
contracts, including in many liability insurance policies. To what extent is a
requirement of notice a trap for the unwary rather than an independently valuable
right for the party with the right to be put on notice? Read UCC § 2-607 for a statutory
example of notice as a condition precedent to a breach of contract claim. As a
malpractice-avoiding lawyer handling contracts cases, should you be more afraid of
section 2-607 or of the general breach-of-contract statute of limitations (which is
commonly four years following accrual of the claim)?

         Nephew, who is 18, has been admitted to several colleges but is thinking about
bypassing college to become a pottery maker. Uncle promises Nephew that if he in
fact goes to college instead, and graduates, Uncle will give him $50,000. He adds that
if Nephew graduates from Uncle's alma mater, Hearst College (where he has been
admitted), he will give him $100,000. Nephew decides to enroll at Hearst, but does
not like it and transfers to the University of California, Sunnydale. Uncle makes no
objection to him switching schools, instead telling him that Hearst "may not be for
everybody." Nephew graduates from UC Sunnydale, whereupon Uncle gives him
$50,000. Nephew asks for the whole $100,000, claiming that Uncle waived the
condition. What result and why?

Problem 19.2

         Owner hires Architect to design and supervise construction of a small office
building. Architect prepares the necessary plans and specifications. Owner hires
Contractor at a total bid of $8 million to build the project. The Owner-Contractor
agreement specifies that Contractor will take its instructions from Architect on the
project. It also provides that three quarters of the total contract price will be paid out

______________________________________________________________________________

396           CHAPTER VI: TERMS AND INTERPRETATION
in progress payments during construction. The remaining one quarter will be paid
after the conclusion of construction, "upon issuance of a written certificate by the
Architect that all work has been done in full conformance with all plans and
specifications and meets all contract requirements, such determination to be made
solely by Architect." The contract also says that "materials may be substituted for
those specified only with prior written approval of Architect."

         The contract required that all pipe used in the building be a particular brand
of high-quality pipe called "Reading." Contractor instead uses "Kohler" brand pipe,
which is generally considered to be equivalent. Architect does not learn of this until
construction is complete and all of the pipe is buried inside the walls. Architect
refuses to give a certificate, insisting that the work does not conform to her plans.

         Contractor demands the remaining $2 million payment from Owner. Owner
refuses to pay Contractor until Contractor presents Architect's certificate, which
Architect refuses to give unless the pipe is replaced. Replacing the pipe will require
demolition of much of the foundation and walls. Contractor sues. How will each side
argue in favor of its preferred interpretation? Who has the better argument?

Problem 19.3

         Sarah Bellum is a brilliant young legal scholar who is being recruited to teach
at Cosmopolitan University School of Law. Sarah signs a contract to begin teaching
at CUSL at an annual salary of $300,000. The contract provides that Sarah's
employment will begin on August 1. It goes on to provide:

Prior to [August 1], the Employee [Sarah] shall provide to the Administration all
documentation and other materials necessary to demonstrate that (1) he/she is an
American citizen or otherwise authorized to engage in lawful employment in the
United States; (2) he/she possesses a Juris Doctorate degree from an American
Bar Association-accredited law school or an equivalent foreign law degree; and (3)
he/she has been admitted to the practice of law in at least one American or foreign
jurisdiction.

         The contract also provides that no modification to the contract may be made
except in writing signed by Sarah and by the Human Resources Vice President of
Cosmopolitan U.

         As of August 1, Sarah, who has been doing a lecture tour in the Far East, fails
to supply any of these documents. She is, in fact, an American citizen, earned her J.D.
with high honors from a top school, and is a member of the bar, and CUSL's hiring
committee has no reason to doubt those facts, but there is no documentation in the
file.

         On August 2, the Human Resources Vice President at CU notifies Sarah that
the contract is terminated since she did not get her documents in by August 1. Sarah,

who had turned down lucrative offers from many other elite schools--where it is now
too late to get a job for the year--sues. It becomes apparent that the reason that
Sarah's contract was terminated was because the CU administration had discovered
a massive budget shortfall and that it no longer wanted to pay Sarah under the
contract. What result and why?

                                           FOCUS OF THIS UNIT

         By now you should understand the concept that what most non-lawyers think
of as "the contract"--the written document--is only part of the larger "agreement"
between the parties. Furthermore, this agreement is only part of that total web of
obligations that lawyers call "the contract." As you saw in the discussion of the parol
evidence rule, oral terms agreed to by the parties may be part of the deal alongside
the written contract document. But can terms become part of a contract if the parties
have never addressed them at all? The answer, perhaps surprisingly, is yes. Two
broad categories of "implied" terms exist that courts will insert into contracts even
when the parties have not expressly agreed to them.

         Terms Implied from the Parties' Deal. It is axiomatic in modern contracts law
that all contracts are, in some fashion, "incomplete." That is, it would be extremely
time-consuming and probably impossible to address, in advance, every possible issue
that might someday come up under the contract. Certain things that the parties did
not bother to discuss would almost certainly have been included in their contract if
they had been asked about it. If, to take a simple example, a buyer in Manhattan
purchases something from a seller in Brooklyn for "$5,000," the "$" almost certainly
is intended to refer to United States dollars, and not those of, say, Canada or
Singapore. Although the parties never specified United States dollars, courts and
other readers of the contract infer from the circumstances that this is what they
meant. A contract for a restaurant meal likewise almost certainly implies a promise
by the restaurant that its food is not poisonous; a contract for a new computer implies
a promise that the item will actually work when it is delivered. Here is a classic
formulation of implied terms by one British judge:

         Prima facie that which in any contract is left to be implied and need not
         be expressed is something so obvious that it goes without saying; so that,
         if, while the parties were making their bargain, an officious bystander

UNIT 20: IMPLIED TERMS  399
     were to suggest some express provision for it in their agreement, they
     would testily suppress him with a common "Oh, of course!"

Southern Foundries (1926) Ltd v Shirlaw, [1939] 2 K.B. 206, 227. This definition is
an unusually narrow one, as you may notice upon reading the materials below, but
the basic idea is clear enough. If the parties would reasonably have expected an
unstated term to be part of their agreement, that term will be part of the contract.

         Terms Implied from Trade Custom. Many times parties to a contract are part
of a trade or business culture where the members share certain understandings and
have particular ways of doing things. Members of the building trades, for example,
understand that when they specify "2 x 4 lumber" they actually mean lumber that is
1.5 inches by 3.5 inches; members of the precious metals trade know that when they
specify "one ounce" of gold they mean one troy ounce, which is smaller than the
everyday English system's avoirdupois ounce of sixteen to a pound used outside the
arena of precious metals and gemstones. Parties in a particular trade are assumed to
operate again the background of all this trade usage and thus can be assumed to
understand that their contract includes the ordinary terms that are usual in the
trade. If parties wish to avoid trade usage terms, they must do so explicitly.

         Default Terms Implied by Law. In many situations, the parties have not
addressed an issue, but we do not know what terms these two parties would obviously
have chosen. For example, suppose A contracts to buy B's car. The parties have not
specified whether the buyer is supposed to pick it up or the seller is supposed to
deliver it. We cannot infer what they each actually intended, and they may now even
disagree about what they intended. Nonetheless, if the seller fails to deliver the car
and the buyer sues, a tribunal will have to decide the issue. In this situation, contract
law has developed what are variously called "background" terms, "gap-filler" terms,
or "default" terms. A default term in contract law--analogous to the default setting
on a computer program--is a term that applies unless the parties elect otherwise.
Thus, in the hypothetical above, the default rule is that when the parties have not
specified otherwise in a sale of goods, the buyer would be responsible for picking up
the car, and thus the seller has no obligation to deliver it. See UCC § 2-308(a) ("Unless
otherwise agreed . . . the place for delivery of the goods is the seller's place . . . .").
Scores of these type of default terms exist in contract law.

         Default terms in American law are generally set to mimic what most
contracting parties would presumably want in most transactions. There is
considerable scholarly debate about whether this is a good approach to the problem,
and your professor may want to explore the issue with you in more detail. Assuming,
however, that the defaults are set correctly, this system has the advantage of being
more likely (though not certain) to carry out the intent of the particular parties to the
dispute. If you consider the way purchasers usually buy things, for example, you will
probably notice that most of the time the buyer picks things up from the seller.
Getting things delivered is less common, and therefore a rule that specifies buyer

______________________________________________________________________________

400  CHAPTER VI: TERMS AND INTERPRETATION
pickup will likely fit a larger range of contracts. Parties who want delivery can change
the default rule by specifying delivery to the buyer. Thus, when a consumer buys
goods online, the contract usually includes an express promise that the seller will
deliver, either for free or for an additional charge.

         These default terms are sometimes developed by courts as part of the common
law, but are often set by statutes and treaties like the UCC and the CISG. Realize,
however that there are a host of state and federal statutes that also create obligations
the parties did not expressly intend.

         Terms Implied by Law as Public Policy. While most implied terms are rooted
in the parties' presumed intent, some terms are implied in law for public policy
reasons. That is, they are terms that courts or statutes put into the parties' contract
not to carry out their actual wishes in their own deal, but to enforce some overarching
policy, such as ensuring contractual fairness or preventing overreaching. Such terms
are imposed even when it is clear that none of the parties had any intention of
including them in the contract. Again, many of these implied terms are statutory (and
there are many such statutory examples in UCC Article 2), but others developed from
case law. Lawyers in practice understand that these kind special rules are out there
and tend to learn them in areas that impact their clients.

     Cases and Materials

WOOD v. LUCY, LADY DUFF-GORDON
         Court of Appeals of New York

       222 N.Y. 88, 118 N.E. 214 (1917)

CARDOZO, J.

         The defendant styles herself "a creator of fashions." Her favor helps a sale.
Manufacturers of dresses, millinery and like articles are glad to pay for a certificate
of her approval. The things which she designs, fabrics, parasols and what not, have a
new value in the public mind when issued in her name. She employed the plaintiff to
help her to turn this vogue into money. He was to have the exclusive right, subject
always to her approval, to place her endorsements on the designs of others. He was
also to have the exclusive right to place her own designs on sale, or to license others
to market them. In return, she was to have one-half of "all profits and revenues"
derived from any contracts he might make. The exclusive right was to last at least
one year from April 1, 1915, and thereafter from year to year unless terminated by

______________________________________________________________________________

UNIT 20: IMPLIED TERMS                   401
notice of ninety days. The plaintiff says that he kept the contract on his part, and that
the defendant broke it. She placed her indorsement on fabrics, dresses and millinery
without his knowledge, and withheld the profits. He sues her for the damages, and
the case comes here on demurrer.

         The agreement of employment is signed by both parties. It has a wealth of
recitals. The defendant insists, however, that it lacks the elements of a contract. She
says that the plaintiff does not bind himself to anything. It is true that he does not
promise in so many words that he will use reasonable efforts to place the defendant's
endorsements and market her designs. We think, however, that such a promise is
fairly to be implied. The law has outgrown its primitive stage of formalism when the
precise word was the sovereign talisman, and every slip was fatal. It takes a broader
view today. A promise may be lacking, and yet the whole writing may be "instinct
with an obligation," imperfectly expressed. McCall Co. v. Wright, 117 N.Y.S. 775 (Sup.
Ct. App. Div. 1909); Moran v. Standard Oil Co., 105 N.E. 217 (N.Y. 1914). If that is
so, there is a contract.

         The implication of a promise here finds support in many circumstances. The
defendant gave an exclusive privilege. She was to have no right for at least a year to
place her own endorsements or market her own designs except through the agency of
the plaintiff. The acceptance of the exclusive agency was an assumption of its duties.
Phoenix Hermetic Co. v. The Filtrine Manufacturing Co., 150 N.Y.S. 193 (Sup. Ct.
App. Div. 1914). We are not to suppose that one party was to be placed at the mercy
of the other. Hearn v. Stevens, 97 N.Y.S. 566 (Sup. Ct. App. Div. 1906). Many other
terms of the agreement point the same way. We are told at the outset by way of recital
that "the said Otis F. Wood possesses a business organization adapted to the placing
of such endorsements as the said Lucy, Lady Duff-Gordon has approved." The
implication is that the plaintiff's business organization will be used for the purpose
for which it is adapted. But the terms of the defendant's compensation are even more
significant. Her sole compensation for the grant of an exclusive agency is to be one-
half of all the profits resulting from the plaintiff's efforts. Unless he gave his efforts,
she could never get anything. Without an implied promise, the transaction cannot
have such business "efficacy as both parties must have intended that at all events it
should have." The Moorcock, 14 P. D. 64, 68 (C.A. 1889). But the contract does not
stop there. The plaintiff goes on to promise that he will account monthly for all
moneys received by him, and that he will take out all such patents and copyrights
and trademarks as may in his judgment be necessary to protect the rights and articles
affected by the agreement. It is true, of course, as the Appellate Division has said,
that if he was under no duty to try to market designs or to place certificates of
indorsement, his promise to account for profits or take out copyrights would be
valueless. But in determining the intention of the parties, the promise has a value. It
helps to enforce the conclusion that the plaintiff had some duties. His promise to pay
the defendant one-half of the profits and revenues resulting from the exclusive agency
and to render accounts monthly, was a promise to use reasonable efforts to bring

______________________________________________________________________________

profits and revenues into existence. For this conclusion, the authorities are ample.
See, e.g., Wilson v. The Mechanical Orguinette Co., 63 N.E. 550 (N.Y. 1902).

         The judgment of the Appellate Division should be reversed, and the order of
the Special Term affirmed, with costs in the Appellate Division and in this court.

Excerpt from Karl N. Llewellyn, A Lecture on Appellate Advocacy, 29 U. CHI. L.
REV. 627 (1962):

         You must remember that Cardozo was a truly great advocate, and the fact that
he became a great judge didn't at all change the fact that he was a great advocate.
And if you will watch, in the very process of your listening to the facts [of Wood v.
Lucy, Lady Duff-Gordon], you will find two things happening. The one is that . . . you
arrive at the conclusion that the case has to come out one way. And the other is, that
it fits into a legal frame that says, "How comfortable it will be, to bring it out that
way. No trouble at all. No trouble at all."

         [Llewellyn then walks through Cardozo's telling of the case facts.]

         Now, is there any way to bring that case out, except one? Isn't it obvious that
we are going to imply a promise on the part of the plaintiff which will satisfy the
requirement of consideration and the decency of the situation?

         All right, now try this: "The plaintiff in this action rests his case upon his own
carefully prepared form agreement, which has as its first essence his own omission of
any expression whatsoever of any obligation of any kind on the part of this same
plaintiff. We thus have the familiar situation of a venture in which one party, here
the defendant, has an asset, with what is, in advance, of purely speculative value.
The other party, the present plaintiff, who drew the agreement, is a marketer eager
for profit, but chary of risk. The legal question presented is whether the plaintiff,
while carefully avoiding all risk in the event of failure, can nevertheless claim full
profit in the event that the market may prove favorable in its response. The law of
consideration joins with the principles of business decency in giving the answer. And
the answer is no."

                                           _____________________

         Review Question 1. Wood v. Lucy, Lady Duff-Gordon seems to be a case about
consideration. Why on earth did your casebook authors put it here in a unit on implied
terms?

______________________________________________________________________________

UNIT 20: IMPLIED TERMS  403
         Review Question 2. What was Judge Cardozo's factual basis in Wood v. Lucy,
Lady Duff-Gordon for implying a promise by Wood that was not actually stated in the
written agreement between the parties? How, according to the Llewellyn excerpt
above, should the case come out under established contract doctrine in the absence of
an implied term? Which result do you believe would better effectuate the actual intent
of the parties?

         Review Question 3. In his book, Framing Contract Law, Professor Victor
Goldberg explores the history of Wood and discovers that Otis Wood deliberately
failed to put a best efforts clause into the Duff-Gordon contract because he had earlier
been sued over a similar clause in a similar distribution clause with the creator of the
hugely popular Kewpie Dolls. Does this fact affect your conclusion about whether
Judge Cardozo was correct in his opinion? Why or why not?

               MENDENHALL v. HANESBRANDS, INC.
     U.S. District Court for the Middle District of North Carolina

                     856 F. Supp. 2d 717 (M.D.N.C. 2012)

BEATY, C.J.

         [Rashard Mendenhall was a popular professional football player for the
Pittsburgh Steelers. He signed a contract with Hanesbrands in 2008 under which he
agreed to help advertise and promote products sold under the Champion trademark.
Section 17(a) of the contract contained a "morals clause" that read as follows:

         If Mendenhall commits or is arrested for any crime or becomes involved in any
         situation or occurrence (collectively, the "Act") tending to bring Mendenhall into
         public disrepute, contempt, scandal, or ridicule, or tending to shock, insult or offend
         the majority of the consuming public or any protected class or group thereof, then
         we shall have the right to immediately terminate this Agreement. [Hanesbrands']
         decision on all matters arising under this Section 17(a) shall be conclusive.

         Beginning in 2011, Mendenhall began to use the Twitter social media platform
to give his opinions on a range of issues. In 2011 he issued a series of tweets
expressing statements many readers believed to be supportive of Osama bin Laden,
the architect of the September 11, 2001 destruction of the World Trade Center, and
questioning the U.S. government's account of what happened. The tweets stirred up
substantial public controversy, including both opposition to and support for
Mendenhall's statements.]

In a letter dated May 5, 2011, Hanesbrands' Associate General Counsel indicated that
it was Hanesbrands' intent to terminate the Agreement effective Friday, May 13,
2011, pursuant to Paragraph 17(a) of the Agreement. Hanesbrands issued a public
statement to ESPN, stating the following:

______________________________________________________________________________

404  CHAPTER VI: TERMS AND INTERPRETATION
         Champion is a strong supporter of the government's efforts to fight
         terrorism and is very appreciative of the dedication and commitment of
         the U.S. Armed Forces. Earlier this week, Rashard Mendenhall, who
         endorses Champion products, expressed personal comments and
         opinions regarding Osama bin Laden and the September 11 terrorist
         attacks that were inconsistent with the values of the Champion brand
         and with which we strongly disagreed. In light of these comments,
         Champion was obligated to conduct a business assessment to determine
         whether Mr. Mendenhall could continue to effectively communicate on
         behalf of and represent Champion with consumers.

         While we respect Mr. Mendenhall's right to express sincere thoughts
         regarding potentially controversial topics, we no longer believe that Mr.
         Mendenhall can appropriately represent Champion and we have
         notified Mr. Mendenhall that we are ending our business relationship.
         Champion has appreciated its association with Mr. Mendenhall during
         his early professional football career and found him to be a dedicated
         and conscientious young athlete. We sincerely wish him all the best.

         Mr. Mendenhall contended that Hanesbrands had no legal basis for
terminating the Agreement. Hanesbrands contended that Mr. Mendenhall's May 2,
2011 tweets regarding the death of Osama bin Laden and the events of September
11, 2001, met the standard set forth in Section 17(a) and therefore Hanesbrands was
within its right to terminate the Agreement.

         Plaintiff filed this civil action.

         Defendant contends that it was within its rights under the express terms of
Section 17(a) to terminate the Agreement. Hanesbrands argues that its decision on
all matters arising under Section 17(a) are to be deemed conclusive pursuant to the
Section's express terms. It is for these reasons that Hanesbrands moves for Judgment
on the Pleadings, asserting that "[b]ecause the undisputed terms of the Agreement
vested Hanesbrands with the conclusive authority to terminate its contractual
relationship with Mr. Mendenhall once it determined that his controversial and
offensive statements tended to bring him into public disrepute, contempt, scandal or
ridicule, or tended to shock, insult, or offend the majority of the consuming public,
Mr. Mendenhall's breach of contract claim fails as a matter of law."

         Plaintiff does not allege that the morals clause in Section 17(a) is
unenforceable as a general matter. Rather, Plaintiff alleges that Hanesbrands' action
in purporting to terminate the Agreement pursuant to Section 17(a) "violates the
covenant of good faith and fair dealing implied in every contract."

         Implied in all contracts governed by New York law "is a covenant of good faith
and fair dealing in the course of contract performance," which requires parties

______________________________________________________________________________

UNIT 20: IMPLIED TERMS  405
exercising discretion under the contract "not to act arbitrarily or irrationally in
exercising that discretion." Dalton v. Educ. Testing Serv., 663 N.E. 2d 289 (N.Y. 1995).
Courts have "equated the covenant of good faith and fair dealing with an obligation
to exercise discretion reasonably and with proper motive, not arbitrarily, capriciously,
or in a manner inconsistent with the reasonable expectations of the parties." Fishoff
v. Coty Inc., 634 F.3d 647, 653 (2d Cir. 2011). The duty of good faith and fair dealing,
however, is not without limits, and no obligation can be implied that would be
inconsistent with other terms of the contractual relationship. A breach of the duty of
good faith and fair dealing is considered a breach of contract.

         In the present case, the Court finds that to the extent that the Agreement
provides Hanesbrands with discretionary termination rights under Section 17(a),
that discretion is subject to the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing. As
such, Hanesbrands' exercise of any such discretion would include a promise on
Hanesbrands' part not to act arbitrarily, irrationally or unreasonably in exercising
that discretion.

         In alleging that Hanesbrands acted unreasonably, Plaintiff's Complaint
includes factual allegations that Hanesbrands purported to terminate the Agreement
pursuant to Section 17(a) of the Agreement, while at the same time issuing a public
statement to ESPN which indicated that Hanesbrands ended its business
relationship with Mr. Mendenhall for another reason, that being because it strongly
disagreed with Mr. Mendenhall's comments. Since Section 17(a) is applicable only to
the extent that Mr. Mendenhall became involved in an act that tended to "bring [him]
into public disrepute, contempt, scandal or ridicule," or tended "to shock, insult or
offend the majority of the consuming public or any protected class or group thereof,"
mere disagreement with Mr. Mendenhall's comments would not have triggered
Hanesbrands' termination rights under Section 17(a). Therefore, from Plaintiff's
factual allegations, the Court can reasonably infer that Defendant's actions in
purporting to terminate the Agreement pursuant to Section 17(a), may have been
unreasonable, in light of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing, if such action
was based on mere disagreement with Plaintiff's statements rather than on the
applicability of Section 17(a)'s standard, as alleged by Plaintiff.

         Defendant contends that even without reference to the news reports, the
undisputed facts support dismissal of this action. Specifically, Defendant contends
that Plaintiff admits in the Complaint that: (1) after posting the 9/11 Tweets, he
received "negative reaction" and comments "opposed" to his views; (2) his statements
were "controversial"; and (3) Plaintiff "apparently received enough criticism or
ridicule in the two days that followed his posting of the 9/11 Tweets that he felt the
need to post a public `clarification' to attempt to mollify anyone he had
`unintentionally harmed' by his statements."

         However, taking Plaintiff's allegations as true, and drawing all reasonable
inferences in Plaintiff's favor, Plaintiff at no time in his Complaint made a blanket

______________________________________________________________________________

406  CHAPTER VI: TERMS AND INTERPRETATION
admission as to the nature of the public's response. In fact, Plaintiff alleged that he
received supportive tweets from members of the public in response to his comments.

         Therefore, the Court finds that a dispute of fact exists between the parties as
to the nature of the public's response to Plaintiff's May 2, 2011 tweets. Furthermore,
based on Plaintiff's allegations, the Court finds that, at this early stage of the
proceedings, Plaintiff has stated at the very least a plausible claim for breach of
contract based on the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing. To find
otherwise would require the Court to impermissibly draw inferences in Defendant's
favor.

         Defendant's Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings will be DENIED.

                                           _____________________

         Review Question 4. The contract in Mendenhall specifically provided that
Hanesbrands' decision "on all matters arising under this Section 17(a) shall be
conclusive." Why put that language in there? Why didn't the contract say that
Hanesbrands' decision would be valid "if a court of competent jurisdiction determines
that Hanesbrands was acting in good faith for a valid reason"?

         Review Question 5. Is the Mendenhall court implying the "good faith" term
because it thinks that is what the parties (including Hanesbrands) intended, or
because it is a term that should apply whether the parties want it to or not?

         Review Question 6. What ideas would you, as a transactional lawyer
representing Hanesbrands, recommend to your client in order to get the "shall be
conclusive" clause enforceable or otherwise reach the result desired by Hanesbrands?

UNIT 20: IMPLIED TERMS  407
               NANAKULI PAVING AND ROCK CO. v. SHELL OIL CO.
                      United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit
                                       664 F.2d 772 (9th Cir. 1981)

HOFFMAN, D.J.1

         [Nanakuli was the smaller of the two major paving contractors in Hawaii. To
make asphalt paving, it had to purchase "paving asphalt"--in reality, a thick, black,
sticky petroleum byproduct technically called "bitumen" --from an oil company and
"aggregate," a mixture of rock and sand, from local quarries. As of 1969, there were
two paving asphalt suppliers on Oahu, Shell (which supplied Nanakuli) and Chevron
(which supplied Nanakuli's chief competitor, HB).

         In the years leading up to 1969, Shell and Nanakuli developed a close
relationship, since Nanakuli was Shell's only big customer in Hawaii and was very
interested in helping it to grow. In 1969, Shell and Nanakuli entered into a 7-year
contract under which Nanakuli agreed to buy all of its requirements of paving asphalt
from Shell, and Shell agreed to sell Nanakuli as much as it needed. The contract
provided that Nanakuli would pay Shell's "posted price"--i.e., the price Shell would
generally charge customersCless a specific discount per ton negotiated with
Nanakuli. Because paving asphalt is derived from oil, and oil prices fluctuate, Shell's
posted price would fluctuate more or less directly with crude oil prices. For the few
decades before 1969, oil prices had been steadily declining in inflation-adjusted
terms, and had generally moved in the $2 to $3 per barrel range.

         In the wake of the Yom Kippur War, the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries--in retaliation for the U.S. government's support of Israel--unilaterally
imposed a 70% price increase in crude oil in the fall of 1973, raising it to over $5 a
barrel. The price continued to rise steadily; within the year the price would be $12.
Prior to this "oil crisis" Nanakuli had bid on major public works projects at a fixed
price, and those contracts did not permit price adjustments for any higher costs
Nanakuli might incur. Thus, when Shell in January 1974 raised its posted price from
$44 to $76 a ton (a 72% increase) Nanakuli was faced with substantial losses on these
government contracts for which it had not yet purchased paving asphalt. It demanded
that Shell afford it "price protection," that is, that Shell would continue to provide all
the paving asphalt necessary to perform these contracts at the old price. Shell

on this opinion was unusually extensive. The unedited opinion would have run more than five times
as long, and would have had 44 footnotes. The phrase "Shell and Nanakuli developed a close
relationship" in the factual summary that follows, for example, condenses nearly ten pages of detailed
facts and bits of evidence that occurred over more than a decade and that are spread in various places
throughout the opinion. A full understanding of the case requires that it be read in its entirely,

408  CHAPTER VI: TERMS AND INTERPRETATION
refused. Nanakuli sued claiming that Shell breached the contract when it refused to
offer price protection. The jury found for Nanakuli, but the judge dismissed the
complaint on the ground that the price protection claim was directly contradicted by
the pricing mechanism of the 1969 written contract. Nanakuli appealed.]

         Nanakuli argues [that] all material suppliers to the asphaltic paving trade in
Hawaii followed the trade usage of price protection and thus it should be assumed,
under the UCC, that the parties intended to incorporate price protection into their
1969 agreement. This is so, Nanakuli continues, even though the written contract
provided for price to be "Shell's Posted Price at time of delivery," F.O.B. Honolulu. Its
proof of a usage that was incorporated into the contract is reinforced by evidence of
the commercial context, which under the UCC should form the background for
viewing a particular contract.

         [Shell argued in response that (1) there was no such trade usage, and (2) even
if there was, it could not be used to contradict the express written terms of the 1969
contract.]

         The validity of the jury verdict in this case depends on four legal questions.
First, how broad was the trade to whose usages Shell was bound under its 1969
agreement with Nanakuli: did it extend to the Hawaiian asphaltic paving trade
[which would consider the practices of those who sold aggregate and other supplies
to Nanakuli] or was it limited merely to the purchase and sale of asphalt, which would
only include evidence of practices by Shell and Chevron? Second, were the two
instances of price protection of Nanakuli by Shell in 1970 and 1971 waivers of the
1969 contract as a matter of law or was the jury entitled to find that they constituted
a course of performance of the contract? Third, could the jury have construed an
express contract term of Shell's posted price at delivery as reasonably consistent with
a trade usage and Shell's course of performance of the 1969 contract of price
protection, which consisted of charging the old price at times of price increases, either
for a period of time or for specific tonnage committed at a fixed price in non-escalating
contracts? Fourth, could the jury have found that good faith obliged Shell to at least
give advance notice of a $32 increase in 1974, that is, could they have found that the
commercially reasonable standards of fair dealing in the trade in Hawaii in 1974 were
to give some form of price protection?

         We approach the first issue in this case mindful that an underlying purpose of
the UCC as enacted in Hawaii is to allow for liberal interpretation of commercial
usages. Code provides, "This chapter shall be liberally construed and applied to
promote its underlying purposes and policies." Haw. Rev. Stat. § 490:1-102(1).2 Only
three purposes are listed, one of which is "(t)o permit the continued expansion of
commercial practices through custom, usage and agreement of the parties." Id.

UNIT 20: IMPLIED TERMS  409
§ 490:1-102(2)(b). The drafters of the Code explain:

         This Act is drawn to provide flexibility so that, since it is intended to be
         a semipermanent piece of legislation, it will provide its own machinery
         for expansion of commercial practices. It is intended to make it possible
         for the law embodied in this Act to be developed by the courts in the light
         of unforeseen and new circumstances and practices.

         . . . The text of each section should be read in the light of the purpose
         and policy of the rule or principle in question, as also of the Act as a
         whole, and the application of the language should be construed narrowly
         or broadly, as the case may be, in conformity with the purposes and
         policies involved.

         . . . The Code seeks to avoid interference with evolutionary growth. . . .

         This principle of freedom of contract is subject to specific exceptions
         found elsewhere in the Act. . . . (An example being the bar on contractual
         exclusion of the requirement of good faith, although the parties can set
         out standards for same.) . . . In this connection, Section 1-205
         incorporating into the agreement prior course of dealing and usages of
         trade is of particular importance.

Id. cmt. 2-3. We read that to mean that courts should not stand in the way of new
commercial practices and usages by insisting on maintaining the narrow and
inflexible old rules of interpretation. We seek the definition of trade usage not only in
the express language of the Code but also in its underlying purposes, defining it
liberally to fit the facts of the particular commercial context here.

         The Code defines usage of trade as "any practice or method of dealing having
such regularity of observance in a place, vocation or trade as to justify an expectation
that it will be observed with respect to the transaction in question." Id. § 490:1-
205(2).3 We understand the use of the word "or" to mean that parties can be bound by
a usage common to the place they are in business, even if it is not the usage of their
particular vocation or trade. That reading is borne out by the repetition of the
disjunctive "or" in subsection 3, which provides that usages "in the vocation or trade
in which they are engaged or of which they are or should be aware give particular
meaning to and supplement or qualify terms of an agreement." Id. § 490:1-205(3). The
drafters ` Comments say that trade usage is to be used to reach the "commercial
meaning of the agreement" by interpreting the language "as meaning what it may
fairly be expected to mean to parties involved in the particular transaction in a given
locality or in a given vocation or trade." Id. cmt. 4. The inference of the two
subsections and the Comment, read together, is that a usage need not necessarily be
one practiced by members of the party's own trade or vocation to be binding if it is so

     3 [Current UCC § 1-303(c) now contains the definition of "usage of trade." - Eds.]

______________________________________________________________________________

410  CHAPTER VI: TERMS AND INTERPRETATION
commonly practiced in a locality that a party should be aware of it.

         Under pre-Code law, a trade usage was not operative against a party who was
not a member of the trade unless he actually knew of it or the other party could
reasonably believe he knew of it. White and Summers add:

         This view has been carried forward by 1-205(3) [now 1-303(c) - Eds.]. . . .
         [U]sage of the trade is only binding on members of the trade involved or
         persons who know or should know about it. Persons who should be
         aware of the trade usage doubtless include those who regularly deal with
         members of the relevant trade, and also members of a second trade that
         commonly deals with members of a relevant trade (for example, farmers
         should know something of seed selling).

JAMES J. WHITE & ROBERT L. SUMMERS, UNIFORM COMMERCIAL Code § 12-6 at 371
(1972). Using that analogy, even if Shell did not "regularly deal" with aggregate
supplies, it did deal constantly and almost exclusively on Oahu with one asphalt
paver. It therefore should have been aware of the usage of Nanakuli and other
asphaltic pavers to bid at fixed prices and therefore receive price protection from their
materials suppliers due to the refusal by government agencies to accept escalation
clauses. Therefore, we do not find the lower court abused its discretion or misread the
Code as applied to the peculiar facts of this case in ruling that the applicable trade
was the asphaltic paving trade in Hawaii.

         Shell argued not only that the definition of trade was too broad, but also that
the practice itself was not sufficiently regular to reach the level of a usage and that
Nanakuli failed to show with enough precision how the usage was carried out in order
for a jury to calculate damages. The extent of a usage is ultimately a jury question.
The Code provides, "The existence and scope of such a usage are to be proved as facts."
Haw. Rev. Stat. § 490:1-205(2). The practice must have "such regularity of observance
. . . as to justify an expectation that it will be observed." The Comment explains:

         The ancient English tests for "custom" are abandoned in this connection.
         Therefore, it is not required that a usage of trade be "ancient or
         immemorial," "universal" or the like. . . . [Full] recognition is thus
         available for new usages and for usages currently observed by the great
         majority of decent dealers, even though dissidents ready to cut corners
         do not agree.

Id. cmt. 5.

         Nanakuli went beyond proof of a regular observance. It proved and offered to
prove that price protection was probably a universal practice by suppliers to the
asphaltic paving trade [except for Shell itself] in 1969. Thus, there clearly was enough
proof for a jury to find that the practice of price protection in the asphaltic paving

______________________________________________________________________________

UNIT 20: IMPLIED TERMS  411
trade existed in Hawaii in 1969 and was regular enough in its observance to rise to
the level of a usage that would be binding on Nanakuli and Shell.

[Nanakuli also showed that after 1969 Shell gave price protection to Nanakuli on two
different occasions. The court concluded that this was evidence of "course of
performance," that is, the subsequent conduct the parties showed that they believed
the price protection term was included in the contract.]

         Perhaps one of the most fundamental departures of the Code from prior
contract law is found in the parol evidence rule and the definition of an agreement
between two parties. Under the UCC, an agreement goes beyond the written words
on a piece of paper. "`Agreement' means the bargain of the parties in fact as found in
their language or by implication from other circumstances including course of dealing
or usage of trade or course of performance . . . ." Id. § 490:1-201(3). Express terms,
then, do not constitute the entire agreement, which must be sought also in evidence
of usages, dealings, and performance of the contract itself. The purpose of evidence of
usages, which are defined in the previous section, is to help to understand the entire
agreement.

         [Usages are] a factor in reaching the commercial meaning of the
         agreement which the parties have made. The language used is to be
         interpreted as meaning what it may fairly be expected to mean to parties
         involved in the particular commercial transaction in a given locality or
         in a given vocation or trade. . . . Part of the agreement of the parties . . .
         is to be sought for in the usages of trade which furnish the background
         and give particular meaning to the language used, and are the
         framework of common understanding controlling any general rules of
         law which hold only when there is no such understanding.

Id. § 490:1-205 cmt. 4.

         A commercial agreement, then, is broader than the written paper and its
meaning is to be determined not just by the language used by them in the written
contract but

         by their action, read and interpreted in the light of commercial practices
         and other surrounding circumstances. The measure and background for
         interpretation are set by the commercial context, which may explain and
         supplement even the language of a formal or final writing.

Id. cmt. 1. Performance, usages, and prior dealings are important enough to be
admitted always, even for a final and complete agreement; only if they cannot be
reasonably reconciled with the express terms of the contract are they not binding on
the parties.

         The express terms of an agreement and an applicable course of dealing
         or usage of trade shall be construed wherever reasonable as consistent

______________________________________________________________________________

412  CHAPTER VI: TERMS AND INTERPRETATION
         with each other; but when such construction is unreasonable express
         terms control both course of dealing and usage of trade and course of
         dealing controls usage of trade.

Id. § 490:1-205(4).

         Our study of the Code provisions and Comments, then, form the first basis of
our holding that a trade usage to price protect pavers at times of price increases for
work committed on nonescalating contracts could reasonably be construed as
consistent with an express term of seller's posted price at delivery. Since the
agreement of the parties is broader than the express terms and includes usages,
which may even add terms to the agreement, and since the commercial background
provided by those usages is vital to an understanding of the agreement, we follow the
Code's mandate to proceed on the assumption that the parties have included those
usages unless they cannot reasonably be construed as consistent with the express
terms.

         [The court goes through an exhaustive list of decisions in which courts "have
been lenient in not ruling out consistent additional terms or trade usage for apparent
inconsistency with express terms. The court refers, among others, to Columbia
Nitrogen Corp. v. Royster Co., 451 F.2d 3 (4th Cir. 1971) (holding that a negotiated
contract that provided for price hikes when a commodity price rose but was silent
about price decreases could be supplemented by a price reduction clause implied from
trade usage); Michael Schiavone & Sons, Inc. v. Securalloy Co., 312 F. Supp. 801 (D.
Conn. 1970) (contract that specified delivery of "500 Gross ton" of stainless steel
actually meant any some amount up not to exceed 500 Gross ton); Decker Steel Co. v.
Exchange National Bank, 330 F.2d 82, 85 (7th Cir. 1964) (holding that contract
specification of "36-inch-wide" steel included steel that was actually 37 inches wide);
Provident Tradesmens Bank & Trust Co. v. Pemberton, 173 A.2d 780, 783-84 (Pa.
Super. Ct. 1961) (note that specifically stated that no notice need be given before
foreclosure held to include a right to notice); A & G Construction Co. v. Reid Brothers
Logging Co., 547 P.2d 1207 (Alaska 1976) (contract that specified that payment would
be made only for "State accepted scale ticketed tonnage" held to require payment for
tonnage not accepted by the State); Modine Manufacturing Co. v. North East
Independent School District, 503 S.W.2d 833, 838 (Tex. Civ. App. 1974) (contract that
required a certain air conditioning system have "not less than" a specified capacity
was not breached by delivering system that actually provided less capacity than
specified); Warren's Kiddie Shoppe, Inc. v. Casual Slacks, Inc., 120 Ga. App. 578, 171
S.E.2d 643 (Ga. Ct. App. 1969) ( contract that provided for delivery in "June-Aug"
held breached by party who delivered all of the goods in August because trade usage
required that most of the goods be shipped in June). The court acknowledges but finds
unpersuasive two contrary cases, Southern Concrete Services, Inc. v. Mableton
Contractors, Inc., 407 F. Supp. 581 (N.D. Ga.1975), aff `d, 569 F.2d 1154 (5th Cir.

UNIT 20: IMPLIED TERMS  413
1978) (unpublished opinion) (holding that a contract that provided for an express
amount could not be modified by trade usage that the specified amounts were only
"estimates"), and Division of Triple T Service, Inc. v. Mobil Oil Corp., 304 N.Y.S.2d
191 (Sup. Ct.1969) [(contract that provided for termination of a franchise for any
reason with 90 days ` notice could not be supplemented by term that required
franchisor to have "cause" for the termination).]

         Some guidelines can be offered as to how usage evidence can be allowed to
modify a contract. First, the court must allow a check on usage evidence by
demanding that it be sufficiently definite and widespread to prevent unilateral post-
hoc revision of contract terms by one party. The Code's intent is to put usage evidence
on an objective basis. J. H. Levie, Trade Usage and Custom Under the Common Law
and the Uniform Commercial Code, 40 N.Y.U. L. Rev. 1101, 1102 (1965), states:

         When trade usage adds new terms to cover matters on which the
         agreement is silent the court is really making a contract for the parties,
         even though it says it only consulted trade usage to find the parties `
         probable intent. There is nothing wrong or even unusual about this
         practice, which really is no different from reading constructive
         conditions into a contract. Nevertheless the court does create new
         obligations, and perhaps that is why the courts often say that usage . . .
         must be proved by clear and convincing evidence.

         Although the Code abandoned the traditional common law test of
nonconsensual custom and views usage as a way of determining the parties ` probable
intent, thus abolishing the requirement that common law custom be universally
practiced, trade usages still must be well settled.

         Here, the express price term was "Shell's Posted Price at time of delivery." A
total negation of that term would be that the buyer was to set the price. It is a less
than complete negation of the term that an unstated exception exists at times of price
increases, at which times the old price is to be charged, for a certain period or for a
specified tonnage, on work already committed at the lower price on nonescalating
contracts. Such a usage forms a broad and important exception to the express term,
but does not swallow it entirely. Therefore, we hold that, under these particular facts,
a reasonable jury could have found that price protection was incorporated into the
1969 agreement between Nanakuli and Shell and that price protection was
reasonably consistent with the express term of seller's posted price at delivery.

Because the jury could have found for Nanakuli on its price protection claim, we
reverse the judgment of the District Court and reinstate the jury verdict for Nanakuli
in the amount of $220,800, plus interest according to law.

         Prefatory Note on Implied Warranties. You were introduced earlier (in a unit
covering "merchants" under the Uniform Commercial Code) to the concept of the
implied warranty of merchantability--a contract term implied by law where the seller
is a merchant. The American Fertilizer case that follows returns to that concept
alongside another, sometimes overlapping UCC implied warranty, that of fitness for
a particular purpose. As you read the case, pay careful attention to see if you can tell
the difference between how the two types of implied contract terms come into
existence and what each of them do.

         Plaintiff, a dealer in agricultural fertilizer, brought suit on open account for

of defense, defendant alleges breach of an implied warranty of fitness for a particular
purpose and breach of an implied warranty of merchantability under the Uniform
Commercial Code--Sales.4

provides:

Where the seller at the time of contracting has reason to know any particular purpose for which the
goods are required and that the buyer is relying on the seller's skill or judgment to select or furnish
suitable goods, there is . . . . an implied warranty that the goods shall be fit for such purpose.

          Section 2-314 insofar as is pertinent provides: "(1) Unless excluded or modified . . . . a

         Plaintiff does not contest its status as a "merchant" within the meaning of § 2-
104(1),5 but contends that defendant failed to meet its burden of proving a breach as
to the accepted goods as is required by § 2-607(4),6 and failed to give the seller
(plaintiff) timely notice thereof pursuant to § 2-607(3)(a),7 particularly in light of the
provisions of § 1-204(2).8

         In jury-waived civil actions trial court's findings have force and effect of the
jury's verdict and when finding is general it is finding of every specific thing necessary
to be found sustaining general judgment and such judgment will not be disturbed on
appeal in the absence of legal errors, if there is any competent evidence reasonably
tending to support the trial court's conclusion.

         Defendant, a cattleman-rancher, had pursued a successful program of
fertilizing his grass lands for fifteen to twenty years. In recent years, he had applied
a fertilizer called 10-20-10 during the first of March each year with what he
characterized as near perfect results. On March 4, 1978, defendant was approached
by Crawford, a sales representative of plaintiff, to induce a sale by plaintiff to
defendant of commercial fertilizer. Crawford suggested that defendant use Triple 19
fertilizer which he said would get better results, representing that it was less costly
and better per unit.9

         Defendant and Crawford inspected a tract of defendant's land known as the
South Taylor Alfalfa 40. The tract had fescue and clovers on it which had started
Spring growth. Crawford agreed that the land was ready to be fertilized and stated
that his Triple 19 would do the job. The ground was moist and the temperature was
normal for early March. Crawford was informed that defendant used the ground both
for cattle grazing and for haying. Crawford recommended that the land be fertilized
by application of 250 pounds per acre, the quantity which defendant had applied of

          5 [By the court] Section 2-104(1) provides: "`Merchant' means a person who deals in goods of the
kind or otherwise by his occupation holds himself out as having knowledge or skill peculiar to the
practices or goods involved in the transaction or to whom such knowledge or skill may be attributed
by the employment of an agent or broker or other intermediary who by his occupation holds himself
out as having such knowledge or skill."

          6 [By the court] Section 2-607(4) provides: "The burden is on the buyer to establish any breach
with respect to the goods accepted."

          7 [By the court] Section 2-607(3)(a) provides: "Where a tender has been accepted . . . . the buyer
must within a reasonable time after he discovers or should have discovered any breach notify the seller
of breach or be barred from any remedy . . . ."

          8 [By the court] Section 1-204(2) provides: "What is a reasonable time for taking any action
depends on the nature, purpose and circumstances of such action."

mixture. A triple-19 fertilizer thus has 19 pounds each of the three elements, as compared with a 10-

20-10 mixture, which has nearly twice as much nitrogen and potassium, and slightly less phosphorous.

Different mixtures of the three nutrients are used for different crops. - Eds.]

416  CHAPTER VI: TERMS AND INTERPRETATION
10-20-10 in past years. Defendant agreed to purchase Triple 19 fertilizer from
plaintiff for application on 183 acres including the 40-acre tract, the fertilizer to be
spread by Crawford. The fertilizer was spread on March 11. Defendant mailed a check
for the fertilizer to plaintiff on April 4, 1978. A second application of fertilizer was
made on April 6. Based upon past experience, defendant expected visible results
within three days from application; but observing none, he summoned two
representatives of plaintiff for a meeting on April 22. One of the representatives
agreed that the fertilizer was not doing what it was supposed to do and that "he"
would make it right. Defendant stopped payment on the check on about April 16.
Plaintiff did nothing further. Thereupon defendant contracted with another fertilizer
company to apply Triple 17 to said lands, except for the 40-acre tract, with good
results. The South Taylor Alfalfa 40 yielded only half the hay as in previous years,
and less than adjoining lands which had no application of fertilizer at all. The cattle
pastured on the lands fertilized with Triple 19 were adversely affected in that they
suffered a condition not observed in defendant's cattle pastured on the land in
previous years. Defendant refused to pay plaintiff for the fertilizer.

         Simmons testified for plaintiff, stating that in agriculture you cannot
guarantee anything other than the analysis of units per hundred weight. He testified
that there are something like 57 things that control the making of a crop, but none
were identified, nor was there any testimony that any of them affected defendant's
hay crop. He further testified that within three weeks or 30 days from the application
of Triple 19 the grass should look dark green and "come on." A farmer who fertilizes
expects to grow something, to get more growth, better quality, and more protein. If
you get a good rain after fertilization, you should start getting some growth and the
grass should start looking dark green within a week. After fertilization and rain, one
should be able to look at the fertilized land and tell if the fertilizer is working.
Simmons said that upon inspection he could not see any visible change between the
fertilized and unfertilized property. When defendant asked Simmons what he
thought of it, Simmons replied "it's just not doing what it's supposed to do," also
stating he would make it right. Without further detailing the evidence before the trial
court, we have no hesitancy in holding there was competent evidence reasonably
tending to support the trial court's conclusion, and to support the judgment in favor
of defendant on the ground of breach of implied warranty under both § 2-314 and § 2-
315 of 12A O.S.1971.

         The defendant not only had reason to know the particular purpose for which
defendant required fertilizer, viz., to increase the quality and quantity of his grass
crop, he relied upon plaintiff's salesman's skill and judgment to select and furnish
suitable fertilizer. Defendant had been a satisfied and successful user of 10-20-10
fertilizer for many years. He had not heard of Triple 19 until the salesman suggested
it to him, and in reliance upon the salesman's representations that Triple 19 would
get better results, would be less costly and better per unit, he contracted for the

product.

         The concept of "merchantability" referred to in § 2-314 connotes not best
quality or perfection in detail, but it does require, at the very least, that the goods
operate for their ordinary purpose.

         Where the seller is a merchant and the facts so warrant, there may be an
implied warranty of merchantability and also one of fitness for the particular
purpose.10

         Having established the existence of the warranty, the buyer has the added
burden of proving that the warranty was broken and that the breach of the warranty
was the proximate cause of the loss sustained.11

         Plaintiff urges that where the buyer's proof is based upon speculation and
conjecture, a mere showing of "poor results" from the use of the product falls short of
meeting the established standard for proximate cause, citing the case of Olin
Mathieson Chemical Corp. v. Moushon, 235 N.E.2d 263 (Ill. Ct. App. 1968). While we
agree that the rule set forth in Olin Mathieson is a correct statement of the law, the
case is clearly distinguishable from the case at bar. In Olin Mathieson, the buyer
purchased explosives from the seller for blasting in a rock quarry. A mere showing on
the part of the buyer of poor results as compared with prior detonations at the quarry
did not establish that the explosive failed to measure up to an implied warranty of
fitness for the purpose intended. As the Court observed: "It could also be that the poor
results were caused by failing to remove the broken rock from the toe and the loading
to within five feet of the top. There is even a possibility that the shot holes were
improperly drilled or that a difference in the rock formation was the cause. We have
no evidence in this record that anything was wrong with the explosive except by
reasoning backward, i.e., the result was poor; therefore, something must have been
wrong with the explosive. In view of the other possibilities this is not enough."

         Facts may be proved by circumstantial, as well as by positive or direct

     10 [By the court] See UCC § 2-315 cmt. 2, which states in part:

A "particular purpose" differs from the ordinary purpose for which the goods are used in that it
envisages a specific use by the buyer which is peculiar to the nature of his business whereas the
ordinary purposes for which goods are used are those envisaged in the concept of merchantability and
go to uses which are customarily made of the goods in question. For example, shoes are generally used
for the purpose of walking upon ordinary ground, but a seller may know that a particular pair was
selected to be used for climbing mountains.

A contract may of course include both a warranty of merchantability and one of fitness for a particular
purpose.

     11 [By the court] See UCC § 2-314 cmt. 13, which states, in part:

In an action based on breach of warranty, it is of course necessary to show not only the existence of
the warranty but the fact that the warranty was broken and that the breach of the warranty was the
proximate cause of the loss sustained.

evidence, and it is not necessary that the proof rise to that degree of certainty which
will exclude every other reasonable conclusion than the one arrived at by the trier of
the facts. It is only required that it appears more probable that the defendant's poor
grass crop was the result of the failure of the fertilizer sold by plaintiff to defendant
to nourish and enrich defendant's grass lands than any other possible cause. It has
also been held that where the warranty was as to the ingredients of fertilizer,
evidence of the effect of the fertilizer on crops was admissible in connection with proof
of the kind of soil, manner of cultivation, accidents of season, and other pertinent
facts to prove that it did not contain the ingredients stated or in the proportion
specified.12

         There was more than ample evidence from which the court below as the trier
of the facts could reasonably infer that the fertilizer sold by the plaintiff to the
defendant did not meet the prescribed standard of merchantability, was not fit for
the ordinary purpose for which it was sold, and that the poor grass crop on defendant's
lands was the proximate result thereof.

         The next issue for consideration is whether under the facts and circumstances
of this case the lapse of forty-two days from the date of the first application of fertilizer
before notice of the breach was given constitutes a "reasonable time" under § 2-
607(3)(a) of the Commercial Code. While the defendant testified that visible results
from the application of fertilizer might be expected as early as three days after
application, all of the witnesses testifying on the subject agreed that such results
should be forthcoming within three weeks to thirty days. Thus there was competent
evidence on the basis of which the court below could reasonably conclude that
defendant should have discovered the breach of warranty within twelve days from
the date of the giving of notice. In order for the buyer to avoid liability for the payment
of goods accepted, he must notify the seller within a reasonable time after he
discovers or should have discovered a breach of warranty. The notification may be
either oral or in writing and is sufficient if it is informative to the seller of the general
nature of the difficulty encountered with the warranted goods by the holding of a
majority of the cases dealing with this subject.

         In the case of L.A. Green Seed Company of Arkansas v. Williams, 438 S.W.2d
717 (Ark. 1969), the court said: "The purpose of the statutory requirement of notice
to the seller of breach of warranty is to enable the seller to minimize damages in some
manner, such as correcting the defect, and also to give the seller some immunity
against stale claims. Of course, the sufficiency of notice and what is considered to be
a reasonable time within which to give notice of breach of warranty are ordinarily
questions of fact for the jury, based upon the circumstances in each case."

         In the case before us, the elapsed time of twelve days from the date of the

discovery by defendant of the defect in the product and the giving notice thereof to
the plaintiff did not under the facts and circumstances of this case constitute
untimely notice. "Discovery" that the fertilizer was not working was not a sudden
event whose arrival could be anticipated or commemorated by the stroke of a clock.
Rather, it was a gradual realization predicated upon day to day observation which
when taking into account weather conditions and past experience with fertilizer led
to the conclusion that the fertilizer was not performing in the manner reasonably to
be expected.

         Review Question 8. The fertilizer numbers noted in the opinion are a
standardized means of representing the relative amounts of nitrogen, phosphorous,
and potassium in the mixture. A triple-19 fertilizer thus has 19 pounds each of the
three elements, as compared with a 10-20-10 mixture, which has nearly twice as
much nitrogen and potassium, and slightly less phosphorous. Different mixtures of
the three nutrients are used for different crops. In American Fertilizer Specialists,
the fertilizer was to be applied to a field of fescue grass and clover. Using this
example, can you articulate the difference between a breach of the warranty of
merchantability (UCC § 2-314) and a breach the warranty of fitness for a particular
purpose (UCC § 2-315)?

         Review Question 9. Suppose you represent the seller, American Fertilizer,
which does not want to face a merchantability claim or a fitness-for-a-particular
purpose claim every time a farmer's crop fails. Consider UCC § 2-316. Could this
provision help your client? How would you go about drafting the appropriate
provisions in the contract?

Problem 20.1

         Scheck owns a Burger Queen fast food restaurant franchise in the middle of
Smallville (pop. 5,943). The franchise is held under a highly detailed 45-page called
the "Franchise Agreement." One term of the Agreement gives Scheck the right to
operate a BQ franchise restaurant at the corner of Main and Elm in Smallville. The
Agreement specifically goes on to provide, however, that "nothing contained herein
shall be read to grant or imply that [Scheck] shall have any area, market, or
territorial rights in such geographic area."

         Scheck has learned that BQ has just negotiated an agreement with Marryat
Corp., a major national food-services company, to build a brand-new Burger Queen
franchise right at the point where Main Street meets the Interstate, only a few blocks
from Scheck's store. Some Burger Queen employees tell Scheck that the company is
hoping that Marryat ultimately acquire a substantial number of its outlets and that
it will help the company get rid of older stores owned by small-town business people
and increase the professionalism of the ultimate product.

         When the sparkling new building opens in its prime location, it quickly picks
up a huge share of the market. Scheck's business plummets. The relatively few
customers he gets, in fact, tell him that they came to his store because the lines at
the one on the Interstate were too long. He sues, arguing that Burger Queen opened
the new store knowing that it would drive him out of business, and thus violated its
obligation of good faith. BQ points to the explicit language of the Agreement. What
should each side argue, and who has the better argument?

Problem 20.2

         Plumber is called to the residence of Homeowner, where moisture has been
seeping into a ceiling. After examination, Plumber says that in her view, the problem
likely lies in the pipes installed in the ceiling, and "you really ought to fix the pipes.
I think that's probably what's going on." She offers to replace the pipes for $800,
nearly all of which will go to her labor in cutting through the floor of the room above,
replacing a few pipe joints, closing things back up, and putting the carpet back down.
Because Homeowner is leaving for a 3-week vacation in Europe, he agrees to have
the work done then and there. Plumber thereupon does the work, which takes several
hours of her time. She replaces exactly what she said she would replace and returns
everything neatly to the way it was. Homeowner pays her, and happily heads off on
vacation.

______________________________________________________________________________

UNIT 20: IMPLIED TERMS  421
         Unfortunately, Plumber's work does not fix the problem, which gets
progressively worse. When Homeowner returns he finds flooding and substantial
damage to ceilings, walls, and floors that ultimately cost $10,000 to repair. He sues
Plumber. Plumber produces the estimate and shows that she did exactly what she
promised to do and never made any guarantee to Homeowner that her work would
actually fix the problem. Homeowner claims that there is an implied warranty in the
repair contract that the repair will fix the problem. What result and why?

Problem 20.3

         Patty's Party Supplies faxed a purchase order to Bart's Balloons for 70,000
balloons, "in an assortment of colors." Patty followed up her purchase order with a
phone call to Bart: "It is especially important for me to get black balloons for use at
`Over the Hill' birthday parties." Bart said he should have no trouble filling the order.
A few hours later, Bart faxed back a confirmation, stating, "Bart's Balloons will
supply the balloons per the terms of your written purchase order in one week for
$3,500 (5 cents per balloon), payment due on delivery. Please confirm these terms by
your signature below." Patty signed the confirmation form and faxed it back to Bart.
Bart delivered the balloons on the due date, consisting entirely of round balloons,
10,000 each in colors of red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and violet (the literal
colors of the rainbow). None of the balloons are black. The balloons are also round,
while Patty had wanted "long" balloons, as she has many customers who are
professional clowns who make balloon animals.

         Assume that Patty has ordered balloons from Bart before on several occasions,
and until now, her order has always been filled with long balloons instead of round
ones. However, the custom in the party-supply industry is that an order for
"balloons," if nothing more is said, means that the order is for a standard size of round
balloon. What shape of balloons was Bart contractually obligated to provide to Patty?
What color or colors of balloons? Make sure you consider UCC § 1-303 in connection
with your answers to those questions.

                                     An Introduction to

                  PERFORMANCE AND BREACH

         Assume now (1) that we have a valid contract, (2) that no defenses prevent the
contract's enforcement, and (3) that we know exactly what the contract says and
means. The next question a lawyer must be able to answer in a potential contract
dispute is whether one or more of the parties has breached the contract. Any failure
to do what a party has promised to do is a breach. Given the almost limitless number
of potential terms to which parties can agree, the question of whether the party did
what it was obligated to do will usually be highly fact-intensive.

         All Breaches Aren't Created Equal? Finding that a party did not do what it
was supposed to do does not end the inquiry. Every breach of contract entitles the
non-breaching party to claim damages or some other remedy. But often the non-
breaching party does not want to sue for damages, but it instead wants to cancel the
contract. As you will see from the materials in this chapter, not all breaches allow the
aggrieved party to do that. Determining whether a particular failure to perform will
allow the other party to cancel the contract depends on the standard of performance
we use to decide the question. American contract law sometimes allows a party to
cancel the agreement no matter how small or unimportant the breach is, a standard
that lawyers call perfect tender. But contract law also sometimes requires parties to
accept and pay for a performance that is not exactly what was bargained for, a
standard called substantial performance.

         When Is Close Good Enough? An example may help to understand this
distinction. You may recall the famous court case in Shakespeare's Merchant of
Venice where the court holds that Shylock is entitled to take a "pound of flesh" from
Antonio.1 But he would, as Portia points out, breach the agreement himself if he took
more or less than a pound. Does he have to remove exactly a pound--that is, 453.592
grams--or is there some amount of leeway? If he takes one pound "more or less," has
he breached in a way that would allow Antonio to back out of the deal? Or would he
just be liable for the additional damage caused by the additional flesh taken? These
two standards and the rules for how they work and when they are used are the subject
of the next unit.

         Excuses, Excuses. Even when a party fails to perform substantially (or even
at all), it still may not be liable for breach of contract. How can this happen? In some
situations, the law will excuse a party who failed to perform. The second unit in this
chapter, covering contract excuses, deals with exactly this situation. You will be
introduced to doctrines known as "commercial impracticability" and "frustration of

     1  By this point, we hope you realize--even without reading the chapter on Remedies--

that a contract permitting extraction of a pound of flesh in the event of a breach would be void as a

matter of public policy. You did realize that, didn't you?

purpose" that allow even a deliberate contract breacher off the hook in certain
circumstances.

         Performance and Excuses Working Together. Good lawyers are adept at
arguing their clients' cases in the alternative, and the doctrines in this chapter are
part of that tradition. Thus, the party who is faced with a claim for breach of contract
may have three layers of response to extent that factual uncertainty permits: (1) The
party may claim, as a factual matter, that it did exactly what it was obligated to do,
so no breach occurred. (2) The party may claim in the alternative that it did not do
exactly what it was obligated to do, but it came close enough that the other party is
obliged to accept and pay for the "good enough" performance rendered. (3) Finally,
the party may claim as an additional alternative that, even if it did not come close to
doing what it was obligated to do, something happened that excused its performance.
Prevailing on any of these three legal theories can lead to the same result--the
defendant is not liable for damages.

Standards of Contract Performance

                                           FOCUS OF THIS UNIT

         When Does Breach Occur? Assume that two parties are in a valid contract,
but one party now believes the other has breached the contract. How does a lawyer
tell when a contract has been breached? Determining whether a breach has occurred
requires a standard for what it means to perform. Put another way, a legal system
could have a rule that says that to comply with a contract means one must do exactly
what one promised to do, without any deviation whatsoever. On the other hand, a
legal system could have a rule in which doing pretty much what one promised to do--
getting close enough--is sufficient.

         Perfect Tender. As it happens, contract law uses both of those rules. The first
is called, in modern legal parlance, the "perfect tender" rule. If a party's tender of
performance fails in any way to meet the contract requirements, the party cannot
recover under the contract.1 Over the years this first approach tended to develop
among merchants engaged in trade, where courts tended to put weight on the
expertise of business people and tended to give them credit for saying exactly what
they meant. In the words of a well-known British judge, in commercial transactions
there is "no room" for things that "are almost the same, or which will do just as well."

         Substantial Performance. Side by side with this, however, was an approach
that allowed for at least a little flexibility, especially in situations like construction
where some deviations from almost inevitable. Thus, in cases like Glacius v. Black,
50 N.Y. 145 (1872), it was held that "mere technical, inadvertent or unimportant
omissions or defects" would not amount to a breach that would allow the other party
to back out of the transaction. What counts as "technical, inadvertent or
unimportant," however, was a matter of some dispute, and can be so today. This
approach is typically known as the "substantial performance" doctrine. The modern
American common law of contracts frequently follows the substantial performance

1 [Although, as we will see later when we get to damages for breach, there are alternative

theories on which a party that has not performed perfectly can still recover something. --Eds.]

UNIT 21: STANDARDS OF CONTRACT PERFORMANCE                                                       427
doctrine, so that close-enough performance is not a breach. If that approach strikes
you as unfair to the party whose expectation is impaired, realize that courts are
reluctant to determine that a failure of performance that causes substantial prejudice
to the other party is "substantial performance" of the contract.

         The UCC and Perfect Tender. When the Uniform Commercial Code was being
drafted in the 1940s, however, merchants and the lawyers who represent them were
adamant that the concept of "perfect tender" be included in the rules for sales of goods.
This fact might surprise you if you would assume merchants would like a rule that
allowed them to deliver things that did not quite meet the buyer's specifications.
Merchants, in fact, are virtually always both buyers and sellers of goods. In their
"buyer" capacity, these merchants benefit from a strict perfect tender standard. They
do not want to be bound to accept products from its suppliers that are almost as good
as what it ordered. A computer manufacturer, for example, wants components that
are exactly what it wanted so that it can ensure that its product does exactly what
the manufacturer promises. Thus, the "perfect tender" rule has been enacted by
statute for sales of goods--at least in a one-shot (or non-installment) sale. The perfect
tender rule is now embodied in section 2-601 of the UCC, and you should now read
that section.

         If the perfect tender rule strikes you as too harsh for trivial non-conformity to
the contract, realize that the rule is frequently blunted by some of the other doctrines
we have studied, such as the duty of good faith. A buyer claiming breach for a trivial
reason cannot in good faith use the trivial nonconformity as an excuse to escape the
contract with the seller where the buyer's real reason for wanting out is that it found
a better price somewhere else. Another amelioration of the perfect tender rule is UCC
section 2-508, which gives the seller of non-conforming goods an opportunity to "cure"
the nonconformity in certain situations. Read section 2-508 to see the extent of a
seller's right to cure.

         The perfect tender rule is not applied to installment contracts; that is, contracts
where goods are delivered in separate lots instead of all at once. In such contracts,
breach requires the occurrence of a defect that "substantially impairs the value of
that installment and cannot be cured." If you find that language to be much closer to
the common-law substantial performance doctrine, then you are correct. Read section
2-612 of the UCC for the rule on breach of installment contracts.

         Advantages and Disadvantages of Both Approaches. One advantage of the
perfect tender rule is that the parties can clearly specify exactly what they want.
Another is that it provides a bright line that allows parties to avoid litigation. One
serious disadvantage, however, is that a party may suffer an enormous loss over a
relatively minor deviation. For example, in one New York case, Dauchey v. Drake, 85
N.Y. 407 (1881), a company that was supposed to place advertisements for a patent
medicine ("Plantation Bitters & Sea Moss Farina") in 1,075 newspaper wound up
breaching its contract because it only succeeded in getting the ads into 1,022 of them.

______________________________________________________________________________

428  CHAPTER VII: PERFORMANCE AND BREACH
In a contemporaneous U.S. Supreme Court case, Filley v. Pope, 115 U.S. 213 (1885),
the seller breached a contract for the sale of 500 tons of Scotch pig iron because the
contract required shipment from Glasgow, but the ship actually sailed from Leith (a
port the same distance from the factory as Glasgow). The shipment was a breach even
though there was no evidence of any prejudice to the buyer. The substantial
performance doctrine seems much more reasonable in the face of such a result.

         This problem of strict compliance can be especially troublesome where one
party is using a relatively minor failure to escape liability on some other ground,
when a reasonable person ordinarily would have no objection. On the other hand, a
looser standard can also be troublesome in that it may encourage shoddy
performance. Contract law, as you will see in the materials that follow, is constantly
navigating the tension between perfect-tender and substantial-performance
standards.

         [Defendant had hired plaintiff contractor to build some cottages for $4,900. The
contract required a certificate from the architect that work had been done in
conformance with the plans before final payment. After construction, the architect
refused to give a certificate based on what the plaintiff claimed were "unreasonable
and frivolous objections." Defendant refused to pay make the final payment of $2,295,
and plaintiff sued. The trial court determined that the work was defective, but that
it caused only about $212 in damage to defendant, and that plaintiff had actually
spent an extra $295 on the project already. So the court awarded plaintiff $1,934.
Defendant appealed.]

COMSTOCK, J.2

         It was one of the specifications of the contract that the "nailing joists" in the
frames of the cottages were to be twelve inches apart, measuring from center to
center. The defendant's evidence tended to show that these joists were in fact placed
sixteen inches apart; that, in consequence of this departure from the specification,

          2 [Judge Comstock's opinion is actually the second (or concurring) opinion printed under this
case in the New York Reports. The opinion is, however, joined by all of the other judges on the court,
making it the arguably controlling opinion. - Eds.]

______________________________________________________________________________

UNIT 21: STANDARDS OF CONTRACT PERFORMANCE  429
the number of joists used in all the buildings was less by about two hundred than the
contract called for; that this defect in the work affected the value, strength and
substantial character of the buildings. It appeared, also, that there was a similar
breach of contract in respect to the distances between the beams in the third floor of
the houses, being in fact twenty-four inches apart, while the contract allowed only
sixteen. To meet the defense so far as it depended on these particular departures from
the contract, the plaintiff was allowed to call other mechanics and ask them as
follows: "Are the houses without these deficient joists and beams, sufficiently strong
for the character of the buildings?" The evidence being given tended to show that the
houses were sufficiently strong, that the joists and beams were placed at distances
customary in that neighborhood, and that the defendant really was not injured at all
by this violation of the contract.

         The defendant having chosen to require, in the plain letter of the contract, that
there should be in each building a certain number of joists and beams placed at
certain distances from each other, the plaintiff had no right to substitute another plan
for this part of the work; nor could he justify his willful departure from the contract
by the opinion of other builders, or by any custom whether local or general.

         I suppose it will be conceded that everyone has a right to build his house, his
cottage or his store after such a model and in such style as shall best accord with his
notions of utility or be most agreeable to his fancy. The specifications of the contract
become the law between the parties until voluntarily changed. If the owner prefers a
plain and simple Doric column, and has so provided in the agreement, the contractor
has no right to put in its place the more costly and elegant Corinthian. If the owner,
having regard to strength and durability, has contracted for walls of specified
materials to be laid in a particular manner, or for a given number of joists and beams,
the builder has no right to substitute his own judgment or that of others. Having
departed from the agreement, if performance has not been waived by the other party,
the law will not allow him to allege that he has made as good a building as the one
he engaged to erect. He can demand payment only upon and according to the terms
of his contract, and if the conditions on which payment is due have not been
performed, then the right to demand it does not exist. To hold a different doctrine
would be simply to make another contract, and would be giving to parties an
encouragement to violate their engagements, which the just policy of the law does not
permit.

         Cases of this kind must not be confounded with others having, perhaps, a slight
resemblance but no real analogy. No doubt a person may voluntarily accept a benefit
under a contract of which the conditions precedent have not been performed by the
other party, and he may do this in such circumstances that a new obligation to pay
for the benefit will arise. Thus, if A. should agree to manufacture and deliver to B. a
carriage of a particular kind and should make a different one, B. may elect whether
he will take it or not. If he voluntarily accepts the article, he thereby either waives

______________________________________________________________________________

430  CHAPTER VII: PERFORMANCE AND BREACH
the objections which he might make to it and is liable to pay for it according to his
contract, or a new assumpsit arises from the act of acceptance as though no previous
agreement had existed

         To conclude, there is, in a just view of the question, no hardship in requiring
builders, like all other men, to perform their contracts in order to entitle themselves
to payment, where the employer has agreed to pay only on that condition. It is true
that such contracts embrace a variety of particulars, and that slight omissions and
inadvertencies may sometimes very innocently occur. These should be indulgently
regarded, and they will be so regarded by courts and juries. But there can be no
injustice in imputing to the contractor a knowledge of what his contract requires, nor
in holding him to a substantial performance. If he has stipulated for walls of a given
material and with a hard inside finish, he knows what he is to do and must perform
it. If he has engaged for a given number and size of windows, joists, beams and sills,
he cannot, with the specifications before him, innocently depart from his contract.3 If
he fails to perform when the requirement is plain, and when he can perform if he will,
he has no right to call upon the courts to make a new contract for him; nor ought he
to complain if the law leaves him without remedy.

         The judgment should be reversed and a new trial granted.

                                           _____________________

         Review Question 1. The Smith v. Brady opinion refers early on to "the plain
letter of the contract," and that "the plaintiff had no right to substitute another plan
for this part of the work." That sounds very much like a perfect-tender standard.
Toward the end of the opinion, however, Judge Comstock described holding the
contractor to "a substantial performance," which is the looser performance standard.
If you were a commercial litigator, could you use the facts and language in Smith as
support for both standards? How?

               230 N.Y. 239, 129 N.E. 889 (1921)

CARDOZO, J.

         The plaintiff built a country residence for the defendant at a cost of upwards
of $77,000, and now sues to recover a balance of $3,483.46, remaining unpaid. The
work of construction ceased in June, 1914, and the defendant then began to occupy
the dwelling. There was no complaint of defective performance until March, 1915.
One of the specifications for the plumbing work provides that "all wrought iron pipe
must be well galvanized, lap welded pipe of the grade known as `standard pipe' of
Reading manufacture." The defendant learned in March, 1915, that some of the pipe,
instead of being made in Reading, was the product of other factories. The plaintiff
was accordingly directed by the architect to do the work anew. The plumbing was
then encased within the walls except in a few places where it had to be exposed.
Obedience to the order meant more than the substitution of other pipe. It meant the
demolition at great expense of substantial parts of the completed structure. The
plaintiff left the work untouched, and asked for a certificate that the final payment
was due. Refusal of the certificate was followed by this suit.

         The evidence sustains a finding that the omission of the prescribed brand of
pipe was neither fraudulent nor willful. It was the result of the oversight and
inattention of the plaintiff's subcontractor. Reading pipe is distinguished from Cohoes
pipe and other brands only by the name of the manufacturer stamped upon it at
intervals of between six and seven feet. Even the defendant's architect, though he
inspected the pipe upon arrival, failed to notice the discrepancy. The plaintiff tried to
show that the brands installed, though made by other manufacturers, were the same
in quality, in appearance, in market value and in cost as the brand stated in the
contract--that they were, indeed, the same thing, though manufactured in another
place. The evidence was excluded, and a verdict directed for the defendant. The
Appellate Division reversed, and granted a new trial.

         We think the evidence, if admitted, would have supplied some basis for the
inference that the defect was insignificant in its relation to the project. The courts
never say that one who makes a contract fills the measure of his duty by less than
full performance. They do say, however, that an omission, both trivial and innocent,
will sometimes be atoned for by allowance of the resulting damage, and will not
always be the breach of a condition to be followed by a forfeiture. The distinction is
akin to that between dependent and independent promises, or between promises and
conditions. Some promises are so plainly independent that they can never by fair
construction be conditions of one another. Others are so plainly dependent that they
must always be conditions. Others, though dependent and thus conditions when there
is departure in point of substance, will be viewed as independent and collateral when

______________________________________________________________________________

432          CHAPTER VII: PERFORMANCE AND BREACH
the departure is insignificant. Considerations partly of justice and partly of
presumable intention are to tell us whether this or that promise shall be placed in
one class or in another. The simple and the uniform will call for different remedies
from the multifarious and the intricate. The margin of departure within the range of
normal expectation upon a sale of common chattels will vary from the margin to be
expected upon a contract for the construction of a mansion or a "skyscraper." There
will be harshness sometimes and oppression in the implication of a condition when
the thing upon which labor has been expended is incapable of surrender because
united to the land, and equity and reason in the implication of a like condition when
the subject-matter, if defective, is in shape to be returned. From the conclusion that
promises may not be treated as dependent to the extent of their uttermost minutiae
without a sacrifice of justice, the progress is a short one to the conclusion that they
may not be so treated without a perversion of intention. Intention not otherwise
revealed may be presumed to hold in contemplation the reasonable and probable. If
something else is in view, it must not be left to implication. There will be no
assumption of a purpose to visit venial faults with oppressive retribution.

         Those who think more of symmetry and logic in the development of legal rules
than of practical adaptation to the attainment of a just result will be troubled by a
classification where the lines of division are so wavering and blurred. Something,
doubtless, may be said on the score of consistency and certainty in favor of a stricter
standard. The courts have balanced such considerations against those of equity and
fairness, and found the latter to be the weightier. The decisions in this state commit
us to the liberal view, which is making its way, nowadays, in jurisdictions slow to
welcome it. Where the line is to be drawn between the important and the trivial
cannot be settled by a formula. "In the nature of the case precise boundaries are
impossible." 2 SAMUEL WILLISTON, LAW OF CONTRACTS § 841 (1926). The same
omission may take on one aspect or another according to its setting. Substitution of
equivalents may not have the same significance in fields of art on the one side and in
those of mere utility on the other. Nowhere will change be tolerated, however, if it is
so dominant or pervasive as in any real or substantial measure to frustrate the
purpose of the contract. There is no general license to install whatever, in the
builder's judgment, may be regarded as "just as good." The question is one of degree,
to be answered, if there is doubt, by the triers of the facts and, if the inferences are
certain, by the judges of the law. We must weigh the purpose to be served, the desire
to be gratified, the excuse for deviation from the letter, the cruelty of enforced
adherence. Then only can we tell whether literal fulfilment is to be implied by law as
a condition. This is not to say that the parties are not free by apt and certain words
to effectuate a purpose that performance of every term shall be a condition of
recovery. That question is not here. This is merely to say that the law will be slow to
impute the purpose, in the silence of the parties, where the significance of the default
is grievously out of proportion to the oppression of the forfeiture. The willful

______________________________________________________________________________

UNIT 21: STANDARDS OF CONTRACT PERFORMANCE  433
transgressor must accept the penalty of his transgression. For him there is no
occasion to mitigate the rigor of implied conditions. The transgressor whose default
is unintentional and trivial may hope for mercy if he will offer atonement for his
wrong.

         In the circumstances of this case, we think the measure of the allowance is not
the cost of replacement, which would be great, but the difference in value, which
would be either nominal or nothing. Some of the exposed sections might perhaps have
been replaced at moderate expense. The defendant did not limit his demand to them,
but treated the plumbing as a unit to be corrected from cellar to roof. In point of fact,
the plaintiff never reached the stage at which evidence of the extent of the allowance
became necessary. The trial court had excluded evidence that the defect was
unsubstantial, and in view of that ruling there was no occasion for the plaintiff to go
farther with an offer of proof. We think, however, that the offer, if it had been made,
would not of necessity have been defective because directed to difference in value. It
is true that in most cases the cost of replacement is the measure. The owner is entitled
to the money which will permit him to complete, unless the cost of completion is
grossly and unfairly out of proportion to the good to be attained. When that is true,
the measure is the difference in value. Specifications call, let us say, for a foundation
built of granite quarried in Vermont. On the completion of the building, the owner
learns that through the blunder of a subcontractor part of the foundation has been
built of granite of the same quality quarried in New Hampshire. The measure of
allowance is not the cost of reconstruction. "There may be omissions of that which
could not afterwards be supplied exactly as called for by the contract without taking
down the building to its foundations, and at the same time the omission may not
affect the value of the building for use or otherwise, except so slightly as to be hardly
appreciable." Handy v. Bliss, 90 N.E. 864 (N.Y. 1910). The rule that gives a remedy
in cases of substantial performance with compensation for defects of trivial or
inappreciable importance, has been developed by the courts as an instrument of
justice. The measure of the allowance must be shaped to the same end.

         The order should be affirmed, and judgment absolute directed in favor of the
plaintiff upon the stipulation, with costs in all courts.

McLAUGHLIN, J., dissenting.

         I dissent. The plaintiff did not perform its contract. Its failure to do so was
either intentional or due to gross neglect which, under the uncontradicted facts,
amounted to the same thing, nor did it make any proof of the cost of compliance,
where compliance was possible.

         Under its contract it obligated itself to use in the plumbing only pipe (between
2,000 and 2,500 feet) made by the Reading Manufacturing Company. The first pipe
delivered was about 1,000 feet and the plaintiff's superintendent then called the
attention of the foreman of the subcontractor, who was doing the plumbing, to the

______________________________________________________________________________

434  CHAPTER VII: PERFORMANCE AND BREACH
fact that the specifications annexed to the contract required all pipe used in the
plumbing to be of the Reading Manufacturing Company. They then examined it for
the purpose of ascertaining whether this delivery was of that manufacture and found
it was. Thereafter, as pipe was required in the progress of the work, the foreman of
the subcontractor would leave word at its shop that he wanted a specified number of
feet of pipe, without in any way indicating of what manufacture. Pipe would
thereafter be delivered and installed in the building, without any examination
whatever. Indeed, no examination, so far as appears, was made by the plaintiff, the
subcontractor, defendant's architect, or anyone else, of any of the pipe except the first
delivery, until after the building had been completed. Plaintiff's architect then
refused to give the certificate of completion, upon which the final payment depended,
because all of the pipe used in the plumbing was not of the kind called for by the
contract. After such refusal, the subcontractor removed the covering or insulation
from about 900 feet of pipe which was exposed in the basement, cellar and attic, and
all but 70 feet was found to have been manufactured, not by the Reading Company,
but by other manufacturers, some by the Cohoes Rolling Mill Company, some by the
National Steel Works, some by the South Chester Tubing Company, and some which
bore no manufacturer's mark at all. The balance of the pipe had been so installed in
the building that an inspection of it could not be had without demolishing, in part at
least, the building itself.

         I am of the opinion the trial court was right in directing a verdict for the
defendant. The plaintiff agreed that all the pipe used should be of the Reading
Manufacturing Company. Only about two-fifths of it, so far as appears, was of that
kind. If more were used, then the burden of proving that fact was upon the plaintiff,
which it could easily have done, since it knew where the pipe was obtained. The
question of substantial performance of a contract of the character of the one under
consideration depends in no small degree upon the good faith of the contractor. If the
plaintiff had intended to, and had complied with the terms of the contract except as
to minor omissions, due to inadvertence, then he might be allowed to recover the
contract price, less the amount necessary to fully compensate the defendant for
damages caused by such omissions. But that is not this case. It installed between
2,000 and 2,500 feet of pipe, of which only 1,000 feet at most complied with the
contract. No explanation was given why pipe called for by the contract was not used,
nor was any effort made to show what it would cost to remove the pipe of other
manufacturers and install that of the Reading Manufacturing Company. The
defendant had a right to contract for what he wanted. He had a right before making
payment to get what the contract called for. It is no answer to this suggestion to say
that the pipe put in was just as good as that made by the Reading Manufacturing
Company, or that the difference in value between such pipe and the pipe made by the
Reading Manufacturing Company would be either "nominal or nothing." Defendant
contracted for pipe made by the Reading Manufacturing Company. What his reason

______________________________________________________________________________

UNIT 21: STANDARDS OF CONTRACT PERFORMANCE  435
was for requiring this kind of pipe is of no importance. He wanted that and was
entitled to it. It may have been a mere whim on his part, but even so, he had a right
to this kind of pipe, regardless of whether some other kind, according to the opinion
of the contractor or experts, would have been "just as good, better, or done just as
well." He agreed to pay only upon condition that the pipe installed were made by that
company and he ought not to be compelled to pay unless that condition be performed.
The rule, therefore, of substantial performance, with damages for unsubstantial
omissions, has no application.

         Review Question 2. Judge McLaughlin's dissent says that "[i]f the plaintiff
[contractor] had intended to, and had complied with the terms of the contract except
as to minor omissions, due to inadvertence, then he might be allowed to recover the
contract price, less the amount necessary to fully compensate the defendant for
damages caused by such omissions." Wouldn't Judge Cardozo agree with that
statement as an accurate articulation of the substantial performance doctrine? If both
judges are applying the same basic rule, then how can you explain their reaching
such different results?

         Review Question 3. Suppose that Mr. Kent was, in fact, the president of the
Reading Pipe Company. Should that change the outcome of the case? Why or why
not?

         Plaintiff, Mrs. Fred M. Cope, sued defendant, O.W. Grun Roofing &
Construction Co., to set aside a mechanic's lien4 filed by defendant and for damages

          4 [When a contractor does work on a piece of real property, statutes in most states allow it to
recover money owed from whoever owns the property, not merely from the person who hired the
contractor. Thus, if a subcontractor is not paid for work, the prime contractor that hired it is liable,
but so can be the owner who hired the prime contractor. If the property is sold, the new owner will also
be liable based on a "mechanic's lien" having been filed in the real property records. The terminology--
still very much in use by lawyers today--came about because in the 19th century all skilled workers
were referred to as "mechanics." The lien is not itself a lawsuit; it simply attaches to the property until
such time as the contractor sues to enforce it or, as here, the owner sues to have the encumbrance on
the property removed. - Eds.]

436  CHAPTER VII: PERFORMANCE AND BREACH
in the sum of $1,500 suffered by plaintiff as a result of the alleged failure of defendant
to perform a contract calling for the installation of a new roof on plaintiff's home.
Defendant, in addition to a general denial, filed a cross-claim for $648, the amount
which plaintiff agreed to pay defendant for installing the roof, and for foreclosure of
the mechanic's lien on plaintiff's home.

         Following trial to a jury, the court below entered judgment awarding plaintiff
$122.60 as damages for defendant's failure to perform the contract; setting aside the
mechanic's lien; and denying defendant recovery on its cross-claim. It is from this
judgment that defendant appeals.

         The written contract required defendant to install a new roof on plaintiff's
home for $648. The contract describes the color of the shingles to be used as "russet
glow," which defendant defined as a "brown varied color." Defendant acknowledges
that it was his obligation to install a roof of uniform color.

         After defendant had installed the new roof, plaintiff noticed that it had streaks
which she described as yellow, due to a difference in color or shade of some of the
shingles. Defendant agreed to remedy the situation and he removed the
nonconforming shingles. However, the replacement shingles do not match the
remainder, and photographs introduced in evidence clearly show that the roof is not
of a uniform color. Plaintiff testified that her roof has the appearance of having been
patched, rather than having been completely replaced. According to plaintiff's
testimony, the yellow streaks appeared on the northern, eastern and southern sides
of the roof, and defendant only replaced the non-matching shingles on the northern
and eastern sides, leaving the southern side with the yellow streaks still apparent.
The result is that only the western portion of the roof is of uniform color.

         When defendant originally installed the complete new roof, it used 24
"squares" of shingles. In an effort to achieve a roof of uniform color, five squares were
ripped off and replaced. There is no testimony as to the number of squares which
would have to be replaced on the southern, or rear, side of the house in order to
eliminate the original yellow streaks. Although there is expert testimony to the effect
that the disparity in color would not be noticeable after the shingles have been on the
roof for about a year, there is testimony to the effect that, although some nine or ten
months have elapsed since defendant attempted to achieve a uniform coloration, the
roof is still "streaky" on three sides. One of defendant's experts testified that if the
shingles are properly applied the result will be a "blended" roof rather than a streaked
roof.

In view of the fact that the disparity in color has not disappeared in nine or ten

months, and in view of the fact that there is testimony to the effect that it would be

impossible to secure matching shingles to replace the nonconforming ones, it can

reasonably be inferred that a roof of uniform coloration can be achieved only by

installing a completely new roof.

______________________________________________________________________________

UNIT 21: STANDARDS OF CONTRACT PERFORMANCE  437
         The evidence is undisputed that the roof is a substantial roof and will give
plaintiff protection against the elements.

         The principle which allows recovery for part performance in cases involving
dependent promises may be expressed by saying that a material breach or a breach
which goes to the root of the matter or essence of the contract defeats the promisor's
claim despite his part performance, or it may be expressed by saying that a promisor
who has substantially performed is entitled to recover, although he has failed in some
particular to comply with his agreement. The latter mode of expressing the rule is
generally referred to as the doctrine of substantial performance and is especially
common in cases involving building contracts, although its application is not
restricted to such contracts.

         It is difficult to formulate definitive rule for determining whether the
contractor's performance, less than complete, amounts to "substantial performance,"
since the question is one of fact and of degree, and the answer depends on the
particular facts of each case. But, although the decisions furnish no rule of thumb,
they are helpful in suggesting guidelines. One of the most obvious factors to be
considered is the extent of the nonperformance. The deficiency will not be tolerated if
it is so pervasive as to frustrate the purpose of the contract in any real or substantial
sense. The doctrine does not bestow on a contractor a license to install whatever is,
in his judgment, "just as good." The answer is arrived at by weighing the purpose to
be served, the desire to be gratified, the excuse for deviating from the letter of the
contract and the cruelty of enforcing strict adherence or of compelling the promisee
to receive something less than for which he bargained. Also influential in many cases
is the ratio of money value of the tendered performance and of the promised
performance. In most cases the contract itself at least is an indication of the value of
the promised performance, and courts should have little difficulty in determining the
cost of curing the deficiency. But the rule cannot be expressed in terms of a fraction,
since complete reliance on a mathematical formula would result in ignoring other
important factors, such as the purpose which the promised performance was intended
to serve and the extent to which the nonperformance would defeat such purpose, or
would defeat it if not corrected. See generally 3A ARTHUR L. CORBIN, CORBIN ON
CONTRACTS §§ 700-07 (1960).

         Although definitions of "substantial performance" are not always couched in
the same terminology and, because of the facts involved in a particular case,
sometimes vary in the recital of the factors to be considered, the following definition
by the Commission of Appeals in Atkinson v. Jackson Bros., 270 S.W. 848, 849 (Tex.
Comm. App. 1925), is a typical recital of the constituent elements of the doctrine:

     To constitute substantial compliance the contractor must have in good
     faith intended to comply with the contract, and shall have substantially
     done so in the sense that the defects are not pervasive, do not constitute
     a deviation from the general plan contemplated for the work, and are

______________________________________________________________________________

438  CHAPTER VII: PERFORMANCE AND BREACH
         not so essential that the object of the parties in making the contract and
         its purpose cannot, without difficulty, be accomplished by remedying
         them. Such performance permits only such omissions or deviations from
         the contract as are inadvertent and unintentional, are not due to bad
         faith, do not impair the structure as a whole, and are remediable without
         doing material damage to other parts of the building in tearing down
         and reconstructing.

See also Dupuy v. Shilling, 27 S.W.2d 323, 325 (Tex. Civ. App. 1930); 10 TEX. JUR. 2D,
Building Contracts § 21; 13 AM. JUR. 2D, Building and Construction Contracts §§ 41-
43.

         What was the general plan contemplated for the work in this case? What was
the object and purpose of the parties? It is clear that, despite the frequency with which
the courts speak of defects that are not "pervasive," which do not constitute a
"deviation from the general plan," and which are "not so essential that the object of
the parties in making the contract and its purpose cannot, without difficulty, be
accomplished by remedying them," when an attempt is made to apply the general
principles to a particular case difficulties are encountered at the outset. Was the
general plan to install a substantial roof which would serve the purpose which roofs
are designed to serve? Or, rather, was the general plan to install a substantial roof of
uniform color? Was the object and purpose of the contract merely to furnish such a
roof, or was it to furnish such a roof which would be of a uniform color? It should not
come as a shock to anyone to adopt a rule to the effect that a person has, particularly
with respect to his home, to choose for himself and to contract for something which
exactly satisfies that choice, and not to be compelled to accept something else. In the
matter of homes and their decoration, as much as, if not more than, in many other
fields, mere taste or preference, almost approaching whimsy, may be controlling with
the homeowner, so that variations which might, under other circumstances, be
considered trifling, may be inconsistent with that "substantial performance" on which
liability to pay must be predicated. Of mere incompleteness or deviations which may
be easily supplied or remedied after the contractor has finished his work, and the cost
of which to the owner is not excessive and readily ascertainable, present less cause
for hesitation in concluding that the performance tendered constitutes substantial
performance, since in such cases the owner can obtain complete satisfaction by merely
spending some money and deducting the amount of such expenditure from the
contract price.

         In the case before us there is evidence to support the conclusion that plaintiff
can secure a roof of uniform coloring only by installing a completely new roof. We
cannot say, as a matter of law, that the evidence establishes that in this case that a
roof which so lacks uniformity in color as to give the appearance of a patch job serves
essentially the same purpose as a roof of uniform color which has the appearance of

______________________________________________________________________________

UNIT 21: STANDARDS OF CONTRACT PERFORMANCE  439
being a new roof. We are not prepared to hold that a contractor who tenders a
performance so deficient that it can be remedied only by completely redoing the work
for which the contract called has established, as a matter of law, that he has
substantially performed his contractual obligation.

         Because of defendant's deficient performance, plaintiff is now in a position
which requires that she pay for a new roof.

         The judgment of the trial court is affirmed.

                          2007 Cal. App. Unpub. LEXIS 6107 (Ct. App.)

         [Legacy wanted to market a device for increasing computer memory that
required a thumbnail-sized component called a "ball grid array (BGA) canopy," a unit
that uses solder balls on the bottom to make electric contacts with a circuit board.
Legacy sent four purchase orders to KCA, a manufacturer, over a nine-month period,
for approximately 59,000 BGA canopies. The purchase orders also provided that all
of KCA's products must be warranted "to be free from defects and to perform to the
original manufacturer's specifications for fit, form and function." Seller KCA
responded with invoices that contained a clause that said "Buyer shall exercise its
right of inspection within 30 days of receipt . . . and all goods shall be deemed accepted
as to quality unless the Seller receives a written notice of rejection within such 30
day period." Things went bad quickly. The first batch was returned because of sticky
tape residue on the canopies. They were cleaned and returned, but were again
rejected for being undersized. They were reworked and shipped back in installments.
The single biggest order, for 40,000 units, was returned because solder balls on the
canopies were smashed and there was exposed copper. KCA inspected them, decided
they were fine, and sent back to Legacy. This led to a dispute, and the parties agreed
that all units would be tested by Legacy. In testing, it turned out that 6 percent of
the units were defective. After discussions trying to settle the matter, Legacy rejected
the goods and refused to proceed. KCA sued.]

______________________________________________________________________________

440  CHAPTER VII: PERFORMANCE AND BREACH
         In this case we review a judgment in a lawsuit between a commercial seller
and a commercial buyer over rejected merchandise. Accordingly, we begin with a
quick review of some relevant UCC provisions:

         A provision of the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC), § 2-601, (also enacted in
California as § 2-601 of the Commercial Code), is known as the perfect tender rule.
The operative words of the statute allow a buyer to reject "the whole" of a delivery of
goods if the goods "fail in any respect to conform to the contract." Courts have noted
that the perfect tender rule imposes "a very high level of conformity" to the contract
on sellers, allowing buyers to "reject a seller's tender for any trivial defect, whether
it be in the quality of the goods, the timing of the performance, or the manner of
delivery." Midwest Mobile Diagnostic Imaging v. Dynamics Corp., 965 F. Supp. 1003,
1011 (W.D. Mich. 1997).

         The perfect tender rule is tempered, however, by another UCC provision, § 2-
508 which affords sellers a right to cure the nonconformity.

         Also, the perfect tender rule does not apply to installment contracts, an
exception which embodies a policy of the law to protect longer-term commercial
relationships. As one commentator has described the installment contract exception:

         The policy in installment contracts is to avoid the abrupt termination of
         a long term contractual relationship merely for technical reasons and to
         keep the contract going. Where many deliveries are contemplated, minor
         defects are likely to appear in some installments and it would give the
         buyer an unreasonable commercial advantage if he could escape from
         the contract for the trivial deficiencies which inevitably occur. In an
         installment contract the buyer has sufficient bargaining power vis-a-vis
         future shipments to adjust minor defects."

William H. Lawrence, Appropriate Standards for a Buyer's Refusal to Keep Goods
Tendered by a Seller, 35 WM. & MARY L. REV. 1635, 1654 n. 86 (1994).

         The installment exception to the perfect tender rule is found in § 2-612 of the
UCC. Unlike the perfect tender standard of § 2-601, § 2-612 embodies a "substantial
impairment" standard; that is, the buyer may cancel "only when the nonconformity
of one or more installments `substantially impairs the value of the whole contract.'"

         In the present case even the seller recognizes that, at the end of the day, six
percent of the parts it shipped were defective, which in the context of parts for
computer memory, not only fails to constitute perfect tender, but also represents a
substantial impairment of the value of the whole of the shipments. We therefore
conclude that under both the "perfect tender" standard and the "substantial
impairment" standard there was substantial evidence to support the trial court's
decision that the seller take nothing by way of its complaint against the buyer.

______________________________________________________________________________

UNIT 21: STANDARDS OF CONTRACT PERFORMANCE  441
         This case is simple if the perfect tender rule governs. And the trial court
impliedly concluded that the perfect tender rule does govern, because it explicitly
found that the "pattern" of sales by KCA to Legacy was not an installment contract.

         Under the perfect tender rule, two facts are dispositive: (1) There is no question
that 6 percent of the sample of some 20,000 parts were nonconforming, and (2) by the
time the parties had agreed to test the sample of some 20,000 parts, KCA had the
better part of a year to produce 100 percent conforming canopies. That is, KCA never
"seasonably" exercised its right to cure, because, by no less than the third order filled
by February 2004, Legacy was still receiving defective canopies on a series of orders
which started the previous July.

         [Turning to the argument that this was an installment contract,] KCA argues
that there was no substantial impairment of value given the ultimate 94 percent pass
rate of the final (20,160 unit) sample. On this point, however, Legacy must prevail
given the standard of review under which this court must operate.

         There was testimony from Legacy's director of manufacturing that every single
solder ball "is an electrical contact that needs to make connection" for the module to
work. Missing or sheared solder balls will not make contact, and that would mean the
whole module would be "basically not functioning" and would have to be "reworked
or repaired." In short, even one defective canopy would mean a computer than didn't
work.

         It is a reasonable inference that, had Legacy simply processed all the canopies
supplied by KCA, the results would have been commercially unacceptable,
particularly given the evidence that the canopies were for a new product, and it would
be reasonable for the trial court to conclude that even a six percent failure rate would
tarnish the new product's reputation. It is particularly noteworthy, in that regard,
that Legacy discontinued its inspection at 20,000 units because the inspection process
itself tied up a production line. That is, the "cost of inspection" was itself significant,
because it showed a need for zero tolerance of defective parts as part of the original
contract. The trial court could thus reasonably conclude that the six percent failure
rate was a substantial impairment of the value of the whole contract.

         KCA [also] argues that Legacy waited an unreasonable amount of time to reject
the "whole" of the goods covered by the contract. There was, however, substantial
evidence on which the trial court could conclude otherwise.

         Specifically, earlier shipments had met a series of problems in addition to the
"sheared or smeared" solder balls: sticky glue, undersizing, and problems with the
silkscreen identification that interfered with the production line. While it is true that
KCA may have cured those defects, the very fact of a series of defects (reminiscent of
a car buyer who buys a lemon) meant that the trial court could conclude it was
commercially reasonable for Legacy to forebear on rejecting the whole of the
inventory until it encountered the defect (the solder-balls) that simply wasn't going

to be cured. The real time frame for rejection, then, was not July 2003 to July 2004,
but early May 2004 (when the sample showed a six percent failure rate) to the letter
in July 2004--barely more than a month.

         The judgment is affirmed. Respondent is to recover its costs on appeal.

         Review Question 5. The KCA Electronics case illustrates the value of the
perfect tender rule to a buyer in the position of Legacy Electronics who, you should
note, would then turn around and be in the position of a UCC seller with its ultimate
products. Yet the court reaches the same result under the substantial impairment
standard for installment contracts in section 2-612. Given that the buyer prevailed
in KCA Electronics under both standards, what situation might you imagine where a
seller would be in breach under the perfect tender rule yet not be substantially
impaired?

                   FANOK v. CARVER BOAT CORP.
United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York

                    576 F. Supp. 2d 404 (E.D.N.Y. 2008)

CONAN, U.S.D.J.

         Jeffrey Fanok brings this action against Carver Yacht Corp. [and] Staten
Island Yacht Sales, Inc. ("SIYS") which arises from his 59-foot Marquis yacht catching
fire and sinking off the coast of Sandy Hook, New Jersey. Each of the defendants has
moved for summary judgment.

         On April 22, 2006, plaintiff entered into a purchase agreement with SIYS for
a 59-foot Marquis Yacht for the 2005 model year. The purchase price was $1,376,940,
inclusive of six percent tax. It appears that plaintiff, at the time of the incident, had
paid $1,202,940.

         Carver inspected the yacht in accordance with its manufacturing and quality
control procedures prior to its transfer to SIYS. It passed all inspections. It was then
shipped, on October 25, 2004, in parts, to SIYS, where it was assembled. Upon receipt
of the yacht, SIYS completed a "Pre-Delivery Service Record," confirming the proper
operating condition and seaworthiness of the yacht. When plaintiff and SIYS signed
the purchase agreement, SIYS agreed to install some after-market features (aft
cockpit controls, a flybridge grill, and a video camera) and make certain repairs. The

______________________________________________________________________________

UNIT 21: STANDARDS OF CONTRACT PERFORMANCE                         443
yacht remained located at SIYS' facility, although plaintiff had access to and use of it
as he wished. The reverse side of the purchase agreement provided:

     DEALER MAKES NO WARRANTIES EXPRESS OR IMPLIED OF, IN ANY
     YACHT OR ITEM PURCHASED HEREUNDER AND NO WARRANTIES OF
     MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE ARE
     INTENDED. WARRANTY, IF ANY, OF ANY ITEM PURCHASED HEREUNDER
     SHALL BE SOLELY THE WARRANTY GIVEN BY THE MANUFACTURER.

         Carver provided a limited express warranty. This document included, among
other things, Carver's warranty that the yacht "will be free from defects in material
and workmanship for one (1) year from delivery to the original retail owner." It
further stated that "for this limited warranty to be valid, Carver must receive a
Warranty Registration Form, duly completed and signed by the Owner, within fifteen
(15) days of delivery" of the yacht, and that the retail dealer (here, SIYS) is
responsible for sending the signed registration form to Carver. Finally, this express
warranty excluded all implied warranties, including merchantability and fitness for
a particular purpose, and stated that "[y]our acceptance of delivery of the warranted
Marquis yacht constitutes your acceptance of the terms of this limited warranty."

         While the yacht was at SIYS, plaintiff was permitted, and evidently
encouraged, to sail it. Plaintiff requested training on the yacht, so SIYS provided him
with a captain who tutored him, onboard, for five to six hours. Plaintiff used the yacht
four or five times, for a maximum of fifteen hours, before the incident in question.

         Plaintiff never had title to the yacht, nor did he sign Carver's "Warranty
Registration," SIYS' "Notice of Owner's Acceptance of Vessel," or SIYS' "Customer
Warranty Acknowledgment." The yacht was never registered. He did sign SIYS'
"Purchase Agreement," which, as noted above, had SIYS' warranty exclusion in it.

         On July 15, 2006, plaintiff, with his wife Susan, his teenage son, Jeff, one of
Jeff's friends, and their two dogs, left SIYS' facility around 11:00 a.m. The group
arrived at Horseshoe Cove a short time later, where they intended to have lunch and
swim. At the point of anchorage, the water depth was approximately ten to fourteen
feet and the yacht's draft (the distance between the water's surface and the bottom of
the yacht) was five feet.

         When the time came to move from their spot, plaintiff put the engine to idling
speed to ensure that the propellers were not rotating. His son, Jeff, used a yacht hook
to position the anchor into the bow, but lost his grip on the hook and dropped it into
the water. As the others on the yacht went to retrieve it, the yacht began to drift. By
the time they returned to the cockpit, the yacht had come into contact with a sandbar,
causing the bow to swing around. Plaintiff stated that he cut off the engines and
engaged both the stern and bow thrusters. At least a minute later, plaintiff's wife and
the children smelled something burning and saw smoke rising out of the port engine
vent. At that point, plaintiff entered the main salon and shut down the electrical
system and generator.

______________________________________________________________________________

444  CHAPTER VII: PERFORMANCE AND BREACH
         Returning to the controls, plaintiff called the Coast Guard for help. In the
meantime, he directed everyone on board to put on life jackets and gather on the stern
platform. Plaintiff's wife scoured the yacht in search of one of the dogs, which was
missing. As the floors were beginning to melt, the family was taken from their yacht
by another vessel.

         Within ten minutes of their departure from the yacht, it became engulfed in
flames. Less than a half hour after the initial call, the Coast Guard arrived and
worked to put out the fire. Its efforts were to no avail, and the yacht burned down to
the waterline. After two hours and 42 minutes, the fire was extinguished, at which
point the skeleton of the yacht drifted into a rock pile and grounded. It was estimated
that 20 gallons of fuel remained on board, indicating that approximately 380 gallons
burned in the fire.

         [Plaintiff--or, rather, the insurance company pursuing the case--advanced
several claims that the yacht was defective, but failed to prove them.]

         As an alternative to showing the existence of a triable issue as to whether there
was a defect in the yacht, plaintiff contends that he does not have to show a defect
because, in fact, Carver and SIYS never "delivered" the yacht. Plaintiff's implication
is that by not delivering the yacht, Carver and SIYS breached the contract. According
to plaintiff, this failure to deliver is due to the fact that there was a punch list of items
remaining to be performed by SIYS, and thus any purported delivery did not comply
with the "perfect tender" rule.

         As to SIYS, although plaintiff never signed its "Notice of Owner's Acceptance
of Vessel" form or entered into a rental agreement for a slip at SIYS, that was not
required to effect delivery of the yacht under the UCC. Section 2-308 states that
"unless otherwise agreed, the place for delivery of goods is the seller's place of
business."5 Plaintiff thus did not have to bring in a trailer and take the yacht away
to affect a delivery. The facts are undisputed that once he signed the contract, paid
the bulk of the purchase price and gave a promissory note for the rest, he asserted
dominion and control of it, taking it out when he wanted, as he did on the day of the
fire. He held himself out as the owner of the yacht, buying insurance on it, putting in
an insurance claim for its loss (and accepting payment), and obtaining a Certificate
of Documentation in his name from the Coast Guard.

         Plaintiff's reliance on the "perfect tender" rule to avoid the conclusion of
delivery is misplaced. That rule provides a framework to determine whether a buyer's
rejection of goods is proper. When a seller makes an imperfect tender, nothing

         5 [Section 2-308 is one of those UCC gap-filler terms of the sort we discussed in the Terms

and Interpretation materials for the course. Where the parties to a sale-of-goods contract do not

include a term specifying a place of delivery, the code provides one for them--at least to some extent.

happens by mere operation of law; should the buyer not reject within a reasonable
time, he waives his right to challenge the alleged imperfection. Instead of an
imperfect tender invalidating a transaction after material changes in the parties'
positions have occurred, as plaintiff is attempting to do here, the perfect tender rule
gives the buyer a provisional right to reject the goods "within a reasonable time after
delivery or tender." UCC § 2-602(1).

         However, plaintiff does not contend that he rejected the yacht on the "punch
list grounds" until after the yacht burned. The punch list items to which plaintiff
refers--comprised mostly of items like "scratches on kitchen table;" "clean inside
carpeting"; and "are the master bath shower doors supposed to rattle a lot when
underway?"--were never items that caused plaintiff to reject or even to threaten to
reject the yacht. It is only now that the yacht is destroyed that plaintiff seizes upon
them as an indication of non-delivery. The equipment additions that the contract
included fall into that same category. They did not impact on the delivery of the yacht
to plaintiff.

         Indeed, the majority of items on the punch list were sufficiently minor that
even under the perfect tender rule, they may not have supported rejection as opposed
to an adjustment of the purchase price, as such an attempted rejection might be
indicative of bad faith. See UCC § 1-203 [now UCC § 1-304]; T.W. Oil, Inc. v. Consol.
Edison Co. of New York, Inc., 443 N.E.2d 932 (N.Y. 1982) ("In contrast [to the perfect
tender rule], to meet the realities of the more impersonal business world of our day,
the code, to avoid sharp dealing, expressly provides for the liberal construction of its
remedial provisions (§ 1-102) so that `good faith' and the `observance of reasonable
commercial standards of fair dealing' be the rule rather than the exception in trade.").
The punch list items certainly would not have supported rejection without a
reasonable opportunity for SIYS to cure them. See UCC § 2-106 cmt 2 ("the seller is
in part safeguarded against surprise as a result of sudden technicality on the buyer's
part by the provisions of § 2-508 on seller's cure of improper tender or delivery").

         In the absence of any evidence that plaintiff ever rejected the yacht, plaintiff's
alternative position is that he never "accepted" delivery. Again, however, the UCC
requires a contrary conclusion. Section 2-606 specifies three methods of acceptance.
Plaintiff's position--that he could only accept by signing the relevant acceptance
forms or advising SIYS expressly that he was accepting--would fall under § 2-
606(1)(a) (acceptance occurs when the buyer "signifies that the goods are conforming
or that he will retain them in spite of their non-conformity"). Section 2-606(1)(b),
however, provides that acceptance occurs when, after a reasonable time for
inspection, the buyer "fails to make an effective rejection." In addition, § 2-606(1)(c)
provides the further alternative of deeming acceptance made if the buyer "does any
act inconsistent with the seller's ownership." Both subsections (1)(b) and (1)(c) show
an acceptance here.

______________________________________________________________________________

446  CHAPTER VII: PERFORMANCE AND BREACH
         Plaintiff used the yacht for nearly three months before the day of the fire. Yet
as noted above, at no time did plaintiff reject the yacht as non-conforming. Having
failed to give any indication of rejection until after the fire, plaintiff accepted the
yacht under § 2-606(1)(b). See Ask Technologies, Inc. v. Cablescope, Inc., No. 01 Civ.
1838, 2003 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 18694, 2003 WL 22400201 (S.D.N.Y. Oct. 20, 2003)
(where buyer complained, complaints were resolved, and buyer continued to use
products for months after complaining, acceptance occurred); EPN-Delaval, S.A. v.
Inter-Equip, Inc., 542 F. Supp. 238 (S.D. Tex.1982) (where buyer stored but did not
use goods prior to inspection and rejection, acceptance occurred under § 2-606(1)(b)
since he did not inspect and discover defect within reasonable time).

         In addition, plaintiff engaged in a number of acts inconsistent with ownership
in SIYS. Indeed, even in the pleadings and his deposition in this action, plaintiff has
repeatedly described himself as the owner of the yacht. No reasonable jury could find
that these actions, singly and collectively, are insufficient to constitute an acceptance
under § 2-606(1)(c).

         Defendants' motions for summary judgment are granted. The Clerk is directed
to enter judgment in favor of defendants, dismissing the complaint.

                                           _____________________

         Review Question 6. The Fanok court states that most of the defects identified
by the buyers (on the "punch list") before launching their new yacht "were sufficiently
minor that even under the perfect tender rule, they may not have supported rejection
as opposed to an adjustment of the purchase price, as such an attempted rejection
might be indicative of bad faith." What does the court mean by that statement and
what does it tell you about the limits of the perfect tender rule?

         Review Question 7. Carefully read UCC section 2-606 ("What Constitutes
Acceptance of Goods"). Be prepared to explain exactly what Mr. Fanok did in this case
that counted as an "acceptance" of the yacht. By the way, beware of confusing
terminology here: the "acceptance" of goods in a sale has nothing to do with
"acceptance" of an offer to form a contract in the first place. In Fanok, for instance,
there was no dispute between the parties as to whether a contract existed between
them; it clearly did, and the parties were arguing over performance and breach.

                                Problems

Problem 21.1

         Actor is a very socially conscious individual and is particularly passionate
about the importance of labor unions. He hires Architect to develop plans for his new
40,000-square-foot hillside home in Malibu. The contract specifically provides that all
the materials listed in Annex A to the contract be obtained from unionized firms, and
prohibits use of non-union materials in any situation where union-made materials
exist. One of the categories listed on Annex A is "structural steel." The requirement
for union-made products is clear from the contract, although the reason for the
specification is not mentioned. Contractor obtains the contract to build the house. As
it is time for the foundation to be laid, however, the only unionized steel supplier
notifies Contractor that, while it could eventually provide the steel, the earliest it
could do so is three months after Contractor had scheduled the work on Actor's home.
Contractor therefore purchases structural steel for the foundation from Rogue Steel
Corp., a non-union manufacturer famous for its hard-line battles against union
organizers, which include three separate cases before the U.S. Supreme Court. The
steel beams acquired from Rogue are embedded in the foundation and work
continues.

         When the home is virtually finished, a Hollywood gossip sheet reports that the
home of Actor, the famous union activist, actually is built on a foundation of Rogue
Steel. Actor is appalled. All his pleasure in the home is destroyed. Evidence shows
that the steel cannot be replaced except by effectively demolishing the entire
structure and staring over. Actor demands that Contractor demolish everything down
to the foundation and start again. Contractor refuses. Evidence shows that the steel
used actually exceeds all contract requirements, except that it is not union-made. It
further shows that there is no difference in the value of the home due to the steel.
Actor refuses to pay for the home. Contractor sues. What will each side argue, and
who do you think has the stronger argument?

Problem 21.2

         Major State University, whose highly profitable athletic programs are known
as the ShorthornsTM, has developed a book about the long and occasionally storied
history of its athletic program, entitled Horns of Excellence. It contracts with Acme
Publishing Co. to produce the book. The contract specifies that Acme will produce
400,000 copies of the book, which MSU plans to sell to alumni and friends. The books
will be delivered in four lots of 100,000 each. The detailed contract specifications
provide that the book's cover, which features a picture of one of its semi-legendary
coaches, will be produced in Shorthorn OrangeTM, a kind of muddy brownish color

______________________________________________________________________________

448  CHAPTER VII: PERFORMANCE AND BREACH
that is the official trademarked color of the Shorthorns and is used for all uniforms,
goods, and merchandise.

         When the first 100,000 copies are delivered to MSU, the school is shocked to
discover that the covers have been printed in Volunteer OrangeTM, a much brighter
color that is the trademarked color of a rival university. MSU rejects the first 100,000
volumes. Acme says that it can change the color for the next shipments. MSU, furious,
cancels the contract anyway and refuses to pay anything for the books. Acme sues.
Evidence shows that not more than five out 100 Shorthorn fans can actually tell the
difference between the two colors. Was MSU's rejection proper? Does it owe anything
to Acme if Acme sues for nonpayment?

Problem 21.3

         Leigh is a lawyer who has just been elected to the partnership of a large
international law firm, where she expects to make a great deal of money over the next
several years. To celebrate, she goes to Rich Motors, a trendy downtown Jaguar
automobile dealer. "After checking out all of the options, she orders the car of her
dreams, a brand-new Jaguar F-type V8S, in British racing green, with a black
convertible top, 20" blade wheels, leather performance seats, Meridian surround-
sound system, camel carpets, heated sport leather steering wheel, heated windshield,
wind deflector, and alloy spare wheel. The parties agree on a price of $125,500, with
delivery to be made on June 1. Leigh puts down a $12,250 deposit. On June 1, Leigh
calls Rich to ask about the car. She is told it has been delayed for a few days. Rich
calls a few days later to say that it will be delivered on June 8. Leigh goes down to
Rich Motors to take possession. As she looks over the car, she sees an eight-inch
scratch in the middle of the shiny green hood. The scratch goes down to the metal and
is very noticeable. Rich says it will repair the scratch so that "no one can ever tell it
was there." Leigh, nevertheless, rejects the car, saying that she wanted a new mint-
condition car. She demands her deposit back. Rich refuses. Leigh sues for return of
her deposit, arguing that Rich breached the contract. What result and why?

Problem 21.4

         Silicon Micro is a manufacturer of microprocessors used in sophisticated
electronics devices. Dull Computer is a manufacturer of personal computers. Dull has
bought processors from SM for several years. It places an order for 50,000 SM-505
processors for delivery on August 1. SM sends a written confirmation. When the order
reaches SM's production facility, however, it turns out that SM has only 25,000 of the
SM-505s in stock. But it has plenty of the faster, more powerful (and more expensive)
SM-605 processors in stock. So SM ships the 505s it has in stock along with 25,000 of
the 605s, assuming that Dull will be willing to accept the faster, more powerful

______________________________________________________________________________

UNIT 21: STANDARDS OF CONTRACT PERFORMANCE  449
processor for the same price as the 505s. When the shipment reaches Dull on July 28,
however, it turns out that the 605s will not work in the specific low-end models Dull
wants them for because they will not run the old operating system. Dull accepts all
the 505s but rejects all the 605s. SM immediately offers to send a shipment of 505s
to fix the problem. This new shipment would arrive in plenty of time for Dull to use
them, but Dull--which has in the meantime received a lower price on 505-equivalent
processors from Feng Shui Electronics Ltd. of Taiwan, refuses. When SM
subsequently sues Dull for improper rejection, what result? Be sure that UCC
sections 2-508 and 2-601 figure prominently in your answer.

Excused Performance

                              FOCUS OF THIS UNIT

         When Bad Things Happen to Good Contracts. By this point, you should
understand that if a party has a duty under a valid contract and fails to perform the
contract in a satisfactory manner, the contracting party is liable for breach. But what
happens if a party's failure to perform is caused by something totally beyond its
control? Suppose, for example, you agree to lease a house for a year to a tenant, and
the day before she moves in a tornado destroys the house. Are you liable for breach
of your contract with the tenant? On the other hand, is she liable to you for the rent
even though the place has been destroyed?

         Original Strict-Liability Standard. The common law has struggled with and
changed its position on these questions over the years. Originally, contracts were
strict-liability undertakings. If a party failed to perform for any reason, then he was
liable for breach. Thus, in the famous English case of Paradine v. Jane, 82 Eng. Rep.
897 (K.B. 1647), a tenant had rented an estate. Subsequently, he was forcibly evicted
from the estate by Royalist troops during the English Civil War, who kept him out of
possession for nearly two years. The tenant refused to pay rent to the owner because
the tenant could not have possession, making the contract worthless to him. The court
held, nonetheless, that the tenant was obliged to pay the full rent, and would have
had to do so even if the whole place had burned down or been swallowed by the sea.
This strict-liability doctrine, however, began to change in the middle of the
nineteenth century. By the early part of the twentieth century, two English cases
establishing doctrines of excused performance had become highly influential in the
United States.

         Origin of "Impossibility of Performance" as an Excuse. The first of these two
cases was Taylor v. Caldwell, 122 Eng. Rep. 309 (1863), in which a concert promoter
had hired a venue called the Surrey Gardens for a major fête. Unfortunately, the
Gardens were totally destroyed by fire shortly before the event was to take place. The
promoter sued on the ground that the owners were in breach for failing to provide the

______________________________________________________________________________

UNIT 22: EXCUSED PERFORMANCE                      451
venue. Under Paradine v. Jane, this argument looked like a winner. Yet the court
held for the owners. It relied on some earlier cases that held when a horse died or a
ship sank, a contract for the item's sale was automatically canceled because the
subject of the contract no longer existed. The court reasoned that that the existence
of the Gardens as a venue was a basic condition under which the contract was formed.
Thus, because destruction of the Gardens made it "impossible" to perform, the owners
were excused from performance.

         Origin of "Frustration of Purpose" as an Excuse. The second case, Krell v.
Henry, [1903] 2 KB 740, involved the biggest public spectacle of its day, the coronation
of King Edward VII in 1902. Krell was the owner of a flat on Pall Mall in London,
which was directly on the coronation route and would provide excellent viewing of the
festivities. Henry rented the flat from Krell for the dates of June 26-27, 1902, paying
an amount greatly in excess of the flat's ordinary rental rate. The problem was that
the new King got sick and the whole event was canceled and rescheduled for August,
which meant that Henry did not need the rooms. He refused to pay the bulk of the
rental, and Krell sued. Relying on The Moorcock (discussed in our previous unit on
implied terms) for the proposition that terms could be implied into contracts, and on
Taylor v. Caldwell, the court held that Henry was excused from performance. A basic
assumption of both contracting parties was that the coronation parade would be held;
there would have otherwise been no contract. When the parade was canceled, Henry's
entire purpose for entering into the contract was frustrated.

         Modern Excuses from Performance. Note the distinction between Taylor and
Krell. In a sense, they are two sides of the same coin. The argument in Taylor was
that the party could not perform--the Surrey Gardens hall was destroyed. The
argument in Krell was that while the party could perform, there was no longer any
reason to do so. These two concepts exist today in American contract law as the
doctrines of "impracticability of performance"--originally and still sometimes called
"impossibility of performance"--and "frustration of purpose."

         As you read the following materials and work through the problems, you may
want to consult the fairly extensive set of impracticability and frustration rules found
in sections 261 through 272 of the Restatement (Second) of Contracts. The core
section on impracticability of performance is section 261, while the core section on
frustration of purpose is section 265.

Sales and Service Agreement" which established Wendt as a dealer of IH goods in the
area of Marlette, Michigan. The agreement set forth the required method of sale,
provisions for the purchase and servicing of goods, as well as certain dealer operating
requirements. The agreement also provided specific provisions for the termination of
the contract upon the occurrence of certain specified conditions.

         In light of a dramatic recession in the farm equipment market, and substantial
losses on the part of IH, IH [in 1985] negotiated an agreement with J.I. Case Co. and
Tenneco Inc. to sell its farm equipment division to Case/Tenneco. The sale took the
form of a sale of assets. The base purchase price was $246,700,000 in cash and
$161,300,000 to be paid in participating preferred stock in Tenneco. While IH asserts
that it lost $479,000,000 on the deal, it also noted that this was a "paper loss" which
will result in a tax credit offsetting the loss.

         In its purchase of IH's farm equipment division, Case/Tenneco did not acquire
IH's existing franchise network.1 Rather, it received "access" to IH dealers, many of
whom eventually received a Case franchise. However, there were some 400 "conflicted
areas" in which both a Case and an IH dealership were located. In these areas Case
offered only one franchise contract. In nearly two-thirds of the conflicted areas, the
IH dealer received the franchise. However, Marlette, Michigan was such a "conflicted
area" and Wendt was not offered a Case franchise.

         Wendt filed this action alleging breach of IH's Dealer Agreement and several
other causes of action, but all Wendt's allegations save the breach of contract action
were disposed of before trial. IH filed a counter-claim against Wendt for debts arising
out of farm equipment and parts advanced to Wendt on credit.

          1 [If Case and Tenneco had bought the corporation that was International Harvester's farm
equipment division, it would have inherited all of IH's contracts, including that with Wendt. By
purchasing only the assets of IH's farm equipment division (i.e., not the entity but simply its real,
personal, and intellectual property), Case did not assume any of the contractual liabilities. IH's sale of
its assets did not automatically terminate any of its contractual liabilities, which means that Wendt's
contract remained with IH. That is why IH is the defendant in this lawsuit, as Wendt never had a
contract with Case.-Eds.]

UNIT 22: EXCUSED PERFORMANCE  453
         At trial, the court allowed IH's defense of impracticability of performance to go
to the jury on the contract action. The jury returned a verdict of no cause of action on
the contract and the district court denied Wendt's motion for J.N.O.V./new trial,
which was based on the invalidity of the impracticability defense. In addition,
however, the court ordered a directed verdict for Wendt as to IH's defenses of
frustration of purpose.

         Wendt asserts a number of errors surrounding the district court's allowing the
defense of impracticability of performance to go to the jury. Wendt first contends that
the defense of impracticability due to extreme changes in market conditions is not a
cognizable defense under Michigan law. In the alternative, Wendt argues that there
was insufficient evidence to withstand Wendt's motion for a directed verdict on
impracticability.

         Wendt first contends that impracticability is only cognizable under Michigan
law as a defense to contracts for sale of goods governed by the UCC For this
contention, Wendt cites Cleveland-Cliffs Iron Co. v. Chicago & Northwestern Trans.
Co., 581 F. Supp. 1144, 1151 (W.D. Mich. 1984), which suggested that the defenses of
frustration of purpose and impracticability were only available as defense to an action
under Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. § 440.2615 [Michigan's version of UCC § 2-615], and
were not available in situations where a party alleged that the contract had become
unprofitable due to a change in market conditions.

         The district court found that Cleveland-Cliffs incorrectly stated Michigan law.
The court asserted that the Michigan Supreme Court's recognition of the doctrine of
impossibility [in common law actions before 1964] was not altered by its adoption of
the UCC in 1964 and further that the doctrine of impossibility was broadened by the
Michigan Court of Appeals in Bissell v. L.W. Edison Co., 156 N.W.2d 623 (Mich. Ct.
App. 1967), to excuse future performance when circumstances make performance
impracticable. Thus, as the district court put it,

     The relevant question is not whether the doctrine of impossibility as
     defined by the Michigan Supreme Court remains valid. . . . [Rather,] the
     only issue in dispute is whether the Michigan Supreme Court would
     adopt the doctrine of impracticability of performance embraced by the
     Court of Appeals in Bissell.

     We find that the district court properly framed the question presented here.

         Generally, under Michigan law, "economic unprofitableness [sic] is not the
equivalent to impossibility of performance. Subsequent events which in the nature of
things do not render performance impossible, but only render it more difficult,
burdensome, or expensive, will not operate to relieve [a party of its contractual
obligations]." Chase v. Clinton County, 217 N.W. 565, 567 (Mich. 1928).

         In Bissell, the Michigan Court of Appeals, relying on [the first] Restatement of
Contracts § 457, concluded that the doctrine of impossibility is a valid defense not

______________________________________________________________________________

454  CHAPTER VII: PERFORMANCE AND BREACH
only when performance is impossible, but also when supervening circumstances make
performance impracticable. Section 457, now § 261 of the Restatement (Second) of
Contracts (1981) provides:

         Discharge by Supervening Impracticability.

         Where, after a contract is made, a party's performance is made
         impracticable without his fault by the occurrence of an event the non-
         occurrence of which was a basic assumption on which the contract was
         made, his duty to render that performance is discharged, unless the
         language or the circumstances indicate the contrary.

         Although Bissell did not involve non-performance due to economic causes, the
court relied extensively on § 457 which defines impossibility to include, "not only
strict impossibility but impracticability because of extreme and unreasonable
difficulty, expense, injury and loss involved." Bissell, 156 N.W. 2d at 626. In the
instant case the district court relied heavily on the language of § 457 quoted in Bissell
to conclude that the extreme downturn in the market for farm products was
"unreasonable and extreme" enough to present a jury question as to the defense under
Michigan law.

         Recognizing that Bissell suggests that an impracticability defense may be
cognizable under Michigan law in some circumstances, we must turn to the question
of whether under Michigan law, the defense of impracticability was appropriately
presented to the jury under the circumstances involving a dramatic downturn in the
market for farm equipment which led to the contract action before us in this case.
The commentary to § 261 of the Restatement (Second) provides extensive guidance
for determining when economic circumstances are sufficient to render performance
impracticable. Comment d makes clear that mere lack of profit under the contract is
insufficient:

         "Impracticability" means more than "impracticality." A mere change in
         the degree of difficulty or expense due to such causes as increased wages,
         prices of raw materials or costs of construction, unless well beyond the
         normal range, does not amount to impracticability since it is this sort of
         risk that a fixed price contract is intended to cover.

Comment d also provides:

         A severe shortage of raw materials or of supplies due to war, embargo,
         local crop failure, unforeseen shutdown of major sources of supply, or
         the like, which either causes a marked increase in cost or prevents
         performance altogether may bring the case within the rule stated in this
         Section.

More guidance is provided in Comment b:

______________________________________________________________________________

UNIT 22: EXCUSED PERFORMANCE  455
     In order for a supervening event to discharge a duty under this Section,
     the non-occurrence of that event must have been a "basic assumption"
     on which both parties made the contract.

Comment b goes on to provide that the application of the "basic assumption"
criteria

     is also simple enough in the cases of market shifts or the financial
     inability of one of the parties. The continuation of existing market
     conditions and of the financial situation of one of the parties are
     ordinarily not such assumptions, so that mere market shifts or financial
     inability do not usually effect discharge under the rule stated in this
     Section.

         Comment b also provides two helpful examples. In Illustration 3, A contracts
to employ B for two years at a set salary. After one year a government regulation
makes A's business unprofitable and he fires B. A's duty to employ B is not discharged
due to impracticability and A is liable for breach. In Illustration 4, A contracts to sell
B a machine to be delivered by a certain date. Due to a suit by a creditor, all of A's
assets are placed in receivership. A is not excused for non-performance under the
doctrine of impracticability.

         In our view, section 261 requires a finding that impracticability is an
inappropriate defense in this case. The fact that IH experienced a dramatic downturn
in the farm equipment market and decided to go out of the business does not excuse
its unilateral termination of its dealership agreements due to impracticability. IH
argues that while mere unprofitability should not excuse performance, the
substantial losses and dramatic market shift in the farm equipment market between
1980 and 1985 warrant the special application of the defense in this case. IH cites
losses of over $2,000,000 per day and a drop in the company's standing on the Fortune
500 list from 27 to 104. IH also put on evidence that if it had not sold its farm
equipment division, it might have had to declare bankruptcy. While the facts suggest
that IH suffered severely from the downturn in the farm equipment market, neither
market shifts nor the financial inability of one of the parties changes the basic
assumptions of the contract such that it may be excused under the doctrine of
impracticability. Rest. 2d § 261 cmt b. To hold otherwise would not fulfill the likely
understanding of the parties as to the apportionment of risk under the contract. The
agreement provides in some detail the procedure and conditions for termination. IH
may not have been entirely responsible for the economic downturn in the company,
but it was responsible for its chosen remedy: to sell its farm equipment assets. An
alternative would have been to terminate its Dealer Agreements by mutual assent
under the termination provisions of the contract and share the proceeds of the sale of
assets to Case/Tenneco with its dealers. Thus, we find that IH had alternatives which
could have precluded unilateral termination of the contract. Further, application of
the impracticability defense in this case would allow IH to avoid its liability under

______________________________________________________________________________

456  CHAPTER VII: PERFORMANCE AND BREACH
franchise agreements, allow Case/Tenneco to pick up only those dealerships its sees
fit and leave the remaining dealers bankrupt. In such circumstance, application of
the doctrine of impracticability would not only be a misapplication of law, but a
windfall for IH at the expense of the dealers.

         In the end, IH simply asserts that it would have been unprofitable to terminate
its agreements with its dealers by invoking the six-month notice and other
termination procedures embodied in the Dealer Agreement, or by sharing the
proceeds of its sale of its farm equipment assets with dealers. This assertion does not
excuse IH's performance under the agreement.

         We hold that while the Supreme Court of Michigan might recognize the defense
of impracticability, it would not do so in the circumstances of this case as a matter of
law.

         In its cross-appeal, IH asserts that the court improperly granted a directed
verdict for Wendt on IH's defense of frustration of purpose.

         It is undisputed that Michigan law recognizes the defense of frustration of
purpose. See Molnar v. Molnar, 313 N.W.2d 171, 173 (Mich. Ct. App. 1981) (allowing
the defense of frustration of purpose in a suit to discontinue child support payments
when the beneficiary child died). However, the district court in the instant case
determined that the defense was unavailable. In making this determination, the
court relied on § 265 of the Restatement (Second) of Contracts, which provides:

         Where, after a contract is made, a party's principal purpose is
         substantially frustrated without his fault by the occurrence of an event
         the non-occurrence of which was a basic assumption on which the
         contract was made, his remaining duties to render performance are
         discharged, unless the language or the circumstances indicate the
         contrary.

         In interpreting this provision, the district court relied on the Supreme Court
of South Dakota's analysis of this same defense when raised by IH in a suit by a
dealer for breach of the same dealer agreement in Groseth International. v. Tenneco,
410 N.W.2d 159 (S.D. 1987).

         In Groseth, the court found that under the Restatement (Second), the defense
of frustration requires the establishment of three factors. The first is that the purpose
frustrated by the supervening event must have been the "principal purpose" of the
party making the contract. Quoting § 265, comment a, the court noted,

         It is not enough that [the contracting party] had in mind a specific object
         without which he would not have made the contract. The object must be
         so completely the basis of the contract that, as both parties understand,
         without it the transaction would make little sense.

______________________________________________________________________________

UNIT 22: EXCUSED PERFORMANCE  457
         The court interpreted this passage to require an inquiry into the principal
purpose of the contract and a finding that the frustrating event destroys the primary
basis of the contract.

         According to the Groseth court, the second factor required under the
Restatement is that the frustration be "substantial." Once again quoting comment a
to section 265, the court stated:

         It is not enough that the transaction has become less profitable for the
         affected party or even that he will sustain a loss. The frustration must
         be so severe that it is not fairly to be regarded as within the risks that
         he assumed under the contract.

The court added, "the fact that performance has become economically burdensome or
unattractive is not sufficient to excuse performance."

         Finally, according to Groseth, the third factor required to make out a defense
of frustration under the Restatement is that the frustrating event must have been a
"basic assumption" of the contract. In analyzing this element, comment a states that
the analysis is the same as under the defense of impracticability.

         Applying these three factors in the instant case, the district court found that
the primary purpose of the Dealer Agreement was stated in section 1 of the
agreement. Section 1 provides,

         The general purposes of the agreement are to establish the dealer of
         goods covered by this agreement, and to govern the relations between
         the dealer and the company in promoting the sale of those goods and
         their purchase and sale by the dealer, and in providing warranty and
         other service for their users.

         The court interpreted this language to mean that the primary purpose of the
agreement was to establish the dealership and the terms of interaction and was not
"mutual profitability" as asserted by IH. Therefore, the court reasoned that a
dramatic down-turn in the farm equipment market resulting in reduced profitability
did not frustrate the primary purpose of the agreement. The court went on to suggest
that continuity of market conditions or the financial situation of the parties were not
basic assumptions or implied conditions to the enforcement of a contract. Thus,
following Groseth, it held that the doctrine of frustration was not applicable to this
case.

         IH does not offer any arguments which challenge the correctness of the Groseth
decision or the district court's analysis. Rather, IH challenges the court's finding that
the primary purpose of the contract was not "mutual profitability." In our view, the
district court had substantial grounds for so finding and we affirm the district court's
grant of a directed verdict for Wendt on the frustration defense. If IH's argument
were to be accepted, the "primary purpose" analysis under the Restatement would

______________________________________________________________________________

458  CHAPTER VII: PERFORMANCE AND BREACH
essentially be meaningless as "mutual profitability" would be implied as the primary
purpose of every contract. Rather, like the doctrine of impracticability, the doctrine
of frustration is an equitable doctrine which is meant to fairly apportion risks
between the parties in light of unforeseen circumstances. It is essentially an implied
term which is meant to apportion risk as the parties would have had the necessity
occurred to them. See Groseth, 410 N.W. 2d at 166. In this case, the frustrating event
was IH's decision to sell its farm equipment assets and go out of that line of business.
While IH might have determined that such a move was economically required, it may
not then assert that its obligation under existing agreements are discharged in light
of its decision.

         As the district court erred in allowing the defense of impracticability of
performance to go to the jury in this case under Michigan law, we REVERSE and
REMAND for a new trial only on the question of damages for IH's breach of its Dealer
Agreement with Wendt. With respect to all other assignments of error by the parties,
we AFFIRM.

RYAN, J., dissenting.

         The court has held that the district court erred in submitting the defendants'
defense of impracticability of performance to the jury. I disagree.

         The court concedes, correctly I think, that the Michigan Supreme Court
"might" recognize the impracticability doctrine, but the court says, "it would not do
so in the circumstances of this case as a matter of law." Despite the court's use of the
verb "might," I assume it means the Michigan Supreme Court, in all probability,
"would," if asked, adopt the doctrine of impracticability of performance as defined in
Restatement (Second) of Contracts § 261. In declaring that the Michigan Supreme
Court would not apply the doctrine "in the circumstances of this case," I take the court
to mean the "facts" of this case. The court cannot mean that the impracticability
doctrine can never be applied in a case involving unforeseeable, extreme, and
unreasonable economic circumstances. There is simply no authority to be found in
the Michigan cases, or indeed in the commentary to § 261, to suggest that no change
in economic circumstances, no matter how catastrophic, would ever be sufficient to
invoke the impracticability defense. Indeed, the majority opinion observes that the
commentary to § 261 "provides extensive guidance for determining when economic
circumstances are sufficient to render performance impracticable."

It appears that the majority opinion rejects the impracticability defense "in the

circumstances of this case" because, in the court's view, the economic reverses

confronted by IH were not so "extreme and unreasonable," severe, or catastrophic as

to excuse performance of the franchise agreement with the plaintiffs. Although

claiming to recognize that whether impracticability of performance has been proved

is a question of fact for the jury, Michigan Bean Co. v. Senn, 287 N.W.2d 257 (Mich.

1979), the court appears to disagree with the jury that IH was confronted with

______________________________________________________________________________

UNIT 22: EXCUSED PERFORMANCE  459
economic circumstances sufficiently disastrous to justify discharge for
impracticability. There were "alternatives," the court says, "which might have
precluded unilateral termination of the contract."

         Whether the "alternative" the court suggests ever occurred to IH's
management, or, if considered, was a feasible business solution, is entirely irrelevant
on this appeal because it is the jury, not this court, that is empowered to determine
whether IH proved impracticability of performance as that defense was defined by
the trial court.

         Since there is nothing in the jurisprudence of the impracticability defense to
suggest that a market collapse of the kind shown by IH is not, as a matter of law,
within the doctrine, we are not free to disturb the jury's verdict.

                                           _____________________

         Review Question 1. "Impracticability" seems to mean something more than
the prospect of losing lots and lots of money and going bankrupt as a result, but it
also seems to mean something less than performance of a contract being literally
impossible. What exactly is impracticability? What sort of additional facts can you
imagine where, if International Harvester had proven them, it could have reached
the jury in impracticability?

         Review Question 2. The excuse of "frustration of purpose requires proof of "the
occurrence of an event the non-occurrence of which was a basic assumption on which
the contract was made." At the time of its 1974 dealership agreement with Karl
Wendt Farm Equipment, International Harvester surely assumed that it would
maintain the farm equipment division it sold in 1985. Why, then, does International
Harvester not succeed in proving frustration of purpose?

VITALIANO, J.

         Dreams of a honeymoon safari in East Africa dashed offer fresh evidence of
how the terror attack on the World Trade Center of September 11, 2001 has shredded
the lives of ordinary New Yorkers and has engendered still continuing reverberations
in decisional law. What might have ordinarily warranted summary disposition in
favor of the safari company and its travel agent, pinning on the traveler the economic
burden of trip cancellation, cannot, in the wake of September 11th, be sustained here
on their motion for summary judgment.

______________________________________________________________________________

460            CHAPTER VII: PERFORMANCE AND BREACH
         Defendant Taicoa Corporation, doing business as Micato Safaris,
acknowledges that plaintiff Alexandra Bush contacted Micato about booking a safari.
By its admission, Micato referred the plaintiff to defendant ProTravel International,
Inc., a retail travel agent, to arrange for a reservation on one of the various safaris
offered by Micato. It is undisputed that, on or about May 8, 2001, the plaintiff booked
an African safari travel package for herself and her fiancé through ProTravel with
Micato. At that time, it is also undisputed, the plaintiff gave ProTravel an initial 20%
deposit in the amount of $1,516. Micato admits that it received the plaintiff's deposit
from ProTravel on May 15, 2001. The safari Alexandra Bush selected for husband to
be and herself was scheduled to begin on November 14, 2001.

         Sixty-four days before the safari's start, September 11, 2001, the world, as we
knew it, came to an end. As a result of the attack on the World Trade Center, other
terrorism alerts and airline scares, the plaintiff and her fiancé decided almost
immediately to cancel their trip. Further, the plaintiff claims, she endeavored to
notify ProTravel of her decision, but, as a result of the interruption of telephone
service between Staten Island, where she had fled to safety, and Manhattan, where
ProTravel maintained an office in midtown, she was physically unable to
communicate her cancellation order until September 27, 2001. ProTravel agrees that
the plaintiff did contact it that day and avers it passed along her request to Micato
orally and in writing. Micato acknowledged receiving a fax from ProTravel to that
effect on October 4, 2001. Thereafter, when the defendants refused to return her
deposit, Alexandra Bush sued in this action to get it back.

         The defendants, by their Manhattan and Massachusetts counsel, now move for
summary judgment dismissing this action.

         The defendants' motion hangs on a registration form. A copy of a completed
form executed by Alexandra Bush was annexed to the moving affidavits of Joseph
Traversa and Patricia Buffolano. Mr. Traversa, the employee of ProTravel who made
the plaintiff's travel arrangements, states that the plaintiff completed and signed the
form when she booked the safari on May 8, 2001. The form contained the following
provision: "I confirm that I have read and agree to the Terms and Conditions as
outlined in our brochure." Also annexed to the moving affidavits was an excerpt the
defendants contend was in the "brochure" referenced in the registration form, and
which the plaintiff claims she never received, setting forth Micato's cancellation
policy for the safari booked by Ms. Bush. The policy imposes a $50 per person penalty
for a cancellation occurring more than 60 days prior to departure. For a cancellation
occurring between 30 and 60 days prior to departure, the traveler was subject to a
penalty equal to 20% of the total retail tour rate. There is no disagreement that the
deposit given by the plaintiff was in an amount equal to 20% of the tour rate.

         With a departure date of November 14, 2001, for Alexandra Bush the days of
moment under the cancellation policy were September 14, 2001 and October 15, 2001.

______________________________________________________________________________

UNIT 22: EXCUSED PERFORMANCE  461
A cancellation order given by her on or before September 14, 2001, the 61st day prior
to departure, would have subjected her to, at worst, a $50 per person, i.e., a $100
penalty. Any cancellation after that date but on or before October 15, 2001 would
subject her to the greater 20% penalty under the cancellation policy. Using either the
September 27, 2001 date Mr. Traversa admits ProTravel received Ms. Bush's notice
of cancellation or the October 4, 2001 date Micato's general manager, Patricia
Buffolano, claims in her affidavit that Micato received written confirmation of the
cancellation from ProTravel, the plaintiff's trip cancellation came within the 30- to
60-day prior to departure window that would trigger a 20% penalty for cancellation.
On the strength of those facts, neither defendant returned the deposit to Alexandra
Bush and both now seek summary judgment dismissing her claim.

         Without conceding that the cancellation policy the defendants advance as their
sword and buckler is either valid or binding on her, Ms. Bush states in her affidavit
submitted in opposition to the motion that, beginning on September 12, 2001 and
continuing for days thereafter, she attempted to contact the travel agency and that
due to difficulties with telephone lines, access to Manhattan and closures of its office,
she was unable to speak to someone from ProTravel until September 27, 2001. All of
the phone calls made by the plaintiff to ProTravel were placed from Staten Island.
While ProTravel's reply affidavit protests that it was open for business from
September 12th and onward and supplies phone records to show its phones were able
to make and receive calls, no evidence is offered to dispute the plaintiff's claim that
it was virtually impossible for many days after the terrorist attack to place a call from
Staten Island if such call was transmitted via the telephone trunk lines in downtown
Manhattan.

         In any event, the defendants ultimately argue that all of the horror, heartbreak
and hurdles for communications and commerce visited on Alexandra Bush and all
New Yorkers in the aftermath of September 11th doesn't matter, for the thrust of
their motion is that a contract is a contract, and that since the cancellation call was
received, at best, 13 days late, the plaintiff is not entitled, as a matter of law, to her
refund. In an equitable bolster to its position, the defendants also assert that Micato
imposes the cancellation penalties to cover costs which it incurs in planning and
preparing for a customer's safari. However, upon oral argument, defendants were
unable to set forth what, if any, expenses had been incurred towards plaintiff's trip,
nor when such expenses were incurred. Thereafter, the defendants submitted, in an
untimely manner, the further affidavit of Patricia Buffolano, dated June 7, 2002,
restating the contention that, prior to receiving notice that Ms. Bush wished to cancel
her trip, Micato was required to pay certain expenses. The affidavit, nonetheless, is
silent as to when these expenses, and more specifically, whether any such expenses
were incurred on or before September 14, 2001, whether any were incurred between
September 14 and September 27, 2001 or whether any were incurred during the one-
week delay between the time ProTravel received notification of the cancellation,

______________________________________________________________________________

462  CHAPTER VII: PERFORMANCE AND BREACH
September 27, 2001, and when Micato claims it received notification from ProTravel,
October 4, 2001.

         When the residue has been poured away, the issue distilled here is whether
the attack on the World Trade Center and the civil upset of its aftermath in the days
that immediately followed excuses Alexandra Bush's admittedly late notice of
cancellation. More to the point, given that effective cancellation on or before
September 14, 2001 would have absolved the plaintiff of the 20% cancellation penalty,
does Ms. Bush's sworn statement that she attempted to phone her cancellation notice
to ProTravel beginning on September 12, 2001 but did not get through until
September 27, 2001 raise a triable issue of fact, which, if resolved in her favor, entitles
her to relief from the cancellation penalty provision of the contract?

         It is in this context that the motion for summary judgment brought on by the
defendants must be considered and it is in this context that they, as the moving
parties, must demonstrate that there is no genuine issue of material fact and that
they are entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Since summary judgment deprives
the litigant of her day in court and is considered to be a drastic remedy, it should not
be granted where there is any doubt as to the existence of a material and triable issue
of fact.

         Though it is true that the black letter of the law establishes the rule that "once
a party to a contract has made a promise, that party must perform or respond in
damages for its failure, even when unforeseen circumstances make performance
burdensome," Kel Kim Corp. v. Central Markets. Inc., 519 N.E.2d 295, 296 (N.Y.
1987), the rule is not an absolute. Where the "means of performance" have been
nullified, making "performance objectively impossible," a party's performance under
a contract will be excused. Id. at 902.

         Counsel for the defendants at oral argument claimed to understand the
difficulties encountered by literally every New Yorker in the wake of the disaster at
the World Trade Center, but argue that those difficulties do not constitute a valid
excuse for the failure of the plaintiff to cancel the safari before September 15, 2001.
The delay until September 27, 2001, they contend, is inexcusable. Putting aside the
sheer insensitivity of their argument, the argument fails to come to grips with
Alexandra Bush's sworn claim that the disaster in lower Manhattan, which was
unforeseen, unforeseeable and, certainly, beyond her control, had effectively
destroyed her ability and means to communicate a timely cancellation under the
contract for safari travel she had booked through and with the defendants. To the
point, Alexandra Bush claims she could not physically take the steps necessary to
cancel on time. Micato and ProTravel, to the contrary, claim she was simply a traveler
too skittish to travel after September 11th, who wanted to stick the travel
professionals she had retained with the bill for her faint heart. Should the defendants
establish that to be the case to the satisfaction of the jury or at a bench trial, they will

be entitled to judgment. They certainly have not established that as a matter of law
now.

         Furthermore, the plaintiff's claim of excuse because of the frustration of the
means of performance is supported, underscored and punctuated by the official
actions taken by civil authorities on September 11, 2001 and in the days that followed.
On the day of the attack, a state of emergency had been declared by the Mayor of the
City of New York, directing the New York City Commissioners of Police, Fire and
Health and the Director of Emergency Management to "take whatever steps are
necessary to preserve the public safety and to render all required and available
assistance to protect the security, well-being and health of the residents of the City."

follows:

                     PROCLAMATION OF A STATE OF EMERGENCY
          Date: September 11, 2001

                     § 1. Pursuant to the powers vested in me by Executive Law § 24, I hereby
          declare a State of Emergency.

                     § 2. This State of Emergency has been declared because of terrorist attacks on
          the World Trade Center causing a great many deaths, injuries and extensive damage
          to buildings and infrastructure in Lower Manhattan. These conditions imperil the
          public safety.

                                b. The occupancy and use of buildings in the following areas is
                     prohibited: Manhattan-Below 14th Street, except for emergency or essential
                     personnel who have been authorized by the Police Commissioner, Fire
                     Commissioner or the Director of Emergency Management.

                                . . .
                     § 4. I hereby direct the Police, Fire and Health Commissioners and the Director
          of Emergency Management to take whatever steps are necessary to preserve the public
          safety and to render all required and available assistance to protect the security, well-
          being and health of the residents of the City.
                     § 5. Any person who knowingly violates any provision of this Order is guilty of
          a class B misdemeanor.
                     § 6. This Order shall take effect immediately. It shall remain in effect for 5
          days unless it is terminated at an earlier date.

         Particularly on the days at the focal point of the argument here, September 12,
13 and 14, 2001, New York City was in the state of virtual lockdown with travel either
forbidden altogether or severely restricted. Precedent is plentiful that contract

                     Declaring a Disaster Emergency in the State of New York
                     WHEREAS, unspeakable atrocities have occurred today in New York City, our
          nations's capital and Pennsylvania that have taken the lives and injured unknown
          numbers of innocent people and have caused calamitous and pervasive damage to
          property; and
                     WHEREAS, these events appear to be deliberate and coordinated acts of
          terrorism committed by despicable and cowardly persons or groups unknown;
                     NOW, THEREFORE, I GEORGE E. PATAKI, Governor of the State of New
          York, do hereby find that a disaster has occurred for which the affected local
          governments are unable to respond adequately. Therefore, pursuant to the authority
          vested in me by the Constitution and the Laws of the State of New York, including
          Section 28 of Article 2-B of the Executive Law, I hereby declare a State Disaster
          Emergency effective September 11, 2001 within the territorial boundaries of the State
          of New York;
                     FURTHER, pursuant to Section 29 of Article 2-B of the Executive Law, I direct
          the implementation of the State Disaster Preparedness Plan and authorize, effective
          September 11, 2001 and continuing, the State Emergency Management Office, the
          Department of Transportation, the New York State Thruway Authority, the State
          Police, the Division of Military and Naval Affairs, the Department of Environmental

          Prevention and Control, the Department of Labor, the Office of Parks, Recreation and
          Historic Preservation and all other State agencies and authorities over which I exercise
          Executive authority to take all appropriate actions to assist in every way all persons
          killed or injured and their families, and protect state property and to assist those
          affected local governments and individuals in responding to and recovering from this
          disaster, and to provide such other assistance as necessary to protect the public health
          and safety; and
                     FURTHER, I have designated Edward F. Jacoby, Jr., Director of the State
          Emergency Management Office (SEMO) as the State Coordinating Officer for this
          disaster.

performance is excused when unforeseeable government action makes such
performance objectively impossible. See A&S Transp. Co. v. County of Nassau, 546
N.Y.S.2d 109 (Sup. Ct. App. Div. 1989); Metpath, Inc. v. Birmingham Fire Insurance
Co., 449 N.Y.S.2d 986 (Sup. Ct. App. Div. 1982). Further, in the painful recognition
of the obvious and extraordinary dimensions of the disaster that prevented the
transaction of even the most time sensitive business during the days and weeks that
followed the September 11th atrocities, the Governor even issued an executive order
extending the statute of limitations for all civil actions in every court of our state for
a period well beyond the times Alexandra Bush claims to have communicated her
cancellation and Micato acknowledges it received it. Executive Order [Pataki] No.
113.7, 9 N.Y.C.R.R. 5.113.7 (2001).4 In such light, to even hint that Alexandra Bush
has failed to raise a triable issue of fact by her argument that the doctrine of
impossibility excuses her late cancellation of the safari she booked through ProTravel
with Micato borders on the frivolous.

         It is not hyperbole to suggest that on September 11, 2001, and the days that
immediately followed, the City of New York was on a wartime footing, dealing with
wartime conditions. The continental United States had seen nothing like it since the
Civil War and, inflicted by a foreign foe, not since the War of 1812. Accordingly, it is
entirely appropriate for this court to consider and follow wartime precedents which
developed the law of temporary impossibility. Stated succinctly, where a supervening
act creates a temporary impossibility, particularly of brief duration, the impossibility
may be viewed as merely excusing performance until it subsequently becomes
possible to perform rather than excusing performance altogether. See generally

          4 The Governor's Executive Order [provides] as follows:
                     I hereby temporarily suspend, from the date the disaster emergency was

          declared . . . until further notice, the following laws:
                     Section 201 of the Civil Practice Law and Rules, so far as it bars actions whose

          limitation period concludes during the period commencing from the date that the
          disaster emergency was declared pursuant to Executive Order Number 113, issued on
          September 11, 2001, until further notice, and so far as it limits a courts authority to
          extend such time, whether or not the time to commence such an action is specified in
          Article 2 of the Civil Practice Law and Rules;

                     Section 5513 of the Civil Practice Law and Rules, so far as it relates to a
          limitation period that concludes during the period commencing from the date that the
          disaster emergency was declared pursuant to Executive Order Number 113, issued on
          September 11, 2001;

                     . . .
                     In addition, I hereby temporarily suspend and modify, for the period from the
          date of this Executive Order until further notice, any other statute, local law,
          ordinance, order, rule or regulation or part thereof, establishing limitations of time for
          the filing or service of any legal action, notice or other process or proceeding . . . .
By his amended order of October 4, 2001, the Governor extended the suspension of the statutes of
limitation through October 12, 2001, giving yet additional factual support to the disaster conditions
still obtaining in New York City at that time.

______________________________________________________________________________

466  CHAPTER VII: PERFORMANCE AND BREACH
Annotation, Modern Status of the Rules Regarding Impossibility of Performance in
Action for Breach of Contract, 84 A.LR.2d 12, § 14 [a].

         The law of temporary and/or partial impossibility flows from the theory that
when a promisor has obligated himself to perform certain acts, which, when taken
together are impossible, the promisor should not be excused from being "called upon
to perform insofar as he is able to do so." Miller v. Vanderlip, 33 N.E.2d 51 (N.Y.
1941). The First Department's opinion in the World War I era case of Erdreich v.
Zimmermann, 179 N.Y.S. 829 (Sup. Ct. App. Div. 1920]) is extremely instructive. In
Edreich, the plaintiff purchased German war bonds, which, at the time of purchase
on December 14, 1916, was entirely lawful since the United States had not yet entered
the conflict. Because of the war, however, the bonds could not be delivered due to a
naval blockade. In April 1917, after a state of war had been declared between the
United States and Germany, the plaintiff demanded his money back for the defendant
seller's failure to deliver the bonds. Almost two years later, with the bonds essentially
worthless, the plaintiff sued for rescission and return of his purchase payment.
Appellate Term held that the delivery of the bonds, though legally contracted for,
would have been unlawful under wartime rules and, therefore, the contract should
have been rescinded for impossibility. The Appellate Division reversed, holding that
"at most, performance of [the] contract was suspended during the existence of
hostilities" and the performance, which had been temporarily excused for
impossibility during hostilities, was now required. The plaintiff was entitled,
therefore, to his worthless bonds, but not the return of his purchase payment. This
holding is in harmony with even earlier precedents acknowledging the fog of war and
its upset of civil society:

         Where performance can be had, without contravening the laws of
war, the existence of the contract is not imperiled, and even if
performance is impossible, the contract may still, when partly executed,
be preserved by ingrafting necessary qualifications upon it, or
suspending its impossible provisions [i.e., physical impossibility to
cancel timely] . . . . If the contract . . . can be saved while the war lasts,
it should be.

Mutual Benefit Life Ins. Co. v. Hillyard, 37 N.J.L. 444, 468-469 (1874).

         So too here, if Alexandra Bush can establish objective impossibility of
performance at trial, she is entitled to, at minimum, a reasonable suspension of her
contractual obligation to timely cancel, if not outright excuse of her untimely
cancellation.

Clearly, the plaintiff has raised, in any event, sufficient material issues of fact

concerning both her inability to cancel by September 15, 2001, the safari she had

booked and the reasonableness of her cancellation on September 27, 2001, all as a

result of the terrorist attack on the World Trade Center, the damage the attack

caused to communications and transportation in the City of New York and the actions
of government in declaring and enforcing a state of emergency in the city and beyond.

         Accordingly, the motion of defendants ProTravel and Micato for summary
judgment dismissing this action is denied in its entirety.

                                           _____________________

         Review Question 3. Why was impossibility (or impracticability) a viable
defense to failure to perform the contract in Bush v. ProTravel while the defense
failed in Karl Wendt Farm Equipment? The amount at stake in the farm equipment
case seems to be much more than was at issue in the safari honeymoon case. If the
amount of money at stake is not determinative, then what exactly does explain the
divergent results in the two cases?

         Review Question 4. The Bush court characterizes the defendants' argument
as being "that all of the horror, heartbreak and hurdles for communications and
commerce visited on Alexandra Bush and all New Yorkers in the aftermath of
September 11th" do not matter because "a contract is a contract." Should events as
extreme and unanticipated as those of 9/11 provide an all-purpose contract excuse?
Why or why not? Weren't there lots of outstanding contractual obligations involving
New Yorkers as of that date? Consider the next case when answering this question.

ANN D. MONTGOMERY, U.S.D.J.

         In 1999, Brad Gupta formed Ameriquest Holdings LLC. Gupta and his brother-
in-law are the sole shareholders of Ameriquest. In July 2000, Ameriquest purchased
a Boeing 737 from Bank of America Leasing and Capital. At the time of purchase, the
plane was leased to U.S. Airways under a lease scheduled to expire in April 2003.5 In

     5 [For tax, flexibility, and other reasons, airlines frequently choose not to own their planes, but

instead to lease them. Since aircraft manufacturers like Boeing prefer to sell, not lease, their planes,

third party lessors like Ameriquest, Bank of America Capital and GATX, buy planes and lease them

to airlines. The aircraft buyer/lessor profits from the difference between the lease payments it receives

from the airline and its loan payments to the lender who financed the purchase. In this case, it appears

that Bank of America and GATX wanted to sell their aircraft before the termination of the U.S.

Airways and Continental leases, so that someone else would have to worry about re-leasing the used

______________________________________________________________________________

468  CHAPTER VII: PERFORMANCE AND BREACH
order to finance the plane, Ameriquest borrowed $3,858,000 from Firstar Equipment
Finance. The loan terms included quarterly payments during the life of the U.S.
Airways lease, followed by a lump-sum "balloon" payment equal to the outstanding
balance when the lease expired in April 2003. Ameriquest and Firstar entered into a
Secured Loan Agreement which gave Firstar a security interest in the Ameriquest
Airplane. The Secured Loan Agreement gave Firstar the right to repossess and sell
the airplane in the event of default by Ameriquest. Moreover, the Secured Loan
Agreement required Ameriquest to obtain written consent from Firstar before re-
leasing the Ameriquest Airplane.

         Gupta acknowledged that during negotiations for the Ameriquest Airplane
loan, he and Firstar had conversations regarding how Ameriquest would remarket
the plane following the expiration of the U.S. Airways lease. However, there was no
explicit agreement that Firstar would allow Ameriquest to re-lease the airplane to a
foreign operator.

         Also in 2000, Gupta formed Ananya Aviation LLC, of which he is the sole
owner, in order to buy two MD-82 aircraft (the "Ananya Airplanes") from GATX
Capital Corporation ("GATX"). At the time they were purchased, the Ananya
Airplanes were leased to Continental Airlines. The leases were set to expire in
September 2002. Again, Firstar provided financing for the Ananya Airplanes. Before
the completion of the Ananya Airplanes loan, Gupta exchanged e-mails with Scott
McCann, a Firstar loan officer, regarding the prospects for re-leasing the Ananya
Airplanes following the expiration of the Continental Airlines lease. In an e-mail to
McCann dated November 2, 2000, Gupta indicated that he would attempt to market
the Ananya Airplanes to operators around the world. In response, McCann informed
Gupta that Firstar only financed equipment used domestically. He did indicate a
possibility that Firstar might change its policy by the time the Continental Airlines
leases expired. However, Gupta testified he understood at the time the loan closed
Firstar's policy was to finance airplanes used domestically.

         Four months following the e-mail exchange, Firstar made two loans to Ananya,
one for each of the Ananya Airplanes. On March 22, 2001, the loans closed in the
amounts of $5,610,380.59 and $5,004,047.26. Similar to the Ameriquest Airplane
lease, these loans required quarterly payments and a lump-sum balloon payment
following the expiration of the Continental Airlines leases in September 2002.
Firstar's prior approval before a new lease was entered was required by the Secured
Loan Agreements entered into for the Ananya Airplanes just as it had been under the
Secured Loan Agreement entered into with regard to the Ameriquest Airplane.

aircraft. Transactions such as these are popular in many industries, and they are the subject of Article
2A of the UCC, which you will encounter in the upper-level Sales & Leases class. - Eds.]

______________________________________________________________________________

UNIT 22: EXCUSED PERFORMANCE  469
         Following the closing of the above-described loans, USBEF [i.e.,U.S. Bancorp
Equipment Finance, Inc.] acquired Firstar's rights under the relevant loan
documents.

         After the tragic events of September 11, 2001, all parties agree that the airline
and airplane market was devastated. In August and September of 2002, Continental
Airlines decided not to renew the leases on the Ananya Airplanes, and returned the
aircraft to Ananya. Both planes were returned to Ananya in a damaged condition.
Damages included an unserviceable engine and an inferior auxiliary power unit
installed by Continental. Additionally, both airplanes required expensive inspections.
Following the failure of Continental to renew the leases, Ananya did not make the
balloon payment that came due in September 2002.

         Meanwhile, U.S. Airways filed for bankruptcy following 9/11. As part of the
bankruptcy proceedings, U.S. Airways terminated the lease and returned the
Ameriquest Airplane to Ameriquest. U.S. Airways made its last lease payment in
June 2002. Following the termination of the lease, Ameriquest failed to make its
quarterly payments to USBEF, and also failed to make the balloon payment that
came due in April 2003.

         Following the defaults by Ananya and Ameriquest, USBEF had the option to
repossess the Ameriquest and Ananya Airplanes. However, USBEF gave Ameriquest
and Ananya time to sell or refinance the airplanes. Gupta suggested to USBEF that
he re-lease the planes to overseas operators in countries including Pakistan, Nigeria,
and Indonesia. The loan agreements required USBEF's consent before Ananya or
Ameriquest could re-lease the planes. In addition to obtaining USBEF's consent to
re-lease the planes, Defendants were required to refinance the loans or convince
USBEF to extend the maturity dates of the loans, as the balloon payments on all the
loans were due and owing by April 2003.

         Gupta and USBEF also looked into the possibility of an outright sale of the
airplanes. USBEF received an offer for the Ameriquest Airplane, but Gupta did not
consent to the sale. Instead, Gupta put together an investment group in an attempt
to purchase the Ameriquest Airplane. On January 16, 2003, Gupta's group made an
offer of $540,000 for the airplane. On February 6, the group lowered its offer to
$525,000. On March 25, the group submitted a third offer in the amount of $300,000.
Shortly after this offer from Gupta, USBEF decided to foreclose on the Ameriquest
Airplane and sell it through a private sale. Although USBEF communicated this
information to Gupta, his group continued to make offers on the Ameriquest Airplane.

     Ultimately, USBEF foreclosed on and sold the Ameriquest and Ananya

Airplanes. The Ameriquest Airplane was sold for $450,000. At the public auction for

the Ananya Airplanes, USBEF bid a total of $2,900,000 for the two aircraft. Following

the sale of the aircraft, USBEF applied the $450,000 from the Ameriquest Airplane

sale to Ameriquest debt. Additionally, USBEF applied the proceeds from the

$2,900,000 it bid on the Ananya aircraft to Ananya's debt.

470  CHAPTER VII: PERFORMANCE AND BREACH
         After applying these payments, the principal balance on the Ameriquest note
as of August 27, 2004 was $2,986,960.45, with $315,586.36 owed in interest. The
interest on the Ameriquest note is accruing at the rate of $871.03 per day. The
balance on the Ananya notes as of August 27, 2004 was $6,736,443.08, with total
unpaid interest equal to $684,008.04. Interest is accruing at the rate of $1,915.99 per
day on the Ananya notes.

         Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56(c) provides that summary judgment shall
issue "if the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on
file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any
material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law."
Fed. R Civ. P. 56(c). On a motion for summary judgment, the Court views the evidence
in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.

         It is undisputed that Defendants have defaulted on the loans at issue. Gupta
conceded at his deposition that Ameriquest failed to make its required quarterly
payments, as well as the balloon payment due in April 2003. Similarly, as admitted
by Gupta, Ananya failed to make the balloon payment due in September 2002.
Moreover, it is undisputed that Gupta has never paid either of the $1,000,000
guaranties he signed with respect to the Ananya Airplanes.

         Defendants have offered a number of defenses to their default of the relevant
loans. [The court goes through several of them, finding them invalid.]

         Defendants have also raised the defense of impossibility and force majeure.
Under New York law, impossibility may be raised if one of two conditions is met:
(1) the subject matter of the contract is destroyed; or (2) the means of performance is
destroyed so as to make performance objectively impossible. Kel Kim Corp. v. Central
Markets. Inc., 519 N.E.2d 295, 296 (N.Y. 1987). However, "that performance should
be excused only in extreme circumstances." Id. Moreover, "financial difficulty or
economic hardship, even to the extent of insolvency or bankruptcy," are not sufficient
circumstances for a finding of impossibility. 407 East 61st Garage, Inc. v. Savoy Fifth
Ave. Corp., 244 N.E.2d 37, 41 (N.Y. 1968).

Here, Defendants do not argue that the subject matter of the contract--the

airplanes--was destroyed. Rather, Defendants contend performance was rendered

impossible by the events of 9/11. Following 9/11, the airplane and airline market

around the world suffered immense losses. Numerous airlines went bankrupt

(including U.S. Airways), while other airlines simply ceased operations. While the

Court is sympathetic to Defendants' plight, the crash of the airline and airplane

industry does not rise to the level of impossibility demanded by New York law.

Certainly, 9/11 radically depressed the market for airplanes. However, decreased

value of collateral is not contemplated by New York law as an excuse for lack of

performance based on impossibility. As New York courts have made plain, the fact

that a contract proves to be unprofitable or onerous for one party does not excuse

unforeseen market forces undoubtedly are also captured in this rubric.

         Additionally, Defendants claim that USBEF made performance impossible by
failing to approve leases of the aircraft to foreign operators. Defendants do not cite
any provision of the loan agreements, however, that affirmatively requires USBEF to
approve leases. Nor do Defendants cite any case law suggesting that a failure to
approve a lease constitutes impossibility of performance.

HEREBY ORDERED that Plaintiff's Motion for Summary Judgment is GRANTED.

Problem 22.1

         Bob is a famous professional athlete in Metropolis. He is hired by RealSports,
a regional chain of athletic apparel superstores, to appear at the grand opening of
their newest store in Metropolis. The contract provides that Bob will arrive for the
grand opening of the store at 9:00 a.m., will sign autographs in two two-hour sessions,
and will do an afternoon free sports clinic for school children at a nearby park. Bob is
to receive $50,000 for his appearance. RealSports spends several times that in
advertising for the opening on television, radio, newspapers, and social media, all of
which tout Bob's attendance at the opening. Two days before the scheduled visit, Bob
is arrested for drunk driving. When apprehended, he physically assaults a police
officer, pulls a gun, and is forcibly subdued. When his car is searched, a substantial
amount of illegal drugs--chiefly cocaine--is found. Bob is taken to jail and booked on
several felony charges. The news spreads quickly, and soon every sports outlet in the
country is talking about little else than Bob and his arrest.

     (a) At Bob's bail hearing the next day, bail is set at $1 million. Bob is strapped

for cash (which is one of the reasons he is doing store openings), although he could

raise the bail money by taking out a loan or selling assets. He does not do so. Instead,

he notifies RealSports that he will not be at the opening because he is in jail. If

RealSports sues, and Bob claims impracticability, what result and why?

Problem 22.2

         Mary lives in Illinois. Her husband has always dreamed of an African safari
vacation. As a special 10th wedding anniversary trip, on July 15 she secretly books a
luxury safari package for the two of them, which will begin on November 15. The trip
is designed as a surprise, and none of her family members (including her two toddlers)
know about it. The total cost, including airfare, is $20,000. The contract provides that
she is to put $5,000 down as a deposit. If she cancels more than 60 days before the
date of the vacation (in this case, September 15), she will be charged a cancellation
fee of $200. If she cancels less than 60 but more than 30 days before the event (October
15), she forfeits her deposit. If she cancels after that she is liable for the full purchase
price. She provides a credit card guaranteeing the full price.

         On August 15, Mary's husband announces that he has decided to leave her and
wants a divorce. Mary is distraught. The next day, while driving to a lawyer's office,
her car is struck by a truck and she is seriously injured. She is rushed to intensive
care with massive internal bleeding, several broken bones, and head injuries. Her life
is saved, but she is in a coma and is unable to communicate. She comes out of the
coma on October 20, but is still very weak, and will be in a wheelchair for several
months and will not physically be able to travel herself for at least a month. Two days
later, thinking of the trip, she asks her sister to try and cancel it for her. The tour
company, which is based in New York, had charged her credit card for the full price
on October 16, as per the agreement. Despite hearing Mary's story, the tour company
refuses to refund the money. The company representative explains that if she had not
wanted to be liable, she should have purchased travel insurance.

         Mary sues to recover her payment from the tour company. Can she do so? On
what theory or theories? If so, how much should she recover?

Problem 22.3

         Shipper signs a contract with Carrier to transport 750,000 barrels of oil from
a field in Kuwait to the oil terminal at Carteret, New Jersey. The oil is to be shipped
on June 1. The contract between Shipper and Carrier does not specify the route that
the oil will take, but Carrier's plan is to use the normal route, which involves sending
an oil tanker down the Persian Gulf, around the Arabian Peninsula, through the Suez

Canal, across the Mediterranean through the Straits of Gibraltar, and then across
the Atlantic.

         The day before the oil is to be loaded, the Egyptian government--as a result of
growing tensions in the Middle East--closes the Suez Canal to American-bound
traffic. International protests are fruitless. Carrier's only option to performing the
contract is to load the oil and transport it south along the African coast--through
pirate-infested Somali waters--and around the Cape of Good Hope. This will, in
effect, double the cost to transport the oil, and increase the insurance costs of the
voyage. Carrier refuses to honor the contract, claiming that performance is
impracticable due to the government. Shipper ultimately finds another carrier who
will transport the oil at a much higher price, and then sues Carrier for breach. What
result?

               An Introduction to

                  REMEDIES

         We now turn to one of the most important practical questions that you and
your clients will face. Let's assume we have a contract, there are no valid defenses,
we understand what each party is supposed to do, we have a breach, and the breach
is unexcused. That leads to one big question that your clients will want you to answer
. . . .

     So what?

         In other words, what is it your client will be entitled to? Clients generally do
not bring breach of contract suits to vindicate some moral or philosophical principle.
They bring them to get something, usually money, from the other party. They want
a remedy. If a client is unlikely to be able to get a valuable remedy--or if the remedy
will be unenforceable because the other party is broke--the contract dispute is likely
a waste of time. Thus, while we believe all of the rest of the course is important (or
we wouldn't be covering it), the question of damages is the one that, in practical
terms, is perhaps the most important and the most ubiquitous. The client usually
does not care that it can prove breach of contract if there is no commensurate
remedy--the metaphorical pot of gold at the end of the contract litigation rainbow--
for doing so. Not every contract suit will involve questions of consideration, formation,
contract defenses, or other issues, but virtually every contract dispute will involve
the question: What should the plaintiff get?

         Types of Remedies. Three broad general categories of remedies are available
in a claim for breach of contract. Any of the remedies may be available in any given
dispute, but a party can normally only get one. Knowing which one to seek and how
to prove it is critical for a successful business litigator.

         The first type is money damages. The goal is to make the injured party whole
by providing a sum of money to compensate the plaintiff. There are, as it happens,
also three types of money damages, what we call the expectation, restitution, and
reliance measures. Exactly what each of those terms mean, and how they are used,
will have to be explored in some detail. Money damages are by far the most commonly
granted remedies in the United States.

         The second is liquidated damages. In other words, damages that the parties
have agreed in advance that they would pay if the contract were breached. Just as
the parties can agree on other terms of their agreement, they can, within some
important limits, provide their own remedies. Understanding the limits, however,
requires some study.

     The third is specific performance, which essentially is an order from a court,

very much like an injunction, compelling a party to do what it was supposed to do. In

______________________________________________________________________________

476                                CHAPTER VIII: REMEDIES
many modern legal systems, this is the most common remedy, but in the U.S. it is
available only in very limited circumstances. You will see that when it is available it
may sometimes be the most desirable for your client.

         Self-Help. Before we move to judicial remedies for breach, however, we want
to note an important remedy that does not rely on a lawsuit: self-help. When one
party breaches a contract, the other party may acquire certain rights that do not
depend on going to court. These include such things as refusing payment, rejecting
incorrect goods, suspending deliveries, and so forth. You have already seen parties
doing this through this book. Many of these rights are granted by contract law. For
example, in the face of a breach the non-breaching party can often suspend its own
performance, withhold promised payments, and refuse to return products. See, for
example, UCC § 2-705, which expressly permits sellers to withhold or stop delivery
of goods upon certain breaches by the buyer. Throughout the course, we have seen
scores of situations where parties take protective actions before litigation, some of
which were permissible while others were not. But good transactional lawyers know
that it is possible to protect clients in advance by thinking about issues and
addressing them ahead of time. A lawyer might give her client greater rights of self-
enforcement, such as by using carefully thought out uses of conditions and allocations
of discretionary authority.

         Thinking about what might happen in the event of breach is something clients
often are not good at, but lawyers are. Understanding contract remedies will be a
great help in protecting your clients in the event of breach.

The Expectation Interest

FOCUS OF THIS UNIT

         Money Damages. The most common remedy for breach of contract, as we
noted above, is money damages. The court compels the breaching party to pay
something to the non-breaching party. In the early days of the English common law,
the issue of how damages should be computed did not often arise; the question was
one for the jury, and the jury's determination--however it was calculated--ordinarily
was final. During the 19th century, however, British and American courts began to
reconsider the wisdom of allowing juries to set whatever damages they chose. They
began to develop standards against which damages awards are to be measured.

         The key to understanding contract damages is that they are ostensibly
awarded only to correct a private wrong, not to vindicate a public interest. Therefore,
while criminal fines and punitive damages in tort are designed to punish malefactors
and discourage others, contract damages are only supposed to make the victim (the
non-breaching party) whole. Anything more than that is often called a "windfall" by
the courts and will be struck down.

         In the materials that follow, in this unit and the next, you will see that the
concept of making the non-breaching party "whole" is easier to state than it is to
apply. Contract law has actually developed three distinct measures of damages for
breach. By far the most prominent is what we call the "expectancy" or "expectation"
measure, and it is the subject of this unit. You will see that the expectancy measure
sounds simple, but actually can be applied in a few different ways to yield different
amounts. In addition to expectancy, courts have also developed two measures called
"restitution" and "reliance" that will be covered in the next unit.

         We will let you get right to the cases, but we caution you that damages
calculations actually run backwards.

Ladies and Gentlemen, Sharpen Your Pencils! Be aware that this part of the

course involves math, a subject of which some law students are not especially fond.

The math is not difficult, however, usually sticking to addition, subtraction,

______________________________________________________________________________

UNIT 23: THE EXPECTATION INTEREST  479
multiplication and (very rarely) division. If you are particularly math-phobic, you
may want to keep a calculator handy during the discussion of remedies. Remember
the overall goal is to make the non-breaching party whole--that number is the
lodestar you will be looking for. If you find yourself doing a calculation and coming
up with a number that is not the amount that will make the party whole, the
calculation--no matter how well you did it--is wrong.

         As you read the materials that follow, you may want to review Restatement
(Second) of Contracts §§ 344-348, which provide an introduction to remedies in
general and expectancy damages in particular.

                                     84 N.H. 114, 146 A. 641 (1929)

BRANCH, J.

         [George Hawkins was a young man the palm of whose hand had been badly
burned nine years earlier by an electric wire, and which had a severe quantity of scar
tissue. Defendant McGee was a surgeon who wanted to experiment with skin
grafting, and repeatedly solicited Hawkins and his father to allow him to take skin
off Hawkins's chest to graft on the palm. Evidence put on by Hawkins showed that
Dr. McGee had said, "I will guarantee to make the hand a hundred per cent perfect
hand" or "a hundred per cent good hand." The operation did not go well, with the hand
becoming matted with hair and having a restricted range of motion. Hawkins sued,
claiming the hand was not as good as he had been promised. The jury found that the
physician was not professionally negligent, and so Hawkins could not recover in tort.
But the jury found for Hawkins on his claim that McGee had made a warranty and
that the warranty was breached.1 The court then turned to the issue of damages.]

         The substance of the charge to the jury on the question of damages appears in
the following quotation: "If you find the plaintiff entitled to anything, he is entitled
to recover for what pain and suffering he has been made to endure and what injury
he has sustained over and above the injury that he had before." To this instruction
the defendant seasonably excepted. By it, the jury was permitted to consider two

     1 [Note some good lawyering here on behalf of Hawkins. The medical malpractice claim failed

because there was no professional negligence by Dr. McGee--an unsurprising result given that the

skin-grafting surgery was new and experimental at the time. Hawkins's lawyers, however, managed

to win the case on a breach of contract theory. Even personal injury lawyers can sometimes benefit

from stuff they learn in Contracts class. - Eds.]

elements of damage, (1) pain and suffering due to the operation, and (2) positive ill
effects of the operation upon the plaintiff's hand. Authority for any specific rule of
damages in cases of this kind seems to be lacking, but when tested by general
principle and by analogy, it appears that the foregoing instruction was erroneous.

         By "damages" as that term is used in the law of contracts, is intended
compensation for a breach, measured in the terms of the contract. The purpose of the
law is to put the plaintiff in as good a position as he would have been in had the
defendant kept his contract. The measure of recovery is based upon what the
defendant should have given the plaintiff, not what the plaintiff has given the
defendant or otherwise expended. The only losses that can be said fairly to come
within the terms of a contract are such as the parties must have had in mind when
the contract was made, or such as they either knew or ought to have known would
probably result from a failure to comply with its terms.

         The present case is closely analogous to one in which a machine is built for a
certain purpose and warranted to do certain work. In such cases, the usual rule of
damages for breach of warranty in the sale of chattels is applied and it is held that
the measure of damages is the difference between the value of the machine if it had
corresponded with the warranty and its actual value, together with such incidental
losses as the parties knew or ought to have known would probably result from a
failure to comply with its terms. "As a general rule, the measure of the vendee's
damages is the difference between the value of the goods as they would have been if
the warranty as to quality had been true, and the actual value at the time of the sale,
including gains prevented and losses sustained, and such other damages as could be
reasonably anticipated by the parties as likely to be caused by the vendor's failure to
keep his agreement, and could not by reasonable care on the part of the vendee have
been avoided." Union Bank v. Blanchard, 18 A. 90, (N.H. 1888). We, therefore,
conclude that the true measure of the plaintiff's damage in the present case is the
difference between the value to him of a perfect hand or a good hand, such as the jury
found the defendant promised him, and the value of his hand in its present condition,
including any incidental consequences fairly within the contemplation of the parties
when they made their contract. Damages not thus limited, although naturally
resulting, are not to be given.

         The extent of the plaintiff's suffering does not measure this difference in value.
The pain necessarily incident to a serious surgical operation was a part of the
contribution which the plaintiff was willing to make to his joint undertaking with the
defendant to produce a good hand. It was a legal detriment suffered by him which
constituted a part of the consideration given by him for the contract. It represented a
part of the price which he was willing to pay for a good hand, but it furnished no test
of the value of a good hand or the difference between the value of the hand which the
defendant promised and the one which resulted from the operation.

______________________________________________________________________________

UNIT 23: THE EXPECTATION INTEREST  481
         It was also erroneous and misleading to submit to the jury as a separate
element of damage any change for the worse in the condition of the plaintiff's hand
resulting from the operation, although this error was probably more prejudicial to the
plaintiff than to the defendant. Any such ill effect of the operation would be included
under the true rule of damages set forth above, but damages might properly be
assessed for the defendant's failure to improve the condition of the hand even if there
were no evidence that its condition was made worse as a result of the operation.

         It must be assumed that the trial court, in setting aside the verdict, undertook
to apply the same rule of damages which he had previously given to the jury, and
since this rule was erroneous, it is unnecessary for us to consider whether there was
any evidence to justify his finding that all damages awarded by the jury above $500
were excessive.

                                           _____________________

         Review Question 1. Make note of the legal standard used by the Hawkins v.
McGee court. How does it square with the way things are phrased in sections 347-348
of the Restatement (Second) of Contracts? Are the rules different, or are they basically
the same as what the Hawkins court describes?

         Review Question 2. How much more is a perfect hand worth than a hairy
hand, and how would one calculate that? At one point in Hawkins, the court describes
the case as "closely analogous to one in which a machine is built for a certain purpose
and warranted to do certain work." If the seller of a machine breached a warranty of
its quality, how would the buyer's damages be calculated? Consult UCC § 2-714 in
answering this last question.

         Review Question 3. The Hawkins court asks us to compare the current
situation with an alternative set of events that did not actually occur. A problem with
this approach is that it is very difficult to actually predict a future that did not
happen. As you read the U.S. Naval Institute case that follows, pay attention to how
the court goes about calculating a specific dollar amount based on a state of affairs
that did not happen. See if you can explain the court's reasoning to a trusted
classmate--or even to some other person who you think you can subject to that sort
of thing.

482  CHAPTER VIII: REMEDIES
      UNITED STATES NAVAL INSTITUTE v.
        CHARTER COMMUNICATIONS, INC.

United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit
                  936 F.2d 692 (2d Cir. 1991)

KEARSE, Circuit Judge

         [Tom Clancy's novel The Hunt for Red October was published in hardcover by
the Naval Institute Press in 1984. In September 1984, Naval entered into a contract
with Berkley Publishing Group to publish a paperback edition of the book, "not sooner
than October 1985." The reason for delayed publication was to allow Naval to
maximize hardcover sales over the coming year. The book became an unexpected
best-seller, and in breach of the contract, Berkley deliberately began selling copies of
the paperback on September 15, and by October 1 the paperback was already near
the top of the best-seller lists. Naval sued on a variety of theories, including copyright
infringement and breach of contract. Naval sought to recover for its own lost sales--
the money it would have made on hardback sales between September 15 and October
1if the paperback had not been available--and also sought to recover $724,300 in
profits made by Berkley on the unauthorized paperback sales during that period. The
trial court, after a hearing, awarded $35,380.50 for breach of contract, $7,760.12 in
copyright damages, and $15,319.27 in prejudgment interest. The Second Circuit
reversed the copyright infringement claim but affirmed the breach of contract. It
turned to the damages calculation.]

         Since the purpose of damages for breach of contract is to compensate the
injured party for the loss caused by the breach, those damages are generally
measured by the plaintiff's actual loss, see, e.g., Restatement (Second) of Contracts
§ 347 (1981). While on occasion the defendant's profits are used as the measure of
damages, this generally occurs when those profits tend to define the plaintiff's loss,
for an award of the defendant's profits where they greatly exceed the plaintiff's loss
and there has been no tortious conduct on the part of the defendant would tend to be
punitive, and punitive awards are not part of the law of contract damages. See
generally id. § 356 cmt a ("The central objective behind the system of contract
remedies is compensatory, not punitive."); id. cmt b (agreement attempting to fix
damages in amount vastly greater than what approximates actual loss would be
unenforceable as imposing a penalty); id. § 355 (punitive damages not recoverable for
breach of contract unless conduct constituting the breach is also a tort for which such
damages are recoverable).

         Here, the district court found that Berkley's alleged $724,300 profits did not
define Naval's loss because many persons who bought the paperback in September
1985 would not have bought the book in hardcover but would merely have waited
until the paperback edition became available. This finding is not clearly erroneous,

______________________________________________________________________________

UNIT 23: THE EXPECTATION INTEREST                      483
and we turn to the question of whether the district court's finding that Naval suffered
$35,380.50 in actual damages was proper.

         In reaching the $35,380.50 figure, the court operated on the premise that, but
for the breach by Berkley, Naval would have sold in September the same number of
hardcover copies it sold in August. Berkley challenges that premise as speculative
and argues that since Naval presented no evidence as to what its September 1985
sales would have been, Naval is entitled to recover no damages. It argues
alternatively that the court should have computed damages on the premise that sales
in the second half of September, in the absence of Berkley's premature release of the
paperback edition, would have been made at the same rate as in the first half of
September. Evaluating the district court's calculation of damages under the clearly
erroneous standard of review, we reject Berkley's contentions.

         The record showed that, though there was a declining trend of hardcover sales
of the Book from March through August 1985, Naval continued to sell its hardcover
copies through the end of 1985, averaging some 3,000 copies a month in the latter
period. It plainly was not error for the district court to find that the preponderance of
the evidence indicated that Berkley's early shipment of 1,400,000 copies of its
paperback edition, some 40% of which went to retail outlets and led to the Book's
rising close to the top of the paperback best-seller lists before the end of September
1985, caused Naval the loss of some hardcover sales prior to October 1985.

         As to the quantification of that loss, we think it was within the prerogative of
the court as finder of fact to look to Naval's August 1985 sales. Though there was no
proof as to precisely what the unimpeded volume of hardcover sales would have been
for the entire month of September, any such evidence would necessarily have been
hypothetical. But it is not error to lay the normal uncertainty in such hypotheses at
the door of the wrongdoer who altered the proper course of events, instead of at the
door of the injured party. See, e.g., Restatement (Second) of Contracts § 352 cmt. a
("Doubts are generally resolved against the party in breach."). The court was not
required to use as the starting point for its calculations Naval's actual sales in the
first half of September, i.e., those made prior to the first retail sale of the paperback
edition. Berkley has not called to our attention any evidence in the record to indicate
that the sales in a given month are normally spread evenly through that month.
Indeed, it concedes that "to a large degree, book sales depend on public whim and are
notoriously unpredictable." Thus, nothing in the record foreclosed the possibility that,
absent Berkley's breach, sales of hardcover copies in the latter part of September
would have outpaced sales of those copies in the early part of the month. Though the
court accurately described its selection of August 1985 sales as its benchmark as
"generous," it was not improper, given the inherent uncertainty, to exercise
generosity in favor of the injured party rather than in favor of the breaching party.

         In all the circumstances, we cannot say that the district court's calculation of
Naval's damages was clearly erroneous.

         Review Question 4. This case may seem overly technical on first read. Note
that what the court faces is the same question that writers of "alternative history"
novels have to face: What would the world be like if things had happened differently?
Carefully consider the evidence the court discusses and note how the court goes about
constructing a sort of parallel world. In proving damages, lawyers frequently must
find ways to do this sort of thing.

         Review Question 5. Suppose you have a seller (such as General Motors was
before its 2009 restructuring) that loses money on every transaction it enters into. Is
it possible that such a seller would have damages if one of those losing contracts were
breached? Maybe the seller should thank the breaching party for stemming its loss.
The Leingang case below seems to suggest that there might actually be compensable
damages, however. As you read Leingang, see if you can articulate why this is so.
Your professor just might ask for your explanation in an upcoming class.

LEINGANG v. CITY OF MANDAN WEED BOARD
               Supreme Court of North Dakota
                  468 N.W.2d 397 (N.D. 1991)

LEVINE, J.

         Robert Leingang appeals from an award of damages for breach of contract. The
issue is whether the trial court used the appropriate measure of damages. We hold it
did not, and reverse and remand.

         The City of Mandan Weed Board awarded Leingang a contract to cut weeds on
lots with an area greater than 10,000 square feet. Another contractor received the
contract for smaller lots. During 1987, Leingang discovered that the Weed Board's
agent was improperly assigning large lots to the small-lot contractor. Leingang
complained and the weed board assigned some substitute lots to him.

         Leingang brought a breach of contract action in small claims court and the City
removed the action to county court. The City admitted that it had prevented
Leingang's performance under the contract and that the contract price for the lost
work was $1,933.78. A bench trial was held to assess the damages suffered by
Leingang.

         At trial, Leingang argued that the applicable measure of damages was the
contract price less the costs of performance he avoided due to the breach. Leingang

______________________________________________________________________________

UNIT 23: THE EXPECTATION INTEREST             485
testified that the total gas, oil, repair and replacement blade expenses saved when he
was prevented from cutting the erroneously assigned lots was $211.18.

         The City argued that to identify Leingang's damages for net profits, some of
Leingang's overhead expenses should be attributed to the weed cutting contract and
deducted from the contract price. The City offered testimony about the profitability
of businesses in Mandan and testimony from Leingang's competitor about the
profitability of a weed cutting business in Mandan. The City also offered Leingang's
1986 and 1987 federal tax returns. Based on the Schedule C--"Profit or Loss From
Business"--in those returns, the City argued that Leingang attributed considerably
more expenses to the business of cutting weeds than he had testified he had avoided.

         The trial court adopted what it called a "modified net profit" approach as the
measure of damages. It derived a profit margin of 20% by subtracting four categories
of expenses reported on Leingang's Schedule C, and attributed to the weed-cutting
business, from the weed-cutting income reported to the IRS. The trial court selected
insurance, repairs, supplies, and car and truck expenses as costs attributed to the
weed-cutting business. Applying the profit margin of 20% to the contract price, the
trial court deducted 80% from the contract price as expenses and awarded Leingang
$368.59 plus interest. Leingang appeals.

         Leingang contends that the method used by the trial court to derive net profits
was improper because it did not restrict the expenses that are deductible from the
contract price to those which would have been incurred but for the breach of the
contract, i.e., those expenses Leingang did not have to pay because the City kept him
from doing the work. We agree.

         For a breach of contract, the injured party is entitled to compensation for the
loss suffered, but can recover no more than would have been gained by full
performance. N.D. Civ. Code §§ 32-03-09, 32-03-36. Our law thus incorporates the
notion that contract damages should give the nonbreaching party the benefit of the
bargain by awarding a sum of money that will put that person in as good a position
as if the contract had been performed. Where the contract is for service and the breach
prevents the performance of that service, the value of the contract consists of two
items: (1) the party's reasonable expenditures toward performance, including costs
paid, material wasted, and time and services spent on the contract, and (2) the
anticipated profits. Thus, a party is entitled to recover for the detriment caused by
the defendant's breach, including lost profits if they are reasonable and not
speculative.

     Where a plaintiff offers evidence estimating anticipated profits with

reasonable certainty, they may be awarded. See King Features Syndicate v. Courrier,

43 N.W.2d 718 (Iowa 1950). In King Features, the plaintiff proved the value of its

anticipated profits by reducing the contract price by the amount it would have spent

to perform. The court held that this proof was reasonably certain. In quantifying the

costs of performance, the plaintiff did not deduct "overhead" expenses because the

______________________________________________________________________________

486  CHAPTER VIII: REMEDIES
evidence established that those expenses were constant whether or not the contract
was performed.

         The King Features approach fulfills the Welsh Manufacturing requirement
that a plaintiff be compensated for all the detriment caused by the breach. Under
King Features, constant overhead expenses are not deducted from the contract price
because they are expenses the plaintiff had to pay whether or not the contract was
breached. The King Features approach compensates plaintiff for constant overhead
expenses by allowing an award of the contract price, reduced only by expenses
actually saved because the contract did not have to be performed. The remaining
contract proceeds are available to pay constant expenses. See also Buono Sales, Inc.
v. Chrysler Motors Corp., 449 F.2d 715, 720 (3d Cir. 1971) (because fixed expenses
must be paid from the sum remaining after costs of performance are deducted, further
reducing contract price by fixed expenses would not fully, or fairly, compensate
plaintiff).

         Neither side argues that lost profits are not calculable here. Instead, each
urges a different method for computing lost profits. In measuring Leingang's
anticipated profits, the trial court erroneously calculated a "net profit" margin by
deducting general costs of doing business including insurance, repairs, supplies, and
car and truck expenses, without determining whether these costs remained constant
regardless of the City's breach and whether they were, therefore, not to be deducted
from the contract price. The reduction from the contract price of a portion of the
"fixed," or constant expenses, effectively required Leingang to pay that portion twice.

         We reverse the judgment and remand for a new trial on the issue of damages.

                                           _____________________

         Review Question 6. Understanding Leingang requires understanding the
difference between two kinds of expenses, often called "direct" and "indirect." Put very
simply, direct costs are those that vary directly with the number of units sold, while
indirect (sometimes called "overhead") costs are incurred regardless of the number of
units sold. At a hamburger stand, for example, the number of patties and buns you
need depend on how many burgers you sell and are thus direct costs. The manager's
salary and the property tax on the building, however, must be paid even if you sell no
burgers at all--making those costs indirect. The price of the burgers must ultimately
cover both of those business expenses. How might you describe the reasoning in
Leingang based on these concepts of direct and indirect costs?

            BRANDEIS MACHINERY & SUPPLY CO., LLC
                    v. CAPITOL CRANE RENTAL, INC.

                  Court of Appeals of Indiana, Fifth District
                       765 N.E.2d 173 (Ind. Ct. App. 2002)

VAIDIK, J.

         [Capitol had been renting a crane from Brandeis. The parties signed a contract
under which Capitol would purchase the crane, which was already on its property,
for $291,773.46. The contract provided that Capitol would pay the full price within
ten days, or would face a "service charge" of two percent per month. Capitol then
changed its mind. Before paying the purchase price, Capitol returned the crane, in
somewhat damaged condition, to Brandeis. Brandeis sued, demanding the full
purchase price plus an accumulated $159,302.38 in service charges and the costs of
inspection and repair, $9,794.86, for a total of $460,870.70. The trial court found that
Capitol was in breach, but awarded a considerably smaller sum. Brandeis appealed.]

         In particular, Brandeis maintains that the trial court erred by failing to award
the contract price and by failing to include service charges for late payment according
to the terms of its contract with Capitol Crane Rental, Inc.

         Capitol maintained that no damages should have been awarded. In the
alternative, Capitol submitted that damages should be calculated by subtracting the
fair market value of the Crane from the Contract price of $291,773.46.

         Regarding the fair market value of the Crane, Henry testified that based on
rates of depreciation the Crane's fair market value in June/July 1999 was between
$270,000 and $275,000. Due to the difference, Capitol suggested using the median
value of $272,500. The difference between the median fair market value of $272,500
and the Contract price of $291,773.46 is a damage award of $19,273.46.

         The trial court entered judgment in favor of Brandeis on June 21, 2001. The
trial court ordered that "Brandeis Machinery & Supply Co., LLC, recover of and from
the defendant, Capitol Crane Rentals, Inc., the sum of $29,067.00 with interest
thereon from the date of judgment, as provided by law, plus costs of this action." This
appeal ensued.

         Brandeis asserts that the trial court erred in calculating the damage award.
Brandeis contends that the trial court erred by failing to award the full Contract price
when calculating the damages.

         Indiana Code § 26-1-2-709(3) provides that after a buyer has wrongfully
rejected goods, a seller is not entitled to price but shall be awarded damages for
nonacceptance under § 26-1-2-708. Damages for nonacceptance are defined as:

     the difference between the market price at the time and place for tender
     and the unpaid contract price together with any incidental damages . . .
     but less expenses saved in consequence of the buyer's breach.

______________________________________________________________________________

488         CHAPTER VIII: REMEDIES
Thus, damages for a wrongful rejection are limited to the difference between the
market value of the goods and the unpaid contract price together with any incidental
damages.

         Turning to our case, we are reminded that we may not re-weigh the evidence
and must sustain the trial court on any legal theory. Given our standard of review,
the trial court could have concluded that Capitol made a wrongful, but effective
rejection of the Crane. Capitol's rejection was wrongful because it was not based on
any non-conformity.

         In this case, the trial court could have justifiably concluded that Capitol
returned the Crane within a reasonable time and provided seasonable notification of
its rejection of the Crane. As to the timing of the return, Capitol's owner, Dotlich,
testified that shortly after the contract was signed in June of 1999, he returned the
Crane to Brandeis' lot and told an employee of Brandeis that he no longer wanted to
buy it. Furthermore, Brandeis had a pattern of canceling contracts in the past after
customers had signed them, but before money had changed hands.

         The appropriate calculation of damages is the difference between the contract
price and the market price at the time of delivery plus incidental damages. Ind. Code
§ 26-1-2-709(3); Ind. Code § 26-1-2-708. Therefore, we find that the trial court did not
err when it declined to include the Contract price in the damage award.

         By calculating the difference between the contract price and the market price,
Brandeis would receive $19,273.46. The trial court awarded Brandeis the sum of
$29,067. By examining the post-trial briefs filed by the parties which outlined their
individual damage calculations, we can infer that the trial court's damage award
includes the difference between the Contract price and the fair market value of the
Crane which is $19,273.46 and the cost of the inspection of the repairs which cost
$9,794.86.

Judgment affirmed.

                    _____________________

         Review Question 7. Wouldn't the simpler thing in Brandeis Machinery be to
just give the seller the contract price plus the late payment fees provided for in the
contract? Why then does the court spend considerable time trying to calculate some
other remedy? What would the problem be with giving the plaintiff here the damages
for which it contended?

         Review Question 8. The goal of contract damages, it is frequently said, is to
"make whole" the breaching party. What position would the seller be in if Capitol had
performed? What position is it in after Capitol repudiates? What is the difference
between those two states? Has the seller been made whole?

                                      Supreme Court of Oklahoma

                                         382 P.2d 109 (Okla. 1962)

JACKSON, J.

         In the trial court, plaintiffs Willie and Lucille Peevyhouse sued the defendant,
Garland Coal and Mining Company, for damages for breach of contract. Judgment
was for plaintiffs in an amount considerably less than was sued for. Plaintiffs appeal
and defendant cross-appeals.

         In the briefs on appeal, the parties present their argument and contentions
under several propositions; however, they all stem from the basic question of whether
the trial court properly instructed the jury on the measure of damages.

         Briefly stated, the facts are as follows: plaintiffs owned a farm containing coal
deposits, and in November, 1954, leased the premises to defendant for a period of five
years for coal mining purposes. A "strip-mining" operation was contemplated in which
the coal would be taken from pits on the surface of the ground, instead of from
underground mine shafts. In addition to the usual covenants found in a coal mining
lease, defendant specifically agreed to perform certain restorative and remedial work
at the end of the lease period. It is unnecessary to set out the details of the work to
be done, other than to say that it would involve the moving of many thousands of
cubic yards of dirt, at a cost estimated by expert witnesses at about $29,000. However,
plaintiffs sued for only $25,000.

         During the trial, it was stipulated that all covenants and agreements in the
lease contract had been fully carried out by both parties, except the remedial work
mentioned above; defendant conceded that this work had not been done.

         Plaintiffs introduced expert testimony as to the amount and nature of the work
to be done, and its estimated cost. Over plaintiffs' objections, defendant thereafter
introduced expert testimony as to the "diminution in value" of plaintiffs' farm
resulting from the failure of defendant to render performance as agreed in the
contract--that is, the difference between the present value of the farm, and what its
value would have been if defendant had done what it agreed to do.

         At the conclusion of the trial, the court instructed the jury that it must return
a verdict for plaintiffs, and left the amount of damages for jury determination. On the
measure of damages, the court instructed the jury that it might consider the cost of
performance of the work defendant agreed to do, "together with all of the evidence
offered on behalf of either party."

______________________________________________________________________________

490  CHAPTER VIII: REMEDIES
         It thus appears that the jury was at liberty to consider the "diminution in
value" of plaintiffs' farm as well as the cost of "repair work" in determining the
amount of damages.

         It returned a verdict for plaintiffs for $5,000.00--only a fraction of the "cost of
performance," but more than the total value of the farm even after the remedial work
is done.

         On appeal, the issue is sharply drawn. Plaintiffs contend that the true measure
of damages in this case is what it will cost plaintiffs to obtain performance of the work
that was not done because of defendant's default. Defendant argues that the measure
of damages is the cost of performance "limited, however, to the total difference in the
market value before and after the work was performed."

         It appears that this precise question has not heretofore been presented to this
court. In Ardizonne v. Archer, 72 Okla. 70, 178 P. 263, this court held that the
measure of damages for breach of a contract to drill an oil well was the reasonable
cost of drilling the well, but here a slightly different factual situation exists. The
drilling of an oil well will yield valuable geological information, even if no oil or gas
is found, and of course if the well is a producer, the value of the premises increases.
In the case before us, it is argued by defendant with some force that the performance
of the remedial work defendant agreed to do will add at the most only a few hundred
dollars to the value of plaintiffs' farm, and that the damages should be limited to that
amount because that is all plaintiffs have lost.

         Plaintiffs rely on Groves v. John Wunder Co., 205 Minn. 163, 286 N.W. 235. In
that case, the Minnesota court, in a substantially similar situation, adopted the "cost
of performance" rule as--as opposed to the "value" rule. The result was to authorize
a jury to give plaintiff damages in the amount of $60,000, where the real estate
concerned would have been worth only $12,160, even if the work contracted for had
been done.

         It may be observed that Groves is the only case which has come to our attention
in which the cost of performance rule has been followed under circumstances where
the cost of performance greatly exceeded the diminution in value resulting from the
breach of contract. Incidentally, it appears that this case was decided by a plurality
rather than a majority of the members of the court.

         Defendant relies principally upon Sandy Valley & E. R. Co., v. Hughes, 175 Ky.
320, 194 S.W. 344; Bigham v. Wabash-Pittsburg Terminal Ry. Co., 223 Pa. 106, 72 A.
318; and Sweeney v. Lewis Const. Co., 66 Wash. 490, 119 P. 1108. These were all cases
in which, under similar circumstances, the appellate courts followed the "value" rule
instead of the "cost of performance" rule. Plaintiff points out that in the earliest of
these cases (Bigham) the court cites as authority on the measure of damages an
earlier Pennsylvania tort case, and that the other two cases follow the first, with no

______________________________________________________________________________

UNIT 23: THE EXPECTATION INTEREST  491
explanation as to why a measure of damages ordinarily followed in cases sounding in
tort should be used in contract cases. Nevertheless, it is of some significance that
three out of four appellate courts have followed the diminution in value rule under
circumstances where, as here, the cost of performance greatly exceeds the diminution
in value.

         The explanation may be found in the fact that the situations presented are
artificial ones. It is highly unlikely that the ordinary property owner would agree to
pay $29,000 (or its equivalent) for the construction of "improvements" upon his
property that would increase its value only about ($300) three hundred dollars. The
result is that we are called upon to apply principles of law theoretically based upon
reason and reality to a situation which is basically unreasonable and unrealistic.

         In Groves v. John Wunder Co., the Minnesota court apparently considered the
contract involved to be analogous to a building and construction contract, and cited
authority for the proposition that the cost of performance or completion of the
building as contracted is ordinarily the measure of damages in actions for damages
for the breach of such a contract.

         In an annotation following the Minnesota case beginning at 123 A.L.R. 515,
the annotator places the three cases relied on by defendant (Sandy Valley, Bigham
and Sweeney) under the classification of cases involving "grading and excavation
contracts."

         We do not think either analogy is strictly applicable to the case now before us.
The primary purpose of the lease contract between plaintiffs and defendant was
neither "building and construction" nor "grading and excavation." It was merely to
accomplish the economical recovery and marketing of coal from the premises, to the
profit of all parties. The special provisions of the lease contract pertaining to remedial
work were incidental to the main object involved.

         Even in the case of contracts that are unquestionably building and construction
contracts, the authorities are not in agreement as to the factors to be considered in
determining whether the cost of performance rule or the value rule should be applied.
Restatement [First] of Contracts § 346(1)(a) submits the proposition that the cost of
performance is the proper measure of damages "if this is possible and does not involve
unreasonable economic waste"; and that the diminution in value caused by the breach
is the proper measure "if construction and completion in accordance with the contract
would involve unreasonable economic waste." (Emphasis supplied.) In an explanatory
comment immediately following the text, the Restatement makes it clear that the
"economic waste" referred to consists of the destruction of a substantially completed
building or other structure. Of course no such destruction is involved in the case now
before us.

         On the other hand, in MCCORMICK, DAMAGES, § 168, it is said with regard to
building and construction contracts that "in cases where the defect is one that can be

______________________________________________________________________________

492  CHAPTER VIII: REMEDIES
repaired or cured without undue expense" the cost of performance is the proper
measure of damages, but where "the defect in material or construction is one that
cannot be remedied without an expenditure for reconstruction disproportionate to the
end to be attained"(emphasis supplied) the value rule should be followed.

         In view of the unrealistic fact situation in the instant case, and certain
Oklahoma statutes to be hereinafter noted, we are of the opinion that the "relative
economic benefit" is a proper consideration here. This is in accord with the recent case
of Mann v. Clowser, 190 Va. 887, 59 S.E.2d 78, where, in applying the cost rule, the
Virginia court specifically noted that "the defects are remediable from a practical
standpoint and the costs are not grossly disproportionate to the results to be obtained"
(Emphasis supplied).

23 Okla. Stat. 1961 §§ 96 and 97 provide as follows:

§ 96. * * * Notwithstanding the provisions of this chapter, no person can
recover a greater amount in damages for the breach of an obligation,
than he would have gained by the full performance thereof on both sides
* * *.

§ 97. * * * Damages must, in all cases, be reasonable, and where an
obligation of any kind appears to create a right to unconscionable and
grossly oppressive damages, contrary to substantial justice no more
than reasonable damages can be recovered.

         Although it is true that the above sections of the statute are applied most often
in tort cases, they are by their own terms, and the decisions of this court, also
applicable in actions for damages for breach of contract. It would seem that they are
peculiarly applicable here where, under the "cost of performance" rule, plaintiffs
might recover an amount about nine times the total value of their farm. Such would
seem to be "unconscionable and grossly oppressive damages, contrary to substantial
justice" within the meaning of the statute. Also, it can hardly be denied that if
plaintiffs here are permitted to recover under the "cost of performance" rule, they will
receive a greater benefit from the breach than could be gained from full performance,
contrary to the provisions of § 96.

         In spite of the agreement of the parties, §§ 96 and 97 limit the damages
recoverable to a reasonable amount not "contrary to substantial justice"; they prevent
plaintiffs from recovering a "greater amount in damages for the breach of an
obligation" than they would have "gained by the full performance thereof."

         We therefore hold that where, in a coal mining lease, lessee agrees to perform
certain remedial work on the premises concerned at the end of the lease period, and
thereafter the contract is fully performed by both parties except that the remedial
work is not done, the measure of damages in an action by lessor against lessee for
damages for breach of contract is ordinarily the reasonable cost of performance of the

______________________________________________________________________________

UNIT 23: THE EXPECTATION INTEREST                                          493
work; however, where the contract provision breached was merely incidental to the
main purpose in view, and where the economic benefit which would result to lessor
by full performance of the work is grossly disproportionate to the cost of performance,
the damages which lessor may recover are limited to the diminution in value
resulting to the premises because of the non-performance.

         It should be noted that the rule as stated does not interfere with the property
owner's right to "do what he will with his own" Chamberlain v. Parker, 45 N.Y. 569,
or his right, if he chooses, to contract for "improvements" which will actually have the
effect of reducing his property's value. Where such result is in fact contemplated by
the parties, and is a main or principal purpose of those contracting, it would seem
that the measure of damages for breach would ordinarily be the cost of performance.

         Under the most liberal view of the evidence herein, the diminution in value
resulting to the premises because of non-performance of the remedial work was
$300.00. After a careful search of the record, we have found no evidence of a higher
figure, and plaintiffs do not argue in their briefs that a greater diminution in value
was sustained. It thus appears that the judgment was clearly excessive, and that the
amount for which judgment should have been rendered is definitely and satisfactorily
shown by the record.

         We are of the opinion that the judgment of the trial court for plaintiffs should
be, and it is hereby, modified and reduced to the sum of $300.00, and as so modified
it is affirmed.

IRWIN, J, dissenting.

         By the specific provisions in the coal mining lease under consideration, the
defendant agreed as follows:

     7b Lessee agrees to make fills in the pits dug on said premises on the property
     line in such manner that fences can be placed thereon and access had to opposite
     sides of the pits.

     7c Lessee agrees to smooth off the top of the spoil banks on the above premises.

     7d Lessee agrees to leave the creek crossing the above premises in such a
     condition that it will not interfere with the crossings to be made in pits as set out in
     7b.

     7f Lessee further agrees to leave no shale or dirt on the high wall of said pits.

Following the expiration of the lease, plaintiffs made demand upon defendant that it
carry out the provisions of the contract and to perform those covenants contained
therein.

     Defendant admits that it failed to perform its obligations that it agreed and

contracted to perform under the lease contract and there is nothing in the record

which indicates that defendant could not perform its obligations. Therefore, in my

opinion defendant's breach of the contract was willful and not in good faith.

______________________________________________________________________________

494                    CHAPTER VIII: REMEDIES
         Although the contract speaks for itself, there were several negotiations
between the plaintiffs and defendant before the contract was executed. Defendant
admitted in the trial of the action, that plaintiffs insisted that the above provisions
be included in the contract and that they would not agree to the coal mining lease
unless the above provisions were included.

         In consideration for the lease contract, plaintiffs were to receive a certain
amount as royalty for the coal produced and marketed and in addition thereto their
land was to be restored as provided in the contract.

         The cost for performing the contract in question could have been reasonably
approximated when the contract was negotiated and executed and there are no
conditions now existing which could not have been reasonably anticipated by the
parties. Therefore, defendant had knowledge, when it prevailed upon the plaintiffs to
execute the lease, that the cost of performance might be disproportionate to the value
or benefits received by plaintiff for the performance.

         Defendant has received its benefits under the contract and now urges, in
substance, that plaintiffs' measure of damages for its failure to perform should be the
economic value of performance to the plaintiffs and not the cost of performance.

         Defendant did not have the right to mine plaintiffs' coal or to use plaintiffs'
property for its mining operations without the consent of plaintiffs. Defendant had
knowledge of the benefits that it would receive under the contract and the
approximate cost of performing the contract. With this knowledge, it must be
presumed that defendant thought that it would be to its economic advantage to enter
into the contract with plaintiffs and that it would reap benefits from the contract, or
it would have not entered into the contract.

         Therefore, if the value of the performance of a contract should be considered in
determining the measure of damages for breach of a contract, the value of the benefits
received under the contract by a party who breaches a contract should also be
considered. However, in my judgment, to give consideration to either in the instant
action, completely rescinds and holds for naught the solemnity of the contract before
us and makes an entirely new contract for the parties.

         In Great Western Oil & Gas Company v. Mitchell, 326 P.2d 794, we held:

         The law will not make a better contract for parties than they themselves
         have seen fit to enter into, or alter it for the benefit of one party and to
         the detriment of the others; the judicial function of a court of law is to
         enforce a contract as it is written.

In the instant action defendant has made no attempt to even substantially perform.
The contract in question is not immoral, is not tainted with fraud, and was not
entered into through mistake or accident and is not contrary to public policy. It is

______________________________________________________________________________

UNIT 23: THE EXPECTATION INTEREST  495
clear and unambiguous and the parties understood the terms thereof, and the
approximate cost of fulfilling the obligations could have been approximately
ascertained. There are no conditions existing now which could not have been
reasonably anticipated when the contract was negotiated and executed. The
defendant could have performed the contract if it desired. It has accepted and reaped
the benefits of its contract and now urges that plaintiffs' benefits under the contract
be denied. If plaintiffs' benefits are denied, such benefits would inure to the direct
benefit of the defendant.

         Therefore, in my opinion, the plaintiffs were entitled to specific performance of
the contract and since defendant has failed to perform, the proper measure of
damages should be the cost of performance. Any other measure of damage would be
holding for naught the express provisions of the contract; would be taking from the
plaintiffs the benefits of the contract and placing those benefits in defendant which
has failed to perform its obligations; would be granting benefits to defendant without
a resulting obligation; and would be completely rescinding the solemn obligation of
the contract for the benefit of the defendant to the detriment of the plaintiffs by
making an entirely new contract for the parties.

         I therefore respectfully dissent to the opinion promulgated by a majority of my
associates.

         Review Question 9. What should the goal of compensation be in contract law?
In Groves v. John Wunder Co., 286 N.W. 235 (Minn. 1939), the Minnesota Supreme
Court--on facts very similar to Peevyhouse--awarded the exact cost-of-performance
measure of damages that the Oklahoma Supreme Court majority rejected:

     The one question for us arises upon plaintiff's assertion that he was entitled,
     not to that difference in value, but to the reasonable cost to him of doing the
     work called for by the contract which defendant left undone.

     Defendant's breach of contract was willful. There was nothing of good faith
     about it. Hence, that the decision below handsomely rewards bad faith and
     deliberate breach of contract is obvious. That is not allowable. [* * *] In
     reckoning damages for breach of a building or construction contract, the law
     aims to give the disappointed promisee, so far as money will do it, what he was
     promised. [* * *]

     Even in case of substantial performance in good faith, the resulting defects
     being remediable, it is error to instruct that the measure of damage is "the
     difference in value between the house as it was and as it would have been if
     constructed according to contract." The "correct doctrine" is that the cost of
     remedying the defect is the "proper" measure of damages.

     Value of the land (as distinguished from the value of the intended product of

     the contract, which ordinarily will be equivalent to its reasonable cost) is no

         proper part of any measure of damages for willful breach of a building contract.
         The reason is plain.

Both Groves and the Peevyhouse case from over two decades later have been heavily
criticized--the latter for applying the diminished-value test and the former for
applying cost of performance in place of it. Which approach is better for putting the
injured party in as good a position as if the other had not breached? To what extent
does either approach make an unjustified "windfall" to one party more (or less) likely?

         Review Question 10. Article 74 of the CISG provides that for breach of an
international sales contract, damages "consist of a sum equal to the loss, including
loss of profit, suffered by the other party as a consequence of the breach." How does
that formulation for damages compare with the common law and UCC approaches
that you have considered in this unit?

can Andy get from Seller?

Problem 23.2

         (a) Homeowner hires contractor to build an in-ground swimming pool in his
back yard. The total price is to be $15,000. Homeowner pays $5,000 down.
Contractor's estimated profit on the job is $4,000. Contractor spends $2,000 to dig the
hole for the pool and prepare for construction. At this point Homeowner claims he is
being ripped off by Contractor's high price and demands a price reduction. Contractor
refuses. Homeowner tells Contractor that "the deal is off" and forbids her to come on
the property to finish the work. Homeowner hires another pool contractor who agrees
to finish the work for $10,000. If the case goes to trial, what (if any) damages would
either party be able to recover from the other?

         (b) Same deal, except that after digging the hole and expending $2,000, it is
Contractor who breaches by refusing to return to work. Homeowner hires another

Problem 23.3

         (a) Buyer contracts with Manufacturer for the production and delivery of
10,000 Texas Rangers jerseys which will be sold in Buyer's store as part of a special
promotion. The contract price is $150,000, and Buyer has paid $75,000 in advance.
The jerseys will retail for $30 each; Buyer expects to gross $300,000 on them. When
the jerseys arrive on the specified day, Buyer is surprised to see that they say
"Ringers," not "Rangers." Buyer rejects the shipment and is not able to find another
supplier in time, so it cancels its special promotion. Buyer demands that
Manufacturer return its deposit and take back the "Ringers" jerseys. Manufacturer
refuses. The jerseys sit in Buyer's loading area for six months without being picked
up. Finally, frustrated Buyer sells the 10,000 jerseys for $30,000 to a novelty and joke
store. Buyer eventually sues for breach of contract. What damages, if any, would
either party be able to recover from the other?

         (b) Same facts, except that the jerseys are not misprinted and conform exactly
to the contract requirements. Buyer, however, has decided to cancel its promotion, so
it no longer wants the jerseys and refuses to take them. Seller, at a cost of $1,500,
sends a truck to retrieve the jerseys. Seller makes several attempts to sell the shirts,
spending about 20 hours of time at $30 an hour and running up a long-distance phone
tab of $150. Seller ultimately sells the whole lot to a discount sporting goods store,
Sports-4-Less, a discount store, for $60,000. Seller sues Buyer for breach of contract.
What damages, if any, would either party be able to recover from the other?

Problem 23.4

         Landlord has spent millions of dollars updating a beautiful old office building
in the downtown area. The lobby, in particular, was paved, at great expense, with
San Francisco Green granite and Canberra York Grey granite, the walls were paneled
with sequence-matched crown-cut American cherry. Immediately after the building
is finished, it is leased in its entirety for ten years to Bank. The lease gives Bank
authority to make modifications to the building, but provides that the building at the
end of the lease must be returned in the same condition, minus normal wear and tear.
Shortly after taking over the building, Bank decides it wants a more modern-looking
lobby, and rips up all of the granite flooring and tears out all of the paneling, disposing
of it all in the trash.

         At the end of the lease, Bank decides not to renew. It lays a new carpet down
in the lobby and paints the walls to freshen them up. Landlord demands that it
rebuild the lobby to its original state. Bank refuses, noting that it would cost $500,000
to do that. Expert appraisers estimate that the total diminution of value is somewhere
between zero (some people do not like granite and cherry lobbies) and $50,000.

                     Restitution and Reliance

                                   FOCUS OF THIS UNIT

         By far the most common judicial remedy for breach of contract in the United
States is expectation damages, introduced in the previous unit. The expectancy is,
however sometimes unavailable or inadequate in certain situations. This unit
addresses the two primary alternatives to expectation damages.

         Restitution: Returning the Ill-Gotten Gain. The first alternative is restitution.
The remedy of restitution did not grow up in contract law. You may have run across
it in other contexts, such as when a criminal defendant is ordered to "make
restitution" to a victim for the harm done. In contract law, however, the concept
involves compensating the wronged party with the ill-gotten gain of another--even if
the breach has not technically caused measurable economic harm. Restitution has its
roots in equity, tort law, and fiduciary law. Over the years, many situations have
arisen in which one person wrongfully held the property of another, such as by having
stolen, borrowed without returning, or otherwise used property to make money
without permission of the property's true owner. The English courts, relying on the
equitable maxim, commodum ex injuria sua nemo habere debet--roughly translated,
"No one shall profit by his own wrong"--developed a remedy that forced the
wrongdoer to pay back what he had obtained.

         An early and straightforward English example of restitution involved stable
operators who boarded horses for the horses' owners. When the horse owners were
out of town for a prolonged period, the stable operators would rent the horses (much
like a modern auto rental business) to other customers. The horse owners did not give
permission for their horses to be rented out, and they were unhappy about this
apparent breach of contract. Yet, they could show no measurable harm. After all, the
horses would have to have been taken out and exercised anyway. With no economic
loss, the owners could not prove expectancy damages, even if the stable owners were
willfully breaching the contract by renting out the owners' horses without permission.
The transaction was--from an economic perspective, at least--harmless.

______________________________________________________________________________

UNIT 24: RESTITUTION AND RELIANCE                      501
Nevertheless, the English courts held early on that, in such a situation, the stable
owner would be liable to "disgorge"--a polite term for the act of spewing something
up and out of one's stomach--the profits they had made. Thus, the horse owner who
had suffered monetary damage would be awarded damages not for his own loss, but
for the profit wrongfully made by the other commandeering his property.

         A natural step from "you're using my property" is "you're using the property
(money) that you were supposed to have paid me." Restitution thus came to be an
alternative remedy for breach of contract. In this unit, we will focus on restitution's
specific application in contract law, but keep in mind that the restitution principle of
disgorging "unjust enrichment" extends far beyond contract. The principle is so broad,
in fact, that the American Law Institute has an entire Restatement on the subject.
The Restatement (Third) of Restitution and Unjust Enrichment was published in
2011. This enormous and fertile topic takes up much of the course in Remedies, a
course you should strongly consider taking later in law school.

         Reliance: "But I Trusted You!" The expectation and restitution remedies go
back far into the early history of the English common law, and they arrived in
America along with the first English colonists. The third major category of damages
is much more recent. Even as a conceptual matter, it dates only back to the 1930s,
although some cases seem to have applied it occasionally before that. In an influential
1936 law review article, The Reliance Interest in Contract Law, Professor Lon Fuller
and his then-student, William Perdue, contended not only that reliance was an
appropriate alternative remedy for breach of contract, but that it might even be the
most appropriate and important remedy in many circumstances.

         The idea of a "reliance interest" rests on a simple parallel. Contracts depend
upon promises. So, in many cases, does the tort of fraud. Consider the car thief who
purports to be the car's owner and sells it to you for $5,000. You relied on the thief's
statements and you are out $5,000 when the true owner reclaims her car. Change up
the facts a bit, and suppose you had paid the $5,000 to the car's true owner, but the
owner has taken your money and refused to deliver the car. You relied on the owner's
promise, and you are out $5,000. Assuming you cannot get the car, what can you
recover in each case? For fraud, the usual remedy (as you may have learned in torts)
is restitution. But in contract, using the expectancy measure would result in the fair
market value of the car. Fuller and Perdue argued that because both situations
involved reliance, using what they called "the reliance interest" as a measure of
damages would be appropriate in either situation.

         While there was a period of time in the last century where it appeared that the
reliance interest might swallow up the expectancy interest, that turned out not to be
the case. Expectation damages remain the most common award in breach of contract
cases. As a practical matter, getting what you expected under a contract is often better
than simply getting back what you spent, but as you will see from the cases below,
that is not always the case.

______________________________________________________________________________

502  CHAPTER VIII: REMEDIES
         All three measures of damages--expectancy, restitution, and reliance--are
part of the contract litigator's toolkit. A contract plaintiff can get only one of the three
measures, but at the time a lawsuit begins, it may not be clear which one will most
benefit the client, and it may not be clear which one a jury (or a reviewing judge) will
conclude is supported by the evidence. A lawyer should therefore understand each of
them.

Cases and Materials

A. Restitution

                                               LEE v. FOOTE
                                District of Columbia Court of Appeals

                                         481 A.2d 484 (D.C. 1984)

PER CURIAM

         Appellant appeals the trial court's denial of compensatory damages upon its
finding that appellee breached an oral contract for the exchange of services. The trial
court awarded appellant only nominal damages of one dollar, ruling that, as a matter
of law, he could not recover for the value of services he performed for appellee. We
reverse and remand.

         The trial court, sitting without a jury, found that Lee and Foote entered into
an oral contract for the exchange of services. Lee agreed to perform rough and
finished carpentry work on Foote's house at 1926 Eleventh Street, N.W., and Foote
agreed to perform plumbing work on Lee's house at 467 M Street, N.W. Lee did rough
carpentry work on Foote's house for approximately 30 days, but did not complete his
performance by doing finished carpentry work. Foote, however, never commenced the
plumbing work at Lee's house, claiming that Lee prevented him from performing by
hiring other plumbers to do the work without giving Foote a reasonable time in which
to start the work. The trial court found that the evidence did not support Foote's
assertion, and that Foote breached the contract without any legal justification.

         Lee sued to recover as damages the reasonable market value of his carpentry
services to Foote. In his complaint, Lee sought $15,000 for the "reasonable market
value" of his work and $5,000 in damages for Foote's failure to perform timely, which
Lee claimed caused him "to fall behind in his job completion time table," and costs. In
his answer to the complaint, Foote denied "the reasonable market value to the work
`performed' by Plaintiff." The trial court denied Lee the damages he sought on the
ground that since the contract terms called for a mutual exchange of services, the
proper measure of Lee's damages was the cost to him of hiring other plumbers to

______________________________________________________________________________

UNIT 24: RESTITUTION AND RELIANCE  503
perform the work. As Lee failed to introduce any evidence of that cost, the trial court
awarded him only nominal damages of one dollar. It is from this legal ruling by the
trial court that Lee appeals.

         When an express contract has been repudiated or materially breached by the
defendant, restitution for the value of the non-breaching party's performance is
available as an alternative to an action for damages on the contract. Ingber v. Ross,
479 A.2d 1256 (D.C. 1984) (citing 12 WILLISTON ON CONTRACTS § 1454 at 14 (1970)).
Restitution for material breach or repudiation of a contract is based upon the
principle of unjust enrichment. TVL Associates v. A&M Construction Corp., 474 A.2d
156, 159 (D.C. 1984). The purpose of restitution is to require the wrongdoer to restore
what he has received and thereby tend to put the injured party in as good a position
as that occupied by him before the contract was made. Restatement (Second) of
Contracts § 373 (1981).

         Restitution is available in this jurisdiction for partial performance by a
plaintiff of services under an express contract which has been breached by a
defendant. In Sterling v. Marshall, 54 A.2d 353, 356 (D.C. 1947), the plaintiff sued
for the value of his engineering services to the defendant pursuant to an express
contract. The defendant had breached the contract after partial performance by the
plaintiff; this court held that the plaintiff was entitled to recover for the reasonable
value of his work. This principle was followed in Aiken v. United Broadcasting Co.,
238 A.2d 588, 590 (D.C. 1968), where the plaintiff had agreed to do printing work for
the defendant, who in turn agreed to provide the plaintiff with radio advertising.
When the defendant failed to perform, the plaintiff sued him for the value of the
printing services provided. The court held that

         Failure to provide service may result in a money judgment. Where the
         party from whom payment is due in something other than money, such
         as goods or other commodities, fails to pay in the particular way
         specified in the contract, payment in money may be demanded.

Id. at 590.1 See also 5 CORBIN § 1112 (proper measure of recovery in restitution is the
reasonable value of the part performance rendered by the plaintiff to the defendant,

          1 [By the court] Other jurisdictions also allow recovery for partial performance where there is
an express contract. See Oliver v. Campbell, 273 P.2d 15, 17-18 (Cal. 1954); Hoefflin v. Wilkerson,
210 S.W. 667 (Ky. Ct. App. 1919); Palmer v. Brown, 40 A.2d 514, 517 (Md. 1945); Weber v. Billman,
135 N.E.2d 866, 871 (Ohio 1956); Goldman v. Shapiro, 84 A.2d 628, 630 (N.J. Super. Ct. 1951).

uncontrolled by the contract price or rate or by any other terms of the express
contract).2

         The trial court found there was an express contract between Lee and Foote. It
further found that Lee had performed carpentry work for Foote, which Foote had
accepted, and that Foote had breached the contract by failing to perform any of the
plumbing work he had agreed to render in return for Lee's performance. Despite
finding an express contract, the trial court erroneously held as a matter of law that
Lee was not entitled to recover for the value of his performance because the express
contract called for Foote to render services rather than pay Lee for his performance.
Under Sterling v. Marshall and Aiken v. United Broadcasting Co., Lee was entitled
to recover in restitution for the reasonable value of his part performance.

         Because of its ruling denying Lee restitution of the value of his performance,
the trial court did not make findings as to the reasonable value of Lee's carpentry
work. We are unable to determine on the record before us whether Lee presented
sufficient evidence on that issue for the trial court to arrive at a "just and reasonable
estimate based on relevant data" of the value of Lee's services. TVL Associates, 474
A.2d at 160. Accordingly, we reverse and remand for a new trial limited to proof of
the damages to which Lee is entitled as compensation for the reasonable value of the
carpentry work which he rendered to Foote.

                                           _____________________

         Review Question 1. The court in Lee v. Foote quotes the Restatement (Second)
of Contracts § 371 as defining the restitution measure as either (a) the reasonable
value of the work measured by how much it would have cost to have it done, or (b)
the actual increase in value of the other party's property or interests--depending on
what "justice requires." Is there some standard for when "justice" would require one
or the other? Or is it just the fact-finder's gut feeling? Didn't we come across this
"justice" problem earlier when studying promissory estoppel? What factors might
influence which of the two restitution measures is "just" in a given case?

2 [By the court] The Restatement (Second) of Contracts provides:

§ 371. Measure of Restitution Interest

          If a sum of money is awarded to protect a party's restitution interest, it may
as justice requires be measured by either

          (a) the reasonable value to the other party of what he received in terms of
what it would have cost him to obtain it from a person in the claimant's position, or

          (b) the extent to which the other party's property has been increased in value
or his other interests advanced.

           UNITED STATES ex rel. COASTAL STEEL ERECTORS, INC.
                                     v. ALGERNON BLAIR, INC.

                     United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit
                                       479 F.2d 638 (4th Cir. 1973)

CRAVEN, Circuit Judge:

         May a subcontractor, who justifiably ceases work under a contract because of
the prime contractor's breach, recover in quantum meruit the value of labor and
equipment already furnished pursuant to the contract irrespective of whether he
would have been entitled to recover in a suit on the contract? We think so, and, for
reasons to be stated, the decision of the district court will be reversed.

         The subcontractor, Coastal Steel Erectors, Inc., brought this action under the
provisions of the Miller Act, 40 U.S.C. § 270a et seq., in the name of the United States
against Algernon Blair, Inc., and its surety, United States Fidelity and Guaranty
Company.3 Blair had entered a contract with the United States for the construction
of a naval hospital in Charleston County, South Carolina. Blair had then contracted
with Coastal to perform certain steel erection and supply certain equipment in
conjunction with Blair's contract with the United States. Coastal commenced
performance of its obligations, supplying its own cranes for handling and placing
steel. Blair refused to pay for crane rental, maintaining that it was not obligated to
do so under the subcontract. Because of Blair's failure to make payments for crane
rental, and after completion of approximately 28 percent of the subcontract, Coastal
terminated its performance. Blair then proceeded to complete the job with a new
subcontractor. Coastal brought this action to recover for labor and equipment
furnished.

         The district court found that the subcontract required Blair to pay for crane
use and that Blair's refusal to do so was such a material breach as to justify Coastal's
terminating performance. This finding is not questioned on appeal. The court then
found that under the contract the amount due Coastal, less what had already been
paid, totaled approximately $37,000. Additionally, the court found Coastal would
have lost more than $37,000 if it had completed performance. Holding that any
amount due Coastal must be reduced by any loss it would have incurred by complete
performance of the contract, the court denied recovery to Coastal. While the district
court correctly stated the "`normal' rule of contract damages," we think Coastal is
entitled to recover in quantum meruit.

          3 [The Miller Act is a statute that gives subcontractors who are owed money under a
government contracts to sue the prime contractor and its surety in federal court. For procedural
reasons, such cases are brought in the name of the United States ex relatione (roughly, "on behalf of"
the subcontractor, although it is actually a dispute between private parties. - Eds.]

506  CHAPTER VIII: REMEDIES
         In United States ex rel. Susi Contracting Co. v. Zara Contracting Co., 146 F.2d
606 (2d Cir. 1944), a Miller Act action, the court was faced with a situation similar to
that involved here--the prime contractor had unjustifiably breached a subcontract
after partial performance by the subcontractor. The court stated:

         For it is an accepted principle of contract law, often applied in the case
         of construction contracts, that the promisee upon breach has the option
         to forego any suit on the contract and claim only the reasonable value of
         his performance.

146 F.2d at 610. The Tenth Circuit has also stated that the right to seek recovery
under quantum meruit in a Miller Act case is clear. Quantum meruit recovery is not
limited to an action against the prime contractor but may also be brought against the
Miller Act surety, as in this case. Further, that the complaint is not clear in regard
to the theory of a plaintiff's recovery does not preclude recovery under quantum
meruit. Narragansett Improvement Co. v. United States, 290 F.2d 577 (1st Cir. 1961).
A plaintiff may join a claim for quantum meruit with a claim for damages from breach
of contract.

         In the present case, Coastal has, at its own expense, provided Blair with labor
and the use of equipment. Blair, who breached the subcontract, has retained these
benefits without having fully paid for them. On these facts, Coastal is entitled to
restitution in quantum meruit.

         The "restitution interest," involving a combination of unjust impoverishment
with unjust gain, presents the strongest case for relief. If, following Aristotle, we
regard the purpose of justice as the maintenance of an equilibrium of goods among
members of society, the restitution interest presents twice as strong a claim to judicial
intervention as the reliance interest, since if A not only causes B to lose one unit but
appropriates that unit to himself, the resulting discrepancy between A and B is not
one unit but two.

         The impact of quantum meruit is to allow a promisee to recover the value of
services he gave to the defendant irrespective of whether he would have lost money
on the contract and been unable to recover in a suit on the contract. The measure of
recovery for quantum meruit is the reasonable value of the performance, and recovery
is undiminished by any loss which would have been incurred by complete
performance. While the contract price may be evidence of reasonable value of the
services, it does not measure the value of the performance or limit recovery. Rather,
the standard for measuring the reasonable value of the services rendered is the
amount for which such services could have been purchased from one in the plaintiff's
position at the time and place the services were rendered.

         Since the district court has not yet accurately determined the reasonable value
of the labor and equipment use furnished by Coastal to Blair, the case must be

______________________________________________________________________________

remanded for those findings. When the amount has been determined, judgment will
be entered in favor of Coastal, less payments already made under the contract.

                                           _____________________

         Review Question 2. The Algernon Blair court says that a "plaintiff may join a
claim for quantum meruit with a claim for damages from breach of contract." What
does the court mean when it refers to a "claim for quantum meruit," and why is that
claim not considered a breach of contract claim?

         Review Question 3. The subcontractor in Algernon Blair apparently made a
bad deal and got lucky that the government breached the contract. Why do you think
a court would approve a remedy that gives the subcontractor anything at all?

         Review Question 4. Parties frequently enter into contracts with a profit
motive, hoping to end up richer than before as a result of the contract. Indeed, the
law of contracts greatly facilitates such business dealings. If you were a judge, what
rule would you articulate as to what kind of enrichment is "unjust" rather than
socially-beneficial profit seeking?

B. Reliance

                      SULLIVAN v. O'CONNOR
             Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts

               363 Mass. 579, 296 N.E.2d 183 (1973)

         The plaintiff patient secured a jury verdict of $13,500 against the defendant
surgeon for breach of contract in respect to an operation upon the plaintiff's nose. The
declaration was in two counts. In the first count, the plaintiff alleged that she, as
patient, entered into a contract with the defendant, a surgeon, wherein the defendant
promised to perform plastic surgery on her nose and thereby to enhance her beauty
and improve her appearance; that he performed the surgery but failed to achieve the
promised result; rather the result of the surgery was to disfigure and deform her nose,
to cause her pain in body and mind, and to subject her to other damage and expense.
The second count, based on the same transaction, was in the conventional form for
malpractice, charging that the defendant had been guilty of negligence in performing
the surgery. Answering, the defendant entered a general denial.

         On the plaintiff's demand, the case was tried by jury. At the close of the
evidence, the judge put to the jury, as special questions, the issues of liability under
the two counts, and instructed them accordingly. The jury returned a verdict for the
plaintiff on the contract count, and for the defendant on the negligence count.

     [Discussion of the negligence count is omitted.]

______________________________________________________________________________

508                                                    CHAPTER VIII: REMEDIES
         As background, we mention certain facts as the jury could find them. The
plaintiff was a professional entertainer and this was known to the defendant. The
agreement was as alleged in the declaration. More particularly, judging from
exhibits, the plaintiff's nose had been straight, but long and prominent; the defendant
undertook by two operations to reduce its prominence and somewhat to shorten it,
thus making it more pleasing in relation to the plaintiff's other features. Actually the
plaintiff was obliged to undergo three operations, and her appearance was worsened.
Her nose now had a concave line to about the midpoint, at which it became bulbous;
viewed frontally, the nose from bridge to midpoint was flattened and broadened, and
the two sides of the tip had lost symmetry. This configuration evidently could not be
improved by further surgery. The plaintiff did not demonstrate, however, that her
change of appearance had resulted in loss of employment. Payments by the plaintiff
covering the defendant's fee and hospital expenses were stipulated at $622.65.

         If an action on the basis of contract is allowed, we have the question of the
measure of damages to be applied where liability is found. Some cases have taken the
simple view that the promise by the physician is to be treated like an ordinary
commercial promise, and accordingly that the successful plaintiff is entitled to a
standard measure of recovery for breach of contract, "compensatory" ("expectancy")
damages, an amount intended to put the plaintiff in the position he would be in if the
contract had been performed, or, presumably, at the plaintiff's election, "restitution"
damages, an amount corresponding to any benefit conferred by the plaintiff upon the
defendant in the performance of the contract disrupted by the defendant's breach.
Thus in Hawkins v. McGee, 146 A. 641 (N.H. 1929), the court, following the usual
expectancy formula, would have asked the jury to estimate and award to the plaintiff
the difference between the value of a good or perfect hand, as promised, and the value
of the hand after the operation. If the plaintiff had not yet paid the doctor his fee,
that amount would be deducted from the recovery. There could be no recovery for the
pain and suffering of the operation, since that detriment would have been incurred
even if the operation had been successful; one can say that this detriment was not
"caused" by the breach. But where the plaintiff by reason of the operation was put to
more pain than he would have had to endure, had the doctor performed as promised,
he should be compensated for that difference as a proper part of his expectancy
recovery. The New Hampshire court further refined the Hawkins analysis in
McQuaid v. Michou, 85 N. H. 299, all in the direction of treating the patient-physician
cases on the ordinary footing of expectancy. See McGee v. United States Fid. & Guar.
Co. 53 F.2d 953 (1st Cir. 1931) (later development in the Hawkins case).

         Other cases, including a number in New York, without distinctly repudiating
the Hawkins type of analysis, have indicated that a different and generally more
lenient measure of damages is to be applied in patient-physician actions based on
breach of alleged special agreements to effect a cure, attain a stated result, or employ
a given medical method. This measure is expressed in somewhat variant ways, but

______________________________________________________________________________

UNIT 24: RESTITUTION AND RELIANCE  509
the substance is that the plaintiff is to recover any expenditures made by him and for
other detriment (usually not specifically described in the opinions) following
proximately and foreseeably upon the defendant's failure to carry out his promise.
This, be it noted, is not a "restitution" measure, for it is not limited to restoration of
the benefit conferred on the defendant (the fee paid) but includes other expenditures,
for example, amounts paid for medicine and nurses; so also it would seem according
to its logic to take in damages for any worsening of the plaintiff's condition due to the
breach. Nor is it an "expectancy" measure, for it does not appear to contemplate
recovery of the whole difference in value between the condition as promised and the
condition actually resulting from the treatment. Rather the tendency of the
formulation is to put the plaintiff back in the position he occupied just before the
parties entered upon the agreement, to compensate him for the detriments he
suffered in reliance upon the agreement. This kind of intermediate pattern of
recovery for breach of contract is discussed in the suggestive article by Fuller and
Perdue, The Reliance Interest in Contract Damages, 46 YALE L.J. 52, 373, where the
authors show that, although not attaining the currency of the standard measures, a
"reliance" measure has for special reasons been applied by the courts in a variety of
settings, including noncommercial settings.

         For breach of the patient-physician agreements under consideration, a
recovery limited to restitution seems plainly too meager, if the agreements are to be
enforced at all. On the other hand, an expectancy recovery may well be excessive. The
factors, already mentioned, which have made the cause of action somewhat suspect,
also suggest moderation as to the breadth of the recovery that should be permitted.
Where, as in the case at bar and in a number of the reported cases, the doctor has
been absolved of negligence by the trier, an expectancy measure may be thought
harsh. We should recall here that the fee paid by the patient to the doctor for the
alleged promise would usually be quite disproportionate to the putative expectancy
recovery. To attempt, moreover, to put a value on the condition that would or might
have resulted, had the treatment succeeded as promised, may sometimes put an
exceptional strain on the imagination of the fact finder. As a general consideration,
Fuller and Perdue argue that the reasons for granting damages for broken promises
to the extent of the expectancy are at their strongest when the promises are made in
a business context, when they have to do with the production or distribution of goods
or the allocation of functions in the market place; they become weaker as the context
shifts from a commercial to a noncommercial field. There is much to be said, then, for
applying a reliance measure to the present facts, and we have only to add that our
cases are not unreceptive to the use of that formula in special situations. Suffering or
distress resulting from the breach going beyond that which was envisaged by the
treatment as agreed, should be compensable on the same ground as the worsening of
the patient's conditions because of the breach. Indeed it can be argued that the very
suffering or distress "contracted for"--that which would have been incurred if the
treatment achieved the promised result--should also be compensable on the theory

______________________________________________________________________________

510  CHAPTER VIII: REMEDIES
underlying the New York cases. For that suffering is "wasted" if the treatment fails.
Otherwise stated, compensation for this waste is arguably required in order to
complete the restoration of the status quo ante.

         In the light of the foregoing discussion, the plaintiff was not confined to the
recovery of her out-of-pocket expenditures; she was entitled to recover also for the
worsening of her condition, and for the pain and suffering and mental distress
involved in the third operation. These items were compensable on either an
expectancy or a reliance view. We might have been required to elect between the two
views if the pain and suffering connected with the first two operations contemplated
by the agreement, or the whole difference in value between the present and the
promised conditions, were being claimed as elements of damage. But the plaintiff
waives her possible claim to the former element, and to so much of the latter as
represents the difference in value between the promised condition and the condition
before the operations.

         Review Question 5. Note the court's statements that an expectancy measure
"may be thought harsh." Presumably the doctor would think it harsh, but would the
patient? Would you? What argument, if any, does the court make to suggest that
there is some sort of unfairness in enforcing expectancy in this kind of situation?

         Review Question 6. Do you agree with the court that plastic surgery (and
healthcare in general) is a "noncommercial" field? If so, should that make a
difference? Should promises made by your plastic surgeon be treated differently than
those made by your hair stylist?

MISTLETOE EXPRESS SERVICE OF OKLAHOMA CITY v. LOCKE
                       Court of Appeals of Texas, Sixth District

                    762 S.W.2d 637 (Tex. App.--Texarkana 1988)

CORNELIUS, J.

         Mistletoe Express Service appeals from an adverse judgment in a breach of
contract suit.

         Phyllis Locke, doing business as Paris Freight Company, entered into a
contract with Mistletoe on October 18, 1984, which provided that Locke would
perform a pickup and delivery service for Mistletoe at various locations in Texas. The
contract term was one year from October 1, 1984. At the expiration of the initial term,

______________________________________________________________________________

UNIT 24: RESTITUTION AND RELIANCE                                 511
the agreement would continue on a month-to-month basis until either party
terminated it by thirty-day written notice.

         In order to perform her contract, it was necessary for Locke to make certain
investments and expenditures. In uncontroverted testimony, she stated that she
spent $3,500 for materials to build a steel and pipe ramp and $1,000 for dirt work.
She also borrowed $15,000, with which she purchased two vehicles for $ 9,000 and
paid $ 6,000 for starting-up expenses. She testified that she would not have done any
of these things had she not made the contract with Mistletoe. Locke's company never
made a profit, although the losses decreased each month while the contract was in
force.

         On May 15, 1985, Mistletoe notified Locke that it planned to cancel the
contract effective June 15, 1985. Locke closed her business and sold the vehicles for
$6,000, taking a loss of $3,000. At the time of trial, Locke still owed $9,750 on her
$15,000 loan, and had paid $2,650 in interest. She testified that the customized ramp
was worth $500 as scrap. She considered the $1,000.00 expended for dirt work a lost
expense.

         The jury found Locke's damages at $19,400.00. The court entered judgment for
that amount, plus prejudgment interest and attorney's fees of $ 2,000.

         Mistletoe's sole contention is that the trial court should have granted it a
directed verdict or judgment notwithstanding the verdict, because there is no
evidence to support the damages which the jury awarded. The gist of the argument
is that the victim of a contract breach is only entitled to be placed in the position he
would have been in had the contract been performed, and therefore Locke could only
recover the profits she lost by reason of the breach.

         It is a general rule that the victim of a breach of contract should be restored to
the position he would have been in had the contract been performed. Determining
that position involves finding what additions to the injured party's wealth have been
prevented by the breach and what subtractions from his wealth have been caused by
it. 5 ARTHUR L. CORBIN, CORBIN ON CONTRACTS § 992 (1964). Where the contract
requires a capital investment by one of the parties in order to perform, that party's
reasonable expectation of profit includes recouping the capital investment. The
expending party would not be in as good a position as if the contract had been
performed if he is not afforded the opportunity, i.e., the full contract term, to recoup
his investment. Houston Chronicle Publishing Co. v. McNair Trucklease, Inc., 519
S.W.2d 924 (Tex. Civ. App. 1975). To recover these expenditures they must have been
reasonably made in performance of the contract or in necessary preparation.

     The Restatement (Second) of Contracts § 349 (1981) states:

     As an alternative to [expectation damages], the injured party has a right
     to damages based on his reliance interest, including expenditures made
     in preparation for performance or in performance, less any loss that the

______________________________________________________________________________

512  CHAPTER VIII: REMEDIES
         party in breach can prove with reasonable certainty the injured party
         would have suffered had the contract been performed.

Further, in section 349, comment a, the authors of the Restatement state:

         Under the rule stated in this Section, the injured party may, if he
         chooses, ignore the element of profit and recover as damages his
         expenditures in reliance. He may choose to do this . . . in the case of a
         losing contract, one under which he would have had a loss rather than a
         profit. In that case, however, it is open to the party in breach to prove the
         amount of the loss, to the extent that he can do so with reasonable
         certainty under the standard stated in section 352, and have it
         subtracted from the injured party's damages.

(Emphasis added.)

         Under these rules, Locke is entitled to the expenditures she incurred in order
to perform her contract. Her uncontradicted testimony and exhibits prove the
amounts of these damages.

         Mistletoe's argument that Locke must show what her position would have been
at the earliest time the contract could legally have been terminated is misplaced.
Under the cited rules, she can recover her reliance expenditures because she was
deprived of an opportunity to recoup those expenditures. Moreover, Mistletoe is not
entitled to have Locke's losses deducted from the recovery, because Mistletoe had the
burden to prove that amount, if any, and it did not do so. Restatement (Second) of
Contracts § 349 cmt a.

         There is no evidence, however, to support an award of $19,400.00. That figure
includes both the loss from the resale of the vehicles which were purchased with the
loan and the current balance of the loan. Locke's reliance damages were the amount
of the loan ($15,000), less the amount recovered from the sale of the property
purchased with the loan ($6,000). The resulting $9,000 should be added to the cost of
the dirt work ($1,000) and the loss from the materials for the ramp ($3,000).
Furthermore, Locke would be receiving a double recovery also if she recovers the full
amount of the interest paid on the loan as well as the prejudgment interest allowed
by the judgment.

         For the reasons stated, the judgment of the trial court is reformed to award
Locke damages in the sum of $13,000, plus prejudgment interest thereon for 910
days, plus attorney's fees of $2,000.00, as awarded in the original judgment. As
reformed, the judgment of the trial court is affirmed.

         Review Question 7. Note the parallel between Mistletoe Express and Algernon
Blair. Both cases involved parties who were losing money on contracts and actually
came out better because of the breach. But the Algernon Blair plaintiff sought
restitution damages while the plaintiff in Mistletoe Express sought reliance. Think
about why each chose that measure, and try to explain why both parties had really
good lawyers.

         Review Question 8. On the basis of this and the following case, can you
articulate the standard for calculating what elements of expense should be considered
as reliance damages? Are courts doing anything more than throwing things at the
wall to see what sticks? If so, what are they doing?

                    DOERING EQUIPMENT CO. v. JOHN DEERE CO.
                                    Appeals Court of Massachusetts

                61 Mass. App. Ct. 850, 815 N.E.2d 234 (Mass. Ct. App. 2004)

KAFKER, J.

         Doering Equipment Company (Doering) had lost money every year on its
contract to act as a distributor for John Deere Co. (Deere) golf and turf products.
When Deere insisted that Doering purchase a large number of "turf gators," a new
multi-purpose utility vehicle that Doering thought would sell poorly, Doering
terminated the contract and sought to recover its losses incurred during the previous
three years. It claimed that the demand that it purchase the turf gators breached the
covenant of good faith and fair dealing.

         Doering brought suit against Deere, seeking recovery of approximately
$500,000, consisting of its operating losses for its golf and turf business over the last
three years ($139,865 in 1996; $150,720 in 1995; and $172,783 in 1994) and attorney's
fees. Doering did not seek recovery for lost profits. Deere counterclaimed for monies
previously owed.

         [The trial judge granted summary judgment for Deere on most claims and
prohibited Doering from introducing evidence of its alleged reliance damages--its
losses in performing the contract for the previous three years--on its remaining
claims. The court also granted Deere $118,467.34 plus attorney's fees of $70,000 on
its counterclaims for goods received and not paid for.]

         Doering has consistently sought to recover all its operating losses, but its
theory of recovery has an elusive, chameleon-like quality. On appeal, Doering appears
to have settled generally on a reliance theory of damages. It also identifies the turf
gator demand as the breach or unfair trade practice for which it seeks recovery. The
relationship between the breach and the damages, however, is unclear.

______________________________________________________________________________

514  CHAPTER VIII: REMEDIES
         As the trial judge recognized, there appears to be no causal connection between
the prior years' losses and the demand that Doering purchase the turf gators. See,
e.g., Massachusetts Farm Bureau Federation, Inc. v. Blue Cross of Massachusetts,
Inc., 532 N.E.2d 660 (Mass. 1989) ("In the absence of a causal relationship between
the alleged unfair acts and the claimed loss, there can be no recovery"). See VMark
Software, Inc. v. EMC Corp., 642 N.E.2d 587 (Mass. App. Ct. 1994) (measure of
contract reliance damages is "similar to the tort standard of actual, or out-of-pocket,
loss proximately suffered"). See also Sullivan v. O'Connor, 296 N.E.2d 183 (Mass.
1973). The damages sought had been sustained while the contract was being
performed according to its terms, before the turf gator demand was made. According
to the damages figures submitted by Doering, the agreement was a losing proposition
from the outset. The damages were, therefore, caused by the bad bargain itself, not
the October breach. The breach may have led Doering to terminate the contract, but
it did not cause the contract losses, which Doering had already incurred.

         Doering seems to recognize the unfavorable nature of the bargain as it makes
no argument that the breach prevented it from continuing the contract and recouping
the accrued losses. See Mistletoe Express Serv. v. Locke, 762 S.W.2d 637, 638 (Tex.
App. 1988). Doering also has not generally argued that the breach deprived it of the
benefit of the bargain. See Anthony's Pier Four, Inc. v. HBC Associates, 583 N.E.2d
806 (1991); VMark Software, 642 N.E.2d at 590 n.2 ("the long-established general
rule for breach of contract recovery in Massachusetts is that the wronged party
should receive the benefit of his bargain, i.e, be placed in the same position as if the
contract had been performed"). See also Restatement (Second) of Contracts § 347
(1981) ("Contract damages are ordinarily based on the injured party's expectation
interest and are intended to give him the benefit of his bargain by awarding him a
sum of money that will, to the extent possible, put him in as good a position as he
would have been in had the contract been performed").

         Relying on VMark Software and Restatement section 349, Doering contends
instead that it is entitled to recover its operating losses for the three years prior to
the "constructive termination" of the contract as "reliance" damages. As this court
stated in VMark, "in an appropriate case, Massachusetts law permits, as an
alternative to such `expectation' damages, the recovery of `reliance' damages, i.e.,
expenditures made in reliance upon a contractual obligation that was not performed."
VMark, 42 N.E.2d at 590 n.2. See Sullivan v. O'Connor, 296 N.E.2d at 186-88; Lord's
& Lady's Enterprises, Inc. v. John Paul Mitchell Systems, 705 N.E.2d 302 (Mass. App.
Ct. 1999).

         In VMark, unlike this case, there was a direct causal connection between the
expenditures sought by the injured party as reliance damages, and the contractual
obligations that were not performed. There, the injured party purchased computer
hardware from a third company in "reliance on VMark's supplying it with a software

______________________________________________________________________________

UNIT 24: RESTITUTION AND RELIANCE  515
product that would be fully functional in conjunction with that hardware." We
concluded that the hardware would not have been purchased "but for VMark's
misleading representations." Here, in contrast, the motion judge, in allowing
summary judgment, rejected Doering's contention that it could prove that it entered
into the contract and incurred the expenses based on various misrepresentations.
Doering does not challenge this decision on appeal. The lack of a causal connection
between the claimed breach (or unfair act) and the losses is fatal to Doering's claims.

         Furthermore, as provided in the Restatement (Second) of Contracts § 349, the
"injured party has a right to damages based on his reliance interest, including
expenditures made in preparation for performance or in performance," but "less any
loss that the party in breach can prove with reasonable certainty the injured party
would have suffered had the contract been performed." See L. Albert & Son v.
Armstrong Rubber Co., 178 F.2d 182, 189 (2d Cir. 1949) (where Hand, J., writing for
the court, stated, "on principle therefore the proper solution would seem to be that
the promisee may recover his outlay in preparation for the performance, subject to
the privilege of the promisor to reduce it by as much as he can show that the promisee
would have lost, if the contract had been performed").4 In the instant case, Doering is
seeking to recover expenditures made in preparation for performance or during
performance, but has also demonstrated, through its own submissions, that the
contract, as performed, had been a losing proposition since inception, separate and
apart from the breach. In fact, the operating losses for the contract, while being
performed by both parties, are exactly what Doering seeks to recover. We are,
therefore, in the rare position of being able to judge with accuracy "what the fate of
the venture would have been had it not been interrupted" by the defendant's breach.
Fuller & Perdue, The Reliance Interest in Contract Damages, 46 YALE L.J. 52, 79
(1936).

         If Doering recovered its losses as requested, it would be in a better position
than if the contract had been performed. This would violate the fundamental
principle first articulated by Professor Fuller and thereafter adopted by Judge
Learned Hand in Albert & Son, the Restatement (Second), and this court in Lord's &
Lady's Enterprises, that "we will not in a suit for reimbursement for losses incurred
in reliance on a contract knowingly put the plaintiff in a better position than he would
have [been in] . . . had the contract been fully performed." Fuller & Perdue, 46 YALE
L.J. at 79. See Productora e Importadora de Papel v. Fleming, 383 N.E.2d 1129 (Mass.

          4 [By the court] We recognize that a "party standing in breach cannot insist on mathematical
precision in the measurement of damages, and may expect some lack of sympathy when he claims
that the loss would have been suffered even if breach had not occurred." Gilmore v. Century Bank &

Problem 24.1

         Titus, a wealthy oil magnate, is a huge fan of Gram Parsons, the influential
musician who co-founded the Flying Burrito Brothers and who died at age 26 of a
drug and alcohol overdose in 1973. He has an extensive collection of Parsons
memorabilia and other materials related to the Los Angeles country-rock scene in the
period 1965-75. Titus really wants the turquoise 1960 Ford Galaxie convertible that
Parsons owned when he moved to Los Angeles in 1966, and which has marijuana
decals and cigarette burns inflicted by Parsons. The car is now owned by a distant
cousin of Parsons, Elmer. Titus and Elmer sign a contract in which Elmer will sell
the car to Titus for $1 million. The car, which is currently loaned on display at the
Country Music Museum in Del Ray, Florida, will be delivered in three months, on
July 15. Titus puts $50,000 down on the car.

         Titus immediately begins renovations to his palatial Houston home, widening
the living room and opening it into a gallery of his collection. Architects design a
special lighted platform on which the car will be displayed; the car will effectively be
the centerpiece of his home. The renovations necessary to accommodate the car are
done at a total cost of $200,000.

         Three days before the car is due to be delivered, Elmer calls Titus and informs
him that he has decided that the car is better off in a museum, and so he has sold the

car to the Country Music Museum for $1,000,001. Elmer returns Titus's check. Titus
subsequently sues Elmer. As the car has already been conveyed to the Museum,
Titus's only remedy is damages. What damages can he collect from Elmer? Work
through each of the three categories. Which one would he be advised to seek?

Problem 24.2

         Back in Unit 9, which covered promissory estoppel, you read the case of
Hoffman v. Red Owl Stores, Inc. There, Joseph Hoffman had extensive, multi-year
negotiations about obtaining a Red Owl grocery store franchise. The two sides never
signed a final contract, but Hoffman sold his bakery, bought a small grocery store to
gain experience, and engaged in other transactions in the midst of representations
made by Red Owl during the negotiations. Hoffman never received a Red Owl
franchise, and he sued Red Owl. While the parties had no contract, the Wisconsin
Supreme Court held that Hoffman could recover based on promissory estoppel. With
regard to damages, the court said "it would be a mistake to regard an action grounded
on promissory estoppel as the equivalent of a breach of contract action" that allowed
for recovery of expectancy damages. Instead damages must be based on reliance, and
even reliance damages could be allowed only to the extent that injustice could be
avoided. The case was then remanded to the trial court for a new trial on the issue of
damages.

         You are a clerk working for the trial judge in Hoffman upon its remand.
Assume for purposes of this problem that Hoffman is seeking from Red Owl Stores
the categories of damages listed below (which, incidentally, are not the same as those
in the real-life case). The judge has asked you to determine whether each type of
qualifies as expectancy, restitution, or reliance damages, given that only reliance
damages will likely be recoverable. If you think you need more information to answer
any of the questions, you should identify the information.

         (a) Expected future profits from Hoffman's bakery, which he sold upon the
recommendation of Red Owl.

         (c) Losses incurred when Hoffman sold the equipment and fixtures from his
small "starter" grocery store below cost based on Red Owl's statement that it was
about to grant him a Red Owl franchise.

         (d) Rental costs of an additional $150 per month incurred when Hoffman
moved his family 100 miles to be closer to the location of his expected Red Owl
franchise.

         (e) $1,000 paid to Red Owl as a nonrefundable "Franchisee Consideration
Fee" at the time Hoffman and Red Owl commenced their negotiations.

         (f) Anticipated profits from Hoffman's operation of a Red Owl grocery store.

         (g) $250 loan commitment fee paid by Hoffman to First State Bank in
connection with obtaining approval for a loan that was intended to be paid to Red
Owl as the "Franchise Fee" at the time Red Owl granted the franchise.

Problem 24.3
         In the immediately preceding unit (UNIT 23: THE EXPECTANCY INTEREST), the

Hawkins v. McGee court found the following jury instruction on damages to be
erroneous:

         "If you find the plaintiff entitled to anything, he is entitled to recover for
         what pain and suffering he has been made to endure and what injury he
         has sustained over and above the injury that he had before." [By] this
         instruction..., the jury was permitted to consider two elements of
         damage, (1) pain and suffering due to the operation, and (2) positive ill
         effects of the operation upon the plaintiff's hand.

The damages instruction was in error, said the Hawkins court, because it did not
measure George Hawkins's expectation damages from the surgery on his hand. What
should this jury instruction say in a jurisdiction where only reliance damages were
available? What should the jury instruction say if only restitution damages were
available?

                         Limits on Damages

                            FOCUS OF THIS UNIT

         In evaluating the principal measures of damages in American contract law--
expectancy, reliance, and restitution--we first focused on the general methods of
calculating the damages in each category. Much of the initial dispute among
contracting parties regarding those calculations relates to valuation of items that
parties agree, at least in principle, should be part of the damages formulation.
Outside of valuation, however, American contract law sets limits on the means and
methods by which parties can prove damages. Particularly with expectancy damages,
where contract law is necessarily imagining an alternative future without a contract
breach, it should come as no surprise that courts will let imaginations run only so far.
A party seeking to prove its claim must work around three important limits on its
ability to recover damages. The limitations of foreseeability, avoidability, and
certainty are the subject of this unit.

         Foreseeability. Today's concept that contract damages must be foreseeable to
the breaching party in order to be recoverable by the non-breaching party traces back
to the famous English case of Hadley v. Baxendale, 156 Eng. Rep. 145 (Ex. Ch. 1854).
In Hadley, plaintiffs owned a flour mill that went out of service because of a break in
the crankshaft that worked the mill. Through neglect by the defendant delivery
service, a needed replacement part arrived five days late, and plaintiffs sought to
recover their loss of five days of output by the mill. The court declined to award those
damages because they could not "reasonably be supposed to have been in the
contemplation of both parties, at the time they made the contract, as the probable
result of the breach of it." More than 160 years later, American contract law prohibits
the awarding of damages that were not foreseeable to both parties at the time of
contracting. The Hadley rule shows up in many places, including in section 351 of the
Restatement (Second) of Contracts and in Article 74 of the CISG.

         Avoidability and the "Duty to Mitigate." Once a contracting party knows that
it is the victim of a breach, is it allowed to do nothing and let its damages award keep
ticking upward? The general answer to this question is no. Section 350 of the

______________________________________________________________________________

UNIT 25: LIMITS ON DAMAGES                      521
Restatement (Second) of Contracts states the typical rule: If a non-breaching party
can avoid breach-of-contract damages "without undue risk, burden, or humiliation,"
but fails to do so, it will not be awarded those damages. Lawyers and courts
sometimes refer to this concept as the "duty to mitigate," but you should understand
that this is not a "duty" in the sense of being an affirmative obligation such as the
duty of ordinary care in negligence law. A party is free to not mitigate its damages,
but the cost of it doing so is that it will not be awarded those damages it could have
avoided.

         Certainty. Our final limiting doctrine is very easy to state but somewhat
challenging to apply. Section 352 of the Restatement (Second) of Contracts provides
that "[d]amages are not recoverable for loss beyond an amount that the evidence
permits to be established with reasonable certainty." What exactly does "reasonable
certainty" mean? Where buyer Burge's new business venture suffers because of seller
Snyder's contract breach, proving expectancy damages can be quite difficult because
of the certainty test. Burge might claim that his line of collectable law professor
figurines would have generated enormous profits if only Snyder had delivered the
rare marble required to make them. Can Burge prove his claim in a way that rises
above the level of pure (and self-interested) speculation? Application of this test ends
up being very fact specific and allows for a great deal of creative advocacy by lawyers.

           SOUTHERN ILLINOIS RIVERBOAT/CASINO CRUISES, INC.
                                 v. HNEDAK BOBO GROUP, INC.

              United States District Court for the Southern District of Illinois

GILBERT, U.S.D.J.

         This matter comes before the Court on a motion for partial summary judgment
on the issue of liability for plaintiff's fire watch expenses filed by defendant Hnedak
Bobo Group, Inc. ("HBG"). The plaintiff, Southern Illinois Riverboat/Casino Cruises,
Inc. ("Harrahs"), has responded to HBG's motion and HBG has replied to the
response.

         Harrahs and HBG entered into an agreement on June 29, 2000, under which
HBG agreed to design the docking facility for a riverboat casino Harrahs planned to
build on the Ohio River in Metropolis, Illinois. Harrahs wanted to replace the casino

______________________________________________________________________________

522                CHAPTER VIII: REMEDIES
it was operating on the site because it was in very poor condition. The parties' contract
(the Agreement) contained several provisions dealing with code compliance. Among
other things, HBG agreed to assist Harrahs "in the filing of the required documents
for the approval of governmental authorities having jurisdiction over the Project" and
to revise "the drawings, if necessary for such approval." The Agreement also provides
that, "Prior to the commencement of construction, [HBG] shall provide
documentation to [Harrahs] that, in the professional judgment of [HBG], all plans
specifications and drawings conform to all applicable governmental regulations,
statutes and ordinances, and the improvements when built in accordance therewith
will conform to applicable regulations."

         Pursuant to the Agreement, HBG designed a dock with four ramps providing
access to the riverboat. HBG eventually determined, after employing an independent
code consultant, that a cheaper, two-ramp design would satisfy the applicable codes
and regulations. Upon review, Harrahs agreed to the two-ramp design. On March 23,
2000, HBG, its code consultant, and Harrahs met with a representative of the State
Fire Marshal to review the two-ramp plan. The Fire Marshal's representative orally
confirmed that the two-ramp plan complied with applicable fire code. He declined,
however, to provide written approval of the design because it was his policy to
withhold such approval until he conducted an inspection of a completed facility.

         HBG completed the dock in August 2001. On August 6, 2001, Harrahs moved
the old boat to the new dock and continued operating the old boat there until the new
boat arrived. The Fire Marshal inspected the old boat/new dock facility on August 24,
2001, and concluded that it failed to meet code because of ingress and egress
problems. The Fire Marshal refused to certify the structure and told Harrahs it had
to maintain a fire watch if it intended to continue its operations. Harrahs chose to
keep the facility open and to maintain the fire watch.1

         Once the new boat arrived on September 10, 2001 and its connection to the
new dock was complete, the Fire Marshal inspected the set up and concluded that the
facility needed additional ramps to comply with code. He concluded that the casino
could not remain open unless Harrahs continued to maintain a fire watch. After an
abortive appeal, Harrahs decided to build a third ramp. HBG claims Harrahs asked
it and Thompson to submit plans for building the third ramp. HBG claims Harrahs
chose to go with Thompson and fired HBG. Harrahs, on the other hand, contends that
HBG continued to be involved with the third ramp until its completion.

          1 [By the court] Because of the code violations, Harrahs had to pay local firefighters to keep a
fire watch on the boat 24 hours a day until it attained compliance with applicable codes.

______________________________________________________________________________

UNIT 25: LIMITS ON DAMAGES  523
         Harrahs brings the instant action against HBG, alleging that it breached both
express and implied warranties by submitting a plan for the dock that did not comply
with applicable code.

         HBG [argues that] summary judgment [should be granted] on the issue of
damages for fire watch expenses [because] Harrahs cannot recover pursuant to the
rule of Hadley v. Baxendale, 156 Eng. Rep. 145.

         Citing Hadley, HBG claims it cannot be liable for the fire watch damages
because the parties never contemplated that Harrahs would "open early." It further
contends that the Agreement specifically addressed how the parties would act if the
casino failed to obtain the necessary permits: HBG was to redesign the dock and
assist Harrahs in obtaining the proper permits. Harrahs, on the other hand, argues
that the fire watches are common in the industry, making them at least foreseeable,
if not within the contemplation of the parties. In support of this proposition, Harrahs
notes that the Office of the State Fire Marshal (OSFM) can require a fire watch when
a particular building does not meet the applicable codes. HBG's code consultant, Jeff
Boyle, testified at his deposition that he was aware that a fire watch is a possible
course of action for a fire marshal to take in the face of code problems.

         The Supreme Court of Illinois has adopted the following rule from Hadley:

         Where two parties have made a contract which one of them has broken,
         the damages which the other party ought to receive in respect of such
         breach of contract should be such as may fairly and reasonably be
         considered either arising naturally, i.e., according to the usual course of
         things, from such breach of contract itself, or such as may reasonably be
         supposed to have been in the contemplation of both parties, at the time
         they made the contract, as the probable result of the breach of it.

Midland Hotel Corp. v. Reuben H. Donnelley Corp., 515 N.E.2d 61, 67 (Ill. 1987).

         Given the testimony of Boyle and others, it certainly appears that fire watch
damages were foreseeable. While it is true that HBG had an obligation under the
Agreement to redesign the dock if it did not comply with the applicable codes, it does
not necessarily follow that the Agreement prohibited Harrahs from mitigating any
damages it might suffer as a result of noncompliance. Similarly, even if the parties
did not contemplate the need for a fire watch, this does not necessarily mean it was
not foreseeable. If it were foreseeable, then whether it was in the specific
contemplation of the parties is not particularly relevant. See Midland Hotel Corp.,
515 N.E.2d at 67.

         The Court DENIES HBG's motion for partial summary judgment on the issue
of fire watch damages.

B. The Avoidability Limitation

                    ROCKINGHAM COUNTY v. LUTEN BRIDGE CO.
                              Circuit Court of Appeals, Fourth Circuit
                                        35 F.2d 301 (4th Cir. 1929)

PARKER, Circuit Judge.

         This was an action at law instituted in the court below by the Luten Bridge
Company, as plaintiff, to recover of Rockingham County, North Carolina, an amount
alleged to be due under a contract for the construction of a bridge.

         On January 7, 1924, the board of commissioners of Rockingham County voted
to award to plaintiff a contract for the construction of the bridge in controversy. Three
of the five commissioners favored the awarding of the contract and two opposed it.
Much feeling was engendered over the matter, with the result that on February 11,
1924, W.K. Pruitt, one of the commissioners who had voted in the affirmative, sent
his resignation to the clerk of the superior court of the County. The clerk proceeded
on the next day to appoint one W.W. Hampton as a member of the board to succeed
him.2

         At a regularly advertised called meeting held on February 21, a resolution was
unanimously adopted declaring that the contract for the building of the bridge was
not legal and valid, and directing the clerk of the board to notify plaintiff that it
refused to recognize same as a valid contract, and that plaintiff should proceed no
further thereunder. This resolution also rescinded action of the board theretofore
taken looking to the construction of a hard-surfaced road, in which the bridge was to
be a mere connecting link. The clerk duly sent a certified copy of this resolution to
plaintiff.

         At the regular monthly meeting of the board on March 3, a resolution was
passed directing that plaintiff be notified that any work done on the bridge would be
done by it at its own risk and hazard, that the board was of the opinion that the
contract for the construction of the bridge was not valid and legal, and that, even if
the board were mistaken as to this, it did not desire to construct the bridge, and would

          2 [Under North Carolina law at the time, the county clerk had authority to appoint a successor
to any commissioner who had died or left office.-Eds.]

______________________________________________________________________________

UNIT 25: LIMITS ON DAMAGES  525
contest payment for same if constructed. A copy of this resolution was also sent to
plaintiff.

         On November 24, 1924, plaintiff instituted this action against Rockingham
County.

         On December 1, 1924, the newly elected board of commissioners held its first
meeting and employed attorneys to defend the action which had been instituted by
plaintiff against the County. [The County's] answer denied that the contract sued on
was legal or binding, and for a further defense set forth the resolutions of the
commissioners with regard to the building of the bridge, to which we have referred,
and their communication to plaintiff.

         At the trial, he jury was instructed to return a verdict for plaintiff for the full
amount of its claim.

         As the County now admits the execution and validity of the contract, and the
breach on its part, the ultimate question in the case is one as to the measure of
plaintiff's recovery.

         We do not think that, after the County had given notice, while the contract was
still executory, that it did not desire the bridge built and would not pay for it, plaintiff
could proceed to build it and recover the contract price. It is true that the County had
no right to rescind the contract, and the notice given plaintiff amounted to a breach
on its part; but, after plaintiff had received notice of the breach, it was its duty to do
nothing to increase the damages flowing therefrom. If A enters into a binding contract
to build a house for B, B, of course, has no right to rescind the contract without A's
consent. But if, before the house is built, he decides that he does not want it, and
notifies A to that effect, A has no right to proceed with the building and thus pile up
damages. His remedy is to treat the contract as broken when he receives the notice,
and sue for the recovery of such damages, as he may have sustained from the breach,
including any profit which he would have realized upon performance, as well as any
other losses which may have resulted to him. In the case at bar, the County decided
not to build the road of which the bridge was to be a part, and did not build it. The
bridge, built in the midst of the forest, is of no value to the County because of this
change of circumstances. When, therefore, the County gave notice to the plaintiff that
it would not proceed with the project, plaintiff should have desisted from further
work. It had no right thus to pile up damages by proceeding with the erection of a
useless bridge.

         The contrary view was expressed by Lord Cockburn in Frost v. Knight, L. R. 7
Ex. 111, but, as pointed out by Prof. Williston, it is not in harmony with the decisions
in this country. The American rule and the reasons supporting it are well stated by
Prof. Williston as follows:

              There is a line of cases running back to 1845 which holds that,
     after an absolute repudiation or refusal to perform by one party to a

______________________________________________________________________________

526  CHAPTER VIII: REMEDIES
contract, the other party cannot continue to perform and recover
damages based on full performance. This rule is only a particular
application of the general rule of damages that a plaintiff cannot hold a
defendant liable for damages which need not have been incurred; or, as
it is often stated, the plaintiff must, so far as he can without loss to
himself, mitigate the damages caused by the defendant's wrongful act.
The application of this rule to the matter in question is obvious. If a man
engages to have work done, and afterwards repudiates his contract
before the work has been begun or when it had been only partially done,
it is inflicting damage on the defendant without benefit to the plaintiff
to allow the latter to insist on proceeding with the contract. The work
may be useless to the defendant, and yet he would be forced to pay the
full contract price. On the other hand, the plaintiff is interested only in
the profit he will make out of the contract. If he receives this it is equally
advantageous for him to use his time otherwise.

3 WILLISTON ON CONTRACTS 2347.

         The leading case on the subject in this country is the New York case of Clark
v. Marsiglia, 1 Denio (N. Y.) 317. In that case defendant had employed plaintiff to
paint certain pictures for him, but countermanded the order before the work was
finished. Plaintiff, however, went on and completed the work and sued for the
contract price. In reversing a judgment for plaintiff, the court said:

The defendant, by requiring the plaintiff to stop work upon the
paintings, violated his contract, and thereby incurred a liability to pay
such damages as the plaintiff should sustain. Such damages would
include a recompense for the labor done and materials used, and such
further sum in damages as might, upon legal principles, be assessed for
the breach of the contract; but the plaintiff had no right, by obstinately
persisting in the work, to make the penalty upon the defendant greater
than it would otherwise have been.

And the rule as established by the great weight of authority in America is summed
up in the following statement in 6 R.C.L. 1029, which is quoted with approval by the
Supreme Court of North Carolina in the recent case of Novelty Advertising Co. v.
Farmers' Mutual Tobacco Warehouse Co., 119 S.E. 196, 198 (N.C.):

While a contract is executory a party has the power to stop performance

on the other side by an explicit direction to that effect, subjecting himself

to such damages as will compensate the other party for being stopped in

the performance on his part at that stage in the execution of the

contract. The party thus forbidden cannot afterwards go on, and thereby

increase the damages, and then recover such damages from the other

party.

This is in accord with the earlier North Carolina decision of Heiser v. Mears, 27 S.E.
117 (N.C.), in which it was held that, where a buyer countermands his order for goods
to be manufactured for him under an executory contract, before the work is
completed, it is notice to the seller that he elects to rescind his contract and submit
to the legal measure of damages, and that in such case the seller cannot complete the
goods and recover the contract price. See, also Kingman & Co. v. Western
Manufacturing Co. 92 F. 486 (8th Circuit) ; Davis v. Bronson, 2 N.D. 300, 50 N.W.
836; Richards v. Manitowoc & Northern Traction Co., 140 Wis. 85, 121 N. W. 837/

         We have carefully considered the cases of Roehm v. Horst, 178 U. S. 1, Roller
v. George H. Leonard & Co.. 229 F. 607 (4th Cir.), and McCoy v. Justices of Harnett
County, 53 N.C. 272, upon which plaintiff relies; but we do not think that they are at
all in point. Roehm merely follows the rule of Hochster v. De la Tour, 2 El. & Bl. 678,
to the effect that where one party to any executory contract refuses to perform in
advance of the time fixed for performance, the other party, without waiting for the
time of performance, may sue at once for damages occasioned by the breach. The same
rule is followed in Roller. In McCoy, the decision was that mandamus to require the
justices of a County to pay for a jail would be denied, where it appeared that the
contractor in building same departed from the plans and specifications. In the
opinions in all of these some language was used which lends support to plaintiff's
position, but in none of them was the point involved which is involved here.

         It follows that there was error in directing a verdict for plaintiff for the full
amount of its claim. The measure of plaintiff's damage, upon its appearing that notice
was duly given not to build the bridge, is an amount sufficient to compensate plaintiff
for labor and materials expended and expense incurred in the part performance of
the contract, prior to its repudiation, plus the profit which would have been realized

         Review Question 2. In Rockingham County some doubt truly existed on Luten
Bridge Company's part as to whether the County's cancellation was a duly authorized
act by the commissioners. (The portion of the opinion detailing the tortuous behind-
the-scenes maneuvering was edited out for purposes of brevity.) Keep in mind that if
the cancellation were not valid, Luten might be in breach if it stopped working. If you
were counsel to Luten Bridge Company and it received this kind of communication
from the County--which may or may not be valid--what would you advise the
company to do?

528  CHAPTER VIII: REMEDIES
                PARKER v. TWENTIETH CENTURY-FOX FILM CORP.
                                       Supreme Court of California

               3 Cal. 3d 176, 474 P.2d 689, 89 Cal. Rptr. 737 (1970) (in bank)

         Defendant Twentieth Century-Fox Film Corporation appeals from a summary
judgment granting to plaintiff [who was legally named Shirley Parker, but was better
known professionally as Shirley MacLaine] the recovery of agreed compensation
under a written contract for her services as an actress in a motion picture. As will
appear, we have concluded that the trial court correctly ruled in plaintiff's favor and
that the judgment should be affirmed.

         Plaintiff is well known as an actress, and in the contract between plaintiff and
defendant is sometimes referred to as the "Artist." Under the contract, dated August
6, 1965, plaintiff was to play the female lead in defendant's contemplated production
of a motion picture entitled "Bloomer Girl." The contract provided that defendant
would pay plaintiff a minimum "guaranteed compensation" of $53,571.42 per week
for 14 weeks commencing May 23, 1966, for a total of $750,000. Prior to May 1966
defendant decided not to produce the picture and by a letter dated April 4, 1966, it
notified plaintiff of that decision and that it would not "comply with our obligations
to you under" the written contract.

         By the same letter and with the professed purpose "to avoid any damage to
you," defendant instead offered to employ plaintiff as the leading actress in another
film tentatively entitled "Big Country, Big Man." The compensation offered was
identical, as were 31 of the 34 numbered provisions or articles of the original
contract.3 Unlike "Bloomer Girl," however, which was to have been a musical
production, "Big Country" was a dramatic "western type" movie. "Bloomer Girl" was
to have been filmed in California; "Big Country" was to be produced in Australia.
Also, certain terms in the proffered contract varied from those of the original.4
Plaintiff was given one week within which to accept; she did not and the offer lapsed.
Plaintiff then commenced this action seeking recovery of the agreed guaranteed
compensation.

          3 [By the court.] Among the identical provisions was the following found in the last paragraph
of Article 2 of the original contract: "We [defendant] shall not be obligated to utilize your [plaintiff's]
services in or in connection with the Photoplay hereunder, our sole obligation, subject to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, being to pay you the guaranteed compensation herein provided for."

          4 [By the court.] Article 29 of the original contract specified that plaintiff approved the director
already chosen for "Bloomer Girl" and that in case he failed to act as director plaintiff was to have
approval rights of any substitute director. Article 31 provided that plaintiff was to have the right of
approval of the "Bloomer Girl" dance director, and Article 32 gave her the right of approval of the
screenplay.

______________________________________________________________________________

UNIT 25: LIMITS ON DAMAGES  529
         Defendant's sole defense to this action which resulted from its deliberate
breach of contract is that in rejecting defendant's substitute offer of employment
plaintiff unreasonably refused to mitigate damages.

         The general rule is that the measure of recovery by a wrongfully discharged
employee is the amount of salary agreed upon for the period of service, less the
amount which the employer affirmatively proves the employee has earned or with
reasonable effort might have earned from other employment. However, before
projected earnings from other employment opportunities not sought or accepted by
the discharged employee can be applied in mitigation, the employer must show that
the other employment was comparable, or substantially similar, to that of which the
employee has been deprived; the employee's rejection of or failure to seek other
available employment of a different or inferior kind may not be resorted to in order
to mitigate damages.

         In the present case defendant has raised no issue of reasonableness of efforts
by plaintiffs to obtain other employment; the sole issue is whether plaintiff's refusal
of defendant's substitute offer of "Big Country" may be used in mitigation. Nor, if the
"Big Country" offer was of employment different or inferior when compared with the
original "Bloomer Girl" employment, is there an issue as to whether or not plaintiff
acted reasonably in refusing the substitute offer. Despite defendant's arguments to
the contrary, no case cited or which our research has discovered holds or suggests
that reasonableness is an element of a wrongfully discharged employee's option to
reject, or fail to seek, different or inferior employment lest the possible earnings
therefrom be charged against him in mitigation of damages.

         In Harris v. Nat. Union etc. Cooks, Stewards, 116 Cal. App. 2d 759, 761, the
issues were stated to be, inter alia, whether comparable employment was open to
each plaintiff employee, and if so whether each plaintiff made a reasonable effort to
secure such employment. It was held that the trial court properly sustained an
objection to an offer to prove a custom of accepting a job in a lower rank when work
in the higher rank was not available, as "The duty of mitigation of damages . . . does
not require the plaintiff `to seek or to accept other employment of a different or
inferior kind.'"

         Applying the foregoing rules to the record in the present case, with all
intendments in favor of the party opposing the summary judgment motion--here,
defendant--it is clear that the trial court correctly ruled that plaintiff's failure to
accept defendant's tendered substitute employment could not be applied in mitigation
of damages because the offer of the "Big Country" lead was of employment both
different and inferior, and that no factual dispute was presented on that issue. The
mere circumstance that "Bloomer Girl" was to be a musical review calling upon
plaintiff's talents as a dancer as well as an actress, and was to be produced in the
City of Los Angeles, whereas "Big Country" was a straight dramatic role in a
"Western Type" story taking place in an opal mine in Australia, demonstrates the

______________________________________________________________________________

530  CHAPTER VIII: REMEDIES
difference in kind between the two employments; the female lead as a dramatic
actress in a western style motion picture can by no stretch of imagination be
considered the equivalent of or substantially similar to the lead in a song-and-dance
production.

         Additionally, the substitute "Big Country" offer proposed to eliminate or impair
the director and screenplay approvals accorded to plaintiff under the original
"Bloomer Girl" contract, and thus constituted an offer of inferior employment. No
expertise or judicial notice is required in order to hold that the deprivation or
infringement of an employee's rights held under an original employment contract
converts the available "other employment" relied upon by the employer to mitigate
damages, into inferior employment which the employee need not seek or accept.

         Statements found in affidavits submitted by defendant in opposition to
plaintiff's summary judgment motion, to the effect that the "Big County" offer was
not of employment different from or inferior to that under the "Bloomer Girl" contract,
merely repeat the allegations of defendant's answer to the complaint in this action,
constitute only conclusionary assertions with respect to undisputed facts, and do not
give rise to a triable factual issue so as to defeat the motion for summary judgment.

         In view of the determination that defendant failed to present any facts showing
the existence of a factual issue with respect to its sole defense--plaintiff's rejection of
its substitute employment offer in mitigation of damages--we need not consider
plaintiff's further contention that for various reasons, including the provisions of the
original contract set forth in footnote 1, ante, plaintiff was excused from attempting
to mitigate damages.

         The judgment is affirmed.

SULLIVAN, Acting C.J., dissenting.

         It has never been the law that the mere existence of differences between two
jobs in the same field is sufficient, as a matter of law, to excuse an employee
wrongfully discharged from one from accepting the other in order to mitigate
damages. Such an approach would effectively eliminate any obligation of an employee
to attempt to minimize damage arising from a wrongful discharge. The only
alternative job offer an employee would be required to accept would be an offer of his
former job by his former employer.

         It is not intuitively obvious, to me at least, that the leading female role in a
dramatic motion picture is a radically different endeavor from the leading female role
in a musical comedy film. Nor is it plain to me that the rather qualified rights of
director and screenplay approval contained in the first contract are highly significant
matters either in the entertainment industry in general or to this plaintiff in

______________________________________________________________________________

UNIT 25: LIMITS ON DAMAGES  531
particular. Certainly, none of the declarations introduced by plaintiff in support of
her motion shed any light on these issues. Nor do they attempt to explain why she
declined the offer of starring in "Big Country, Big Man." Nevertheless, the trial court
granted the motion, declaring that these approval rights were "critical" and that their
elimination altered "the essential nature of the employment."

         I believe that the judgment should be reversed so that the issue of whether or
not the offer of the lead role in "Big Country, Big Man" was of employment comparable
to that of the lead role in "Bloomer Girl" may be determined at trial.

                                           _____________________

         Review Question 3. The language in Parker v. Twentieth Century-Fox Film
Corp. is fairly sweeping. Most people's experience suggests, however, that employers
change the duties of their employees routinely. Does the court really mean the
employee must take the new assignment only if the terms, including the location and
all aspects of the contract, are identical? If not, where should the line be drawn?

C. The Certainty Limitation

     KAY & ANDERSON, S.C. v. AMERITECH PUBLISHING, INC.
                               Court of Appeals of Wisconsin
                                 2005 Wisc. App. LEXIS 216

PER CURIAM.

         Kay & Andersen is a Madison law firm. Its office manager, Ida Carlin, signed
a contract with Ameritech to list the firm and its attorneys in Ameritech's 2001 white
pages business listings and its yellow pages, in its Madison area phonebooks.

         Ameritech's 2001 phone books did not include the white page listing for the
firm or for Randal J. Andersen, one of two partners in the firm. The book also failed
to list its one associate in the proper alphabetical place. The firm received fewer than
expected new clients and less than expected new client revenue in 2001 and 2002. Its
complaint in this proceeding alleged that Ameritech's listing errors were responsible
for the clientele and revenue loss. This appeal results from the trial court's decision
awarding $183,000 to the firm to compensate for that lost revenue.

         [The court concludes there was sufficient evidence to find that Ameritech
breached the contract.]

     The firm's evidence on damages included the following. Between 1997 and

2000 it obtained between 99 and 129 new clients annually and received new client

revenues between $114,000 and $298,000. During the same period, overall revenues

______________________________________________________________________________

532                          CHAPTER VIII: REMEDIES
varied between $639,000 and $780,000. In 2001, the firm received 80 new clients and
$91,000 in new client revenue and earned $705,000 in overall revenue. In 2002, it
received 87 new clients and $122,000 in new client revenue and $658,000 in fee
revenue. Based on this financial data, the firm's two partners testified the firm could
expect average yearly revenues of $731,000 with $183,000 representing new client
revenue. Consequently, they calculated that the firm's $213,000 in new client revenue
in 2001 and 2002 fell $152,000 below what they expected. It was also the partners'
testimony that the sole reason for this shortfall was the 2001 white page listing errors
that prevented potential new clients from contacting them.

         Ameritech presented an expert accounting witness who offered a different
method of computing the firm's lost revenue and testified that using his method the
losses attributable to the listing errors were far less. However, the trial court
concluded his method was unreliable and produced an unreasonably small damage
amount. While noting that precise calculations were impossible, the court held
Ameritech had not demonstrated a more reasonable or accurate measure of losses
than the firm. The court also found the firm's loss of expected clients and revenue
was solely due to the listing errors and noted it would be pure speculation to find
other reasons for the less than expected number of clients. The court concluded
"Ameritech failed to prove any other factors that would explain the loss of revenues
attributed to new customers as described in the testimony of the plaintiffs. Therefore,
plaintiffs' damage numbers are accepted." The resulting damages included the
$152,000 the firm calculated for its 2001-02 losses and an additional sum for
carryover losses in future years.

         There was sufficient evidence to support the trial court's damage award.
Ameritech characterizes the firm's computation of its damages as illogical and
speculative. However, a business's past performance is admissible to prove the
expected return in a given year. See Cutler Cranberry Co. v. Oakdale Electric Coop.,
254 N.W.2d 234 (Wis. 1977). Consequently, Ameritech's arguments that question the
firm's interpretation of its past performance address only the weight and credibility
of the testimony. Those are matters which the trial court, and not this court,
determines. See Wis. Stat. § 805.17(2). In determining the firm provided the more
credible calculation of damages, the trial court reasonably applied the following
principle.

         In Essock v. Mawhinney, 3 Wis. 2d 258, 270, 88 N.W.2d 659 (Wis. 1985),
the court favorably quoted the following from 15 AM. JUR. 2D Damages § 23, at
414:

It is now generally held that the uncertainty which prevents a recovery
is uncertainty as to the fact of the damage and not to its amount and
that where it is certain that damage has resulted, mere uncertainty as
to the amount will not preclude the right of recovery. This view has been

         sustained where, from the nature of the case, the extent of injury and
         the amount of damage are not capable of exact and accurate proof.
         Under such circumstances all that can be required is that the evidence
         with such certainty as the nature of the particular case may permit lay
         a foundation which will enable the trier of fact to make a fair and
         reasonable estimate.

                         HOLLYWOOD FANTASY CORP. v. GABOR
                      United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit

                                       151 F.3d 203 (5th Cir. 1998)

ROSENTHAL, District Judge:

         Appellee Hollywood Fantasy Corporation was briefly in the business of
providing "fantasy vacation" packages that would allow participants to "make a
movie" with a Hollywood personality and imagine themselves movie stars, for one
week, for a fee. In May 1991, Hollywood Fantasy planned to offer its second fantasy
vacation package, in San Antonio, Texas. Hollywood Fantasy arranged to have Zsa
Zsa Gabor as one of two celebrities at the event. Two weeks before the fantasy
vacation event, Ms. Gabor cancelled her appearance. A short time later, Hollywood
Fantasy cancelled the vacation event, to which it had sold only two tickets. A short
time after that, Hollywood Fantasy went out of business.

         Leonard Saffir created Hollywood Fantasy and served as its chief executive
officer. The company Mr. Saffir created charged each vacation "client" $7,500 for a
week of "pampering," instruction on making movies, rehearsals, and a "starring" role
in a short videotaped film with a "nationally known" television or movie star. Mr.
Saffir hoped that "bloopers" and "outtakes" from the videotapes would ultimately
become the basis for a television series. A new venture, Hollywood Fantasy had
conducted only one vacation event before the package scheduled to take place in San
Antonio in May 1991. The first event, held in Palm Springs, California, had received
some media coverage, but had lost money.

         This case began with a letter Hollywood Fantasy sent Zsa Zsa Gabor dated
March 4, 1991. The letter opened with the following language:

         This will confirm our agreement whereby Hollywood Fantasy Corporation
         (HFC) will employ you under the following terms and conditions: . . .

______________________________________________________________________________

534  CHAPTER VIII: REMEDIES
The letter set out the terms and conditions of Ms. Gabor's appearance in fourteen
numbered paragraphs. The terms and conditions specified the dates of employment;
the hours of work; the duties required; the payment; and certain perquisites to be
provided. The letter stated that Ms. Gabor was to be employed from May 2-4, 1991,
in San Antonio, Texas; was to be "on call" from after breakfast until before dinner
each day; was to act in videotaped "movie" scenes with the clients, using scripts and
direction provided by Hollywood Fantasy, and was to join the clients for lunch and
dinner; was to allow Hollywood Fantasy to use her name and photograph for
publicity; and was to provide media interviews "as appropriate" during her stay in
San Antonio. Hollywood Fantasy was to pay Ms. Gabor a $10,000 appearance fee and
$1,000 for miscellaneous expenses. Hollywood Fantasy would also provide Ms. Gabor
two first-class round-trip plane fares from Los Angeles; transportation to the Los
Angeles airport and in San Antonio; hair and makeup services; meals; hotel expenses,
excluding long distance telephone calls; and a hotel suite with "two bath rooms if
available."

         Ms. Gabor made three handwritten changes to this letter before signing and
returning it to Mr. Saffir. She inserted the word "one" into the sentence stating that
she would make herself available for media interviews; inserted the words "two
bedroom" above the sentence describing the hotel suite that was to be provided in San
Antonio; and added the words "wardrobe to be supplied by Neiman Marcus" to the
paragraph outlining the perquisites.

         The last paragraph of the terms and conditions provided an "out clause":

         [Hollywood Fantasy] agrees that if a significant acting opportunity in a film
         comes up [Gabor] will have the right to cancel [her] appearance in San
         Antonio by advising [Hollywood Fantasy] in writing by April 15, 1991.

The final paragraph of the letter stated: "Please sign a copy of this agreement and fax
it to me . . . as soon as possible so we can proceed." Ms. Gabor signed the letter in a
signature blank above the words "Agreed and accepted," and sent it back to Leonard
Saffir, who had already signed as the chief executive officer for Hollywood Fantasy.

         On April 10, Ms. Gabor and Mr. Saffir talked by telephone. The parties differ
as to the substance of that conversation. Mr. Saffir asserts that they discussed the
changes Ms. Gabor had made and "everything was agreed." Ms. Gabor asserts that
Mr. Saffir acted as if the original offer had been accepted. The parties agree that Ms.
Gabor sent Mr. Saffir a telegram dated April 15, 1991, stating:

         In accordance with the contract that exists between us the purpose of this
         telegram is to inform you that I must terminate it because I am due to be
         involved in preproduction and a promotion film for a motion picture I am
         contracted to do. The name of the film is Queen of Justice produced by
         Metro Films of Los Angeles. . . . I am very sorry to cause you any discomfort

______________________________________________________________________________

UNIT 25: LIMITS ON DAMAGES  535
         but will be happy to try to help in supplying you with a replacement and
         hopefully we'll be able to do something together in the very near future.

Hollywood Fantasy unsuccessfully attempted to replace Ms. Gabor for the San
Antonio event. The San Antonio event was cancelled; the two ticket purchasers
received their money back; Hollywood Fantasy went out of business; and this
litigation began.

         Ms. Gabor did not appear at the docket call scheduled for November 9, 1992.
Following a default judgment on liability and a jury trial on damages, the jury
awarded Hollywood Fantasy $3,000,000. The district court entered final judgment in
that amount. Ms. Gabor moved to set aside the judgment on the ground that she did
not receive notice of the docket call. The district court granted Ms. Gabor's motion to
vacate the judgment and ordered a new trial. After a second trial, the jury awarded
Hollywood Fantasy $100,000 on its breach of contract claim. In the [post-trial] order,
the district court found that a contract did exist between Ms. Gabor and Hollywood
Fantasy, rejecting Ms. Gabor's argument that her handwritten changes to the March
4, 1991 letter materially modified and rejected Hollywood Fantasy's offer. The district
court also upheld the jury's finding that Ms. Gabor's cancellation was not based on "a
significant acting opportunity in a film," as the contract permitted. The district court
entered judgment in favor of Hollywood Fantasy for $100,000, plus attorneys' fees
and post-judgment interest. Ms. Gabor timely appealed.

         [The court affirms the district court on the contract formation and breach
issues.]

         At trial, Ms. Gabor moved for judgment as a matter of law that there was
insufficient evidence to support the jury's award of $100,000 for breach of contract.
The district court denied Ms. Gabor's motion. Ms. Gabor renews her objection here.

         "In a federal case involving a state law claim, state law determines the kind of
evidence that may be produced to support a verdict, but federal law establishes the
quantum of evidence needed to support a verdict." Parham v. Carrier Corp., 9 F.3d
383, 386 (5th Cir. 1993) (citations omitted). ; see also Jones v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.,
870 F.2d 982, 986 (5th Cir. 1989). This court will uphold the district court's denial of
a challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence if there is substantial evidence to support
the jury's verdict. Bradley, 130 F.3d at 174.

         "It is a general rule that the victim of a breach of contract should be restored
to the position he would have been in had the contract been performed." Mistletoe
Express Serv. of Okla. City, Okla. v. Locke, 762 S.W.2d 637, 638 (Tex. App.--
Texarkana 1988, no writ). "However, an injured party may, if he so chooses, ignore
the element of profits and recover as damages his expenditures in reliance." Nelson
v. Data Terminal Sys., Inc., 762 S.W.2d 744, 748 (Tex. App.--San Antonio 1988, writ
denied) (citing Restatement (Second) of Contracts §§ 347, 349).

______________________________________________________________________________

536  CHAPTER VIII: REMEDIES
         The $100,000 damages award cannot be supported as the recovery of lost
profits. Mr. Saffir testified that Hollywood Fantasy lost $250,000 in profits from
future fantasy vacation events and at least $1,000,000 in future profits from the
creation of a television series based on "bloopers" and "outtakes" from the videotapes
of clients "acting" with Hollywood personalities. Although "recovery of lost profits
does not require that the loss be susceptible to exact calculation," Szczepanik v. First
Southern Trust Co., 883 S.W.2d 648, 649 (Tex. 1994), lost profits must be proved with
"reasonable certainty." Texas Instruments, Inc. v. Teletron Energy Management, Inc.,
877 S.W.2d 276, 279 (Tex. 1994). "[A] party claiming injury from lost profits need not
produce in court the documents that support his opinions or estimates." Ishin Speed
Sport, Inc. v. Rutherford, 933 S.W.2d 343, 351 (Tex. App.--Fort Worth 1996, no writ).
A witness may testify "from personal knowledge as to what profits would have been."
Naegeli Transp. v. Gulf Electroquip, Inc., 853 S.W.2d 737, 740 (Tex. App.--Houston
[14th Dist.] 1993, writ denied). However, "at a minimum, opinions or estimates of lost
profits must be based on objective facts, figures or data from which the amount of lost
profits may be ascertained." Szczepanik, 883 S.W.2d at 649. "Mere speculation" of the
amount of lost profits is insufficient. Thedford v. Missouri Pac. R.R. Co., 929 S.W.2d
39, 47 (Tex. App.--Corpus Christi 1996, writ denied).

         Leonard Saffir's testimony that Hollywood Fantasy lost $250,000 in future
profits was based on his estimate that Hollywood Fantasy would make a $25,000
profit from each of ten future events. Hollywood Fantasy was a new venture. It had
put on one event, in which nine people participated, and in which it had lost money.
Two weeks before the San Antonio event, only two people had bought tickets for the
event. Hollywood Fantasy had no commitments to, or arrangements for, specific
future events. "Profits which are largely speculative, as from an activity dependent
on uncertain or changing market conditions, or on chancy business opportunities, . .
. or on the success of a new and unproven enterprise, cannot be recovered." Texas
Instruments, 877 S.W.2d at 279. "The mere hope for success of an untried enterprise,
even when that hope is realistic, is not enough for recovery of lost profits." Id. at 280.
In Texas Instruments, the Texas Supreme Court made it clear that the relevant
"enterprise" in the lost profits inquiry is "not the business entity, but the activity
which is alleged to have been damaged." Id. There was no evidence at trial that the
"movie fantasy vacation" enterprise promoted by Hollywood Fantasy had been a
successful enterprise in any context. There was no evidence that the Hollywood
Fantasy management had ever been involved in any prior fantasy vacation
enterprise, let alone a successful one..

         In Texas Instruments, the Texas Supreme Court stated that even a new
enterprise may attempt to recover lost profits when there are "firmer reasons" to
"expect [the] business to yield a profit." Texas Instruments, 877 S.W.2d at 280. There
was no evidence at trial that Hollywood Fantasy had "firm" reasons to expect a profit.
Nine participants attended the Palm Springs event; not all of those participants paid

______________________________________________________________________________

UNIT 25: LIMITS ON DAMAGES  537
the full $7,500 price of admission and only "some" of the Hollywood Fantasy
employees were paid for their work. As of April 15, 1991, two weeks before the San
Antonio event, only two tickets had been sold. Mr. Saffir's testimony that he still
expected twenty participants was based on the optimistic but unsupported assertion
that people generally "don't send in their money right away."

         Hollywood Fantasy's claim for loss of television revenue is even more
speculative. Mr. Saffir admitted that he had not sold a television pilot, let alone a
series, based on the fantasy vacation videotapes. Mr. Saffir testified that the actors
appearing in the videotapes could have unilaterally declined to permit Hollywood
Fantasy to use the tapes in a television pilot. Mr. Saffir testified that unidentified
producers and others were enthusiastic about the "concept" of such a television series,
but he had difficulty even estimating what the profits from a series might be. No
"objective facts, figures, or data" substantiated the estimate of lost profits.

         Hollywood Fantasy's claims for lost profits also fail because there was no
evidence of how Hollywood Fantasy estimated the profits or what data it used to do
so. See National Union Fire, 955 S.W.2d at 132 (noting that lost profits may be
recovered "if factual data is available to furnish a sound basis for computing probable
losses"); Thedford, 929 S.W.2d at 49 ("Testimony about lost profits must at least be
based upon some factual data.").

         Although Hollywood Fantasy did not present evidence to base an award of
compensatory damages on either lost profits or lost investment, it did present
sufficient evidence as to certain out-of-pocket expenses to justify their recovery. Mr.
Saffir testified that Hollywood Fantasy incurred the following out-of-pocket expenses
for the San Antonio event: (1) $8,500 in printing costs for color brochures and press
releases; (2) $12,000 in marketing costs for mailings and advertising; (3) $22,000 in
personnel and miscellaneous expenses, including air fares, staff accommodations,
script-writing costs, telephone calls, and logo t-shirts; (4) $9,000 in travel expenses
for Mr. Saffir and members of the Hollywood Fantasy "staff," including Margo Mayor,
Hollywood Fantasy's president; and (5) $6,000 in expenses relating to preparations
to film the San Antonio event for a possible television pilot. These expenses total
$57,500.

         Ms. Gabor objects that this evidence cannot form the basis of a damages award
because Mr. Saffir testified that there were documents relating to a few of these
expenses, but did not produce any documents at trial. However, the Texas cases Ms.
Gabor cites to support her argument do not hold that documentary evidence is
required for the recovery of out-of-pocket expenses.

         Ms. Gabor presented no evidence controverting Mr. Saffir's testimony as to
Hollywood Fantasy's lost out-of-pocket expenses for the San Antonio event. Mr.
Saffir's testimony as to Hollywood Fantasy's out-of-pocket expenses is sufficient to
support an award of $57,500 for breach of contract, but not to support an award of

         Review Question 4. The owners of Hollywood Fantasy Corporation obviously
had plans to make a great deal of money off their new business. Why did they end up
getting only reliance damages? Why was Ms. Gabor not liable for all their future
losses? Can you articulate a rule that explains the outcome?

         Review Question 5. Compare the very different language used by the courts
Hollywood Fantasy and Kay & Anderson. Are they applying the same test? Or
alternatively, is the Texas rule applied in Hollywood Fantasy much more restrictive
than that used by the Wisconsin court?

         Review Question 6. A footnote in Hollywood Fantasy states that the plaintiff
had to pay $15,000 back to two persons who had already purchased tickets. Why did
the court not consider this an "out of pocket" expense?

Problem 25.1

         Homeowner's roof is seriously damaged in a windstorm. He files a claim with
Arcturus Insurance, which carries his homeowner's policy. After repeated contact
over several months, Arcturus ultimately refuses to pay the claim. Just before the
final denial, Homeowner is on the roof putting a tarpaulin over a leaking point. He
slips, falls from the roof, and is seriously injured. At trial, the jury finds that
Homeowner's claim was valid and that Arcturus breached the contract by failing to
pay. In addition to the damage to the house, however, Homeowner demands payment
for his injuries, arguing that if Arcturus had not breached the contract the roof would
have been fixed and he would not have been on the roof at the time he fell. Are his
personal injury damages recoverable?

5 [By the court.] Hollywood Fantasy cannot recover the $15,000 it refunded to the two

individuals who had bought tickets to the San Antonio event before it was cancelled. The ticket price

refund was not an out-of-pocket expense. Hollywood Fantasy presented no testimony as to what

portion, if any, of this amount it would have kept as profit had the event gone forward with Ms. Gabor's

participation.

Problem 25.2

         Mina is a second-year law student who is at the top of her class at an elite
private university in the Northeast. As such, she is offered 12-week summer
clerkships by many of the world's top law firms. She in especially interested in cutting
edge work for entertainment industry clients, and so takes a clerkship at the very
prestigious mid-sized Los Angeles firm of Wolfram & Hart. She graciously turns down
all of her other offers. Two weeks before the clerkship is to start, Wolfram & Hart
informs her that it will not need her for the summer. Mina remonstrates with them,
pointing out her reliance on their promise. The hiring partner tells her it's just tough
luck, baby. "That's Hollywood, kid." Mina sues, seeing damages for the $60,000 she
was to have made over those 12 weeks.

         (a) Assume that Mina cannot get another private firm legal position for the
summer. Instead, she makes $3,600 as a research assistant for a professor. What
remedies does she have?

         (b) Assume that Wolfram & Hart instead offers to have her work in the
mailroom at the same pay, telling her she can list on her resume that she "worked on
many matters" for the firm during the summer. If she turns this down, has Mina
failed to mitigate her damages?

         (c) Assume instead that Sterling & Bond, one of New York's most prestigious
firms, hears that Mina is available and offers her a job in its New York at the same
pay she would have received at Wolfram & Hart. She does not want to practice in
New York. If she turns it down, has she failed to mitigate her damages?

Problem 25.3

         Ann signs a contract to acquire a franchise to build a new Burger Queen fast-
food restaurant on the corner of 12th and Vine Streets. Ann is a marketing executive
who has never previously run a restaurant. She chose BQ because it is a popular and
well-run franchise system that usually provides solid profits for franchise owners.
The projected site has been approved by the BQ real estate department as having
suitable traffic for a franchise, the land is properly zoned, and Ann has an option on
the property and the necessary capital to build and run the franchise. BQ, however,
breaches the contract and refuses to award her a franchise. She sues, claiming lost
profits for her aborted business.

         At trial Ann will show that (1) only about 5 percent of BQ franchises lose
money; (2) the average annual profit of a franchise is $250,000, (3) she would be
expected to own the franchise for at least 10 years, and therefore (4) she estimates
that the total profits she lost on the transaction are $2.3 million. BQ argues that this
is wholly speculative since Ann has never run this kind of business before. It also
introduces evidence that Ann had also explored the possibility of a Wallyburger

______________________________________________________________________________

540  CHAPTER VIII: REMEDIES
franchise--Wallyburger is BQ's chief competitor in the fast-food burger market--and
could have been placed on the same spot. A Wallyburger representative will testify
that Ann had been approved for a Wallyburger franchise, and the company would
have been happy to have one of its restaurants on that site. Because a Wallyburger
franchise yields annual profits nearly as high as that of BG, the company argues that
Ann failed to mitigate her damages by buying a competing franchise.

         How much of her $2.3 million in expected profits should Ann get?

                         Special Remedies

                           FOCUS OF THIS UNIT

         Having covered the "big three" principal measures of damages in American
contract law (expectancy, reliance, and restitution), along with the limitations on
such damages (foreseeability, Avoidability, and certainty), we now turn our attention
to what we here categorize as "special remedies." The two remedies covered in this
unit are, as you will see, more narrowly available than the big three, but they are an
integral part of the toolkit of the practicing lawyer who must understand when they
are and are not in play.

         Specific Performance. One type of special remedy that you have heard of
elsewhere by this point is specific performance. This remedy is the particular
contract-law application of the broader power of courts to issue injunctions--orders
compelling specific action or non-action by a party, generally issued under threat of
contempt for non-compliance. You may have encountered injunctive relief (or at least
references to it) in other law school classes. An order of specific performance compels
a party to do what the party promised. In a contract to buy land or goods that qualify
as truly "unique," for example, a court can order the breaching seller to perform the
deal. In much of the world, this judicially-managed remedy is preferred and is used
frequently. For common-law jurisdictions like the United States, specific performance
is disfavored and applicable only in certain qualifying situations. Be aware that some
courts discussing specific performance do so with little or no use of the term "specific
performance." If, however, a court is evaluating a party's request for an injunction
and the injunction is one that would order a breaching party to perform its
contractual obligations, then the underlying issue is one of specific performance.

         Sections 357 through 369 of the Restatement (Second) of Contracts provides
some substantial detail on when specific performance is and is not available, and this
unit addresses some of those highlights. In Uniform Commercial Code cases, specific
performance is sometimes available for buyers and sellers when the other side
breaches. The sellers' specific performance remedy is under section 2-709, which is
entitled "Action for the Price." This provision does not raise many of the concerns of

______________________________________________________________________________

UNIT 26: SPECIAL REMEDIES                      543
other types of specific performance because a buyer's breach is usually a simply
failure to pay money. As you should know by now, the common-law system has
absolutely no qualms about awarding money damages. For buyers, the specific
performance remedy is more narrowly tailored, and section 2-716 ("Buyer's Right to
Specific Performance or Replevin") mimics many of the restrictions included in the
Restatement, such as by reference to "unique" goods. Finally, considering that
countries with a civil law system do not disfavor specific performance nearly as much
as common-law jurisdictions, it should come as no surprise that the CISG provides
for the remedy of specific performance. Article 62 gives the seller an action for the
price very much like UCC section 2-709. Article 46(1) provides that a buyer generally
may require the seller to perform his obligations unless the buyer has resorted to an
"inconsistent" remedy.

         Liquidated Damages. Can parties contractually agree in advance what their
damages will be in the event of breach? The answer to that question is a definite and
unequivocal . . . sometimes. Damages agreed to in advance are known as liquidated
damages, and they are the second special remedy that we will cover in this unit. The
term "liquidated" does not mean that the party is awarded water. As used in this
context, liquidated refers to a claim being reduced to a specific amount, as opposed to
a claim that is "unliquidated" and not yet known.1 If a contract term provides for
liquidated damages that function as a "penalty" imposed on the breaching party,
American courts will refuse to enforce the clause.

         Section 356 of the Restatement (Second) of Contracts describes the well-
established rules on when liquidated damages provisions are enforceable. The
amount chosen by the parties must be a reasonable estimate of anticipated or
difficult-to-prove losses. For sale-of-goods contracts, Uniform Commercial Coe section
2-718 generally tracks the common-law restrictions on liquidated damages, though it
also contains a "statutory liquidated damages" rule that is available as a remedy
under some specified circumstances. The UCC allows a party to retain some or all of
a prepaid deposit following the other side's breach, even where the contract does not
provide for liquidated damages. The CISG, for its part, does not address the question
of liquidated damages, either by sanctioning them or restricting them. Such silence
raises the possibility that a court will apply its own local law on the matter, even
where otherwise applying the CISG.

"liquid assets" (cash and things can be quickly and easily turned into cash) or "liquidity crises" for

banks (that is, having plenty of assets but not enough cash to pay bills. Thus, "liquidating" in this

sense means turning an unquantified legal right into a specific sum of cash.--Eds.]

KAYE, J.

         [Barbara Michaels owned a building in New York City whose eastern wall
faced the Midtown Tunnel exit at East 36th Street in Manhattan, and may perhaps
have been the single most visible site for a billboard in the city. In 1981 she leased
space to Van Wagner Advertising to put up a lighted billboard, which it did. In 1982,
Michaels sold the building to S&M Enterprises, and the new owner, citing an
ambiguous provision in the lease, terminated it and ordered Van Wagner to remove
the billboard. Van Wagner sued, and at trial successfully showed that the termination
was improper and that S&M had breached the contract. At issue was the remedy;
Van Wagner sought specific performance and thus the right to put up and lease the
billboard. The trial court refused specific performance and instead awarded monetary
damages. The Appellate Division affirmed.]

         Given defendant's unexcused failure to perform its contract, we next turn to a
consideration of remedy for the breach: Van Wagner seeks specific performance of the
contract, S&M urges that money damages are adequate but that the amount of the
award was improper.2

         Whether or not to award specific performance is a decision that rests in the
sound discretion of the trial court, and here that discretion was not abused.
Considering first the nature of the transaction, specific performance has been

          2 [By the court] We note that the parties' contentions regarding the remedy of specific
performance in general, mirror a scholarly debate that has persisted throughout our judicial history,
reflecting fundamentally divergent views about the quality of a bargained-for promise. While the usual
remedy in Anglo-American law has been damages, rather than compensation "in kind," see Oliver W.
Holmes, Jr., The Path of the Law, 10 HARV. L. REV. 457, 462 (1897); OLIVER W. HOLMES, JR., THE
COMMON LAW 299-301 (1881); GRANT GILMORE, THE DEATH OF CONTRACT 14-15 (1974), the current
trend among commentators appears to favor the remedy of specific performance, see E. Allen

L. REV. 111 (1981); and Alan Schwartz, The Case for Specific Performance, 89 YALE L.J. 271 (1979),
but the view is not unanimous, see RICHARD A. POSNER, ECONOMIC ANALYSIS OF LAW § 4.9, at 89-90

imposed as the remedy for breach of contracts for the sale of real property, but the
contract here is to lease rather than sell an interest in real property. While specific
performance is available, in appropriate circumstances, for breach of a commercial or
residential lease, specific performance of real property leases is not in this State
awarded as a matter of course. See Gardens Nursery School v Columbia Univ., 94
Misc. 2d 376, 378).3

         Van Wagner argues that specific performance must be granted in light of the
trial court's finding that the "demised space is unique as to location for the particular
advertising purpose intended." The word "uniqueness" is not, however, a magic door
to specific performance. A distinction must be drawn between physical difference and
economic interchangeability. The trial court found that the leased property is
physically unique, but so is every parcel of real property and so are many consumer
goods. Putting aside contracts for the sale of real property, where specific
performance has traditionally been the remedy for breach, uniqueness in the sense of
physical difference does not itself dictate the propriety of equitable relief.

         By the same token, at some level all property may be interchangeable with
money. Economic theory is concerned with the degree to which consumers are willing
to substitute the use of one good for another, the underlying assumption being that
"every good has substitutes, even if only very poor ones," and that "all goods are
ultimately commensurable." Anthony T. Kronman, Specific Performance, 45 U. CHI.
L. REV. 351, 359 (1978). Such a view, however, could strip all meaning from
uniqueness, for if all goods are ultimately exchangeable for a price, then all goods
may be valued. Even a rare manuscript has an economic substitute in that there is a
price for which any purchaser would likely agree to give up a right to buy it, but a
court would in all probability order specific performance of such a contract on the
ground that the subject matter of the contract is unique.

         The point at which breach of a contract will be redressable by specific
performance thus must lie not in any inherent physical uniqueness of the property
but instead in the uncertainty of valuing it:

         What matters, in measuring money damages, is the volume, refinement,
         and reliability of the available information about substitutes for the
         subject matter of the breached contract. When the relevant information
         is thin and unreliable, there is a substantial risk that an award of money
         damages will either exceed or fall short of the promisee's actual loss. Of
         course this risk can always be reduced--but only at great cost when

______________________________________________________________________________

546  CHAPTER VIII: REMEDIES
         reliable information is difficult to obtain. Conversely, when there is a
         great deal of consumer behavior generating abundant and highly
         dependable information about substitutes, the risk of error in measuring
         the promisee's loss may be reduced at much smaller cost. In asserting
         that the subject matter of a particular contract is unique and has no
         established market value, a court is really saying that it cannot obtain,
         at reasonable cost, enough information about substitutes to permit it to
         calculate an award of money damages without imposing an
         unacceptably high risk of undercompensation on the injured promisee.
         Conceived in this way, the uniqueness test seems economically sound.

Kronman, 45 U. CHI. L. REV., at 362. This principle is reflected in the case law and is
essentially the position of the Restatement, which lists "the difficulty of proving
damages with reasonable certainty" as the first factor affecting adequacy of damages.
Restatement (Second) of Contracts § 360(a) (1981). Thus, the fact that the subject of
the contract may be "unique as to location for the particular advertising purpose
intended" by the parties does not entitle a plaintiff to the remedy of specific
performance.

         Here, the trial court correctly concluded that the value of the "unique qualities"
of the demised space could be fixed with reasonable certainty and without imposing
an unacceptably high risk of undercompensating the injured tenant. Both parties
complain: Van Wagner asserts that while lost revenues on the Asch contract may be
adequate compensation, that contract expired February 28, 1985, its lease with S&M
continues until 1992, and the value of the demised space cannot reasonably be fixed
for the balance of the term. S&M urges that future rents and continuing damages are
necessarily conjectural, both during and after the Asch contract, and that Van
Wagner's damages must be limited to 60 days--the period during which Van Wagner
could cancel Asch's contract without consequence in the event Van Wagner lost the
demised space. S&M points out that Van Wagner's lease could remain in effect for
the full 10-year term, or it could legitimately be extinguished immediately, either in
conjunction with a bona fide sale of the property by S&M, or by a re-letting of the
building if the new tenant required use of the billboard space for its own purposes.
Both parties' contentions were properly rejected.

         First, it is hardly novel in the law for damages to be projected into the future.
Particularly where the value of commercial billboard space can be readily determined
by comparisons with similar uses--Van Wagner itself has more than 400 leases--the
value of this property between 1985 and 1992 cannot be regarded as speculative.
Second, S&M having successfully resisted specific performance on the ground that
there is an adequate remedy at law, cannot at the same time be heard to contend that
damages beyond 60 days must be denied because they are conjectural. If damages for
breach of this lease are indeed conjectural, and cannot be calculated with reasonable

______________________________________________________________________________

UNIT 26: SPECIAL REMEDIES  547
certainty, then S&M should be compelled to perform its contractual obligation by
restoring Van Wagner to the premises. Moreover, the contingencies to which S&M
points do not, as a practical matter, render the calculation of damages speculative.
While S&M could terminate the Van Wagner lease in the event of a sale of the
building, this building has been sold only once in 40 years; S&M paid several million
dollars, and purchased the building in connection with its plan for major development
of the block. The theoretical termination right of a future tenant of the existing
building also must be viewed in light of these circumstances. If any uncertainty is
generated by the two contingencies, then the benefit of that doubt must go to Van
Wagner and not the contract violator. Neither contingency allegedly affecting Van
Wagner's continued contractual right to the space for the balance of the lease term is
within its own control; on the contrary, both are in the interest of S&M. Thus, neither
the need to project into the future nor the contingencies allegedly affecting the length
of Van Wagner's term render inadequate the remedy of damages for S&M's breach of
its lease with Van Wagner.

                                           _____________________

         Review Question 1. Parties seeking specific performance will generally assert
that monetary damages are inadequate compensation because of the "uniqueness" of
the breaching party's promised performance. The Van Wagner court cautions that
"[t]he word `uniqueness' is not, however, a magic door to specific performance. A
distinction must be drawn between physical difference and economic
interchangeability." Could you explain what that statement means if you were called
upon to do so? The principle involved is actually a rather important one for practicing
lawyers to understand.

                                        522 F.2d 33 (8th Cir. 1975)

ROSS, Circuit Judge.

         [In September 1970, Amoco contracted to supply Laclede with its requirements
of propane for Laclede to sell to its residential customers.]

         For a time the parties operated satisfactorily under this agreement, and some
17 residential subdivisions were brought within it by supplemental letters. However,
for various reasons, including conversion to natural gas, the number of developments
under the agreement had shrunk to eight by the time of trial. These were all mobile
home parks.

______________________________________________________________________________

548  CHAPTER VIII: REMEDIES
         During the winter of 1972-73 Amoco experienced a shortage of propane and
voluntarily placed all of its customers, including Laclede, on an 80% Allocation basis,
meaning that Laclede would receive only up to 80% of its previous requirements.
Laclede objected to this and pushed Amoco to give it 100% of what the developments
needed. Some conflict arose over this before the temporary shortage was alleviated.

         Then, on April 3, 1973, Amoco notified Laclede that its Wood River Area Posted
Price of propane had been increased by three cents per gallon. Laclede objected to
this increase also and demanded a full explanation. None was forthcoming. Instead
Amoco merely sent a letter dated May 14, 1973, informing Laclede that it was
"terminating" the September 21, 1970, agreement effective May 31, 1973. It claimed
it had the right to do this because "the Agreement lacks `mutuality.'"

         The district court felt that the entire controversy turned on whether or not
Laclede's right to "arbitrarily cancel the Agreement" without Amoco having a similar
right rendered the contract void "for lack of mutuality" and it resolved this question
in the affirmative. We disagree with this conclusion and hold that settled principles
of contract law require a reversal.

         [The Court of Appeals determined that Amoco could not void the contract based
on an alleged lack of mutuality and that Amoco's refusal to deliver propane was
therefore a breach of contract. The court then turned its attention to Laclede's claim
that it was eligible for specific performance in the form of an injunction requiring
Amoco to continue delivering propane under the contract.]

         Generally the determination of whether or not to order specific performance of
a contract lies within the sound discretion of the trial court. However, this discretion
is, in fact, quite limited; and it is said that when certain equitable rules have been
met and the contract is fair and plain "specific performance goes as a matter of right."
Miller v. Coffeen, 365 Mo. 204, 280 S.W.2d 100, 102 (1955), quoting, Berberet v. Myers,
240 Mo. 58, 77, 144 S.W. 824, 830 (1912). (Emphasis omitted.)

         With this in mind we have carefully reviewed the very complete record on
appeal and conclude that the trial court should grant the injunctive relief prayed. We
are satisfied that this case falls within that category in which specific performance
should be ordered as a matter of right. See Miller v. Coffeen, supra, 280 S.W.2d at
102.

         Amoco contends that four of the requirements for specific performance have
not been met. Its claims are: (1) there is no mutuality of remedy in the contract; (2)
the remedy of specific performance would be difficult for the court to administer
without constant and long-continued supervision; (3) the contract is indefinite and
uncertain; and (4) the remedy at law available to Laclede is adequate. The first three
contentions have little or no merit and do not detain us for long.

______________________________________________________________________________

UNIT 26: SPECIAL REMEDIES  549
         There is simply no requirement in the law that both parties be mutually
entitled to the remedy of specific performance in order that one of them be given that
remedy by the court.

         While a court may refuse to grant specific performance where such a decree
would require constant and long-continued court supervision, this is merely a
discretionary rule of decision which is frequently ignored when the public interest is
involved.

         Here the public interest in providing propane to the retail customers is
manifest, while any supervision required will be far from onerous.

         Section 370 of the [First] Restatement of Contracts (1932)4 provides:

                  Specific enforcement will not be decreed unless the terms of the
                  contract are so expressed that the court can determine with
                  reasonable certainty what is the duty of each party and the
                  conditions under which performance is due.

We believe these criteria have been satisfied here. [As] to all developments for which
a supplemental agreement has been signed, Amoco is to supply all the propane which
is reasonably foreseeably required, while Laclede is to purchase the required propane
from Amoco and pay the contract price therefor. The parties have disagreed over what
is meant by "Wood River Area Posted Price" in the agreement, but the district court
can and should determine with reasonable certainty what the parties intended by
this term and should mold its decree, if necessary accordingly. Likewise, the fact that
the agreement does not have a definite time of duration is not fatal since the evidence
established that the last subdivision should be converted to natural gas in 10 to 15
years. This sets a reasonable time limit on performance and the district court can and
should mold the final decree to reflect this testimony.

         It is axiomatic that specific performance will not be ordered when the party
claiming breach of contract has an adequate remedy at law. This is especially true
when the contract involves personal property as distinguished from real estate.

         However, in Missouri, as elsewhere, specific performance may be ordered even
though personalty is involved in the "proper circumstances." Mo. Rev. Stat. [UCC § 2-
716(1)]; Restatement of Contracts, supra, § 361. And a remedy at law adequate to
defeat the grant of specific performance "must be as certain, prompt, complete, and
efficient to attain the ends of justice as a decree of specific performance." National
Marking Mach. Co. v. Triumph Mfg. Co., 13 F.2d 6, 9 (8th Cir. 1926).

         One of the leading Missouri cases allowing specific performance of a contract
relating to personalty because the remedy at law was inadequate is Boeving v.
Vandover, 240 Mo. App. 117, 218 S.W.2d 175, 178 (1949). In that case the plaintiff

550                 CHAPTER VIII: REMEDIES
sought specific performance of a contract in which the defendant had promised to sell
him an automobile. At that time (near the end of and shortly after World War II) new
cars were hard to come by, and the court held that specific performance was a proper
remedy since a new car "could not be obtained elsewhere except at considerable
expense, trouble or loss, which cannot be estimated in advance."

         We are satisfied that Laclede has brought itself within this practical approach
taken by the Missouri courts. As Amoco points out, Laclede has propane immediately
available to it under other contracts with other suppliers. And the evidence indicates
that at the present time propane is readily available on the open market. However,
this analysis ignores the fact that the contract involved in this lawsuit is for a long-
term supply of propane to these subdivisions. The other two contracts under which
Laclede obtains the gas will remain in force only until March 31, 1977, and April 1,
1981, respectively; and there is no assurance that Laclede will be able to receive any
propane under them after that time. Also it is unclear as to whether or not Laclede
can use the propane obtained under these contracts to supply the Jefferson County
subdivisions, since they were originally entered into to provide Laclede with propane
with which to "shave" its natural gas supply during peak demand periods.5
Additionally, there was uncontradicted expert testimony that Laclede probably could
not find another supplier of propane willing to enter into a long-term contract such
as the Amoco agreement, given the uncertain future of worldwide energy supplies.
And, even if Laclede could obtain supplies of propane for the affected developments
through its present contracts or newly negotiated ones, it would still face considerable
expense and trouble which cannot be estimated in advance in making arrangements
for its distribution to the subdivisions.

         Specific performance is the proper remedy in this situation, and it should be
granted by the district court.

         For the foregoing reasons the judgment of the district court is reversed and the
cause is remanded for the fashioning of appropriate injunctive relief in the form of a
decree of specific performance[.]

"may be decreed where the goods are unique or in other proper circumstances." Is
propane "unique" in any way? Assuming that it is not, what exactly qualified as the

B. Liquidated Damages

          TRUCK RENT-A-CENTER, INC. v. PURITAN FARMS 2nd, INC.
                                      Court of Appeals of New York

                               41 N.Y.2d 420, 393 N.Y.S.2d 365 (1977)

JASEN, Judge.

         The principal issue on this appeal is whether a provision in a truck lease
agreement which requires the payment of a specified amount of money to the lessor
in the event of the lessee's breach is an enforceable liquidated damages clause, or,
instead, provides for an unenforceable penalty.

         Defendant Puritan Farms 2nd, Inc. (Puritan), was in the business of furnishing
milk and milk products to customers through home delivery. In January, 1969,
Puritan leased a fleet of 25 new milk delivery trucks from plaintiff Truck Rent-A-
Center for a term of seven years commencing January 15, 1970. Under the provisions
of a truck lease and service agreement entered into by the parties, the plaintiff was
to supply the trucks and make all necessary repairs. Puritan was to pay an agreed
upon weekly rental fee. It was understood that the lessor would finance the purchase
of the trucks through a bank, paying the prime rate of interest on the date of the loan
plus 2%. The rental charges on the trucks were to be adjusted in the event of a
fluctuation in the interest rate above or below specified levels. The lessee was granted
the right to purchase the trucks, at any time after 12 months following
commencement of the lease, by paying to the lessor the amount then due and owing
on the bank loan, plus an additional $100 per truck purchased.

         Article 16 of the lease agreement provided that if the agreement should
terminate prior to expiration of the term of the lease as a result of the lessee's breach,
the lessor would be entitled to damages, "liquidated for all purposes," in the amount
of all rentals that would have come due from the date of termination to the date of
normal expiration of the term less the "re-rental value" of the vehicles, which was set
at 50% of the rentals that would have become due. In effect, the lessee would be
obligated to pay the lessor, as a consequence of breach, one half of all rentals that
would have become due had the agreement run its full course. The agreement recited
that, in arriving at the settled amount of damage, "the parties hereto have considered,
among other factors, Lessor's substantial initial investment in purchasing or
reconditioning for Lessee's service the demised motor vehicles, the uncertainty of

______________________________________________________________________________

552            CHAPTER VIII: REMEDIES
Lessor's ability to re-enter the said vehicles, the costs to Lessor during any period the
vehicles may remain idle until re-rented, or if sold, the uncertainty of the sales price
and its possible attendant loss. The parties have also considered, among other factors,
in so liquidating the said damages, Lessor's saving in expenditures for gasoline, oil
and other service items."

         The bulk of the written agreement was derived from a printed form lease which
the parties modified by both filling in blank spaces and typing in alterations. The
agreement also contained several typewritten indorsements which also made changes
in the provisions of the printed lease. The provision for lessee's purchase of the
vehicles for the bank loan balance and $100 per vehicle was contained in one such
indorsement. The liquidated damages clause was contained in the body of the printed
form.

         Puritan tendered plaintiff a security deposit, consisting of four weeks' rent and
the lease went into effect. After nearly three years, the lessee sought to terminate the
lease agreement. On December 7, 1973, Puritan wrote to the lessor complaining that
the lessor had not repaired and maintained the trucks as provided in the lease
agreement. Puritan stated that it had "repeatedly notified" plaintiff of these defaults,
but plaintiff had not cured them. Puritan, therefore, exercised its right to terminate
the agreement "without any penalty and without purchasing the trucks." On the date
set for termination, December 14, 1973, plaintiff's attorneys replied to Puritan by
letter to advise it that plaintiff believed it had fully performed its obligations under
the lease and, in the event Puritan adhered to the announced breach, would
commence proceedings to obtain the liquidated damages provided for in article 16 of
the agreement. Nevertheless, Puritan had its drivers return the trucks to plaintiff's
premises, where the bulk of them have remained ever since. At the time of
termination, plaintiff owed $45,134.17 on the outstanding bank loan.

         Plaintiff followed through on its promise to commence an action for the
payment of the liquidated damages. Defendant counterclaimed for the return of its
security deposit. At the nonjury trial, plaintiff contended that it had fully performed
its obligations to maintain and repair the trucks. Moreover, it was submitted, Puritan
sought to cancel the lease because corporations allied with Puritan had acquired the
assets, including delivery trucks, of other dairies and Puritan believed it cheaper to
utilize this "shadow fleet." The home milk delivery business was on the decline and
plaintiff's president testified that efforts to either re-rent or sell the truck fleet to
other dairies had not been successful. Even with modifications in the trucks, such as
the removal of the milk racks and a change in the floor of the trucks, it was not
possible to lease the trucks to other industries, although a few trucks were
subsequently sold. The proceeds of the sales were applied to the reduction of the bank
balance. The other trucks remained at plaintiff's premises, partially protected by a

______________________________________________________________________________

UNIT 26: SPECIAL REMEDIES  553
fence plaintiff erected to discourage vandals. The defendant countered with proof that
plaintiff had not repaired the trucks promptly and satisfactorily.

         At the close of the trial, the court found, based on the evidence it found to be
credible, that plaintiff had substantially performed its obligations under the lease
and that defendant was not justified in terminating the agreement. Further, the court
held that the provision for liquidated damages was reasonable and represented a fair
estimate of actual damages which would be difficult to ascertain precisely. "The
parties, at the time the agreement was entered into, considered many factors
affecting damages, namely: the uncertainty of the plaintiff's ability to re-rent the said
vehicles; the plaintiff's investment in purchasing and reconditioning the vehicles to
suit the defendant's particular purpose; the number of man hours not utilized in the
non-service of the vehicles in the event of a breach; the uncertainty of reselling the
vehicles in question; the uncertainty of the plaintiff's savings or expenditures for
gasoline, oil or other service items, and the amount of fluctuating interest on the bank
loan." The court calculated that plaintiff would have been entitled to $177,355.20 in
rent for the period remaining in the lease and, in accordance with the liquidated
damages provision, awarded plaintiff half that amount, $88,677.60. The resulting
judgment was affirmed by the Appellate Division, with two Justices dissenting.

         The primary issue before us is whether the "liquidated damages" provision is
enforceable. Liquidated damages constitute the compensation which, the parties have
agreed, should be paid in order to satisfy any loss or injury flowing from a breach of
their contract. In effect, a liquidated damage provision is an estimate, made by the
parties at the time they enter into their agreement, of the extent of the injury that
would be sustained as a result of breach of the agreement. 5 WILLISTON, CONTRACTS
(3d ed.), § 776, p. 668. Parties to a contract have the right to agree to such clauses,
provided that the clause is neither unconscionable nor contrary to public policy.
Provisions for liquidated damage have value in those situations where it would be
difficult, if not actually impossible, to calculate the amount of actual damage. In such
cases, the contracting parties may agree between themselves as to the amount of
damages to be paid upon breach rather than leaving that amount to the calculation
of a court or jury.

         On the other hand, liquidated damage provisions will not be enforced if it is
against public policy to do so and public policy is firmly set against the imposition of
penalties or forfeitures for which there is no statutory authority. It is plain that a
provision which requires, in the event of contractual breach, the payment of a sum of
money grossly disproportionate to the amount of actual damages provides for penalty
and is unenforceable. E.g., Equitable Lumber. Corp. v. IPA Land Dev. Corp., 381
N.Y.S.2d 459, 462-463 (1976). A liquidated damage provision has its basis in the
principle of just compensation for loss. Cf. [First] Restatement, Contracts, § 339, and
Comment. A clause which provides for an amount plainly disproportionate to real
damage is not intended to provide fair compensation but to secure performance by

______________________________________________________________________________

554  CHAPTER VIII: REMEDIES
the compulsion of the very disproportion. A promisor would be compelled, out of fear
of economic devastation, to continue performance and his promisee, in the event of
default, would reap a windfall well above actual harm sustained. As was stated
eloquently long ago, to permit parties, in their unbridled discretion, to utilize
penalties as damages, "would lead to the most terrible oppression in pecuniary
dealings." Hoag v. McGinnis, 22 Wend. 163, 166 (N.Y. 1839).

         The rule is now well established. A contractual provision fixing damages in the
event of breach will be sustained if the amount liquidated bears a reasonable
proportion to the probable loss and the amount of actual loss is incapable or difficult
of precise estimation. City of Rye v. Public Serv. Mut. Ins. Co., 34 N.Y.2d 470, 473,
358 N.Y.S.2d 391; [First] Restatement, Contracts, § 339.6 If, however, the amount
fixed is plainly or grossly disproportionate to the probable loss, the provision calls for
a penalty and will not be enforced. Equitable Lumber Co., 38 N.Y.2d 516, 521-522,
381 N.Y.S.2d 459, 461-462. In interpreting a provision fixing damages, it is not
material whether the parties themselves have chosen to call the provision one for
"liquidated damages," as in this case, or have styled it as a penalty. Such an approach
would put too much faith in form and too little in substance. Similarly, the agreement
should be interpreted as of the date of its making and not as of the date of its breach.

         In applying these principles to the case before us, we conclude that the amount
stipulated by the parties as damages bears a reasonable relation to the amount of
probable actual harm and is not a penalty. Hence, the provision is enforceable and
the order of the Appellate Division should be affirmed.

         Looking forward from the date of the lease, the parties could reasonably
conclude, as they did, that there might not be an actual market for the sale or re-
rental of these specialized vehicles in the event of the lessee's breach. To be sure,
plaintiff's lost profit could readily be measured by the amount of the weekly rental
fee. However, it was permissible for the parties, in advance, to agree that the re-
rental or sale value of the vehicles would be 50% of the weekly rental. Since there
was uncertainty as to whether the trucks could be re-rented or sold, the parties could
reasonably set, as they did, the value of such mitigation at 50% of the amount the
lessee was obligated to pay for rental of the trucks. This would take into consideration
the fact that, after being used by the lessee, the vehicles would no longer be "shiny,
new trucks," but would be used, possibly battered, trucks, whose value would have
declined appreciably. The parties also considered the fact that, although plaintiff, in
the event of Puritan's breach, might be spared repair and maintenance costs
necessitated by Puritan's use of the trucks, plaintiff would have to assume the cost of
storing and maintaining trucks idled by Puritan's refusal to use them. Further, it was

6 [The substantially similar provision in the Restatement (Second) of Contracts is located in

______________________________________________________________________________

UNIT 26: SPECIAL REMEDIES  555
by no means certain, at the time of the contract, that lessee would peacefully return
the trucks to the lessor after lessee had breached the contract.

         We attach no significance to the fact that the liquidated damages clause
appears on the preprinted form portion of the agreement. The agreement was fully
negotiated and the provisions of the form, in many other respects, were amended.
There is no indication of any disparity of bargaining power or of unconscionability.
The provision for liquidated damages related reasonably to potential harm that was
difficult to estimate and did not constitute a disguised penalty. We also find no merit
in the claim of trial error advanced by Puritan.

         Accordingly, the order of the Appellate Division should be affirmed, with costs.

         Review Question 3. The Truck Rent-a-Center court approvingly quotes a
statement that "to permit parties, in their unbridled discretion, to utilize penalties as
damages, `would lead to the most terrible oppression in pecuniary dealings.'" Why
might that be true? Is the problem significant enough to justify the restriction on
parties' rights to contract freely for liquidated damages?

         Review Question 4. Section 355 of the Restatement (Second) of Contracts
articulates the longstanding rule in contract law that "[p]unitive damages are not
recoverable for breach of contract unless the conduct constituting the breach is also a
tort for which punitive damages are recoverable." How does the prohibition on
unreasonable liquidated damages help support the prohibition on punitive damages?
Put another way, what policy determinations do both of these rules have in common?

          LAKE RIVER CORPORATION v. CARBORUNDUM COMPANY
                         United States Court of Appeals, Seventh Circuit
                                      769 F.2d 1284 (7th Cir. 1985).

POSNER, Circuit Judge.

         This diversity suit between Lake River Corporation and Carborundum
Company requires us to consider questions of Illinois commercial law, and in
particular to explore the fuzzy line between penalty clauses and liquidated-damages
clauses.

         Carborundum manufactures "Ferro Carbo," an abrasive powder used in
making steel. To serve its midwestern customers better, Carborundum made a
contract with Lake River by which the latter agreed to provide distribution services
in its warehouse in Illinois. Lake River would receive Ferro Carbo in bulk from
Carborundum, "bag" it, and ship the bagged product to Carborundum's customers.

______________________________________________________________________________

556  CHAPTER VIII: REMEDIES
The Ferro Carbo would remain Carborundum's property until delivered to the
customers.

         Carborundum insisted that Lake River install a new bagging system to handle
the contract. In order to be sure of being able to recover the cost of the new system
($89,000) and make a profit of 20 percent of the contract price, Lake River insisted
on the following minimum-quantity guarantee:

In consideration of the special equipment [i.e., the new
bagging system] to be acquired and furnished by LAKE-RIVER
for handling the product, CARBORUNDUM shall, during the
initial three-year term of this Agreement, ship to LAKE-RIVER
for bagging a minimum quantity of [22,500 tons]. If, at the
end of the three-year term, this minimum quantity shall not
have been shipped, LAKE-RIVER shall invoice CARBORUNDUM at
the then prevailing rates for the difference between the
quantity bagged and the minimum guaranteed.

If Carborundum had shipped the full minimum quantity that it guaranteed, it would
have owed Lake River roughly $533,000 under the contract.

         After the contract was signed in 1979, the demand for domestic steel, and with
it the demand for Ferro Carbo, plummeted, and Carborundum failed to ship the
guaranteed amount. When the contract expired late in 1982, Carborundum had
shipped only 12,000 of the 22,500 tons it had guaranteed. Lake River had bagged the
12,000 tons and had billed Carborundum for this bagging, and Carborundum had
paid, but by virtue of the formula in the minimum-guarantee clause Carborundum
still owed Lake River $241,000--the contract price of $533,000 if the full amount of
Ferro Carbo had been shipped, minus what Carborundum had paid for the bagging
of the quantity it had shipped.

         When Lake River demanded payment of this amount, Carborundum refused,
on the ground that the formula imposed a penalty. At the time, Lake River had in its
warehouse 500 tons of bagged Ferro Carbo, having a market value of $269,000, which
it refused to release unless Carborundum paid the $241,000 due under the formula.
Lake River did offer to sell the bagged product and place the proceeds in escrow until
its dispute with Carborundum over the enforceability of the formula was resolved,
but Carborundum rejected the offer and trucked in bagged Ferro Carbo from the East
to serve its customers in Illinois, at an additional cost of $31,000.

         Lake River brought this suit for $241,000, which it claims as liquidated
damages. Carborundum counterclaimed for the value of the bagged Ferro Carbo when
Lake River impounded it and the additional cost of serving the customers affected by
the impounding.

         [The court first determines Lake River did not have a legal basis to assert a
pre-judgment lien on the bagged Ferro Carbo it had impounded. Thus, Lake River

______________________________________________________________________________

UNIT 26: SPECIAL REMEDIES                                      557
cannot use that method of self-help to collect on its claimed damages before they are
reduced to final judgment. The court then turns to Lake River's liquidated damages
claim.]

         The hardest issue in the case is whether the formula in the minimum-
guarantee clause imposes a penalty for breach of contract or is merely an effort to
liquidate damages. Deep as the hostility to penalty clauses runs in the common law,
see Loyd, Penalties and Forfeitures, 29 HARV. L. REV. 117 (1915), we still might be
inclined to question, if we thought ourselves free to do so, whether a modern court
should refuse to enforce a penalty clause where the signator is a substantial
corporation, well able to avoid improvident commitments. Penalty clauses provide an
earnest of performance. The clause here enhanced Carborundum's credibility in
promising to ship the minimum amount guaranteed by showing that it was willing to
pay the full contract price even if it failed to ship anything. On the other side it can
be pointed out that by raising the cost of a breach of contract to the contract breaker,
a penalty clause increases the risk to his other creditors; increases (what is the same
thing and more, because bankruptcy imposes "deadweight" social costs) the risk of
bankruptcy; and could amplify the business cycle by increasing the number of
bankruptcies in bad times, which is when contracts are most likely to be broken. But
since little effort is made to prevent businessmen from assuming risks, these reasons
are no better than makeweights.

         A better argument is that a penalty clause may discourage efficient as well as
inefficient breaches of contract. Suppose a breach would cost the promisee $12,000 in
actual damages but would yield the promisor $20,000 in additional profits. Then
there would be a net social gain from breach. After being fully compensated for his
loss the promisee would be no worse off than if the contract had been performed, while
the promisor would be better off by $8,000. But now suppose the contract contains a
penalty clause under which the promisor if he breaks his promise must pay the
promisee $25,000. The promisor will be discouraged from breaking the contract, since
$25,000, the penalty, is greater than $20,000, the profits of the breach; and a
transaction that would have increased value will be forgone.

         On this view, since compensatory damages should be sufficient to deter
inefficient breaches (that is, breaches that cost the victim more than the gain to the
contract breaker), penal damages could have no effect other than to deter some
efficient breaches. But this overlooks the earlier point that the willingness to agree
to a penalty clause is a way of making the promisor and his promise credible and may
therefore be essential to inducing some value-maximizing contracts to be made. It
also overlooks the more important point that the parties (always assuming they are
fully competent) will, in deciding whether to include a penalty clause in their
contract, weigh the gains against the costs--costs that include the possibility of
discouraging an efficient breach somewhere down the road--and will include the
clause only if the benefits exceed those costs as well as all other costs.

______________________________________________________________________________

558  CHAPTER VIII: REMEDIES
         On this view the refusal to enforce penalty clauses is (at best) paternalistic--
and it seems odd that courts should display parental solicitude for large corporations.
But however this may be, we must be on guard to avoid importing our own ideas of
sound public policy into an area where our proper judicial role is more than usually
deferential. The responsibility for making innovations in the common law of Illinois
rests with the courts of Illinois, and not with the federal courts in Illinois. And like
every other state, Illinois, untroubled by academic skepticism of the wisdom of
refusing to enforce penalty clauses against sophisticated promisors, see, e.g., Goetz &
Scott, Liquidated Damages, Penalties and the Just Compensation Principle, 77
COLUM. L. REV. 554 (1977), continues steadfastly to insist on the distinction between
penalties and liquidated damages. To be valid under Illinois law a liquidation of
damages must be a reasonable estimate at the time of contracting of the likely
damages from breach, and the need for estimation at that time must be shown by
reference to the likely difficulty of measuring the actual damages from a breach of
contract after the breach occurs. If damages would be easy to determine then, or if
the estimate greatly exceeds a reasonable upper estimate of what the damages are
likely to be, it is a penalty.

         The distinction between a penalty and liquidated damages is not an easy one
to draw in practice but we are required to draw it and can give only limited weight to
the district court's determination. Whether a provision for damages is a penalty
clause or a liquidated-damages clause is a question of law rather than fact[.]

         Mindful that Illinois courts resolve doubtful cases in favor of classification as
a penalty, we conclude that the damage formula in this case is a penalty and not a
liquidation of damages, because it is designed always to assure Lake River more than
its actual damages. The formula--full contract price minus the amount already
invoiced to Carborundum--is invariant to the gravity of the breach. When a contract
specifies a single sum in damages for any and all breaches even though it is apparent
that all are not of the same gravity, the specification is not a reasonable effort to
estimate damages; and when in addition the fixed sum greatly exceeds the actual
damages likely to be inflicted by a minor breach, its character as a penalty becomes
unmistakable. See Arduini v. Board of Educ., 93 Ill. App.3d 925, 931-33, 49 Ill. Dec.
460, 465-66, 418 N.E.2d 104, 109-10 (1981), rev'd on other grounds, 92 Ill.2d 197, 65
Ill. Dec. 281, 441 N.E.2d 73 (1982); 5 CORBIN ON CONTRACTS § 1066 (1964). This case
is within the gravitational field of these principles even though the minimum-
guarantee clause does not fix a single sum as damages.

         Suppose to begin with that the breach occurs the day after Lake River buys its
new bagging system for $89,000 and before Carborundum ships any Ferro Carbo.
Carborundum would owe Lake River $533,000. Since Lake River would have incurred
at that point a total cost of only $89,000, its net gain from the breach would be
$444,000. This is more than four times the profit of $107,000 (20 percent of the

______________________________________________________________________________

UNIT 26: SPECIAL REMEDIES  559
contract price of $533,000) that Lake River expected to make from the contract if it
had been performed: a huge windfall.

         Next suppose (as actually happened here) that breach occurs when 55 percent
of the Ferro Carbo has been shipped. Lake River would already have received
$293,000 from Carborundum. To see what its costs then would have been (as
estimated at the time of contracting), first subtract Lake River's anticipated profit on
the contract of $107,000 from the total contract price of $533,000. The difference--
Lake River's total cost of performance--is $426,000. Of this, $89,000 is the cost of the
new bagging system, a fixed cost. The rest ($426,000-$89,000 = $337,000)
presumably consists of variable costs that are roughly proportional to the amount of
Ferro Carbo bagged; there is no indication of any other fixed costs. Assume, therefore,
that if Lake River bagged 55 percent of the contractually agreed quantity, it incurred
in doing so 55 percent of its variable costs, or $185,000. When this is added to the cost
of the new bagging system, assumed for the moment to be worthless except in
connection with the contract, the total cost of performance to Lake River is $274,000.
Hence a breach that occurred after 55 percent of contractual performance was
complete would be expected to yield Lake River a modest profit of $19,000 ($293,000-
$274,000). But now add the "liquidated damages" of $241,000 that Lake River claims,
and the result is a total gain from the breach of $260,000, which is almost two and a
half times the profit that Lake River expected to gain if there was no breach. And this
ignores any use value or salvage value of the new bagging system, which is the
property of Lake River--though admittedly it also ignores the time value of money;
Lake River paid $89,000 for that system before receiving any revenue from the
contract.

         To complete the picture, assume that the breach had not occurred till
performance was 90 percent complete. Then the "liquidated damages" clause would
not be so one-sided, but it would be one-sided. Carborundum would have paid
$480,000 for bagging. Against this, Lake River would have incurred its fixed cost of
$89,000 plus 90 percent of its variable costs of $337,000, or $303,000. Its total costs
would thus be $392,000, and its net profit $88,000. But on top of this it would be
entitled to "liquidated damages" of $53,000, for a total profit of $141,000--more than
30 percent more than its expected profit of $107,000 if there was no breach.

         The reason for these results is that most of the costs to Lake River of
performing the contract are saved if the contract is broken, and this saving is not
reflected in the damage formula. As a result, at whatever point in the life of the
contract a breach occurs, the damage formula gives Lake River more than its lost
profits from the breach--dramatically more if the breach occurs at the beginning of
the contract; tapering off at the end, it is true. Still, over the interval between the
beginning of Lake River's performance and nearly the end, the clause could be
expected to generate profits ranging from 400 percent of the expected contract profits
to 130 percent of those profits. And this is on the assumption that the bagging system

______________________________________________________________________________

560  CHAPTER VIII: REMEDIES
has no value apart from the contract. If it were worth only $20,000 to Lake River, the
range would be 434 percent to 150 percent.

         Lake River argues that it would never get as much as the formula suggests,
because it would be required to mitigate its damages. This is a dubious argument on
several grounds. First, mitigation of damages is a doctrine of the law of court-assessed
damages, while the point of a liquidated-damages clause is to substitute party
assessment; and that point is blunted, and the certainty that liquidated-damages
clauses are designed to give the process of assessing damages impaired, if a defendant
can force the plaintiff to take less than the damages specified in the clause, on the
ground that the plaintiff could have avoided some of them. It would seem therefore
that the clause in this case should be read to eliminate any duty of mitigation, that
what Lake River is doing is attempting to rewrite the clause to make it more
reasonable, and that since actually the clause is designed to give Lake River the full
damages it would incur from breach (and more) even if it made no effort to find a
substitute use for the equipment that it bought to perform the contract, this is just
one more piece of evidence that it is a penalty clause rather than a liquidated-
damages clause.

         But in any event mitigation would not mitigate the penal character of this
clause. If Carborundum did not ship the guaranteed minimum quantity, the reason
was likely to be--the reason was--that the steel industry had fallen on hard times
and the demand for Ferro Carbo was therefore down. In these circumstances Lake
River would have little prospect of finding a substitute contract that would yield it
significant profits to set off against the full contract price, which is the method by
which it proposes to take account of mitigation. At argument Lake River suggested
that it might at least have been able to sell the new bagging equipment to someone
for something, and the figure $40,000 was proposed. If the breach occurred on the
first day when performance under the contract was due and Lake River promptly sold
the bagging equipment for $40,000, its liquidated damages would fall to $493,000.
But by the same token its costs would fall to $49,000. Its profit would still be
$444,000, which as we said was more than 400 percent of its expected profit on the
contract. The penal component would be unaffected.

         With the penalty clause in this case compare the liquidated-damages clause in
Arduini v. Board of Education, supra, which is representative of such clauses upheld
in Illinois. The plaintiff was a public school teacher whose contract provided that if
he resigned before the end of the school year he would be docked 4 percent of his
salary. This was a modest fraction of the contract price. And the cost to the school of
an untimely resignation would be difficult to measure. Since that cost would be
greater the more senior and experienced the teacher was, the fact that the liquidated
damages would be greater the higher the teacher's salary did not make the clause
arbitrary. Even the fact that the liquidated damages were the same whether the

______________________________________________________________________________

UNIT 26: SPECIAL REMEDIES  561
teacher resigned at the beginning, the middle, or the end of the school year was not
arbitrary, for it was unclear how the amount of actual damages would vary with the
time of resignation. Although one might think that the earlier the teacher resigned
the greater the damage to the school would be, the school might find it easier to hire
a replacement for the whole year or a great part of it than to bring in a replacement
at the last minute to grade the exams left behind by the resigning teacher. Here, in
contrast, it is apparent from the face of the contract that the damages provided for by
the "liquidated damages" clause are grossly disproportionate to any probable loss and
penalize some breaches much more heavily than others regardless of relative cost.

         We do not mean by this discussion to cast a cloud of doubt over the "take or
pay" clauses that are a common feature of contracts between natural gas pipeline
companies and their customers. Such clauses require the customer, in consideration
of the pipeline's extending its line to his premises, to take a certain amount of gas at
a specified price--and if he fails to take it to pay the full price anyway. The
resemblance to the minimum-guarantee clause in the present case is obvious, but
perhaps quite superficial. Neither party has mentioned take-or-pay clauses, and we
can find no case where such a clause was even challenged as a penalty clause--though
in one case it was argued that such a clause made the damages unreasonably low.
See National Fuel Gas Distribution Corp. v. Pennsylvania Public Utility Comm'n, 76
Pa. Commw. 102, 126-27 n. 8, 464 A.2d 546, 558 n. 8 (1983). If, as appears not to be
the case here but would often be the case in supplying natural gas, a supplier's fixed
costs were a very large fraction of his total costs, a take-or-pay clause might well be
a reasonable liquidation of damages. In the limit, if all the supplier's costs were
incurred before he began supplying the customer, the contract revenues would be an
excellent measure of the damages from breach. But in this case, the supplier (Lake
River, viewed as a supplier of bagging services to Carborundum) incurred only a
fraction of its costs before performance began, and the interruption of performance
generated a considerable cost saving that is not reflected in the damage formula.

         The fact that the damage formula is invalid does not deprive Lake River of a
remedy. The parties did not contract explicitly with reference to the measure of
damages if the agreed-on damage formula was invalidated, but all this means is that
the victim of the breach is entitled to his common law damages. See, e.g.,
Restatement, Second, Contracts § 356, comment a (1981). In this case that would be
the unpaid contract price of $241,000 minus the costs that Lake River saved by not
having to complete the contract (the variable costs on the other 45 percent of the
Ferro Carbo that it never had to bag). The case must be remanded to the district judge
to fix these damages.

         Review Question 5. What facts made the liquidated damages provision in
Lake River an unenforceable penalty while its counterpart in Truck Rent-a-Center
was enforced? You may have to re-read the case carefully to answer this question
with an acceptable level of specificity.

         Review Question 6. Judge Posner says in Lake River that one strong argument
against enforcing punitive liquidated damages provisions is that "a penalty clause
may discourage efficient as well as inefficient breaches of contract." What exactly are
"efficient" breaches of contract and why would a legal system not want to discourage
them? In what kind of factual scenario could you imagine breaching a contract being
a net social benefit in a way that, say, commission of a tort is not?

Problem 26.1

         Sandra Perez owns the 8th Avenue Grill, a lunch-and-breakfast restaurant
occupying 1500 square feet on the ground floor of Anderson Tower, a twenty-story
office building located a few blocks outside the downtown business district. In 20X5,
Perez is in the fifth year of a nine-year lease with Anderson LLP, the owner of the
building. During Perez's five years in business, slightly more than half of the
customers of 8th Avenue Grill have been office tenants who work in Anderson Tower.
The building has never been more than 75% occupied during that time, and in recent
years, Anderson LLP has lost money or barely broken even. Starting in mid-20X5,
Anderson LLP began systematically not renewing the leases of its office tenants (who
have much shorter-term leases than the ground floor restaurant), which seemed like
odd behavior for a landlord. By September, however, Anderson's reasons for removing
tenants became clear as it announced a plan to convert the building from office space
to expensive downtown condominiums.

         Perez is devastated by this announcement, as it means her breakfast and lunch
clientele will dwindle and her business will almost certainly fail. That failure,
incidentally, is precisely the outcome hoped for by the landlord, who wants to convert
the 8th Avenue Grill space into a posh lobby for the new condominiums. Upon
examination of her lease, however, Perez notices that Anderson LLP explicitly
promised to lease to her "1500 square feet on the ground floor of this twenty-story
office building," not a condominium. Perez decides to sue Anderson LLP, and her
lawyer quickly obtains a partial summary judgment determining that the landlord is

______________________________________________________________________________

UNIT 26: SPECIAL REMEDIES  563
breaching its lease with Perez by the act of converting Anderson Tower into
condominiums.

         Perez deeply wants to keep the 8th Avenue Grill and life as she knows it intact
for the remaining four years on her lease before she retires. Can Perez obtain a decree
of specific performance requiring Anderson LLP to perform its contractual obligation
to lease space in Anderson Towers as an office building for four more years? What
will both sides argue and who should prevail?

Problem 26.2

         In March, retail chain Toys-We-Is signed a contract with PlayCo, a home
playground equipment manufacturer. The contract provides for PlayCo to ship Toys-
We-Is 1,000 of its exclusively licensed Space Trek Wars play forts at $10,000 each,
for delivery on November 1. Toys-We-Is originally planned, in turn, to sell the play
forts for $15,000 at retail. In July, however, a new installment in the Space Trek
Wars movie franchise releases and it becomes a massive hit, increasing the demand
for products associated with Space Trek Wars. Sensing an opportunity, Toys-We-Is
launched an ad campaign built around these elaborate sci-fi themed play forts, which
it now plans to sell for $20,000 as all indications are that the forts will be a high-end
"it" toy for the holiday season.

         On October 1, PlayCo informs Toys-We-Is that it is breaching the contract and
will not deliver any of the forts. The real reason for this breach, it turns out, is that
PlayCo decided it could sell the forts to the public itself through its website and reap
all the profit. The president of Toys-We-Is, Latoya Ball, has come to your office about
the situation. Ball says that while losing profit on the forts is bad enough, her greater
concern is with the loss of reputation for the Toys-We-Is chain, which has built its
entire marketing plan around Space Trek Wars and these play forts as the "crown
jewel" product. Many customers would be drawn into the stores to gawk at the floor
model, even though few will purchase it. That sort of foot traffic (especially parents
with children) drives holiday sales. Ball wants to know if she can force PlayCo to
honor its agreement with Toys-We-Is. Can she? Make sure your answer addresses
UCC § 2-716 and its Official Comments 1 and 2.

Problem 26.3

         In April 20X0, ex-NBA player Carlisle Richards and regional school Kings
State University ("KSU") executed an employment agreement making Richards the
head men's basketball coach at KSU for a period of four years with an option for a
fifth year. The contract contained a liquidated damages provision that states:

         Richards recognizes that his promise to work for the
         University for the entire term of this contract is of the

______________________________________________________________________________

564  CHAPTER VIII: REMEDIES
         essence of this contract with the University. Richards also
         recognizes that the University is making a highly valuable
         investment in his continued employment by entering into this
         contract and its investment would be lost were he to resign
         or otherwise terminate his employment with the University
         prior to the expiration of this Contract. Accordingly, he
         will pay to the University as liquidated damages an amount
         equal to his base and supplemental salary, multiplied by the
         number of years (or portion(s) thereof) remaining on the
         contract.

         Richards was highly successful in his first two seasons at KSU, booth years
reaching the "Sweet 16" semifinals in the NCAA Tournament. In April 20X2, at the
coach's request, Richards and Kings State renegotiated and executed a modified
employment agreement for a term of five years that increased his salary and
supplemental salary by a total of $100,000.00 for a total annual salary of $300,000.00.
The liquidated damages clause in the modified agreement was identical to the
original version.

         In March 20X3, Richards led his team even further, to the NCAA "Final Four."
A few days after KSU's elimination by the eventual national champion, Richards quit
his position at KSU and accepted the same position at Behemoth State University--
a much larger and more prestigious school--for a total annual salary of $700,000.00.
KSU promptly sued Richards, claiming liquidated damages of $1,200,000. What will
both sides argue and who should prevail?

                An Introduction to

       CONTRACT NONPARTIES

         Are We Not Done Yet?! If you have proceeded through the previous units in
this book, you have gone through every step of the contract process.

       What law applies--common law, UCC, CISG, or something else?

       Was there an agreement between the parties?

       If so, is the agreement supported by consideration or some substitute?

       If so, is there some defense to the formation of the contract?

       If not, have we interpreted the agreement and determined that what

     each party was supposed to have done?

       If so, did one of the parties breach?

       If so, was the breach excused?

       If not, what remedies are available to party victimized by the breach?

         But there is, in fact, one more type of issues that may arise and that we should
address. So far in all of our discussions we have assumed that the party raising the
claim of breach was a party to the contract. And that is by far the most common
situation.

         Strangers to the Contract. Indeed, the general rule in contract law is that a
"stranger to the contract" (that is, one who is not a party) has no right to enforce the
contract. After all, contracts often are not isolated transactions, and many people may
have some generalized "interest" in the contracts. In some cases, like a contract
between a star athlete and a professional team, there may be literally millions of fans
with an interest in how one or both of the parties are performing the contract.
Imagine the chaos if anyone interested in whether a contract is performed could bring
a lawsuit. Even if we limit litigation rights to non-parties who actually have a direct
economic interest riding on the transaction, strong reasons still exist to restrict the
right to bring claims to the parties themselves. Suppose, for example that Tracy is
married to Dana, and Dana has a lucrative employment contract with her employer.
The employer breaches the contract and fires Dana. Tracy obviously has suffered
harm--where spouses share incomes the loss of one hurts both. If Dana does not want
to sue the employer, can Tracy sue for the harm that he suffered?

         Generally, the answer to that question is "no." The long-standing doctrine of
"privity of contract" holds that when parties create a contract, it benefits and binds
only themselves. They cannot impose contractual obligations on those who are not

______________________________________________________________________________

568                                           CHAPTER IX: CONTRACT NONPARTIES
parties, and only they can enforce the obligations they have undertaken through a
breach of contract claim.

         Enter the Outsiders. Privity is still a basic principle of contract law, but there
are two very important areas where nonparties do have the right to bring actions in
their own name. One area involves the concept of assignment and delegation, where
parties transfer their rights and obligations to others, effectively allowing new parties
to be substituted for original parties. The second area is the doctrine of third party
beneficiaries, in which the original contracting parties remain, but enforceable rights
have been created for nonparties. These concepts are the subjects of the next two
units.

                     Third-Party Beneficiaries

FOCUS OF THIS UNIT

         Consider the common life insurance policy. Suppose that Mario has purchased
life insurance from Mushroom Mutual Insurance Company. As part of the purchase,
Mario has designated Peach as his beneficiary. Peach may not know anything about
this contract until long after its making, but both Mario and Mushroom Mutual
understand that the purpose of the contract is to make a payment to Peach in the
event of Mario's demise during the term of the policy. Suppose Mario dies and Mutual
does not pay the policy amount. The late Mario cannot sue because he is (still) dead.
Can Peach--who was not a party to the contract--sue Mutual? The answer, as you
probably suspect, is going to be yes. After all, it would make no sense to have a life
insurance policy that could not be enforced because the policy holder was dead. It only
makes sense for Peach to have rights under the contract. The nonparty allowed to sue
in such circumstances is known as a "third party beneficiary."

         Intended or Incidental? Suppose, however, that Peach does not sue for the
money. But Mario's brother Luigi--to whom Peach owes a great deal of money--
wants to sue Mushroom Mutual to have it pay Peach, so that Peach will have the
money to pay Luigi. Can Luigi enforce the contract against Mutual? No. Luigi would
benefit if the contract were performed, but he is not allowed to enforce it. As you will
see from the cases below, Peach is what lawyers call an "intended beneficiary," while
Luigi is an "incidental beneficiary." The distinction is important. If an aircraft
company signs a new contract to build fifty passenger planes, a lot of people will
incidentally benefit from the contract--employees, stockholders, subcontractors and
suppliers (and their employees, stockholders, and suppliers), and so on. But only
intended beneficiaries can enforce the contract.

         Defenses Against Beneficiary Claims. The rights of a third-party beneficiary
do not exist apart from the underlying contract between the promisor and promisee.
Put differently, the third party's rights are derivative of the rights of the promisee.
As a result, the beneficiary gets contract rights that are no greater than the promisee
had. You may recall an otherwise enforceable contract is subject to defenses, such as

______________________________________________________________________________

UNIT 27: THIRD-PARTY BENEFICIARIES  571
fraud, mistake, and illegality. If the promisor in an underlying contract would have
the right to raise defenses against the promisee, those same defenses are effective
against a claim brought by a third-party beneficiary. Section 309 of the Restatement
(Second) of Contracts also states a useful rule that obviously follows from the nature
of derivative claims: if no contract was ever formed between the promisor and the
promisee, there can be no third-party beneficiary.

     Cases and Materials

                                           LAWRENCE v. FOX

         [Holly owed $300 to Lawrence. Holly then agreed to loan Fox $300, and Fox in
return Fox promised to settle Holly's debt by paying the $300 to Lawrence. Fox failed
to do so. Lawrence sued Fox. Fox argued that he was not a party to Lawrence's
contract with Holly, and Lawrence was not a party to his own contract with Holly,
and therefore Lawrence could not sue him.]1

         It is now more than a quarter of a century since it was settled by the Supreme
Court of this State--in an able and pains-taking opinion by the late Chief Justice
SAVAGE, in which the authorities were fully examined and carefully analyzed--that
a promise in all material respects like the one under consideration was valid; and the
judgment of that court was unanimously affirmed by the Court for the Correction of
Errors. Farley v. Cleveland, 4 Cow. 432 (N.Y. 1825), same case in error, 9 Cow. 639
(N.Y. 1827). In that case one Moon owed Farley and sold to Cleveland a quantity of
hay, in consideration of which Cleveland promised to pay Moon's debt to Farley; and
the decision in favor of Farley's right to recover was placed upon the ground that the
hay received by Cleveland from Moon was a valid consideration for Cleveland's
promise to pay Farley, and that the subsisting liability of Moon to pay Farley was no
objection to the recovery.

         The report of that case shows that the promise was not only made to Moon but
to the plaintiff Farley. In this case, the promise was made to Holly and not expressly
to the plaintiff; and this difference between the two cases presents the question,

     1 [If you are wondering why Lawrence chose to sue Fox instead of the man who actually owed

him the money, the best guess is that of Professor Waters, who concluded that Holly owed an illegal

gambling debt to Lawrence. As you learned in the unit on illegality, courts do not enforce such

agreements. Do you think Lawrence's lawyer earned his fee by prevailing in this case? For the story

of the case, see Anthony J. Waters, The Property In the Promise: A Study of the Third Party Beneficiary

Rule, 98 HARV. L. REV. 1109, 1123-1127 (1985). - Eds.]

raised by the defendant's objection, as to the want of privity between the plaintiff and
defendant.

         As early as 1806 it was announced by the Supreme Court of this State, upon
what was then regarded as the settled law of England, "That where one person makes
a promise to another for the benefit of a third person, that third person may maintain
an action upon it." Schermerhorn v. Vanderheyden, 1 Johns. 139 (N.Y. 1806), has
often been re-asserted by our courts and never departed from.

         This question was subsequently, and in a case quite recent, again the subject
of consideration by the Supreme Court, when it was held, that in declaring upon a
promise, made to the debtor by a third party to pay the creditor of the debtor, founded
upon a consideration advanced by the debtor, it was unnecessary to aver a promise
to the creditor; for the reason that upon proof of a promise made to the debtor to pay
the creditor, a promise to the creditor would be implied. And in support of this
proposition, in no respect distinguishable from the one now under consideration, the
case of Schermerhorn v. Vanderheyden, with many intermediate cases in our courts,
were cited, in which the doctrine of that case was not only approved but affirmed. The
same principle is adjudged in several cases in Massachusetts. In Hall v. Marston,17
Mass. 575 (1822), the court says: "It seems to have been well settled that if A promises
B for a valuable consideration to pay C, the latter may maintain assumpsit for the
money"; and in Brewer v. Dyer, 61 Mass. 337 (1851), the recovery was upheld, as the
court said, "upon the principle of law long recognized and clearly established, that
when one person, for a valuable consideration, engages with another, by a simple
contract, to do some act for the benefit of a third, the latter, who would enjoy the
benefit of the act, may maintain an action for the breach of such engagement; that it
does not rest upon the ground of any actual or supposed relationship between the
parties as some of the earlier cases would seem to indicate, but upon the broader and
more satisfactory basis, that the law operating on the act of the parties creates the
duty, establishes a privity, and implies the promise and obligation on which the action
is founded."

         It was also insisted that Holly could have discharged the defendant from his
promise, though it was intended by both parties for the benefit of the plaintiff, and
therefore the plaintiff was not entitled to maintain this suit for the recovery of a
demand over which he had no control. It is enough that the plaintiff did not release
the defendant from his promise, and whether he could or not is a question not now
necessarily involved. Suppose the defendant had given his note in which, for value
received of Holly, he had promised to pay the plaintiff and the plaintiff had accepted
the promise, retaining Holly's liability. Very clearly Holly could not have discharged
that promise, be the right to release the defendant as it may. No one can doubt that
he owes the sum of money demanded of him, or that in accordance with his promise
it was his duty to have paid it to the plaintiff; nor can it be doubted that whatever

may be the diversity of opinion elsewhere, the adjudications in this State, from a very
early period, approved by experience, have established the defendant's liability; if,
therefore, it could be shown that a more strict and technically accurate application of
the rules applied, would lead to a different result (which I by no means concede), the
effort should not be made in the face of manifest justice.

         The judgment should be affirmed.

COMSTOCK, J. (Dissenting.)

         The plaintiff had nothing to do with the promise on which he brought this
action. It was not made to him, nor did the consideration proceed from him. If he can
maintain the suit, it is because an anomaly has found its way into the law on this
subject. In general, there must be privity of contract. The party who sues upon a
promise must be the promisee, or he must have some legal interest in the
undertaking. In this case, it is plain that Holly, who loaned the money to the
defendant, and to whom the promise in question was made, could at any time have
claimed that it should be performed to himself personally. He had lent the money to
the defendant, and at the same time directed the latter to pay the sum to the plaintiff.
This direction he could countermand, and if he had done so, manifestly the
defendant's promise to pay according to the direction would have ceased to exist. The
plaintiff would receive a benefit by a complete execution of the arrangement, but the
arrangement itself was between other parties, and was under their exclusive control.
If the defendant had paid the money to Holly, his debt would have been discharged
thereby. So Holly might have released the demand or assigned it to another person,
or the parties might have annulled the promise now in question, and designated some
other creditor of Holly as the party to whom the money should be paid. It has never
been claimed, that in a case thus situated, the right of a third person to sue upon the
promise rested on any sound principle of law.

                                           _____________________

         Review Question 1. Judge Comstock's dissent in Lawrence v. Fox asserts the
general principle that to bring a breach of contract claim "there must be privity of
contract. The party who sues upon a promise must be the promisee, or he must have
some legal interest in the undertaking." The requirement of "privity of contract"
reflects the common law's longstanding position that only parties who have a direct
legal relationship to the contract can enforce it. Did it make logical sense for the New
York Court of Appeals to relax the privity rule under the facts of Lawrence? Why or
why not? Would your opinion change if you concluded, like Judge Comstock did in a
lengthy part of his opinion that we omitted, that no existing precedent actually
supported the majority's outcome?

______________________________________________________________________________

574  CHAPTER IX: CONTRACT NONPARTIES
         Review Question 2. One argument against granting Lawrence the right to sue
Fox directly is that changing the law was unnecessary. Since Lawrence retained his
right to sue Holly, he could do so and then place the burden on Holly to join Fox to
the lawsuit as a third-party defendant and then let the court sort things out. What,
if any, are the disadvantages to such an approach?

         Comment. British courts until 1999 were firmly in Judge Comstock's camp--
they managed to get through the entire 19th and 20th centuries without recognizing
third party beneficiary doctrine, until Parliament enacted it in statutory form in The
Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Act of 1999. It took some 70 years to get the
legislation passed, and even then not everyone liked it. As you read the cases in this
unit, think about whether the British courts or the American courts had the better
approach to these cases.

                  SEAVER v. RANSOM
             Court of Appeals of New York
           224 N.Y. 233, 120 N.E. 639 (1918)

POUND, J.

         Judge Beman and his wife were advanced in years. Mrs. Beman was about to
die. She had a small estate, consisting of a house and lot in Malone and little else.
Judge Beman drew his wife's will according to her instructions. It gave $1,000 to
plaintiff, $500 to one sister, plaintiff's mother, and $100 each to another sister and
her son, the use of the house to her husband for life, and remainder to the American
Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals. She named her husband as
residuary legatee and executor. Plaintiff was her niece, 34 years old, in ill health,
sometimes a member of the Beman household. When the will was read to Mrs.
Beman, she said that it was not as she wanted it. She wanted to leave the house to
plaintiff. She had no other objection to the will, but her strength was waning, and,
although the judge offered to write another will for her, she said she was afraid she
would not hold out long enough to enable her to sign it. So the judge said, if she would
sign the will, he would leave plaintiff enough in his will to make up the difference.
He avouched the promise by his uplifted hand with all solemnity and his wife then
executed the will. When he came to die, it was found that his will made no provision
for the plaintiff.

         This action was brought, and plaintiff recovered judgment in the trial court,
on the theory that Beman had obtained property from his wife and induced her to
execute the will in the form prepared by him by his promise to give plaintiff $6,000,
the value of the house, and that thereby equity impressed his property with a trust
in favor of plaintiff. Where a legatee promises the testator that he will use property

______________________________________________________________________________

UNIT 27: THIRD-PARTY BENEFICIARIES            575
given him by the will for a particular purpose, a trust arises. Beman received nothing
under his wife's will but the use of the house in Malone for life. Equity compels the
application of property thus obtained to the purpose of the testator, but equity cannot
so impress a trust, except on property obtained by the promise. Beman was bound by
his promise, but no property was bound by it; no trust in plaintiff's favor can be
spelled out.

         An action on the contract for damages, or to make the executors trustees for
performance, stands on different ground. The Appellate Division properly passed to
the consideration of the question whether the judgment could stand upon the promise
made to the wife, upon a valid consideration, for the sole benefit of plaintiff. The
judgment of the trial court was affirmed by a return to the general doctrine laid down
in the great case of Lawrence v. Fox, 20 N.Y. 268 (1859), which has since been limited
as herein indicated.

         Contracts for the benefit of third persons have been the prolific source of
judicial and academic discussion. Williston, Contracts for the Benefit of a Third
Person, 15 HARV. L. REV. 767; Corbin, Contracts for the Benefit of Third Persons, 27
YALE L. REV. 1008. The general rule, both in law and equity was that privity between
a plaintiff and a defendant is necessary to the maintenance of an action on the
contract. The consideration must be furnished by the party to whom the promise was
made. The contract cannot be enforced against the third party, and therefore it cannot
be enforced by him. On the other hand, the right of the beneficiary to sue on a contract
made expressly for his benefit has been fully recognized in many American
jurisdictions, either by judicial decision or by legislation, and is said to be "the
prevailing rule in this country." Hendrick v. Lindsay, 93 U.S. 143, 23 L. Ed. 855;
Lehow v. Simonton, 3 Colo. 346. It has been said that `the establishment of this
doctrine has been gradual, and is a victory of practical utility over theory, of equity
over technical subtlety.' BRANTLY ON CONTRACTS (2d Ed.) p. 253. The reasons for this
view are that it is just and practical to permit the person for whose benefit the
contract is made to enforce it against one whose duty it is to pay. Other jurisdictions
still adhere to the present English rule that a contract cannot be enforced by or
against a person who is not a party.

         In New York the right of the beneficiary to sue on contracts made for his benefit
is not clearly or simply defined. It is at present confined: First, to cases where there
is a pecuniary obligation running from the promisee to the beneficiary, "a legal right
founded upon some obligation of the promisee in the third party to adopt and claim
the promise as made for his benefit." Farley v. Cleveland, 4 Cow. 432, 15 Am. Dec.
387; Lawrence v. Fox, supra. Secondly, to cases where the contract is made for the
benefit of the wife, affianced wife, or child of a party to the contract. The close
relationship cases go back to the early King's Bench case (1677), long since repudiated
in England, of Dutton v. Poole, 2 Lev. 211 (s. c., 1 Ventris, 318, 332). The natural and
moral duty of the husband or parent to provide for the future of wife or child sustains

______________________________________________________________________________

576  CHAPTER IX: CONTRACT NONPARTIES
the action on the contract made for their benefit. `This is the farthest the cases in this
state have gone,' says Cullen, J., in the marriage settlement case of Borland v. Welch,
162 N. Y. 104, 110, 56 N. E. 556.

         The right of the third party is also upheld in, thirdly, the public contract, where
the municipality seeks to protect its inhabitants by covenants for their benefit; and,
fourthly, the cases where, at the request of a party to the contract, the promise runs
directly to the beneficiary although he does not furnish the consideration. It may be
safely said that a general rule sustaining recovery at the suit of the third party would
include but few classes of cases not included in these groups, either categorically or
in principle.

         The desire of the childless aunt to make provision for a beloved and favorite
niece differs imperceptibly in law or in equity from the moral duty of the parent to
make testamentary provision for a child. The contract was made for the plaintiff's
benefit. She alone is substantially damaged by its breach. The representatives of the
wife's estate have no interest in enforcing it specifically. It is said in Buchanan v.
Tilden that the common law imposes moral and legal obligations upon the husband
and the parent not measured by the necessaries of life. It was, however, the love and
affection or the moral sense of the husband and the parent that imposed such
obligations in the cases cited, rather than any common-law duty of husband and
parent to wife and child. If plaintiff had been a child of Mrs. Beman, legal obligation
would have required no testamentary provision for her, yet the child could have
enforced a covenant in her favor identical with the covenant of Judge Beman in this
case. The constraining power of conscience is not regulated by the degree of
relationship alone. The dependent or faithful niece may have a stronger claim than
the affluent or unworthy son. No sensible theory of moral obligation denies arbitrarily
to the former what would be conceded to the latter. We might consistently either
refuse or allow the claim of both, but I connot reconcile a decision in favor of the wife
in Buchanan v. Tilden, based on the moral obligations arising out of near
relationship, with a decision against the niece here on the ground that the
relationship is too remote for equity's ken. No controlling authority depends upon so
absolute a rule. . . . Kellogg, P. J., writing for the court below well said:

         The doctrine of Lawrence v. Fox is progressive, not retrograde. The
         course of the late decisions is to enlarge, not to limit, the effect of that
         case.

         The court in that leading case attempted to adopt the general doctrine that any
third person, for whose direct benefit a contract was intended, could sue on it. As late
as Townsend v. Rackham, 143 N. Y. 516, 523, 38 N. E. 731, 733, we find Peckham, J.,
saying that, `to maintain the action by the third person, there must be this liability
to him on the part of the promisee.' Buchanan v. Tilden went further than any case

______________________________________________________________________________

UNIT 27: THIRD-PARTY BENEFICIARIES  577
since Lawrence v. Fox in a desire to do justice rather than to apply with technical
accuracy strict rules calling for a legal or equitable obligation.

         But, on principle, a sound conclusion may be reached. If Mrs. Beman had left
her husband the house on condition that he pay the plaintiff $6,000, and he had
accepted the devise, he would have become personally liable to pay the legacy, and
plaintiff could have recovered in an action at law against him, whatever the value of
the house. That would be because the testatrix had in substance bequeathed the
promise to plaintiff, and not because close relationship or moral obligation sustained
the contract. The distinction between an implied promise to a testator for the benefit
of a third party to pay a legacy and an unqualified promise on a valuable
consideration to make provision for the third party by will is discernible, but not
obvious. The tendency of American authority is to sustain the gift in all such cases
and to permit the donee beneficiary to recover on the contract. Matter of Edmundson's
Estate, 103 A. 277, 259 Pa. 429 (1918). The equities are with the plaintiff, and they
may be enforced in this action, whether it be regarded as an action for damages or an
action for specific performance to convert the defendants into trustees for plaintiff's
benefit under the agreement.

         The judgment should be affirmed, with costs.

                                           _____________________

         Review Question 3. In Lawrence v. Fox, the third-party beneficiary was a
creditor, while in Seaver v. Ransom, the third-party beneficiary sought to enforce a
promise to make a gift. The Seaver court states that the distinction between these
two situations is "discernable, but not obvious." As you may recall from our study of
consideration, contract law often treats gift promises quite differently from other
promises. Why exactly did the court decide to treat a gift promise the same way as a
promise to pay a debt?

         Review Question 4. In your Property course, you may have run across the
general requirements for a valid will. A will is quite formal, and most states require
it to be personally handwritten by the testator or signed in front of at least two
witnesses who attest to the signature. Here, there were two wills (the wife's and the
husband's) and neither one gave the house to the niece. Judge Pound seems to say
that the formality of the requirements for wills can be circumvented simply by
making an oral statement of intent. Does it make sense for parties to be able to
accomplish something through contract law that the law governing wills expressly
does not permit? Why or why not?

578  CHAPTER IX: CONTRACT NONPARTIES
                           HALE v. GROCE
                      Supreme Court of Oregon
                 304 Or. 281, 744 P.2d 1289 (1987)

LINDE, Justice.

         Defendant, who is an attorney, was directed by a client to prepare
testamentary instruments and to include a bequest of a specified sum to plaintiff.
After the client's death, it was discovered that the gift was not included either in the
will or in a related trust instrument. After an unsuccessful attempt to obtain judicial
reformation of the will and trust, plaintiff brought the present action for damages
against the attorney.

         The complaint alleged as two separate claims, first, that defendant was
negligent in a number of particulars and, second, that he failed to carry out a
contractual promise to his client, the decedent, which the decedent had intended
specifically for the benefit of plaintiff. In other states plaintiffs in such cases have
sometimes been allowed to recover on one or both of these theories, as negligently
injured parties or as third-party beneficiaries under a contract. It is a new question
in this court.

         Defendant moved to dismiss the complaint on grounds that the stated facts did
not constitute a claim under either theory, and that, at least as to the tort theory, the
action was not commenced within the time limited by the applicable statute. The
circuit court held that the action was not time-barred but allowed defendant's motion
to dismiss both claims. On plaintiff's appeal, the Court of Appeals reinstated
plaintiff's negligence claim, and it also remanded for trial her allegations that
defendant was estopped from invoking the statute of limitations. Hale v. Groce, 730
P.2d 576 (Or. Ct. App. 1986).

         Both parties petitioned this court for review. Defendant asserts that a lawyer
owes a professional duty of care only to his client and cannot be sued for malpractice
by others who are injured by the way he performs that duty. Plaintiff asks us to
reinstate her contract claim as a third-party beneficiary. We hold that the complaint
states claims for damages under both theories, a claim as the intended beneficiary of
defendant's professional contract with the decedent and a derivative tort claim based
on breach of the duty created by that contract to the plaintiff as its intended
beneficiary.

The two claims are related, but they differ in important respects. Standing

alone, without a duty to plaintiff derived from defendant's contractual undertaking,

plaintiff's tort claim would confront the rule that one ordinarily is not liable for

negligently causing a stranger's purely economic loss without injuring his person or

property. See Ore-Ida Foods v. Indian Head, 627 P.2d 469 (Or. 1981) (denying

employer's claim against third person who caused employer to become liable for

______________________________________________________________________________

UNIT 27: THIRD-PARTY BENEFICIARIES                  579
workers' compensation benefits), Snow v. West, 440 P.2d 864 (Or. 1968) (denying
employer's claim against third person for loss of services of employee). It does not
suffice that the harm is a foreseeable consequence of negligent conduct that may
make one liable to someone else, for instance to a client. Some source of a duty outside
the common law of negligence is required. Even then, tort rules such as comparative
fault may apply that do not apply to contract claims. A contract claim, on the other
hand, does not necessarily depend on showing negligence.

         Similar claims were made in Currey v. Butcher, 61 P. 631 (Or. 1900), in which
attorneys were charged with a faulty search of a title. This court held that they were
entitled to an instruction that they would not be liable to a person for whom their
client may have acted unbeknownst to them. A chief precedent for Currey was
Buckley v. Gray, 42 P. 900 (Cal. 1895), which the court cited for the proposition that
"an attorney employed to draw a will is not liable to a person who, through the
attorney's ignorance or negligence in the discharge of his professional duties, was
deprived of the portion of the estate which the testator instructed the attorney should
be given such person by the will."

         Since 1900, many courts have reconsidered that proposition, some preferring
a contract analysis, some negligence, and at least one "a definite maybe." Kirgan v.
Parks, 478 A.2d 713, 714 (Md. Ct. App. 1984). Buckley v. Gray itself was overruled in
Lucas v. Hamm, 364 P.2d 685, 687 (Cal. 1961). The California Supreme Court stated
that a lawyer might be liable to an intended testamentary beneficiary either for
negligence or for breach of the lawyer's contract with the testator, though the court
balked at recognizing professional negligence in a lawyer's failure to meet the state's
rule against perpetuities and restraints on alienation. After Lucas, the California
court treated contract liability as superfluous and settled on negligence theory, which
in California calls for applying "public policy" by "balancing" half a dozen "factors" in
each case.

         The Pennsylvania Supreme Court chose the contrary course in Guy v.
Liederbach, 459 A.2d 744 (Pa. 1983), a claim by a beneficiary who lost a legacy
because the testator's lawyer let her subscribe as a witness to the will. The court
rejected both open-ended tort liability to foreseeably injured third parties and what
it considered the "unworkable" California standard, noting that:

         although a plaintiff on a third party beneficiary theory in contract may
         in some cases have to show a deviation from the standard of care, as in
         negligence, to establish breach, the class of persons to whom the
         defendant may be liable is restricted by principles of contract law, not
         negligence principles relating to foreseeability or scope of the risk.

______________________________________________________________________________

580  CHAPTER IX: CONTRACT NONPARTIES
Id. at 752. Citing dictum in an early Pennsylvania decision, Lawall v. Groman, 37 A.
98 (Pa. 1897), the court settled instead on liability to the intended beneficiary under
Restatement (Second) Contracts § 302(1) (1981).2

         The Connecticut Supreme Court similarly allowed a disappointed beneficiary
of a testamentary trust to proceed against the testatrix's lawyer on a contract theory
over an objection that the lawyer's promise obligated him only to the client and not
to the intended beneficiary, because the benefit to the plaintiff also was the essence
of the benefit promised to the testatrix. Stowe v. Smith, 441 A.2d 81 (Conn. 1981).

         We agree that the beneficiary in these cases is not only a plausible but a classic
"intended" third-party beneficiary of the lawyer's promise to his client within the rule
of Restatement § 302(1)(b) and may enforce the duty so created, as stated. Id. section
304.3 See, e.g., Parker v. Jeffery, 37 P. 712 (Ore. 1894) (stating rule that a contract
may be enforced by one for whose benefit it was intended). The promise, of course,
was not that the lawyer would pay plaintiff the stipulated sum, and it is too late for
the lawyer to perform the promise that he did make, but this does not preclude an
action for damages for the nonperformance. In principle, such an action is available
to one in plaintiff's position.

         Because under third-party analysis the contract creates a "duty" not only to
the promisee, the client, but also to the intended beneficiary, negligent
nonperformance may give rise to a negligence action as well. Not every such contract
will support either claim. A contract to prepare a will or other instrument may
promise different things. It may undertake to make a particular disposition by means
specified by the client (for instance, in trust, or by a gift of identified property), or to
accomplish the intended gift by specified means of the lawyer's choosing. Failure to
do what was promised then would be a breach of contract regardless of any
negligence. On the other hand, the lawyer's promise might be to use his best
professional efforts to accomplish the specified result with the skill and care
customary among lawyers in the relevant community. Because negligence liability of
this kind arises only from the professional obligation to the client, it does not threaten

2 [Section 302 provides:
(1) Unless otherwise agreed between promisor and promisee, a beneficiary of a promise is an
intended beneficiary if recognition of a right to performance in the beneficiary is appropriate
to effectuate the intention of the parties and either

          (a) the performance of the promise will satisfy an obligation of the promisee to pay
money to the beneficiary; or

          (b) the circumstances indicate that the promisee intends to give the beneficiary the
benefit of the promised performance.

to divide a lawyer's loyalty between the client and a potentially injured third party,
as defendant argues.

         Whether breach of that kind of promise is properly characterized as a breach
of contract or as negligence, we have said, depends on the legal rule for which its
character is at issue. See Securities-Intermountain v. Sunset Fuel, 289 Or. 243, 252
n.6, 611 P.2d 1158 (1980). That case, like this one, involved an issue whether the
action was commenced in time. We cited Currey v. Butcher, supra, to illustrate that
a breach of professional duty could give rise to an action "either in assumpsit, for a
breach of the implied promise, or in case, for the neglect of the duty." Securities-
Intermountain, 289 Or. at 254, 611 P.2d 1158. We also noted Justice O'Connell's
observation, in Bales for Food v. Poole, 246 Or. 253, 424 P.2d 892 (1967), that the
different statutory time limitations for tort and contract claims deserved legislative
reconsideration. 289 Or. at 260, 611 P.2d 1158.

         In the present case, the Court of Appeals held that plaintiff's complaint pleaded
only a tort claim. In the court's view, the complaint alleged no more than that the
alleged professional contract "merely incorporate[d] by reference or by implication a
general standard of skill and care to which the defendant would be bound
independent of the contract."

         [The court then recounts the specific allegations of the plaintiff's complaint.]

         These paragraphs allege breach of a specific promise "that defendant would
prepare a trust document wherein Rogers and plaintiff would be co-trustees and
through which plaintiff would receive the gift Rogers intended her to have," a "trust
document with plaintiff's gift in it." They allege, not that defendant performed this
promise negligently, but that he did not perform it at all. As far as these allegations
went, he might have broken the promise purposely, or under circumstances that
might be a partial or entire defense to a negligence claim.

         Lacking a detailed written contract, [resolution of the question] may depend
on correspondence, memoranda, or testimony. When an alleged contract does not lend
itself to incorporation of a writing in the complaint, the issue at least may have to
await affidavits and possible counter-affidavits on motion for summary judgment. It
should not have been decided on a motion to dismiss the complaint. For this reason,
we reverse so much of the decision of the Court of Appeals as affirmed the dismissal
of the contract claim.

                                           _____________________

         Review Question 5. The court cites section 302 of the Restatement (Second) of
Contracts, which separates non-party contract beneficiaries into two categories:
intended and incidental. Intended beneficiaries, who can enforce the contract, must
satisfy a two-pronged test. First, that "recognition of a right to performance in the
beneficiary is appropriate to effectuate the intention of the parties." Consider our

______________________________________________________________________________

582  CHAPTER IX: CONTRACT NONPARTIES
Luigi v. Peach scenario from the introduction to this unit. How do Peach and Luigi
meet (or not meet) that standard?

         Review Question 6. The second prong of Restatement section 302 can be
satisfied in two different ways. One way is if "performance of the promise will satisfy
an obligation of the promisee to pay money to the beneficiary." Does Peach meet that
standard in our hypothetical? What about Luigi? The second way is to show that "the
circumstances indicate that the promisee intends to give the beneficiary the benefit
of the promised performance." Do either or both of our two characters meet this
alternative standard?

         Review Question 7. In Barcelo v. Elliott, 923 S.W.2d 575 (Tex. 1996). the Texas
Supreme Court considered a case with facts substantially similar to Hale v. Groce
and had this to say about the third-party beneficiary claim:

                  Plaintiffs also contend that, even if there is no tort duty extending
         to beneficiaries of an estate plan, they may recover under a third-party-
         beneficiary contract theory. While the majority of jurisdictions that have
         recognized a cause of action in favor of will or trust beneficiaries have
         done so under negligence principles, some have allowed recovery in
         contract. [citing, among other cases, Hale v. Groce]. In Texas, however,
         a legal malpractice action sounds in tort and is governed by negligence
         principles. Cf. Heyer v. Flaig, 70 Cal.2d 223, 74 Cal. Rptr. 225, 228, 449
         P.2d 161, 164 (1969) (recognizing that third-party-beneficiary contract
         theory "is conceptually superfluous since the crux of the action must lie
         in tort in any case; there can be no recovery without negligence"). Even
         assuming that a client who retains a lawyer to draft an estate plan
         intends for the lawyer's work to benefit the will or trust beneficiaries,
         the ultimate question is whether, considering the competing policy
         implications, the lawyer's professional duty should extend to persons
         whom the lawyer never represented. [W]e conclude that the answer is
         no.

Barcelo, 923 S.W.2d at 579. Does the Texas approach or the Oregon approach make
more sense to you? Are a lawyer's professional obligations so personal and special
that they cannot be owed to someone other than the client--even if that is precisely
what the client wants, or is the Texas court bending over backwards to protect
lawyers from liability?

         Review Question 8. Given the role that professional malpractice plays here,
should tort analysis (which depends on enforcement of general norms) displace any
third-party beneficiary analysis (which depends on the terms of individual contracts)
when we look at questions like this? Or should they both be available?

minimize exposure to these third party beneficiary actions?

      INTERPOOL LTD. v. THROUGH TRANSPORT MUTUAL
                       INSURANCE ASSOCIATION LTD.

     United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida.
                          635 F. Supp. 1503 (S.D. Fla. 1985)

JAMES LAWRENCE KING, Chief Judge.

         THIS CAUSE arises upon the Defendant's motion to stay the proceeding and
compel arbitration.

         Interpool Ltd and C.T.C. Corporation, the parties bringing this action, were
the owners of certain containerized cargo equipment which was leased to Mayan
Lines and Imparca, shipping companies. Both Mayan Lines and Imparca insured this
equipment with Through Transport Mutual Insurance Ltd.

         The insurance contract between Mayan/Imparca and Through Transport
required arbitration of any disputes involving coverage. Interpool Ltd. was not a
signatory to these contracts.

         The equipment was damaged and Interpool filed suit in this court to recover
the losses to its property, naming as defendants Mayan Lines as lessee, Imparca as
lessee, and Through Transport as the insurer. Mayan Lines has filed bankruptcy and
Imparca is a Venezuelan corporation that has apparently gone out of business and
has not been served.

         Through Transport has now filed a motion to stay the proceedings and compel
arbitration as required by the terms of its agreement with Mayan/Imparca on the
theory that Interpool Limited by claiming the position of a third party beneficiary,
now stands in the shoes of Mayan/Imparca and is bound by their contractual
agreement to arbitrate.

         The crucial issue in this case is: may a party who is not a signatory to the
contract but claims third party beneficiary status under the contract be bound by a
clause in the contract requiring arbitration of the dispute.

         Interpool and C.T.C. claim that because they never signed an agreement
requiring arbitration that they are under no contractual duty to arbitrate, and thus
have respectfully declined Through Transports offer to do so. Interpool and C.T.C. are
relying on an estoppel theory in that Through Transports confirmation of insurance
coverage directed to Interpool made mention of coverage under Through Transports

______________________________________________________________________________

584  CHAPTER IX: CONTRACT NONPARTIES
rule 31 and 12 but made no mention of any other rules applicable to Interpool or
C.T.C. Thus Interpool/C.T.C. claim that they were without notice that they were to
be bound by the arbitration clause contained in rule 35 of Through Transport's rules
and bylaws.

         Interpool and C.T.C. claim that the rules on their face only apply to Through
Transport members and are thus not applicable to Interpool/C.T.C. who are not
Interpool members. Interpool/C.T.C. are correct in their assertion that absent an
agreement to arbitrate the parties cannot be required to submit to arbitration.
Seaboard Coast Line R.R. v. Trailer Train Co. 690 F.2d 1343 (11th Cir. 1982).

         The issue before this court is clearly one of law and not a factual dispute.
Interpool/C.T.C. are assuming the benefits of the contract as third party beneficiaries.
Interpool/C.T.C. now wish to "stand in the shoes" of the contracting parties
Mayan/Imparca and derive the benefit of the Mayan/Imparca insurance contract with
Through Transport. Through Transports contract with Mayan/Imparca is clear on its
face that the parties will be bound by the rules and bylaws of the Through Transport
association. Rule 35 of the association states that disputes will be put to arbitration
for resolution.

         The law is clear that a third party beneficiary is bound by the terms and
conditions of the contract that it attempts to invoke. "The beneficiary cannot accept
the benefits and avoid the burdens or limitations of a contract." Trans-Bay Engineers
& Builders, Inc. v. Hills, 551 F.2d 370 (D.C.1976).

         Ordinary principles of contract law are used to determine if a non-signatory is
to be bound by the contract and "a party may be bound by an agreement to arbitrate
even in the absence of a signature." McAllister Bros. v. A & S Transport Co. 621 F.2d
519 (2nd Cir. 1980). Interpool/C.T.C. are bound by the terms and conditions of the
contract between Mayan/Imparca and Through Transport. The Rules applicable and
incorporated into the contract, specifically Rule 35 require arbitration of disputes.

         This court is empowered by 9 U.S.C. sec. 3 to stay this proceeding pending
arbitration of this dispute. Therefore . . . [t]he Defendant's motion to stay this case is
hereby GRANTED pending arbitration of this matter.

                                           _____________________

         Review Question 10. Contract law, as we hope you have learned by now, is
generally premised on the notion of voluntary consent by contracting parties. What
justification is there, then, for the Interpool court's statement that "a party may be
bound by an agreement to arbitrate even in the absence of a signature"? Doesn't that
statement run contrary to the voluntary nature of contractual obligations?

Problem 27.1

         Hank and Hilda have borrowed $250,000 from Bank for the purpose (stated in
the loan agreement) of building the couple's dream home. Hank and Hilda, in turn,
contracted with Fly-by-Night Builders to build the house, authorizing the builders to
draw down $100,000 of the loan proceeds (which are on deposit at Bank) to get the
project started. Builders then purchased $30,000 worth of lumber on credit from
Lumber Sellers, Inc. for the express purpose--stated in the credit agreement--of
being used for construction of Hank and Hilda's house. Three months later, after it
becomes apparent that Fly-by-Night Builders has mismanaged the project and
squandered the first $100,000 draw, it goes out of business, leaving no assets, but
many debts, including unpaid $30,000 debt owed to Lumber Sellers. Builders got the
materials from Lumber Sellers, but used it for other projects and did not use any on
Hank and Hilda's job.

         Lumber Sellers has now sued Hank, Hilda, and Bank. The theory of the lawsuit
is that Lumber Sellers is a third-party beneficiary of (1) the loan agreement between
Hank, Hilda, and the Bank; (2) the construction contract between Hank, Hilda, and
Builders, or (3) both. What result and why?

Problem 27.2

         You have just passed the Bar Exam for the state of Catatonic and are in the
process of joining a small firm that has hired you to develop a practice in the area of
wills and estate planning. Unlike Oregon and Texas, Catatonic has never addressed
the precise issue of whether the beneficiary of an estate plan can bring a third-party
breach of contract claim against the attorney who drafted the will. The Catatonic
Supreme Court has, in another factual setting, however, adopted section 302 of the
Restatement (Second) of Contracts.

         Draft a clause to include in your standard contract between "Lawyer" and
"Client" that (hopefully) will prevent beneficiaries from being able to sue your firm
for breach of contract. Remember that this clause is one that prospective clients will
read and you might have to defend in person on the witness stand when you are sued
by disappointed beneficiaries. In other words, seek to avoid potential liability but
don't do so in a manner that would run off clients or offend a future jury. (If this seems
like a grim request, keep in mind that a key task of transactional lawyers is to
imagine worst case scenarios and come up with ways to prevent them from
happening.)

586  CHAPTER IX: CONTRACT NONPARTIES
Problem 27.3

         Brandon Starr was signed by Tantamount Pictures to appear as the action hero
lead in its upcoming high-budget film, Raiders of the Lost Jurassic Park. The contract
between Starr and Tantamount requires Starr to procure and maintain a $2 million
life and disability insurance policy payable to Tantamount in the event that Starr is
unable to fulfil his obligations to appear in the movie. Starr did indeed take out the
required policy with Casualty Insurance Company and made the premium payments
for the first four months, but he then missed the following two months. Casualty
Insurance sent numerous notices to Starr informing him that if he failed to make a
premium payment for a total of 90 days, the policy would, per its express terms, be
cancelled and not subject to reinstatement. On the 93rd day since Starr's first missed
payment, he was tragically killed when his automobile careened off the side of a
coastal cliff.

         (a) Tantamount Pictures promptly sent a notice of claim to Casualty Insurance,
which denied coverage based on the lapse of the policy. Tantamount argued that its
rights were established by its contract with Starr and were unaffected by Starr's
separate failure to make premium payments. What result and why?

         (b) Same facts as part (a), except the insurance policy in question is subject to
a state insurance statute that requires insurers to reinstate policies up to 120 days
since the original missed payment, provided that the policyholder makes the
premium payments current. What result if Tantamount Pictures tenders payment
within the 120 day period?

         Be sure that you consider Restatement (Second) of Contracts section 309 in
connection with this problem.

Problem 27.4

         Think back to the In re Baby M case at the beginning of the course (Units 1
and 2). In the Unit 2 materials, the New Jersey Supreme Court ultimately held that
the surrogacy agreement between Mary Beth Whitehead (the surrogate mother) and
William Stern was unenforceable on public policy grounds. Imagine instead that the
contract actually was enforceable, just like the trial court decided at the beginning of
Unit 2. In that situation, would William Stern's wife, Elizabeth Stern--who was not
a party to the surrogacy contract--qualify as a third-party beneficiary? Why or why
not?

Assignment and Delegation

                                           FOCUS OF THIS UNIT

         The nonparties we considered in the previous unit--third-party beneficiaries--
can gain rights under contract law based largely on the original intent of the parties
to the contract. They are parties in their own right from the day the contract is
formed. This unit deals with a very different situation: where nonparties take over
the rights and duties of contracting parties after the inception of the contract. An
example may help explain what we mean here.

         A Simple Contract. Suppose that builder Burge has contracted with Snyder to
build a department store, Snyder's Shop-a-Rama, in exchange for $1 million. Under
this contract, Snyder has the right to performance from Burge--construction of the
store. Likewise, Burge has the right to Snyder's performance--payment of the $1
million. Each party's contract rights to the other's performance under these facts also
create corresponding duties.1 Thus, we can equally say that Burge has a legal duty to
build the department store for Snyder, while Snyder has a legal duty to pay Burge $1
million. In a bilateral contract like this example, both sides have rights the
performance of another (which are legal benefits) and duties to perform (which are
legal detriments).

         Passing Along Rights and Duties. With these rights and duties in mind,
consider the possibility that the parties may want to move them around. In your
Property course, you have likely heard of the "bundle of sticks" approach to property
rights, in which various sticks from the bundle can be removed and transferred.
Contract rights are a form of property. What if Snyder decides that he, in fact, does
not want to own or run a department store, but he has heard that Williston would be

1 [One or more of your first-year professors may have introduced you to the idea that all legal

duties have reciprocal rights, and vice versa. Thus, my right to build a fence on my property implies

your duty not to tear down that fence; your duty to pay me money implies my right to get it, and so on.

These were dubbed "jural correlatives" by Professor Hohfeld and have had a great deal of influence,

particularly in property and tort law. See, e.g., Wesley Newcomb Hohfeld, Fundamental Legal

Conceptions as Applied in Judicial Reasoning, 26 YALE L.J. 710 (1917).--Eds.]

interested in jumping into such a business venture? Can Snyder and Willison agree
to substitute Williston into Snyder's place in the original contract? Or suppose Burge
has decided to exit the construction business, so he arranges for Corbin to build
Snyder's department store for him. Neither Snyder or Burge may have a particular
objection--Williston may have better credit and Corbin may be a better construction
company--but what if one of the original parties objects? Does that party still have
the right to transfer its rights and duties?

         Getting the Vocabulary Right. The law of assignment and delegation is where
we find the answers to these questions, but exploring that law requires
understanding some terminology. Contract rights (the benefits) are assigned, while
contract duties (the obligations) are delegated. Attorneys sometimes lump
assignment and delegation together and refer to both concepts as assignment, but
doing so is incorrect. Indeed, this kind of imprecision that can get a transactional
lawyer in trouble. Suppose the Snyder-Burge contract says that "Burge may the
assign the contract to another builder"--that provision arguably means that Burge
can transfer his benefit ("assign"), but cannot transfer his obligation ("delegate").
Snyder may be indifferent about who gets the money he pays Burge, but may have a
strong objection to having someone else do the work, especially if he selected Burge
because of the latter's special skill and expertise.

         The original contracting party who makes an assignment is known as an
assignor, while the nonparty who receives the assignor's rights is called the assignee.
Where duties are delegated, the original contracting party is called the delegator
while the nonparty who takes on the delegator's duties under the contract is called
the delegatee.2

         The Basic Rules. The general rules are pretty simple. (1) Contractual benefits
may be assigned, and contract obligations may be delegated, except sometimes when
they cannot. (2) Both assignment and delegation may be limited or prohibited by the
parties' agreement, except when such limits or prohibitions are not effective. Fleshing
out the exceptions to these general rules is the main challenge. The basic rules on
assignments are found in section 317 of the Restatement (Second) of Contracts, while
those on delegation are in section 318. Article 2 of the UCC has its own rules for sale-
of-goods contracts in section 2-210. Some of the UCC's approach to interpretation of
assignment and delegation provisions is also reflected in section 322 of the
Restatement. You should look at those sections as you read the cases in this unit.
Interestingly, the CISG has no rules of its own on the topic, which means if you are
working in international sales transactions you may find yourself using the domestic

     2 [We're not terribly fond of all these "-or" and "-ee" terms, as they can be a recipe for confusion

and errors in contract drafting. (Practice tip: When drafting contracts, use the parties' names, or some

functional terms like "buyer" and "seller" instead whenever possible.) Nonetheless, you need to

recognize these sort of terms as they frequently appear in both transactional documents and court

opinions. -Eds.]

                                      BURNISON v. JOHNSTON
                                       Supreme Court of Nebraska
                              277 Neb. 622, 764 N.W.2d 96 (Neb. 2009)

CONNOLLY, J.

         We are asked to decide whether a law firm can assign its right to collect unpaid
legal fees. The law firm assigned its claim to the appellant, Mary Burnison. Burnison
filed an action seeking recovery of the fees from the appellee, Kathleen Johnston, and
in response, Johnston raised several defenses. After trial, the district court dismissed
Burnison's claims because it concluded that she lacked standing to bring the action.
The court reasoned that the law firm had impermissibly assigned personal legal
services. We conclude that public policy does not bar assignment of a right to collect
unpaid legal fees.

         Since 1994, the law firm Martin & Martin, P.C., had provided legal services to
Johnston and her husband regarding their real estate holdings. In October 2001, the
firm assigned to Burnison "all right, title, and interest in any cause of action arising
from legal services that MARTIN & MARTIN, P.C. rendered to . . . Johnston[,] at her
request from May 1, 1996 through February 25, 1998."3

         Burnison filed a complaint against Johnston, seeking recovery of unpaid legal
fees for services provided by the assignor. She alleged breach of oral contract and
quantum meruit theories of recovery. Burnison alleged that (1) the firm had
performed legal services for Johnston in 1996 and 1997; (2) she only sporadically paid
for some of these services; and (3) despite demand for payment, she owed $76,323 in
legal fees and $32,918 in interest.

         In her answer, Johnston denied that Burnison was the real party in interest
or that any contract existed between her and the firm. Her answer included a litany
of affirmative offenses. She alleged that (1) the firm's services were provided for
another party; (2) the claims for payment resulted from fraud; and (3) the statute of

3 [You might wonder why the law firm would assign the right to Burnison. Although the court

does not actually state the reason, the likelihood is that this was a delinquent account that the firm

sold (at a discounted price) to a debt collector. The entire debt collection industry relies on the fact that

creditors can assign their rights to collect money for goods or services already received.--Eds.]

UNIT 28: ASSIGNMENT AND DELEGATION                                                                 591
limitations barred the claims. She admitted that the firm had performed work for
her. But she alleged that (1) its legal work violated the law and ethical standards for
attorneys; (2) its performance was contrary to the standard of professional care for
attorneys in Nebraska; and (3) the firm "fraudulently performed" because the
attorneys had advised her to take actions that were illegal and which subjected her
to legal liability and loss of property. She also alleged that the firm had fraudulently
listed charges and payment on her account to defeat the statute of limitations.

         At trial, the parties stipulated that the firm's hourly rate was fair. But
Johnston disputed whether the firm provided services for her and whether the
services were of any value to her. In addition, she contended that some of the
assignor's actions were unethical, which she alleged precluded the assignee's recovery
of unpaid legal fees.

         In its order, the court concluded that Burnison lacked standing as an assignee
to seek recovery of the unpaid legal fees. It ruled that the assignment upon which she
relied was an improper attempt to assign personal legal services. It reasoned that the
language in the firm's assignment to Burnison was too broad because it assigned a
cause of action instead of an unpaid fee.

         Burnison contends that Nebraska law permits an assignment of a claim for
unpaid legal fees and that our cases on the nonassignability of malpractice claims are
not controlling. She argues that none of the public policy considerations that prohibit
the assignment of legal malpractice claims are present when an attorney assigns a
claim to collect unpaid legal fees for services already provided. She distinguishes a
legal malpractice claim as a tort action resting on the attorney's personal fiduciary
duty to provide professional services to a client. She argues that in contrast to a
malpractice claim, a claim to collect unpaid legal fees is a contract action that does
not involve a duty to provide personal services. In brief, she argues that "the duty to
professionally provide legal services is personal; the duty to pay for that service which
has already been performed is not."

         At the outset, we note that a likely stumbling block here was the failure of our
case law to consistently use the proper terminology to discuss the transfer of
contractual rights and duties. Unless a party transfers both its rights and its duties
under a contract, it is important to distinguish between the assignment of contractual
rights and the delegation of performance of a duty. See Restatement (Second) of
Contracts §§ 317 & 318 (1981);4 3 E. ALLAN FARNSWORTH, FARNSWORTH ON

     4 [Section 317 Assignment of a Right

     (1) An assignment of a right is a manifestation of the assignor's intention to transfer

     it by virtue of which the assignor's right to performance by the obligor is extinguished in

     whole or in part and the assignee acquires a right to such performance.

     (2) A contractual right can be assigned unless

     (a) the substitution of a right of the assignee for the right of the assignor

     would materially change the duty of the obligor, or materially increase the burden or

CONTRACTS § 11.1 (3d ed. 2004). Although the court stated that the firm had
impermissibly attempted to assign personal legal services, it apparently meant that
the firm had impermissibly attempted to delegate performance of its duty to provide
legal services.

         But this case does not involve delegation of performance of a duty under a
contract for personal services. And Johnston admits that the firm did not delegate
any obligation to perform legal services for her. We conclude that the district court
erred in finding that the firm had attempted to delegate performance of its duty to
provide legal services. Here, the firm assigned only its contractual right to receive
Johnston's payment for services rendered. But Johnston argues that public policy
prohibited the firm's assignment and that we should therefore affirm the court's
judgment even if its reasoning was incorrect.

         We have held that a contractual right to the benefit of a promise cannot be
assigned if the obligor reasonably intended for the right to be exercised only by the
party with whom it contracted. The rule usually applies when a promise involves a
relationship of personal trust or confidence or the obligor has expectations of
counterperformance. See Schupack v. McDonald's System, Inc., 264 N.W.2d 827 (Neb.
1978). See also 29 SAMUEL WILLISTON, A TREATISE ON THE LAW OF CONTRACTS § 74:10
(Richard A. Lord ed., 4th ed. 2003). Otherwise, contractual rights are generally
assignable unless the terms validly preclude assignment or the assignment is
contrary to statute or public policy. Accord Rest. 2d § 317; WILLISTON, supra.

         In Peterson v. Hynes, 371 N.W.2d 664 (Neb. 1985), we affirmed a party's right
to assign a claim for unpaid fees under a contract to provide personal services. There,
the buyers of stock in a bank holding company promised in an addendum to the
purchase agreement that they would hire the sellers as consultants and pay them
specified fees for a defined period. But the buyers never allowed the sellers to provide
consulting services and paid them only a fraction of the promised fees. The sellers

risk imposed on him by his contract, or materially impair his chance of obtaining
return performance, or materially reduce its value to him, or

          (b) the assignment is forbidden by statute or is otherwise inoperative on
grounds of public policy, or

          (c) assignment is validly precluded by contract.

Section 318 Delegation of Performance of Duty

(1) An obligor can properly delegate the performance of his duty to another unless the

delegation is contrary to public policy or the terms of his promise.

(2) Unless otherwise agreed, a promise requires performance by a particular person

only to the extent that the obligee has a substantial interest in having that person perform or

control the acts promised.

(3) Unless the obligee agrees otherwise, neither delegation of performance nor a

contract to assume the duty made with the obligor by the person delegated discharges any

duty or liability of the delegating obligor. -Eds.]

assigned their claim to recover the unpaid fees under the agreement. On appeal, the
buyers argued that they were not liable because the sellers could not assign their
contractual rights. We noted that the sellers had not delegated their obligation to
perform consulting services. We held that a right to receive money under a contract
may be assigned

         unless there is something in the terms of the contract manifesting the
         intention of the parties that it shall not be assigned. This is true of
         money due or to become due under a contract involving personal skill,
         service, or confidence; the party who has performed such obligations, or
         who has contracted to do so, may assign his right to the money earned
         or which he is to earn, although the contract itself is not assignable. 10

Id. at 577, 371 N.W.2d at 667 (quoting 6 AM. JUR. 2D Assignments § 16 (1963)). See
also Rest. 2d § 317, cmt d. Johnston acknowledges our holding in Peterson. But she
contends that the firm's assignment was against public policy. She argues that
Burnison must prove the value of the firm's services and its compliance with
professional responsibility requirements. Because she has malpractice defenses to
the firm's claim for unpaid fees, she argues that the same public policy concerns that
prohibit the assignment of attorney malpractice claims apply here. We disagree.

         Johnston cites no case holding that such an assignment violates public policy.
It is true that an assignee's rights are no greater than the assignor's and that
Burnison must prove the value of its services and compliance with professional
standards. And it is not uncommon for clients to allege counterclaims of legal
malpractice in response to actions to recover unpaid legal fees. But Johnston's
reliance on the public policy reasons for prohibiting the assignment of tort claims for
legal malpractice is misplaced. Assignments of malpractice claims are prohibited to
avoid undermining the duty of confidentiality and other professional duties that arise
from the client-attorney relationship. Those public policy concerns are not present
here.

         We conclude that public policy does not prohibit an attorney's assignment of a
claim for unpaid legal fees simply because a client might raise malpractice defenses.
Johnston's defenses against the assigned claim are not defenses against the
assignment itself and did not prevent Burnison from attempting to enforce her
interest.

         Accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the district court and remand the
cause with directions to the district court to make the necessary findings of fact and
conclusions of law and decide the remaining issues.

professional duties that arise from the client-attorney relationship. Those public
policy concerns are not present here." Why is Johnson not allowed to assign (i.e., sell)
her (tort) malpractice claim against the Martin & Martin law firm, but the firm is
allowed to assign and sell its (contract) claim against Johnson for unpaid legal fees?
Are the public policy concerns really that different, or is this simply a situation where
the law protects lawyers more than their clients?

                               133 Ga. App. 27, 209 S.E.2d 661 (1974).

BELL, Chief Judge.

         Air Conditioning and Heating Service Co., Inc., entered into a written contract
with Hicks for the installation of heating and air conditioning systems in an
apartment complex. The contract contained a clause prohibiting the assignment of
the contract, "or any part thereof" without the written consent of the other party. Air
Conditioning assigned to the plaintiff Mingledorff's a portion of the money due Air
Conditioning on the contract without the written consent of defendants. The trial
court granted defendants' motion for judgment on the pleadings.

         Plaintiff contends that the anti-assignment clause in issue is invalid.
[Georgia] Code Ann. § 85-1803 permits the assignment of choses in action5 arising on
a contract but it does not prohibit parties from providing that their contract shall not
be assignable. In Bewick Lumber Co. v. Hall, 21 S.E. 154 (Ga. 1894), it was held that
a credit check payable on demand was assignable in spite of language on the check
that it was not transferable, citing an earlier version of § 85-1803. However, in Cowart
v. Singletary, 79 S.E. 196 (Ga. 1913) it was noted that the instrument in Bewick was
not an executory contract containing mutual obligations and stated that subject to
certain modifications "the parties to an executory contract may in terms prohibit its
assignment, so that an assignee does not succeed to any rights in the contract by
virtue of the assignment." The contract here is clearly an executory one with mutual
obligations between the parties. While, as contended by plaintiff, it may have been
completely executed by plaintiff's assignor, this fact would not require a result
invalidating the anti-assignment clause. The nonassignment clause is valid and
enforceable. The provisions found in the Uniform Commercial Code, UCC §§ 2-210(2)
and 9-318(4), which nullify the effects of anti-assignment provisions, have no

application to this contract as it is not one for the sale of goods but is a contract for
services and labor with an incidental furnishing of equipment and materials.

         The contract provision is plain and unambiguous and is not subject to
interpretation or construction. It provided that the "subcontractor (plaintiff's
assignor) shall not sublet, assign or transfer this sub-contract, or any part thereof
without the written consent of the defendant." The phrase "or any part thereof" will
operate to preclude the limited assignment of a right under the contract, to wit:
Money due the plaintiff's assignor.

         Judgment affirmed.

         Review Question 2. The contract in Mingledorff's was a mixed sale of goods
and services that could plausibly have qualified as a Uniform Commercial Code sale
of goods. Suppose that, contrary to the outcome in the actual case, the contract in
Mingledorff's had been held to be a sale of goods governed by UCC § 2-210(2). Would
the outcome of the case have been different? Read the statute and explain why or why
not. Can you imagine any problems arising from "choses in action" being subject to
assignment by contracting parties?

     GILMORE v. SCI TEXAS FUNERAL SERVICES, INC.
                            Court of Appeals of Texas

                 234 S.W.3d 251 (Tex. App.--Waco 2007).

FELIPE REYNA, Justice.

         Pam Pickens, who was forty years' old, suffered a series of unexplained
seizures which caused her brain function to cease. She was removed from artificial
life support only days after she was admitted to the intensive care unit. Her mother
Jane Gilmore handled the funeral arrangements.

         Gilmore made the arrangements with Connally/Compton Funeral Home. The
Connally/Compton representative recommended the "Wilbert Way" to Gilmore, which
involves a ceremonial lowering of the casket into a vault and the sealing of the vault
at the conclusion of the graveside service. The Wilbert Way is a service provided by
the Wilbert Vault Company.

         At the graveside service, the pastor stepped aside after he finished a Scripture
reading, and two men approached the casket. One of them, Wilbert Vault employee
James Turner, attached a pair of vice grips to a lowering device and began lowering
the casket into the vault. Several witnesses testified that the lowering device emitted
a ratcheting sound which was described by Gilmore's husband as being similar to a

______________________________________________________________________________

596                                            CHAPTER IX: CONTRACT NONPARTIES
winch pulling a boat onto a trailer. As the casket was being lowered, there was a "big
boom," and the casket turned sideways and fell an unspecified distance to the bottom
of the vault. The casket was partially opened by the impact, Pam's arm was exposed,
and several mementos spilled out.

         According to the testimony, the peaceful setting suddenly broke into
pandemonium. Those in attendance scattered. There were screams. The pastor
noticed "a young girl laying out on the ground." According to the Connally/Compton
funeral director, "everyone was visibly upset." Several men righted the casket. The
pastor had others stand in a line between the vault and the seats to provide a shield
for those in attendance. At the funeral director's suggestion, the casket was opened,
Pam's body was repositioned, and the mementos were returned to the casket.

         Wilbert Vault had the lowering device taken to its offices in Grapevine "to
determine what had gone wrong with it." It was "determined that the device couldn't
be repaired," so Wilbert Vault discarded it with other scrap metal.

         Gilmore and the Pickenses filed suit against Connally/Compton and Wilbert
Vault alleging [multiple claims, including negligence and] breach of contract.

         At trial, the jury was charged on the breach of contract and negligence claims
as well as the joint-enterprise theory. The jury refused to find that Connally/Compton
breached its contract, that Connally/Compton and Wilbert Vault were engaged in a
joint enterprise, or that any negligence on Connally/Compton's part was a proximate
cause of the occurrence in question. The jury found that Wilbert Vault's negligence
was a proximate cause but also found that none of the plaintiffs suffered compensable
mental anguish.

         Appellants [contend] that the court abused its discretion by denying their
motion for new trial in which they argued that the jury's refusal to find that
Connally/Compton breached its contract is against the great weight and
preponderance of the evidence. Appellants argue in this regard that the primary
breach of contract is Connally/Compton's failure to provide the Wilbert Way as
contemplated by the parties' contract.

         Under the plain language of the written contract, Gilmore purchased a Wilbert
Venetian Vault and the "Dignity Heritage Memorial Package" from
Connally/Compton for Pam's burial. Although there is no express provision in the
contract regarding the purchase of the Wilbert Way, no one disputes that the
purchase of this particular vault and the Dignity Heritage Memorial Package
includes purchase of the Wilbert Way service. See Transcontinental Gas Pipeline
Corp. v. Texaco, Inc., 35 S.W.3d 658, 670 (Tex. App.--Houston [1st Dist.] 2000, pet.
denied) (trade usage is admissible to explain contract terms so long as it does not
contradict express terms of contract); see also Tex. Bus. & Com. Code Ann. § 1.303(c)
(Vernon Supp. 2006), § 2.202(1) (Vernon 1994).

UNIT 28: ASSIGNMENT AND DELEGATION  597
         A breach of contract has been defined as "a failure, without legal excuse, to
perform any promise that forms the whole or part of a contract." 23 SAMUEL
WILLISTON & RICHARD A. LORD, A TREATISE ON THE LAW OF CONTRACTS § 63:1 (4th
ed.2002) (emphasis added); accord Crim Truck & Tractor Co. v. Navistar Int'l Transp.
Corp., 823 S.W.2d 591, 597 (Tex.1992) ("the failure to perform the terms of a contract
is a breach of contract").

         Connally/Compton argues that the failure of the lowering device does not
constitute a breach of the parties' contract on its part because Wilbert Vault and not
Connally/Compton was responsible for the lowering device. We disagree. Section
318(3) of the Restatement (Second) of Contracts provides:

         Unless the obligee agrees otherwise, neither delegation of performance
         nor a contract to assume the duty made with the obligor by the person
         delegated discharges any duty or liability of the delegating obligor.

Restatement (Second) of Contracts § 318(3) (1981).

         Connally/Compton also suggests that Appellants suffered no contract damages
from this breach because Connally/Compton wrote off the $8,878 which Gilmore still
owed. We likewise reject this assertion. Even assuming a jury determined that
Gilmore suffered no actual pecuniary loss, she would at minimum be entitled to
nominal damages.

         It is undisputed that Pam's graveside service did not conclude with a
ceremonial lowering via the Wilbert Way as contemplated by the contract. There is
no evidence in the record that Gilmore agreed to discharge Connally/Compton from
this obligation, notwithstanding Connally/Compton's delegation of this duty to
Wilbert Vault. See Honeycutt, 992 S.W.2d at 579; Restatement (Second) of Contracts
§ 318(3). Therefore, the jury's refusal to find a breach of contract "is so against the
great weight and preponderance of the evidence that it is clearly wrong and unjust."
Dow Chem. Co., 46 S.W.3d at 242.

         For the foregoing reasons, we sustain Appellants' first issue [and reverse] in
part[.]

                                           _____________________

         Review Question 3. The Gilmore opinion expressly raises the possibility that
Connally/Compton Funeral Home could have obtained consent from Gilmore
discharging the funeral home's responsibility as to the duties that were delegated to
Wilbert Vault. Assuming that such consent language would become part of the so-
called "fine print" of a standard form contract, should such standardized consent be
what determines the outcome?

                                    Supreme Court of North Dakota.

                                        491 N.W.2d 71 (N.D. 1992)

ERICKSTAD, Chief Justice.

         Harold Rosenberg and Gladys E. Rosenberg (Rosenbergs) appeal two district
court decisions granting summary judgment in favor of Son, Inc., and Mary Pratt. We
reverse and remand for further proceedings.

         On February 8, 1980, Pratt entered into a contract for the sale of a business
with the Rosenbergs, agreeing to purchase the Rosenbergs' Dairy Queen located in
the City Center Mall in Grand Forks. The terms of the sales contract for the franchise,
inventory, and equipment were a purchase price totaling $62,000, a $10,000 down
payment, and $52,000 due in quarterly payments at 10 percent interest over a 15-
year-period. The sales contract also contained a provision denying the buyer a right
to prepayment for the first five years of the contract.

         Mary Pratt assigned her rights and delegated her duties under the sales
contract to Son, Inc., on October 1, 1982.6 The assignment agreement contained a
"Consent To Assignment" clause which was signed by the Rosenbergs on October 14,
1982.7 The assignment agreement also included a "save harmless" clause in which
Son, Inc., promised to indemnify Pratt.8 Subsequent to this transaction, Mary Pratt

          6 [By the court] The term "assign" is normally associated with a party's rights under a contract
(i.e., getting paid, receiving goods); whereas the term "delegate" is associated with a party's duties
under a contract (i.e., making a payment, performing a service). However, it is a common practice to
call the assigning of rights and delegating of duties merely an "assignment of contract." This is
especially true when language such as "all right, title and interest" is used. This was the exact
language contained in the assignment agreement between Pratt and Son, Inc., and also in the
assignment agreement between Son, Inc., and Merit Corporation (to be discussed later).

An assignment of `the contract' or of `all my rights under the contract' or an assignment in
similar general terms is an assignment of rights and unless the language or the circumstances
(as in an assignment for security) indicate the contrary, it is a delegation of performance of the
duties of the assignor and its acceptance by the assignee constitutes a promise by him to
perform those duties. This promise is enforceable by either the assignor or the other party to
the original contract.

Section 41-02-17(4), N.D.C.C. See also 67 AM. JUR. 2D Sales § 383, at 650. Thus, the assignment
agreements in this case not only assigned rights, they also delegated duties to the assignees.

          7 [By the court] The language of the consent clause was very brief and direct. In full, it read:
"The undersigned, Harold Rosenberg and Gladys E. Rosenberg, sellers in the above described Contract
of Sale, do hereby consent to the above assignment."

8 [By the court] The indemnification clause reads as follows:

______________________________________________________________________________

UNIT 28: ASSIGNMENT AND DELEGATION                             599
moved to Arizona and had no further knowledge of, or involvement with, the Dairy
Queen business. Also following the assignment, the Dairy Queen was moved from the
City Center Mall to the corner of DeMers and North Fifth Street in Grand Forks.

         The sales contract was then assigned by Son, Inc., to Merit Corporation (Merit)
on June 1, 1984. This assignment agreement did not contain a consent clause for the
Rosenbergs to sign. However, the Rosenbergs had knowledge of the assignment and
apparently acquiesced. They accepted a large prepayment from Merit, reducing the
principal balance due to $25,000. Following this assignment, Merit pledged the
inventory and equipment of the Dairy Queen as collateral for a loan from Valley Bank
and Trust of Grand Forks.

         Payments from Merit to the Rosenbergs continued until June of 1988, at which
time the payments ceased, leaving an unpaid principal balance of $17,326.24 plus
interest. The Rosenbergs attempted collection of the balance from Merit, but the
collection efforts were precluded when Merit filed bankruptcy. The business assets
pledged as collateral for the loan from Valley Bank and Trust of Grand Forks were
repossessed. The Rosenbergs brought this action for collection of the outstanding debt
against Son, Inc., and Mary Pratt.

         It is a well-established principle in the law of contracts that a contracting party
cannot escape its liability on the contract by merely assigning its duties and rights
under the contract to a third party. This principle is codified in [UCC § 2-210(1)]:

         Delegation of performance; Assignment of rights.

         (1) A party may perform his duty through a delegate unless
                  otherwise agreed or unless the other party has a substantial
                  interest in having his original promisor perform or control the
                  acts required by the contract. No delegation of performance
                  relieves the party delegating of any duty to perform or any liability
                  for breach.

(emphasis added).

         Professor Corbin explained this point succinctly in his treatise on contract law.

         An assignment is an expression of intention by the assignor that his
         duty shall immediately pass to the assignee. Many a debtor wishes that
         by such an expression he could get rid of his debts. Any debtor can

     And the said party of the second part [Son, Inc.] covenants and agrees to and with the said
     party of the first part [Pratt] that the said party of the second part will pay the said purchase
     price and will observe and perform all the terms, conditions and stipulations in the said
     agreement mentioned which are thereunder by the said party of the first part to be observed
     and performed, and will save harmless and keep indemnified the said party of the first part
     against all claims, demands and actions by reason of the failure of the said party of the second
     part to observe and perform the said agreement.

______________________________________________________________________________

600  CHAPTER IX: CONTRACT NONPARTIES
         express such an intention, but it is not operative to produce such a
         hoped-for result. It does not cause society to relax its compulsion against
         him and direct it toward the assignee as his substitute. In spite of such
         an `assignment,' the debtor's duty remains absolutely unchanged. The
         performance required by a duty can often be delegated; but by such a
         delegation the duty itself is not escaped.

4 CORBIN ON CONTRACTS § 866 at 452.

         This rule of law applies to all categories of contracts, including contracts for
the sale or lease of real property, service contracts, and contracts for the sale of goods,
which is present in the facts of this case.

         In the case of a contract for the sale of goods, the assignment and
         delegation may be by the buyer as well as by the seller. The buyer's
         assignment of his right to the goods and his delegation of the duty to pay
         the price are both effective; but he himself remains bound to pay the
         price just as before. If the assignee contracts with the assignor to pay
         the price, the seller can maintain suit for the price against the assignee
         also, as a creditor beneficiary of the assumption contract; the seller has
         merely obtained a new and additional security.

Id. at 454-455 (emphasis added) (footnotes omitted).

         Thus, when Pratt entered into the "assignment agreement" with Son, Inc., a
simple assignment alone was insufficient to release her from any further liability on
the contract. See Jedco Development Co., Inc. v. Bertsch, 441 N.W.2d 664 (N.D.1989)
(lessee is not relieved of this obligation to pay rent merely because he had assigned
lease with lessor's consent absent a novation); Brooks v. Hayes, 133 Wis. 2d 228, 395
N.W.2d 167 (1986) (party delegating duties under contract is not relieved of
responsibility for fulfilling an obligation or liability in the event of a breach). See also
Restatement (Second) of Contracts § 318; 6A C.J.S. Assignments § 97 at 753; 6 AM.
JUR. 2D Assignments § 110; 67 AM. JUR. 2D Sales § 383, at 649.

         It is not, however, a legal impossibility for a contracting party to rid itself of an
obligation under a contract. It may seek the approval of the other original party for
release, and substitute a new party in its place. In such an instance, the transaction
is no longer called an assignment; instead, it is called a novation. If a novation occurs
in this manner, it must be clear from the terms of the agreement that a novation is
intended by all parties involved. "An obligor is discharged by the substitution of a
new obligor only if the contract so provides or if the obligee makes a binding
manifestation of assent, forming a novation." Restatement (Second) of Contracts §
318 cmt. d. Therefore, both original parties to the contract must intend and mutually
assent to the discharge of the obligor from any further liability on the original
contract.

______________________________________________________________________________

UNIT 28: ASSIGNMENT AND DELEGATION  601
         It is evident from the express language of the assignment agreement between
Pratt and Son, Inc., that only an assignment was intended, not a novation. The
agreement made no mention of discharging Pratt from any further liability on the
contract. To the contrary, the latter part of the agreement contained an indemnity
clause holding Pratt harmless in the event of a breach by Son, Inc. Thus, it is
apparent that Pratt contemplated being held ultimately responsible for performance
of the obligation.

         Furthermore, the agreement was between Pratt and Son, Inc.; they were the
parties signing the agreement, not the Rosenbergs. An agreement between Pratt and
Son, Inc., cannot unilaterally affect the Rosenbergs' rights under the contract.

         As mentioned earlier, the Rosenbergs did sign a consent to the assignment at
the bottom of the agreement. However, by merely consenting to the assignment, the
Rosenbergs did not consent to a discharge of the principal obligor--Pratt. Nothing in
the language of the consent clause supports such an allegation. A creditor is free to
consent to an assignment without releasing the original obligor.

         Where the obligee consents to the delegation, the consent itself does not
         release the obligor from liability for breach of contract. More than the
         obligee's consent to a delegation of performance is needed to release the
         obligor from liability for breach of contract. For the obligor to be released
         from liability, the obligee must agree to the release. If there is an
         agreement between the obligor, obligee and a third party by which the
         third party agrees to be substituted for the obligor and the obligee
         assents thereto, the obligor is released from liability and the third
         person takes the place of the obligor. Such an agreement is known as a
         novation.

Brooks v. Hayes, 395 N.W.2d at 174. See also Jedco Development Co., Inc. v. Bertsch,
441 N.W.2d at 666 ("a lessee is not relieved of his obligation to pay rent merely
because he has assigned the lease with the lessor's consent ... rather, the lessor must
intend to release the lessee"). Thus, the express language of the agreement and intent
of the parties at the time the assignment was made did not contemplate a novation
by releasing Pratt and substituting Son, Inc., in her stead.

         As stressed above, a party assigning its rights and delegating its duties is still
a party to the original contract. An assignment will not extinguish the relationship
and obligations between the two original contracting parties. However, an
assignment does result in the assignor having a surety relationship, albeit
involuntary, with the assignee, but not with the other original contracting party.

         A common instance of involuntary suretyship, at least as between the
         principal and surety themselves, occurs where one party to a contract
         [Son, Inc.], as a part of the agreement, assumes an indebtedness owing
         by the other [Pratt] to a third person [the Rosenbergs], the one assuming

______________________________________________________________________________

602  CHAPTER IX: CONTRACT NONPARTIES
         the indebtedness becoming the principal [Son, Inc.], and the former
         debtor a surety [Pratt].

72 C.J.S. Principal and Surety § 35 (emphasis added). Therefore, in the present facts,
Pratt enjoyed a surety position as to Son, Inc., but remained a principal on the
contract with the Rosenbergs.

         The inquiry as to Pratt's liability does not end at this juncture. Pursuant to
guaranty law, the trial court released Pratt from any liability on the contract due to
the changes or alterations which took place following her assignment to Son, Inc.
While it is true that Pratt cannot be forced to answer on the contract irrespective of
events occurring subsequent to her assignment, it is also true that she cannot be
exonerated for every type of alteration or change that may develop.

         The buyer can assign his right to the goods or land and can delegate
         performance of his duty to pay the price. He himself remains bound as
         before by his duty to pay that price. But observe that he remains bound
         `as before'; the assignee and the seller cannot, by agreement or by
         waiver, make it the assignor's duty to pay a different price or on different
         conditions. If the seller is willing to make such a change, he must trust
         to the assignee alone. It has been held that, if a tender of delivery by a
         certain time is a condition precedent to the buyer's duty to pay, the
         assignee of the buyer has no power to waive this condition, and
         substantial delay by the seller will prevent his getting judgment against
         the assignor for the price. If the assignee has contracted to pay the price,
         his waiver of the condition will be effective in a suit against him, but it
         will not be allowed to prejudice the position of the assignor, who now
         occupies substantially the position of surety.

4 CORBIN ON CONTRACTS § 866, at 458-459 (emphasis added) (footnotes omitted).

         The trial court decided pursuant to guaranty statutes, Section 22-01-15,
N.D.C.C., and case law, Tri-Continental Leasing Corp. v. Gunter, 472 N.W.2d 437,
that any alteration in the underlying obligation resulted in a release of Pratt on the
contract. It appears that an assignor occupies a much different position from that of
a guarantor; not every type of alteration is sufficient to warrant discharge of the
assignor. As suggested by Professor Corbin in the language highlighted above, the
alteration must "prejudice the position of the assignor." 4 CORBIN ON CONTRACTS §
866, at 459.

         Accordingly, unless the other contracting party has consented to release
         him, the assignor remains bound by his obligations under the contract
         and is liable to the other party if the assignee defaults,.... However, the
         assignor is responsible only for the obligation which he originally

         knowledge, increase the burden.

         If the changes in the obligation prejudicially affect the assignor, a new
agreement has been formed between the assignee and the other original contracting
party. More concisely, a novation has occurred and the assignor's original obligation
has been discharged. In reversing and remanding in Jedco, we said:

         We cannot determine as a matter of law that the assignment was
         intended to be a novation which resulted in a release of [the assignor's]
         liability under the lease. Because there are different inferences to be
         drawn from the undisputed facts, reasonable persons could draw more
         than one conclusion in this case. Therefore, the summary judgment is
         reversed and the case is remanded for further proceedings.

441 N.W.2d at 668. We must do the same in this case. Thus, we reverse the summary
judgment and remand for further proceedings.

         Review Question 4. "An assignment will not extinguish the relationship and
obligations between the two original contracting parties." says the Rosenberg court.
"However, an assignment does result in the assignor having a surety relationship,
albeit involuntary, with the assignee, but not with the other original contracting
party." What exactly is a surety relationship? What is the difference between the legal
relationship the Rosenbergs have with Mary Pratt and the legal relationship the
Rosenbergs have with Son, Inc.?

         Review Question 5. Assume that you are Mary Pratt's transactional lawyer
during all of the assignments and delegations that occurred in Rosenberg v. Son, Inc.
What would you advise your client to do differently as compared to what she did (or
did not) do in the actual case?

              Problems

Problem 28.1

         Carla Customer wanted some landscape work done at her home. She got a bid
for $15,000 from Ace Garden Service, a well-established and very highly rated firm
with a stellar reputation. She also received a bid of $10,000, from Deuce Contractors,
a smaller entity with s number of bad online reviews. She signed a contract with Ace,
primarily because of its exceptional reputation. She was thus surprised when the
crew that showed up to do the work came from Deuce Contractors, who told her they

had been delegated the work by Ace. Carla objected, but Ace told her that there was
no restriction on its delegation of duties under the contract. Carla wants to back out
of the contract with Ace. Does she have to accept the work from Deuce? If Carla finds
the work to be of insufficient quality, to whom can she complain?

Problem 28.2

         Rock musician Ice Scream contracted with Concert Promoter, Inc. to headline
its Fourth of July "Freedom in the Park" all-day concert. On June 1, however, Mr.
Scream was approached by representatives of the United Nations who asked him to
become a celebrity "Peace Ambassador" and tour formerly war-torn regions to raise
awareness of UN relief programs. In a rare (for him, at least) moment of quiet
introspection, Mr. Scream decided that "making a difference" was more important
than fulfilling his contract, so he contacted former bandmate Banan Asplit and asked
him to take over the concert gig. Asplit was about as famous as Scream, and they had
fairly similar audience profiles.

         a. Concert Promoter was not happy with this turn of events. He demanded that
Scream perform. Would Scream be in breach of contract if he continued to refuse to
perform? Why or why not?

         b. Suppose instead that Promoter consented. Scream headed off on his Peace
Ambassador tour, but when the concert date rolled around, Asplit was a no-show,
much to the embarrassment of Concert Promoter, which had to provide refunds to
many angry concert-goers. Who is liable to Promoter--Scream, Asplit, or both?
Explain your answer.

Problem 28.3

         Olivia owns Purpleacre, a plot of land that is desirable for commercial
development (despite it being not being nearly as popular as Blackacre). On March 1,
Olivia signed a contract promising to convey Purpleacre to Ashton on June 1 for
$250,000, which Ashton paid up front. Because Olivia and Ashton wanted to save
money on legal fees, they found an employment contract on the internet and modified
it themselves until they were satisfied it would work as a real estate contract. Among
other provisions, the Olivia-and-Ashton contract contained language that expressly
"prohibits assignment of this contract by any party" and further provides that "any
assignment, delegation, or attempted assignment or delegation of any part of this
agreement is void ab initio."

         On April 1, Ashton and Becker signed a document entitled "Contractual
Assignment of Rights" in which Ashton sold to Becker in exchange for $300,000 "any
and all of Ashton's rights under that certain real estate contract with Olivia dated

______________________________________________________________________________

UNIT 28: ASSIGNMENT AND DELEGATION  605
March 1 for the conveyance of Purpleacre." Olivia was completely unaware of the
agreement between Ashton and Becker.

         When the June 1 closing date rolled around, Olivia announced that she did not
want to sell Purpleacre at all, and that she certainly would not sell it to Becker, with
whom she does not even have a contract. Olivia says that she is quite willing to refund
the $250,000 if she can figure out to whom she owes it. What result if Becker sues
Olivia, seeking a decree of specific performance requiring Olivia to convey Purpleacre
to him? Why? Be sure to consider Restatement (Second) of Contracts section 322 in
connection with your answer.
