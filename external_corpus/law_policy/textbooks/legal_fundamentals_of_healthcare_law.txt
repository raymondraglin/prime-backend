PART I

THE BUSINESS OF
MEDICINE

Introduction

Healthcare is a business that drives innovation and growth.
While most consider healthcare strictly in terms of physicians,
nurses, and patients, the business of healthcare needs careful
management to continue achieving its health-related mission.
The healthcare industry is different from others in some very
fundamental ways. The business side monitors the bottom
line, which directly affects the quality of patient care and the
7 | THE BUSINESS OF MEDICINE

cost of services. Therefore, the bottom line needs to be positive
to invest in equipment, technology, and competitive staff
compensation. Another definitive difference between
healthcare and other industries is that large segments of
healthcare are dominated by nonprofit providers, and
payments are made by third parties, including private insurers
and the government.

    Learning Objectives

           Describe the distinctive elements of health as
             a business enterprise

           Identify professional norms in healthcare
           Summarize the rise of for-profit medicine

             through the lens of specialty hospitals and
             hospice providers

Healthcare Priorities

Whether an organization is a for-profit or a non-profit entity,
it cannot stay in business if it is unable to generate income
                                                THE BUSINESS OF MEDICINE | 8

to keep the lights on and make payroll. Organizations must
balance financial solvency with the well-being of patients. In
healthcare, patients are the primary stakeholders. However,
one critical difference is the asymmetry of information, where
a patient may never have a complete understanding of their
medical condition or the costs associated with treatment. Trust
between the patient and provider is critical. The complex
patient-physician relationship creates a unique transaction
experience with few comparables.

A. For-Profit Hospitals

There are approximately 1,000 proprietary hospitals in the US
that provide short-term care. Almost half are owned by large
corporations that specialize in hospital management, while the
other half are owned by groups of private investors.
Proprietary hospitals are for-profit and characterized by having
250 beds or less and offering inpatient and outpatient services.
Most are located in small or medium towns, and virtually none
are found in states with strong commissions or certificate-of-
need policies. Proprietary hospitals are considered to have
more efficient management and use fewer employees per bed.
Patients in proprietary hospitals are typically not lower-income
or covered through Medicaid. Proprietary hospitals generally
have per diem rates comparable to voluntary hospitals;
however, ancillary charges are higher.

   The COVID-19 pandemic, as well as cost escalations related
9 | THE BUSINESS OF MEDICINE

to the nationwide shortage of nurses, resulted in inflating labor
costs. HCA Healthcare, one of the biggest operators of for-
profit healthcare facilities, manages an 182-hospital system
based in Nashville, TN. HCA reported $6.94 billion in
expenses tied to salaries and benefits in the first quarter of
2022, a 10.1 percent year-over-year increase (Ellison, 2022).

B. Proprietary Nursing Homes

                                         Nursing home residents
                                      account for one percent of
                                      the US population
                                      (Warraich, 2021). Several
                                      legislative changes were
                                      created during the
                                      COVID-19 pandemic to
                                      support the 36 percent
                                      increase in federal
                                      expenditures for healthcare
                                      expenses associated with the
                                      COVID response
                                      (Hartman et al., 2021). Due
to the lack of personal protective equipment (PPE) and
nursing-patient ratios, six studies showed that the risk of
infection and death from COVID-19 was significantly higher
in for-profit nursing homes (Warraich, 2021). Contrarily,
these studies also found that the quality of care improved
                                              THE BUSINESS OF MEDICINE | 10

when ownership changed to not-for-profit. Further
encouraging health disparities, these proprietary homes are
more likely to care for Black and Hispanic patients. While
many states began to lobby for legislation that protected
nursing homes from lawsuits during the pandemic, the
delivery of care began to suffer as for-profit nursing homes
received millions in government funding (Warraich, 2021).
Some unscrupulous practices ensued, with investors buying
nursing homes and then renting these spaces back to
operators with excessive management fees.

C. Home Health & Hospice Care

A variety of home services are provided by for-profit entities.
Services include nursing care, homemaking assistance,
respiratory therapy, occupational and physiotherapy, and
hospice care. These services generate a multi-billion-dollar
profit. Approximately half the total cost of home health care
is covered by Medicare. As Medicare and private third-party
coverage expand, the rapidly growing expenditures for care
continue to increase.

   Two-thirds of hospice providers in the US are for-profit.
Correspondingly, the cost of hospice care has increased while
the quality of care has decreased. The need for elderly care, like
patients with dementia, has increased convergence between
for-profit nursing homes and hospices. Over 20 percent of
nursing homes and hospice providers have common
11 | THE BUSINESS OF MEDICINE

ownership (Department of Health and Human Services,
2018). This relationship has increased the cost of care. While
many have been charged with fraud, many lobbyists are
recommending the elimination of immunity provisions
(Warraich, 2021).

   The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS,
2022a) issued updates to the Medicare payment policies and
rates for skilled nursing facilities under the Skilled Nursing
Facility Prospective Payment System (SNF PPS) for fiscal year
2023, which aims to ensure the safety of both nursing home
residents and staff and improve the quality of services. By
2025, $265 billion worth of care services for Medicare could
shift to the home (Bestsennyy et al., 2022).

D. Laboratory & Emergency Services

   The global laboratory
services market is expected
to grow 4.21% over the
forecast period, from
$365.690 billion in 2019 to
$468.249 billion by 2025
(CMS, 2022b). Almost a third of these laboratories are owned
by for-profit companies. Some operate laboratories in not-for-
profit hospitals as well. Other ancillary services sold by these
companies include cardiopulmonary testing, CAT scans,
industrial health screening, weight-control clinics, dental care,
                                               THE BUSINESS OF MEDICINE | 12

alcohol and drug programs, rehabilitation counseling, and
prepaid HMO programs. Two additional markets are
emergency room services and long-term hemodialysis for end-
stage renal disease.

   The Emergency Medical Treatment & Labor Act
(EMTALA) passed by Congress in 1986, ensures public access
to emergency services regardless of ability to pay. As part of
this legislation, Medicare-participating hospitals must offer
medical screening examinations for emergent medical
conditions such as active labor (CMS, 2022b). Combined
with the decline in general practice providers making house
calls, the dependency on emergency room visits has
skyrocketed over the past few decades. Additionally, third-
party payers reimburse at higher rates for emergency care than
the same care provided in a doctor's office. These actions
coalesce in an industry that specializes in emergency services.
Services can include the facility, emergency care packages, and
professional staffing. Locum tenens, temporary physicians
work in varying locations, allowing physicians and training
residents to provide medical services often without board
certification. The average hospitalist working 15 shifts a
month makes around $280K/year. Working 15 shifts/month
as a locum tenens hospitalist makes a minimum of $350K
annually (todayshospitlaist.com, 2023). While locum tenens
can relieve burnout or fill a temporary void left by departing
physicians, the costs are significantly higher. Several studies
have shown that there is limited empirical evidence to support
13 | THE BUSINESS OF MEDICINE

the assumptions about the quality and safety of locum practice
(Ferguson & Walshe, 2019). In other words, there appears to
be no greater risk of harm to patients when staffing is provided
by locum tenens. This is specifically important in rural areas
with physician staffing issues.

E. Hemodialysis

                                The Social Security Act

                                of 1972 was amended to

                                expand Medicare funding

                                for end-stage renal disease.

                                The number of patients

                                requiring dialysis has grown

Dialysis patient by Mishu57 CC  exponentially over the
BY-NC-SA Wikipedia              decades. According to the
                                National Institute of

Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Disease, nearly 786,000

Americans have end-stage renal disease, 71% are on dialysis,

and 29% will receive a kidney transplant (2023). As of August

2022, 89,931 people were on the waiting list for a kidney

transplant, while only 20,663 transplants had been performed,

according to the U.S. Organ Procurement and

Transplantation Network. Medicare spending per person for

those with chronic kidney disease was more than double the

amount for those without, according to the USRDS 2020

annual report.
                                               THE BUSINESS OF MEDICINE | 14

   The number of proprietary dialysis facilities has continued
to trend upward in parallel with the needs of patients. Free-
standing facilities typically have lower expenses in comparison
to dialysis units located in hospitals. Some proprietary
companies have expanded their services to include the sale of
dialysis equipment and supplies. The national dialysis market
is controlled by two for-profit organizations, one is DaVita,
which controls 37% of the market (Childers et al., 2019). US
kidney dialysis clinics form a profitable $24 billion industry,
with four large proprietary firms capturing more than 85% of
the revenues (LaRosa, 2019).

F. Technology

The new healthcare industry is expanding rapidly and is highly
profitable. The expansive nature of healthcare and the
displacement of patients during Hurricane Katrina sparked
a governmental push to increase the role of technology in
healthcare with the use of electronic medical records (EMR),
also called electronic health records (EHR). Two of the most
used companies in the US, Epic and Cerner, are cloud-based
software development companies with a large market share
across the healthcare industry. Epic covered almost 31%, and
Cerner held around 25% of the total EHR market share in
2020. Epic's revenue hit $3.8 billion in 2021 (Dyrda, 2022)
while Cerner's 2021 revenues pulled in $5.765 billion, up 5%
from 2020 (Jercich, 2022). Costs for technologies range from
15 | THE BUSINESS OF MEDICINE

$15K-$70K per provider. Electronic health records not only
improve efficiency but also increase the portability of medical
records and decrease medical errors, thereby improving patient
safety. Costs to consider include the purchase of the software
package subscription, implementation/development, ongoing
upgrades, and optimization. In addition to those costs are
expenses for IT personnel and provider training. Many of these
expenses were offset by Medicare and Medicaid EHR Incentive
Programs to promote interoperability between EHR systems.
Between 2011 and 2017, financial incentives were provided
to healthcare organizations through "Meaningful Use." As
US healthcare payments shifted from a "fee-for-service" model
to focus on quality outcomes, many payment models require
EHRs that are meaningful use compliant, further pushing the
requirements placed on technology that follows governmental
guidelines for interoperability.

Healthcare as a Private Business

Considering the aforementioned revenues generated from
healthcare combined with the growing complexity and need
for healthcare services, the healthcare industry is inevitably
attractive to businesses (Perry & Thompson 2017).
Healthcare's growing need for technology is a massive
investment of capital, which presents a problem for nonprofit
institutions. Private entrepreneurs come with the capital
needed to build and equip new hospitals, nursing homes, and
                                              THE BUSINESS OF MEDICINE | 16

laboratories and to start new healthcare businesses. With
profits ensured, consumers expect improved efficiency and
quality of healthcare. Two major differences in healthcare that
make it a unique market are the goods and consumers. Because
most people consider it a basic right, healthcare differs from
other businesses. Public funds pay for most of the research
needed to develop new medications and new medical
technology. Additionally, more US citizens are receiving tax-
supported medical care through Medicare and Medicaid and
other types of public programs. A second unique feature of
the healthcare market is that most consumers (i.e., patients) are
not "consumers" at all. Patients who are seriously ill do not
have the ability to "shop around" for the best price; therefore,
the laws of supply and demand do not apply the same to
healthcare. Assumptions about a competitive free market do
not apply to healthcare, considering the dependence of
patients on the judgment of the providers. Typically, the
healthcare expenditures are based on the decisions of
providers. Patients with lower health literacy were associated
with increased reports of poor physical functioning, pain,
limitations in daily activities, and poor mental health status.
All these special characteristics of the healthcare market
conspire to produce an atypical situation when a private
business enters the equation. A private corporation in the
healthcare business uses technology often developed at public
expense, and it sells services that most Americans regard as
their basic right but are heavily subsidized by public funds,
17 | THE BUSINESS OF MEDICINE

largely allocated through the decisions of physicians rather
than consumers, and almost entirely paid for through third-
party insurance (Perry & Thompson 2017). The possibilities
for abuse are obvious.

A. The Uninsured

Currently, 1 in 10 (approximately 8.0%) of Americans are
uninsured, according to the U.S. Census Bureau Household
Pulse Survey data from March 2022. While this percentage
has fallen from 10.5% since 2020, rates tend to be higher in
the Southern regions: Mississippi (14.4%), Texas (13.0%),
Oklahoma (12.4%), and Georgia (12.0%). Other large
disparities exist, with 13% of uninsured reported being
between the ages of 18 and 24, and the second largest
uninsured demographic being 11.8% between the ages of 25
and 39. Education was a large predictor of health insurance
status, with 20.9% of insureds reporting not having a high
school diploma. In contrast, only 3.3% with a bachelor's degree
or higher reported being uninsured (Festa, 2022). 17.0% of the
uninsured reported being Hispanic/Latino while 9.5% were
Black Americans. This stands in contrast to 6.0% of Asian
Americans and 5.4% of white Americans who reported being
uninsured. Two other large predictors of insurance status are
household size and income. Families with children under 18
(10.2% vs. 6.7% without children) and whose income was less
than $25K annually reported being uninsured more than
                                              THE BUSINESS OF MEDICINE | 18

individuals with higher income (7.0% under $60K annually,
2.4% at $100K annually) (Festa, 2022). Most Americans
obtain insurance through their employers, which further
complicated coverage during the COVID-19 pandemic when
many Americans (specifically Latinos) lost coverage. The
unregulated market approach in healthcare fails to resolve
social inequalities and injustices that arise when the market
fails to provide access to uninsured or underinsured patients.

B. Role of the Medical Professional

Because healthcare is a unique market for the aforementioned
reasons, the answer to overuse may fall on the medical provider
acting on behalf of the patients. Providers can help patients
navigate cost-effective options for treatment, pharmaceutical
discounts, and determine the necessity of each option. The
provider should shop for goods and services that are the most
cost-effective for the patients. Physicians should have no
economic conflict of interest when providing care; however,
physicians with proprietary hospitals and nursing homes,
diagnostic laboratories, dialysis units, and many small
companies represent the stockholders of these corporations.
19 | THE BUSINESS OF MEDICINE

Currently, there are no

principles adopted by the

American       Medical

Association's  (AMA)

Principles of Ethics

regarding the declaration of

physicians' financial interests. A statement about practicing

physicians deriving no financial benefit from the healthcare

market except their own professional services should become

part of the ethical code of the AMA. It would have no legal

force but would be accepted as a standard for the behavior of

practicing physicians throughout the country (Perry &

Thompson, 2017). In the Opinions and Reports of the

Judicial Council, it states that "It is not in itself unethical for a

physician to own a for-profit hospital or interest therein,"

confirming that there is nothing inherently improper in

physicians' owning or investing in healthcare businesses.

However, acting in their own financial interests by overusing

services or obtaining kickbacks and rebates would be

considered improper. This stance only addresses abuse and

ignores physicians' responsibilities to evaluate drugs, devices,

diagnostic tests, and therapeutic procedures in the public

interest. (Opinions and Reports, Section 4.40(2)). "If the

AMA took a strong stand against any financial interest of

physicians in healthcare businesses, it might risk an antitrust

suit," according to Perry & Thompson (2017). This is

specifically concerning when the physician is acting as the
                                              THE BUSINESS OF MEDICINE | 20

purchasing agent for the patient while the public pays the
majority of the bill.

Another critical problem emerging from the increasing
commercialization of healthcare is the so-called "cream-
skimming" phenomenon. Proprietary hospitals can
concentrate on providing the most profitable services to the
best-paying patients, thereby skimming the cream off the
market. According to Perry & Thompson (2017), this can be
achieved in two ways: the elimination of low-frequency and
unprofitable services and the exclusion of unprofitable patients
(e.g., uninsured patients or those with complex and chronic
illnesses). The not-for-profit healthcare facility could not
employ such practices. Another form of skimming in the
proprietary hospitals' is the lack of residency and other
training programs. To provide an adequate and up-to-date
range of experiences that are often expensive, large teaching
hospitals are obliged to maintain services that are not
necessarily economically viable.
The tendency of the profit-making sector to emphasize
procedures and technology that are heavily automated and
highly profitable, particularly when applied on a mass scale,
creates more issues. Combining the aforementioned with the
omission of relatively inefficient and unprofitable services,
regardless of medical or social need, leads to the exacerbation
of problems with excessive fragmentation of care and
overemphasis on expensive technology. One final concern is
21 | THE BUSINESS OF MEDICINE

that the private healthcare industry could hold powerful
political influence on national health policy, which could
hinder rather than facilitate rational debate on national
healthcare policy (Perry & Thompson, 2017).
When pondering the ethical connections between medicine
and business as well as policy and regulation, it is important to
consider the concept of autonomy. This notion that patients
are engaged in their healthcare decisions is foundational to
healthcare as well as health law and policy developments.
However, without appropriate access to healthcare, ethical
concerns over shared decision-making with one's physician
become moot.

Type of Healthcare Organization

Healthcare organizations are responsible for providing
patients with a wide range of services, including preventive
care, diagnosis, treatment, and rehabilitation. The specific
services that they offer and the populations that they serve can
vary widely.

   Hospitals: Hospitals are the most complex and
      comprehensive type of healthcare organization. They
      provide a wide range of services, including inpatient
      care, outpatient care, and emergency care.

   Clinics and medical offices: Clinics and medical offices
      are typically smaller than hospitals and offer a more
                                              THE BUSINESS OF MEDICINE | 22

      limited range of services. They may specialize in a
      particular area of medicine, such as primary care,
      pediatrics, or surgery.
   Nursing homes: Nursing homes provide care for
      people who need assistance with daily living activities.
      They may offer short-term or long-term care.
   Mental health and addiction treatment
      centers: Mental health and addiction treatment centers
      provide care for people with mental health disorders or
      substance abuse problems.
   Home health agencies: Home health agencies provide
      care to people who are unable to leave their homes for
      medical reasons. They may provide nursing care,
      physical therapy, or other services.
   Public health organizations: Public health
      organizations work to improve the health of the
      population as a whole. They may focus on prevention,
      education, or research.
   Health insurance companies: Health insurance
      companies provide financial protection for people who
      need medical care. They may reimburse patients for
      services or pay hospitals and other healthcare providers
      directly.

Now, let's take a closer look at the differences between for-
profit and not-for-profit healthcare systems and what
implications these differences have for the quality and
23 | THE BUSINESS OF MEDICINE

accessibility of healthcare.

A. For-Profit vs. Not-for-Profit

For-profit healthcare organizations are owned by investors and
shareholders (either public or private), whereas not-for-profit
organizations are managed by either a state or local
government entity. What does this mean exactly? Any profits
obtained by a for-profit entity can be distributed among
investors, who then pay income and property taxes. Not-for-
profits are legally obligated to invest any profits generated back
into the organization to benefit the community.

   Many patient advocates, labor unions, and bioethicists
believe that with this configuration, for-profit healthcare
providers' interests lie with shareholders and investors rather
than the patient. Some go further to accuse for-profit
providers of denying care to patients who are not insured or
have Medicaid (Perry & Thompson, 2017).

B. Physician-Owned Specialty
Hospitals

Physician-owned hospital means any hospital in which a
physician, or the immediate family member of a physician,
has an ownership or investment interest. These entities are
either partially or fully owned by physician-investors. They
also limit the number of services offered to only a few that
                                              THE BUSINESS OF MEDICINE | 24

provide high-profit margins, like cardiology, orthopedics, or
outpatient surgical procedures. These specialty hospitals
cherry-pick patients who are typically not severely ill. By
limiting access to healthier patients, costs are reduced in
relation to technology and personnel needed for treatment.
Additionally, the costs at these facilities are higher (Perry &
Thompson, 2017).

   It is important to note that healthcare legislation drives
trends in all areas of healthcare. Decades ago, drastic
reductions in Medicare reimbursements forced a mass exodus
to physician-owned specialty hospitals. Further exacerbating
these disgruntled departures was the dissatisfaction of
physicians with administrators and government bureaucrats.
Decreasing physicians' salaries fueled by profit motivation,
physician-owned specialty hospitals were propelled by the
physicians' frustrations concerning efforts to exercise control
of their clinical practices. In doing so, many physicians actively
pursued the more lucrative patient population for higher
profits; notably, there were fewer, if any, Medicaid patients.
This action ultimately resulted in damage to the healthcare
industry for both the system and the patients. Some private
health systems responded by destabilizing the threat of
administrators for physicians who remained affiliated with the
hospitals. Physicians referred their least costly and most
healthy patients to facilities in which they had an ownership
interest while sending the more complex cases to general
hospitals. However, many of these physician-owned specialty
25 | THE BUSINESS OF MEDICINE

hospitals were not in compliance with the Centers for
Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) Conditions of
Participation, including having an on-site emergency
department and patient safety standards. In March 2010,
Congress passed the largest legislative healthcare reform with
the Affordable Care Act (or Obamacare). A portion of this
legislation was dedicated to curbing the expansion of
physician-owned specialty hospitals (Perry & Thompson,
2017).

C. For-Profit Hospice

                                      The earliest considerations
                                      of hospice care arose in the
                                      1960s but didn't emerge as
                                      the concept as we know it
                                      until the 1980s. The growth
                                      of hospice care spread
rapidly in the 1970s, with mostly small volunteer-dominated,
community-based programs that provided spiritual support
and palliative care. By the late 1970s, there were approximately
60 hospice providers in America. That number exploded in the
early 1980s to over 400. Policymakers began to take notice, and
Congress created Medicare hospice benefits in 1982 for
patients deemed terminally ill with less than 6 months to live.
These federal benefits pay a fixed per diem rate, which includes
routine home care, continuous home care, inpatient respite
                                              THE BUSINESS OF MEDICINE | 26

care, or general inpatient care. The per diem rate covers services
that include nursing care, physician services, pain
management, medical social services, counseling (including
bereavement services), physical therapy, occupational therapy,
speech-language pathology, dietary counseling services, and
homemaking services, whether they are provided or not.
Throughout the 1990s, the per diem rates paid by Medicare
steadily increased, and by 2006, 40% of Medicare beneficiaries
had received hospice care prior to death. Between the years
1992 and 2002, Medicare payments for hospice care increased
fivefold, as did the number of Medicare-participating hospice
providers. Within the next 6 years, hospice expenditures
exceeded $11 billion. Concurrently, the for-profit hospice
industry grew by 128%, while the nonprofit sector only grew
by 1% (Perry & Thompson, 2017). Based on this information,
it is reasonable to predict that the rising availability and
awareness of hospice care could lead to more Medicare
beneficiaries choosing it for end-of-life care.

unethical and warrant investigation. In 2009, the Medicare

Payment Advisory Commission exposed this conflict of

interest between the financial relationships of hospice

providers and long-term care facilities. Given the heightened

emotions and vulnerability of these dying patients and their

caregivers, potential informed decision-making is susceptible

to unscrupulous marketing that overpromises the services that

will be provided. Medicare found hospice providers maximize

the length of stay for profits. The initial costs of transitioning

patients to hospice care are higher in the first four days as well

as the last four days prior to death. Although costs in between

those times are lower, the longer the duration of the patient's

stay, the higher the overall profits. Studies found that for-profit

hospices selectively admitted patients with primary diagnoses

and younger ages than religious or non-profit hospices, which

corresponds with higher profits (Perry & Thompson, 2017).

Compromised Quality of Care by Hospice
Providers

Holistic end-of-life care with a coordinated interdisciplinary
care team is the hallmark of hospice. Federal law mandates care
pursuant to an individual patient's written plan, including
access to physician services, skilled nursing care, dietary or
nutritional services, psychological counseling, spiritual care,
and medical social services (Perry & Thompson, 2017). Other
services include occupational therapy, speech therapy, physical
therapy, continuous home care, and homemaker services. Basic
hospice services include:

   Providing patient care, including pain management
   Coordinating care with the family or nursing home
   Ordering medications
   Grief counseling
   Support for caregivers
   Education to family members on caregiving
   Religious or community resources
   Burial arrangements assistance

For-profit hospice providers were noted to use less-skilled
nursing staff. For-profit hospice patients received significantly
fewer services than non-profit hospice patients. Hence the
name for-profit, the financial bottom line is driving the
creation of profits for its investors. Although quality is difficult
to measure in hospice care, new quality self-reporting metrics
29 | THE BUSINESS OF MEDICINE

show that for-profit hospice providers are scoring lower than
not-for-profit.

    Key Takeaways

           Distinctive elements of health as a business
             enterprise include monitoring the bottom line,
             which directly affects the quality of patient
             care and the cost of services. The bottom line
             needs to be positive to invest in equipment,
             technology, and competitive staff
             compensation. Large segments of healthcare
             are dominated by nonprofit providers, and
             payments are made by third parties, including
             private insurers and the government.

           Professional norms in healthcare include the
             medical provider acting on behalf of the
             patients. Providers can help patients navigate
             cost-effective options for treatment,
             pharmaceutical discounts, and determine the
             necessity of each option. The provider should
             shop for goods and services that are the most
                                  THE BUSINESS OF MEDICINE | 30

   cost-effective for the patients. Physicians
   should have no economic conflict of interest
   when providing care; however, physicians
   with proprietary hospitals and nursing homes,
   diagnostic laboratories, dialysis units, and
   many small companies represent the
   stockholders of these corporations.
 Physician-owned hospitals are hospitals in
   which a physician, or an immediate family
   member, has an ownership or investment
   interest and are either partially or fully owned
   by physician investors. By limiting access to
   healthier patients, costs are reduced. For-
   profit hospice patients receive significantly
   fewer services and have lower-skilled
   caregivers. However, little evidence is
   provided to support a difference in quality
   between for-profit versus not-for-profit
   hospice providers.

PART I

HEALTHCARE
REFORM

Healthcare reform by Nick Youngson CC BY-SA 3.0 Pix4free

Introduction

Business has become a powerful force in medicine. The future
of health care cannot escape that reality. "The US recently
experienced the most devastating recession since the Great
Depression" (Wicks & Keevil, 2021) and a global crisis with
37 | HEALTHCARE REFORM

the COVID-19 epidemic. As healthcare costs rise, the pressure
to rein in healthcare spending is ever-present. New legislation
could make a significant shift in how healthcare is provided
and who has access to care.

In 2010, the Affordable Care Act (ACA) was the largest piece
of legislation to pass regarding healthcare in America. It aimed
to reduce healthcare costs by providing affordable insurance to
the underinsured and uninsured. It encompassed individuals
making between 100% and 400% above the national poverty
level. However, it was not embraced by states equally. More
conservative states in the southern regions did not adopt
Medicaid Expansion and did little to ensure the ACA's success.
The array of issues facing the US healthcare system urges the
need for new health reform to address rising costs, reduce
medical errors, strengthen patient rights, build public health
infrastructure, and confront the costs of medical malpractice
insurance. Pollard (2022) provides several factors that deter
significant social/health reform in this country, including:

   Political gridlock: The US political system is highly
      polarized, with two major parties that often have very
      different views on social and health policy. This makes it
      difficult to pass major reforms that require bipartisan
      support.

   The influence of special interests: Powerful special
      interests, such as the healthcare industry, often oppose
      reforms that would threaten their profits. They can use
                                                   HEALTHCARE REFORM | 38

   their financial resources and political influence to block
   or weaken reform efforts.
 Public apathy: Many Americans are not well-informed
   about social and health policy issues, and they may not
   see reform as a priority. This can make it difficult to
   build public support for reform efforts.
 The complexity of the issue: Social and health policy
   issues are often complex and difficult to understand.
   This can make it difficult to reach a consensus on the
   best course of action.
 The cost of reform: Social and health reform can be
   expensive, and there is often disagreement about who
   should pay for it. This can be a major obstacle to reform
   efforts.

 Learning Objectives

        Summarize the implications of reform for
          health professionals, such as physicians,
          nurses, or pharmacists

        Describe the increased complexity of
          relationships between physicians, healthcare
          institutions, and drug and device
          manufacturers
39 | HEALTHCARE REFORM

           Articulate how healthcare is different from
             other industries based on policies and
             regulations

           Determine how to find an acceptable
             equilibrium between market and professional
             service paradigms for healthcare

Business

Clarifying the Definition of Business

Business, in terms of healthcare, is about being an employer
who offers opportunities that are more attractive than others,
provides a chance to develop the employee's abilities, and does
work that has value. Businesses should start with a realistic
view of what they do, particularly if the right kinds of
conditions are present. Business is defined in two ways:

 1. The practice of making one's living by selling a product
      or service; or

 2. An organization engaged in commercial, industrial, or
      professional activities.

Businesses can be for-profit entities or non-profit
                                                       HEALTHCARE REFORM | 40

organizations. Business types range from limited liability
companies to sole proprietorships, corporations, and
partnerships.

                   excluded from this version of the text. You

        https://pressbooks.uwf.edu/
        healthcarelaw/?p=44#h5p-6

Measuring Impact and Performance

Metrics used to determine the success of healthcare are
different from those used for other types of businesses, which
solely focus on financial returns in the form of profits. A
broader set of metrics around "value creation" for stakeholders
(employees, suppliers, managers, financiers, customers, and
the local community) should be how organizational
performance is evaluated.

Stakeholders are individuals who have an interest in decisions
made in the healthcare industry and its subsidiaries. Businesses
need to find ways to engage stakeholders, clarify their purpose
beyond profits, clarify to whom they are accountable, and
clarify how they are going to treat others to foster the kind
41 | HEALTHCARE REFORM

of cooperation they need to generate and sustain value over
time. Stakeholder Theory is a view of capitalism that stresses
the interconnected relationships between a business and its
customers, suppliers, employees, investors, communities, and
others who have a stake in the organization. The ultimate
purpose of any healthcare entity is to provide a service to the
community it serves.

Stakeholder Theory in
Healthcare

Healthcare systems' hallmarks are things like quality, access,
innovation, and prevention. However, affordability and fiscal
limits are also important. With the soaring costs of US
healthcare, importance is placed on financing care, creating
a system that is sustainable and maintains high quality, and
innovation. Markets provide a powerful mechanism for
aligning the interests of organizations and patients and
ensuring that new innovations align with the community's
needs. Properly functioning markets have great efficiency,
create powerful connections between patients and providers,
generate new innovations that continue to improve the quality
of care, and help reduce waste. Waste comes from a variety
of sources and patterns of behavior, not only via replication
of services and unnecessary treatment but also administrative
costs, as well as irresponsible and wasteful behavior by patients.
                                                       HEALTHCARE REFORM | 42

There remains a need to create a system that better serves the
interests of a variety of key stakeholders.

Identifying Stakeholders and Their
Interests

Stakeholders have a vested interest in the changes within the
healthcare sector. Whether they are community patients,
providers, payors, policymakers, donors, or investors, they are
affected by the operational performance of the organization.
The principles of engaging stakeholders include:

           Know who the stakeholders are, both internally
             and externally

           Build trust with stakeholders through open
             communication, transparency, and data

           Define ways to serve stakeholders
           Execute a stakeholder strategy (financial impact)

             to build creditability
           Build a sustainable long-term operating model

             that creates value for stakeholders through
             standardization, metrics, and providing feedback

The ACA Responsibility

The Affordable Care Act of 2010 (ACA) increased health
insurance coverage for the uninsured and underinsured
43 | HEALTHCARE REFORM

through health insurance markets. The delineated principles
of this reform included:

 1. Protect citizens' financial health (bankruptcy due to
      catastrophic illnesses)

 2. More affordable insurance (reducing administrative
      costs, removing unnecessary testing, and limiting
      premium charges for certain populations)

 3. Aim for universality
 4. Made coverage portable
 5. Guaranteed choice of plans and providers (allowing

      individuals to keep their current plans)
 6. Focused on prevention and wellness
 7. Improve safety and quality
 8. Long-term financial sustainability (reducing costs,

      improving productivity, and adding new revenue
      sources)

Changes from the ACA required stakeholders to alter
normative behaviors. First, an individual mandate required
minimal essential health coverage with penalties. Those who
were of a lower socioeconomic status but not qualified for
Medicaid received federal subsidies under the law. Second, it
prohibited insurance providers from considering pre-existing
conditions when determining an applicant's coverage. Third,
it created a marketplace for online shopping for health
insurance. Last, it expanded existing Medicaid programs.

Places where ACA improved access include:

 1. Children are allowed to stay on their parent's health
      insurance policies until they turn 26 years old.

 2. Children 19 and under cannot be turned down for
      coverage due to a pre-existing condition.

 3. Preventative services are provided without cost-sharing.
 4. Coverage can no longer be rescinded by the insurance

      company for any reason other than fraud.
 5. Incentives are provided for providers who work in

      underserved areas.
 6. Lifetime limits cannot be placed on any essential health

      coverage.
 7. Small businesses can provide health coverage and receive

      tax credits (up to 35%).
 8. Seniors who are Medicare Part D eligible can receive a

      tax-free $250 rebate check.
 9. Insurance companies must justify unreasonable rate

      increases (10% or more).
10. Consumers can appeal a denied claim with an outside

                           Many contend that the

                           ACA falls short in its

                           reform. However, many of

                           the shortcomings of the

                           ACA were due to the lack of

ACA Medicaid expansion by  commitment by the states.

Wisconsin, and Wyoming) that chose not to expand Medicaid

coverage, thereby negating the ability to advance health equity.

For example, Mississippi chose not to expand using federal

matching funds under the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021,

despite having more than 300,000 individuals who could not

afford health insurance and were not qualified for Medicaid.

Although former Attorney General Jim Hood was in favor of

the expansion, former Governor Phil Bryant sued the federal

government, claiming the ACA was unconstitutional. Despite

losing millions of dollars caring for uninsured Mississippians

each year, the governor chose to "...look at health care as an

economic driver...like the automobile industry." There was

also a troubled debut of the federally run insurance

marketplaces and state-run programs (Campbell, 2018). The

Mississippi marketplace offered very few options that were

accepted by very few healthcare entities and often did not

reimburse claims for long periods. This poorly supported

model would lead one to believe that the ACA was a failure;
however, the fault lies with the states that did not support
it and the political parties that refused to put citizens before
political alliances.

The Patient Protection and
Affordable Care Act

Partisan Elements of the PPACA

"Beyond analyzing the rhetoric used to describe healthcare
reform," importance should be placed on examining the
legislation bill itself for clues as to its partisan or bipartisan
nature. "The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act
(PPACA) contains progressive insurance reform and increased
fees and burdens on employers, but the bill also incorporates
some forward-thinking delivery-side reforms that received
bipartisan support (Frakes, 2012)."
47 | HEALTHCARE REFORM

      Reform

community for focusing on

profits rather than patients  Patient Protection and

producing barriers to

achieving  universal

coverage.  Democratic

control of both Congress and the Presidency after the 2008

elections finally offered some opportunity to pass massive

insurance industry reforms. The PPACA contained several

partisan provisions aimed at negating the market power of

insurance companies. Some provisions included severe taxes

on insurers and allowed adult dependents to remain on their

parent's coverage until the age of 26. It also established the

minimum essential benefits that plans must provide. The

White House and Congressional Democrats drafted the bill,

which targeted health insurance reform, and this legislation

made a strong partisan statement (Frakes, 2012).

      B. Employer Penalties

While the PPACA subjects businesses to increased restrictions,
requirements, and fees, it allowed the Democrats to reshape
employer participation within the insurance industry. Shifting
                                                       HEALTHCARE REFORM | 48

employer participation away from the old model of voluntary,
flexible employer-sponsored coverage, a mandate was also
added that required employers to provide health insurance
coverage to their employees. Section 9006 of the PPACA
required businesses to issue 1099 IRS tax forms to any
individual or corporation from whom they purchased a good
or service worth over $600 within a given tax year. This
provision was criticized for being burdensome and time-
consuming. However, Congress repealed the provision in early
2011 before President Obama signed the measure into law
(Frakes, 2012).

      C. Bipartisanship Reform

The trending bipartisan goal that unites both sides of the aisle
is the focus on increasing healthcare quality at a lower cost,
which is inextricably linked. The promotion of the
accountable care shared savings program has gained bipartisan
support. Providers are incentivized to produce specific health
outcomes and high patient satisfaction. Alternatively, increases
in cost resulting from care are the financial responsibility of the
provider. The PPACA includes a shared savings model in the
form of Accountable Care Organizations ("ACOs"), a shared
savings structure for Medicare beneficiaries, and has gained
bipartisan support. Lastly, strong bipartisan support exists for
the inclusion of health information technology within
healthcare delivery. Large-scale political conflicts are brutal,
and every congressional member's votes and statements are
49 | HEALTHCARE REFORM

available online. These factors present challenges to crafting
a piece of healthcare legislation representative of varying
opinions and bipartisan support (Frakes, 2012).

The Affordable Care Act

Effect on
Availability of
Affordable Health
Insurance and
Access to Care

Years after the ACA was   Doctor writing on clipboard by
signed into law on March  Marco Verch CC BY Flickr

23, 2010, it has had its clearest and most measurable effects on

the availability of health insurance for the American people

and access to care. According to the US Department of Health

& Human Services (2022), the Centers for Medicare &

Medicaid Services (CMS) show a "record-breaking 21 million

people in more than 40 states and territories gained healthcare

coverage thanks to the ACA's expansion of Medicaid to low-

income adults under 65. The total enrollment for Medicaid

expansion, Marketplace coverage, and the Basic Health

Program in participating states has reached an all-time high of

more than 35 million people as of early 2022."
                                                       HEALTHCARE REFORM | 50

   The ACA has improved the availability of health insurance
and access to care by providing states with the option to
expand Medicaid programs to include all adults with incomes
at or below 138% of the federal poverty level (that translated
to $17,130 for a single person and $35,245 for a family of four
in 2021). States that chose not to expand cited concerns about
funding once federal funds were withdrawn. Several issues that
originally plagued the ACA rollout have been improved. The
federal marketplaces now seem to be functioning adequately.
The number of canceled policies has declined, and
marketplaces have offered accessible and affordable
alternatives. Lastly, some new marketplace plans restrict access
to providers to control costs. While good efforts to improve the
process are making strides, many who purchased marketplace
plans have substantial deductibles and copayments to
minimize premiums, leaving participants with large out-of-
pocket expenses and limited access to services (Blumenthal et
al., 2015).

The ACA and the Health Care Delivery
System

The most aggressive efforts in the history of the nation to
address the problems of the delivery system need to focus on
approaches to improving healthcare delivery, including:

 1. changes in the way the government pays for health care,
51 | HEALTHCARE REFORM

 2. changes in the organization of health care delivery,
 3. changes in workforce policy, and
 4. changes intended to make the government more nimble

      and innovative in pursuing future healthcare reforms.

Changes in Payment

The ACA embraced efforts to move away from volume-based,
fee-for-service reimbursement and push towards outcome-
driven payment models with compliance incentives.

   Reduce Medicare Readmissions

Hospitals were subjected to
financial penalties for higher-
than-expected rates of
readmissions of Medicare
beneficiaries within 30 days,
starting in October 2012.
Healthcare entities were
frustrated because the cause of
readmission was not taken into consideration in many cases.
For example, a patient who is recovering from being discharged
the previous week has an automobile accident and is
readmitted. The cause of readmission had no bearing on the
initial incident. However, since the inception of this program,
                                                       HEALTHCARE REFORM | 52

30-day readmission rates nationally have declined drastically
among Medicare beneficiaries. According to Blumenthal et al.
(2015), "the appropriateness of current readmission measures
has been questioned because of evidence that safety-net
hospitals and large teaching hospitals may be unfairly
penalized under the program owing to the social and medical
complexity of their patient populations."

   Reduce Hospital-Acquired Conditions

The ACA expanded a previous CMS program that penalized
hospitals for avoidable threats to the safety of Medicare
patients, coined never events. Under the ACA program, a
hospital may lose 1% of Medicare payments if it performs in
the lowest quartile regarding rates of hospital-acquired
conditions, including avoidable infections, adverse drug
events, pressure ulcers, and falls. This payment program strives
to improve patient safety. The Department of Health and
Human Services (DHHS) noted a documented decline in
composite rates of hospital-acquired conditions nationally and
estimates that these safety improvements prevented deaths and
saved healthcare costs.

   Value-Based Payment Programs for
     Hospitals and Physicians

Since the passage of the ACA, value-based payment models
have revolutionized the way healthcare systems receive
payments. Value-based programs provide incentives for
hospitals and physicians to improve their performance on a
variety of quality and cost metrics other than hospital-acquired
conditions and readmissions.

          CMS's five original value-based programs have the
       goal of linking provider performance of quality
       measures to provider payment:

          End-Stage Renal Disease
            Quality Incentive Program (ESRD QIP)

   Bundled Payments

The Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act of 2015
(MACRA) encourages clinicians to participate in alternative
payment models (APM), such as bundled payments. Bundled
payments shift the financial risk to providers, further urging
them to focus on cost-efficient care and reduced waste. Under
the bundled payment model, providers receive a single
                                                       HEALTHCARE REFORM | 56

payment for a specified set of hospitalization, physician, and
post-acute care services related to a given procedure or
condition (Franco, 2017).

Changes in the Organization of Health
Care Delivery

   Accountable Care Organizations

The ACA encourages

healthcare providers to form

new           organizational

arrangements       called

accountable care organizations

(ACOs). It intends to promote

the integration and

coordination of ambulatory, inpatient, and post-acute care

services and to take responsibility for the cost and quality of

care for a defined population of Medicare beneficiaries. It was

perceived that ACOs would serve as a bridge from fragmented

fee-for-service care to integrated, coordinated delivery systems.

However, challenges with the early implementation of ACO

caused over 100 people to drop out of Medicare and

commercial plans.
57 | HEALTHCARE REFORM

   Primary Care Transformation

One of the ACA's focuses is to improve the delivery of primary
care by supporting a variety of programs, like the
Comprehensive Primary Care Initiative. It is an innovative
payment and organization model designed to control expenses
and improve the quality of care through emphasized care
coordination, improved chronic disease management, greater
access to primary care, and administrative simplification. It has
shown a significant reduction in emergency department visits
and inpatient hospitalizations.

   --------------

The Patient Protection and
Affordable Care Act

The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act was a
comprehensive healthcare reform law enacted in 2010 and also
known as the Affordable Care Act (ACA). The ACA had
three primary goals.

   Improving access to healthcare coverage through more
      affordable options and subsidies ("premium tax
      credits").

   Expand the Medicaid program to cover all adults with
      income below 138% of the FPL. Despite federal funds to
      support the Medicare expansion, several states did not
                                                       HEALTHCARE REFORM | 58

      adopt the expansion (Texas, Wyoming, Kansas,
      Wisconsin, Mississippi, Alabama, Tennessee, Georgia,
      Florida, North Carolina, and South Carolina).
   Support initiatives designed to lower the costs of
      healthcare.

Initially, one initiative under the ACA provided increased
Medicare reimbursements to pay primary care physicians for
two years. This helped increase the number of primary care
appointments for Medicare patients (U.S. Department of
Health and Human Services, 2022). In addition to extending
coverage and improving preventative healthcare access, the
ACA also enforced:

   Requirements for employee coverage for companies with
      50 or more full-time employees

   Eliminated rejection of coverage based on preexisting
      conditions for children

   Create a state-based Health Exchange for individuals to
      gain coverage

   Create essential health benefits packages providing
      comprehensive coverage for a set of services

   Eliminated lifetime capitations for coverage
   Shifted focus on quality outcomes and reduced waste

An individual mandate requiring US citizens to maintain
healthcare coverage or be penalized (KFF, 2013). Penalties
59 | HEALTHCARE REFORM

were increased annually. All of the ACA requirements can be
found here.

Single-Payer Healthcare

With the insurgent campaign of Bernie Sanders during the
2016 Democratic Primary, advocates for a single-payer system
gained momentum. The revival of support for single-payer
health insurance on the public agenda was the platform for
Senator Bernie Sanders's 2020 presidential campaign
(Oberlander, 2016). Many questions exist as to whether or
not it is a realistic option for the United States or a political
impossibility. There are currently 17 countries that offer
single-payer healthcare: Norway, Japan, the United Kingdom,
Kuwait, Sweden, Bahrain, Canada, the United Arab Emirates,
Denmark, Finland, Slovenia, Italy, Portugal, Cyprus, Spain,
and Iceland. The United Kingdom has both universal
healthcare and a single-payer healthcare system. Canadian
residents receive government coverage for medically necessary
hospital and physician services but also have the option to
obtain private coverage for services not covered by the
Canadian National Health Insurance to the British National
Health Service (NHS). Canada's single government-operated
insurance plan greatly reduces administrative costs and the
complexity of healthcare. Canada has had its fair share of
issues with controlling costs, providing access and timely
                           HEALTHCARE REFORM | 60

service, and grappling with growing public dissatisfaction; all

its problems pale in comparison to those in the United States

(Oberlander, 2016).

                                    The first bill proposing a

                           single-payer system in the

                           U.S. was endorsed by

                           President Harry Truman in

                           1943 and would be funded

                           through payroll taxes.

Healthcare reform by Nick  Although the bill did not
Youngson CC BY-SA 3.0      come to fruition, Medicare
Pix4free                   was enacted in 1965 and

embodied the single-payer model. The architects of Medicare

saw it as the cornerstone of a national health insurance system

and believed it would eventually expand to cover the entire

population. Support for the single-payer system gained

momentum again in the early 1970s among liberal Democrats

such as Senator Ted Kennedy (D-MA). While policymakers

were able to pursue incremental expansion through Medicaid,

Medicare expansion has yet to happen. Groups such as

Physicians for a National Health Program support the single-

payer approach (Oberlander, 2016).

Although the ACA was the largest piece of healthcare reform
with considerable achievement, healthcare coverage continues
to be out of reach for many Americans, specifically those in
poorer states, due to a lack of marketplace choices. According
61 | HEALTHCARE REFORM

to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention National Center
for Health Statistics, there were 31.6 million people of all ages
without healthcare coverage in 2020, and 31.2 million were
under the age of 65 (Cha & Cohen, 2022). While the allure
of reducing healthcare spending is enticing, one of the biggest
drawbacks to a U.S. single-payer program is the fierce
resistance from conservatives that charge these programs to be
"socialized medicine" with "death panels." There is a belief
that large-scale tax increases would need to fund a single-payer
program rather than trim government spending on military
defense. The combination of prevailing anti-tax sentiment
with the required substantial overhaul of the current system
leaves the task of adopting a single-payer system daunting. Not
to mention the needed support from the U.S. Senate to secure
enough votes to overcome a filibuster. With each election
comes uncertainty concerning healthcare reform and ongoing
support. Preserving and strengthening the ACA and Medicare
while addressing the underinsurance and affordability of
coverage could be just as difficult as establishing a single-payer
system.

   Based on the current lack of federal funding for healthcare
and the exorbitant costs associated with it, the question
remains whether or not the government could absorb the costs
of a single-payer system. Although Senator Bernie Sanders
proposed a single-payer bill in 2016, estimating $14 trillion
over a decade, economists estimate costs to be much higher.
                                                       HEALTHCARE REFORM | 62

According to the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget
(2019), economists estimated that a single-payer healthcare
system would cost the federal government $27.7 trillion
through 2026, the Urban Institute estimated a $32 trillion
cost over the same period, and the American Action Forum
calculated that it would cost the federal government $36
trillion through 2029. On average, the estimated cost to the
federal government would roughly be $28-32 trillion over a
decade. Representative Pramila Jayapal's Medicare for All Act
proposed in 2019 and 2021, has failed to pass. Medicare for
All is supported by 69 percent of registered voters, including
87 percent of Democrats, the majority of Independents, and
nearly half of Republicans. Additionally, over 50 cities and
towns across America have passed resolutions endorsing
Medicare for All.
63 | HEALTHCARE REFORM

Future Healthcare Law

Trends in healthcare spending have followed a steep upward
trajectory accompanied by a global pandemic, rapidly growing
scientific precision, and technical sophistication. According to
the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services National
Health Expenditure Data (2021), the U.S. healthcare system
spent upwards of $4.3 trillion, or 18.3% of the Gross Domestic
Product (GDP). Not only did Medicare and Medicaid
spending grow by 21% and 17%, respectively, but private
health insurance and out-of-pocket expenditures also grew by
28% and 10%, respectively. National health spending is
projected to grow to reach $6.2 trillion by 2028 (CMS, 2021).
Sadly, U.S. spending is comparatively high in relation to other
developed countries, yet outcomes are not superior to these
other countries.

OECD Health Statistics, 2021
                                                       HEALTHCARE REFORM | 64

In 2023, Speaker of the House Kevin McCarthy vowed to
avoid raising the debt limit on entitlement programs like Social
Security and Medicare without first issuing budget cuts to the
programs. Reforms to these programs are likely to come,
including cuts that would decrease reimbursements for
services and are expected to impact the quality of care patients
will receive. The House Freedom Caucus is a group of 50
Republicans that is tackling excessive government spending,
including healthcare. McCarthy granted them significant
concessions to secure his seat as Speaker of the House.
Republicans propose converting Medicaid and Affordable
Care Act subsidies to block grants, which would cut spending
by $3.6 trillion over 10 years (Lalljee, 2023). Some Republicans
have called for the complete elimination of Social Security. In
2023, Florida Senator Rick Scott proposed a plan to require
Congress to renew Social Security and Medicare every five
years. However, Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell
stated, "Unfortunately, that was the Scott plan; that's not a
Republican plan (Bailey, 2023)." While funds for entitlement
programs stay at the forefront of budget concerns, other areas
of the national federal budget seem to be increasing with no
opposition. For example, the 2023 National Defense
Authorization Act defense budget was increased by 8%.
President Joe Biden has signed the Fiscal 2023 National
Defense Authorization Act into law, allotting $816.7 billion to
the Defense Department. Funding for this increase is not yet
clear (Harris, 2022). This is important to note when budget
65 | HEALTHCARE REFORM

cuts are being made to the national federal budget.
Comparatively speaking, defense spending is over half of the
U.S. discretionary spending budget, while healthcare remains
at an average of 5% (not including the 8% allocated for
veterans' benefits). This continues to transfer healthcare costs
for services back to those not covered by Medicare/Medicaid.
The majority of healthcare spending went towards in-patient
hospital care (over 30%) (Kurani et al., 2022). To lower
healthcare costs, the focus has heavily shifted to preventative
care.

Preventative Care

One way to prevent the enormous costs associated with
treatment for acute illnesses and chronic healthcare events is
to shift the focus from treatment to prevention and early
intervention (Sage & McIlhattan, 2014). Healthcare demands
that we "do more with less." Throwing money at a problem
no longer suffices, and patients expect quality. Trends in
unhealthy behaviors and chronic disease have enhanced the
need for population health. The COVID-19 pandemic has
also pushed the government to be more involved in healthcare.
Inventing and funding new technologies could alleviate some
of the financial burdens. Unfortunately, most of what is
considered "healthcare law" is anchored in legal issues relating
to professionals, facilities, private insurance, public programs,
corporate structures, and the use or withdrawal of life-giving
                                                      HEALTHCARE REFORM | 66

technology. Health policy needs to reevaluate and
accommodate changing geographic and service boundaries,
new professional settlements, and evolving financial practices.

A. Dyadic care

"The physician-patient relationship is a member of a special
class of legal relationships called fiduciary relationships.
Through the creation of fiduciary duties, the law recognizes
that there are relationships in which the parties inherently have
unequal power (Witherell v. Weimer, 1981)." This
relationship's foundation is based on the theory that the
physician-patient relationship has the following structure: the
physician is skilled and experienced in those subjects about
which the patient is not, but may depend on their health or
even their lives. Therefore, the patient places great confidence
and faith in the professional advice and acts of the physician.
The physician is expected to recommend treatments based
only on the patient's medical and psychological needs.
Witherell v. Weimer, 421 NE2d 869 (1981).
The physician-patient relationship is fiduciary, and the
patient's interests must be a priority. This stands in
contrast to the legal rule of caveat emptor ("let the
buyer beware"). Typically, the law assumes the buyer
and seller have knowledge of and access to the same
information and possess bargaining power. Fiduciary
duty extends to all aspects of the physician-patient
relationship. This includes breaching the financial
67 | HEALTHCARE REFORM

aspects of the fiduciary duty to a patient, which can
subject the physician to liability under the law.

B. Physician control

Power and accountability in healthcare reside mainly within
the self-regulating medical profession. This indicates that
physicians decide what treatments patients will receive. The
healthcare practitioner who generates a medical record after
making a physical or mental examination of, or administering
treatment to, any person is considered the owner of the
medical record. This is especially the case when medical charts
are kept on paper in a file cabinet. Physicians serve as
gatekeepers by determining the scope and intensity of
healthcare services. As a result of this structure, medical
services are low in variety, accessibility, and measurable benefit.
Physicians most often bear moral and financial responsibility
in the event that something goes wrong, which can breed bias
and fear in the profession.

Information and authority are more diffused with the
evolution of electronic medical records. Displaced individuals
during Hurricane Katrina, along with destroyed medical
records, encouraged the widespread adoption of interoperable
electronic systems and allowed a patient's medical history to
be accessed anywhere. Electronic health records (EHR)
expenditures in the US grew an annual average of 5.4% from
2015 to 2019, totaling $14.5 billion in 2019 (Jercich, 2020).
                                                      HEALTHCARE REFORM | 68

US expenditures on EHRs are forecast to total $19.9 billion
in 2024 (Jercich, 2020). However, according to Huynh and
Dzabic (2020), interoperability of EHRs would cut health
costs by $30 billion through streamlined patient-centered care.

C. Hospital walls

Hospitals are confined settings where patients receive
treatment for serious illnesses. They have specialized
technology and a clear professional hierarchy. Patients are
considered vulnerable, and their care is considered crucial, but
the history of hospitals is more focused on charity than
business, despite the large number of resources and financial
benefits they generate. Therefore, hospitals often have a
feudal-like community structure rather than a business-like
structure, including in terms of safety and quality.

Hospitals represent a closed environment in which the sickest
patients live as well as receive care, with captive technology
and a strict hierarchy of professional authority. Hospitalized
patients are assumed to be vulnerable, and the care they receive
is seen as life-saving. However, the hospital's history is more
charitable than corporate, notwithstanding the considerable
resources the sector consumes and the financial rewards it
generates. As a result, the hospital often functions as a feudal
community rather than an industrial organization, including
with respect to safety and quality. Historically, independent
physician decision-making has taken precedence over
69 | HEALTHCARE REFORM

administrative efficiency, leading to decentralized governance
among clinical departments, which is delegated to medical staff
committees and verified through compliance with private
accreditation standards. Physicians do not hold positions as
owners, managers, employees, or suppliers, but instead form
an internal nobility with their own power dynamics and
methods for distributing rewards and resolving conflicts.
However, health services obtained through schools, faith
organizations, workplaces, and community groups are
different. Physicians are not typically in charge in these
settings. Other professionals, such as nurses, pharmacists,
social workers, and clergy, exercise their authority and follow
their own preferences. Health can also be a significant aspect
of social networks that lack a clear hierarchy or leadership but
still require oversight to prevent harm and misuse of resources.

D. Third-party payment

Healthcare coverage typically falls into three categories:
governmental, employer-provided, or private plans.

 1. Government plans:
       1. Medicare- Individuals 65 years and older
       2. Medicaid- state-run plan for low-income families,
            qualified pregnant women, children, and
            individuals with disabilities
       3. TRICARE- federal program for military personnel
       4. CHAMPVA- federal program for disabled veterans
                                                       HEALTHCARE REFORM | 70

            and their dependents
 2. Employer-provided plans are provided to employees who

      work 30 or more hours per week
 3. Private plans are provided by the private health

      insurance industry and are not run by the government
      but are regulated at the state and federal levels.

       1. COBRA allows eligible former employees and their
            dependents the option to continue group health
            insurance coverage at their own expense for a
            period of time, usually up to 36 months. It is also
            available for individuals turning 26 and no longer
            covered by their parent's insurance plan, part-time
            workers, and the self-employed.

Hospital care, services provided by licensed health
professionals, and treatments that require a physician's
prescription are typically covered by health insurance, while
areas such as nutrition, fitness, and stress management are
often excluded. The justification for these fixed categories is
practical, as they tend to be more expensive and less flexible,
making insurance both necessary and manageable. For
companies offering health coverage as an employee benefit, this
aligns with providing financial security. For publicly funded
programs like Medicare and Medicaid, this reduces the
potential for abuse. However, these arguments can be circular,
as insurance may contribute to high prices, and reactive care
may be more costly and less effective than proactive prevention
71 | HEALTHCARE REFORM

and early treatment. Only a few health insurance plans, known
as health maintenance organizations, attempt to address these
issues. The rest reinforce the medical establishment through
provider contracts in private coverage and reimbursement
systems in public coverage.

Healthcare law will require a more adaptable approach to
easing the financial strain of healthcare. Most transactions will
not be covered by traditional insurance. Healthcare law must
determine the responsibilities of these intermediaries to end-
users based on the contracts they offer to the public and the
impact they have on service providers. Instead of offering fixed
coverage categories, insurance may provide fixed subsidies in
case of illness or injury, giving policyholders more control over
how the funds are used (similar to disability insurance). This
approach is more attractive because insurers can no longer rely
on physician judgment as a necessary proxy.

E. Physician-extending technology

Many "mid-level" providers have been seen as physician
extenders rather than independent professionals. However,
this assumption is disrespectful to their skill set and
knowledge-based. The objective of employing mid-level
providers is to enhance or supplement the services provided
and billed by physicians, not to diminish their skills or replace
them. When new devices, treatments, or drug formularies are
created, physicians act as "learned intermediaries" for patients
                                                       HEALTHCARE REFORM | 72

regarding the product's risks. However, the US pharmaceutical
market is unique in its ability to market directly to consumers.
Combined with the push to engage the patient as part of the
healthcare decision-making team, it is unclear who possesses
"prescriptive authority" under the law.

   With emerging new technologies being "reimbursable" by
health insurance, access to third-party payment creates
incentives for providers to use new products/devices but high
additional costs for the patient. However, many modern
technologies are extensions of the physician's practice, such
as the ability to access hospital and clinic notes or diagnostic
laboratory results.

With the emergence of COVID-19, one technology service
that has rapidly expanded is telehealth services. Telehealth
involves utilizing digital technologies and information to
access healthcare services from a distance and manage one's
health. This may be done through personal devices such as
computers or mobile phones from the comfort of the home
or through healthcare professionals using telehealth
73 | HEALTHCARE REFORM

technology from a medical office or mobile van, particularly
in rural areas. Telehealth can also be utilized by healthcare
providers to enhance and support their services.

F. Self-monitoring

Patients are able to easily obtain a home pulse oximeter, a
home blood pressure monitoring system, a wristband blood
pressure monitor to be worn when exercising, and a home
defibrillator. A compact device can be attached to an
individual's inhaler, which records each time the inhaler is used
and its location. The recorded data is then wirelessly
transmitted to the individual's smartphone. Similar devices
enable people with chronic conditions to self-monitor various
health parameters, such as blood glucose levels, ECG data,
body temperature, heart rate, and blood pressure. Electronic
platforms, smartphone apps, and computerized systems are
becoming increasingly prevalent, empowering individuals to
take a more proactive role in managing their health and
wellness. There is a wide range of informational and
educational tools available, each performing diverse functions.
Symptom checkers from WebMD and Aetna allow individuals
to learn about potential causes of symptoms. A drug
interaction checker through CVS informs individuals about
potential drug interactions with prescription and over-the-
counter medications.

There are countless other applications that encourage healthier
                                                       HEALTHCARE REFORM | 74

habits, track pregnancy, customize fitness and weight-loss
plans, as well as track sleep patterns, physical activity, and
calories burned. Most apps are downloaded to personal
smartphones and can offer a mobile-connected recordkeeping
service for individuals. Individuals can access their medical
records, such as Epic Systems' MyChart, through digital
portals, allowing them to view lab/test results, immunization
history, prescription lists, family medical histories, and data
from self-monitoring.

G. Communication and consultation

Some apps allow patients to search for physicians, hospitals,
and other healthcare providers, schedule appointments, and
check in remotely. Some apps allow individuals to consult a
physician on demand for a nominal fee of $40. The ability to
access medical records also allows for real-time communication
between the patient, office staff, and physician via patient
portals. Patients can leave messages directly for the nurse or
provider and receive responses without communicating with
office personnel. Eliminating this link in the process makes
communication more efficient.

H. Retail Medical Clinics

Retail medical clinics offer accessible and affordable health
services, typically provided by mid-level practitioners, without
the need for appointments and at fixed prices. Clinics are
75 | HEALTHCARE REFORM

commonly located in chain drug stores like Walgreens and
CVS, supermarkets like Publix, or big-box retailers like
Walmart and Target. Although they are not yet a major source
of primary care, they have had a significant impact on COVID
vaccination coordination and distribution. Retail clinics
provide basic medical services for minor illnesses and injuries
at a lower cost and without the need for appointments. While
they may provide similar services to what a private physician's
office would offer, they are typically not considered a
replacement for a traditional doctor-patient relationship.

Sentinel Legal Issues

Sentinel issues in the healthcare industry involve various
aspects of the healthcare workforce, such as restrictions on
licenses for primary care providers, obstacles to telehealth, and
limitations on community health workers. Other issues
encompass approvals of medical products, liability, and
malpractice risks, insurance coverage and payment, and
privacy and security of health information. Several issues have
exacerbated the need for providers, including the aging baby
boomer population, the COVID-19 pandemic, and the
number of people obtaining mandated healthcare coverage.
According to predictions by Heiser (2021) from the
Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC), the
United States could see an estimated shortage of between
37,800 and 124,000 physicians by 2034. The global pandemic
                                                       HEALTHCARE REFORM | 76

highlighted severe disparities in access to healthcare services
and revealed weaknesses in the healthcare system.

A. Nurse Scope of Practice

Licensing laws in most states limit the independent delivery
of primary care by nurse practitioners (NPs). To provide care,
some states mandate that NPs enter into collaboration
agreements with physicians. For instance, in New Jersey, NPs
must establish a joint protocol with a collaborating physician
to prescribe medication. In other states, NPs require formal
supervision, delegation, or physician-led management.
Restrictive practice laws usually outline the ratio of physicians
to NPs, require supervising physicians to be present on site
(e.g., at a retail clinic) for a certain number of hours, or limit
the number of sites that a single physician can oversee. While
some states have loosened these restrictions or allowed NPs full
autonomy to practice, it has been met with great opposition
from medical professional organizations.

B. Community Health Centers

Community health workers (CHWs), who are not necessarily
medical professionals, serve as bridges between community
members and healthcare providers. Health centers, such as
Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs), that receive
funding from the HRSA Bureau of Primary Health Care are
responsible for providing comprehensive primary care services
77 | HEALTHCARE REFORM

to underserved communities and populations. Most patients
are treated either for free or charge a nominal fee on a sliding
scale based on their income. These centers are crucial in rural
areas, as they serve as a safety net for those in need. FQHCs,
which are outpatient clinics, are eligible for specific
reimbursement systems under Medicare and Medicaid,
including Health Center Program award recipients and look-
alikes, as well as clinics connected with tribal organizations
(Rural Health Information Hub, 2021).

C. Over-the-Counter (OTC) Drugs

It's important to note that not all OTC drugs are appropriate
for everyone, and some conditions may require a prescription.
It's always a good idea to talk to a doctor or pharmacist before
taking any new medication. Over-the-counter (OTC) drugs
can generate cost savings in several ways:

 1. Avoiding the need for a doctor's visit: By allowing
      consumers to purchase and self-medicate with OTC
      drugs, they can avoid the cost of a doctor's visit, which
      can be substantial.

 2. Lower cost of medication: OTC drugs are typically less
      expensive than prescription drugs because they do not
      require a prescription and can be sold directly to
      consumers.

 3. Reduced health insurance costs: Using OTC drugs can
      reduce the burden on the healthcare system and lower
                                                       HEALTHCARE REFORM | 78

      the overall cost of healthcare, which can result in lower
      health insurance costs for consumers.
 4. Increased competition: The availability of OTC drugs
      creates competition in the marketplace, which can lead
      to lower prices for consumers.
 5. Improved health outcomes: By allowing consumers to
      treat common illnesses and conditions at home, OTC
      drugs can improve health outcomes and prevent the
      need for more costly medical interventions.

D. Home Testing

Home testing options have expanded rapidly in the last two
decades. Many consumer diagnostics are regulated by the U.S.
Food and Drug Administration (FDA) using the risk-based
approach to classifying medical devices authorized by the FDA
Modernization Act of 1997. However, testing is being heavily
marketed directly to consumers, sometimes without proper
FDA clearance. Home testing kits can provide information
about DNA genealogy, potential allergies, illegal drug use,
fertility, pregnancy, STDs, colorectal cancer, and the
inheritance of breast or cervical genes. Home testing kits were
revolutionized by the free COVID-19 kits provided to
American citizens.

Without proper FDA clearance, the FDA warns of accuracy
flaws in processing results and the estimates of disease risk
for customers. However, its availability provides access to
79 | HEALTHCARE REFORM

consumers without the need for an appointment or insurance
approval. The results are also private and owned by the
consumer. If the consumer purchases genetic testing from a
home kit, there is no medical record validating that diagnosis.
If that individual decides to upgrade their cancer policy after
receiving at-home kit results, there is no confirmed medical
diagnosis to disclose as a pre-existing condition. A medical
diagnosis is typically made by a licensed healthcare provider
based on a comprehensive evaluation of a patient's symptoms,
medical history, and results from various diagnostic tests,
including laboratory tests.

   It's important to note that at-home medical kits can be
useful tools for monitoring health, but they should not be
used in place of a formal medical evaluation by a licensed
healthcare provider. If the results of an at-home test are
positive or concerning, it's recommended to follow up with
a doctor or healthcare professional for a more complete
evaluation and to receive an accurate diagnosis.

Privacy and Security of Personal
Health Data

The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act
(HIPAA) is a federal law in the United States that was enacted
in 1996. It provides a set of national standards to protect the
privacy and security of individuals' protected health
information (PHI). The Department of Health and Human
                                                      HEALTHCARE REFORM | 80

Services was given the authority to enforce HIPAA
compliance.

   HIPAA requires healthcare providers, health plans, and
healthcare clearinghouses to implement administrative,
physical, and technical safeguards to ensure the confidentiality,
integrity, and availability of electronically protected health
information (ePHI). HIPAA also gives individuals the right
to access and receive a copy of their health information, as
well as the right to request that their information be amended
if it is inaccurate or incomplete. HIPAA is important for
maintaining the privacy and security of individuals' health
information, as well as ensuring that this information is only
used for authorized purposes. Failure to comply with HIPAA
can result in significant fines and legal penalties. The largest
HIPAA settlement in 2021 was against Excellus Health Plan
for a penalty of over $5 million for a breach of over 9K patient
records in 2015 (HIPAA Journal, 2022). A study from the
University of Minnesota and the University of Florida
measured attacks on healthcare delivery organizations from
2016 to 2021, and the results suggest ransomware attacks on
healthcare delivery organizations are increasing in frequency
and sophistication, further exacerbating HIPAA violations.
Attacks have doubled while personal health information
exposure increased more than 11-fold, from approximately 1.3
million in 2016 to more than 16.5 million in 2021 (McKeon,
2023)
81 | HEALTHCARE REFORM

The HIPAA Right of Access standard, specified in 45 C.F.R. 
164.524(a), grants individuals the privilege to examine, obtain,
and receive a copy of their own protected health information
kept in a designated record set. Within 30 days of receiving a
request from an individual or their authorized representative,
the health records must be provided. A reasonable fee, based
on the cost of reproduction, may be charged for the copies
requested. Although a request for access to health records may
be declined, this can only occur under specific and rare
circumstances. Some of these circumstances include:

 1. Psychotherapy notes: A covered entity may deny an
      individual's request for access to psychotherapy notes,
      which are separate from the rest of the individual's
      medical record.

 2. Information compiled for legal proceedings: A covered
      entity may deny an individual's request for access to PHI
      if it was compiled in anticipation of, or for use in, a civil,
      criminal, or administrative proceeding.

 3. Information that could cause harm: A covered entity
      may deny an individual's request for access to PHI if the
      disclosure of the information could cause serious harm
      to the individual or another person.

 4. Information that is subject to law enforcement or
      national security restrictions: A covered entity may deny
      an individual's request for access to PHI if the
      information is restricted by law enforcement or national
                                                       HEALTHCARE REFORM | 82

      security requirements.
 5. Information that is protected by a privilege: A covered

      entity may deny an individual's request for access to PHI
      if the information is protected by a privilege, such as
      attorney-client privilege or physician-patient privilege.

Other general privacy laws include the Computer Fraud and
Abuse Act of 1986 and the Electronic Communications
Privacy Act of 1986. The Computer Fraud and Abuse Act
of 1986 prohibits unauthorized access to protected computers
and networks as well as unauthorized damage to computer
systems. It also criminalizes the unauthorized distribution of
malicious software and the unauthorized interception of
electronic communications. The Electronic Communications
Privacy Act of 1986 governs the interception of electronic
communications, including unauthorized access to stored
electronic communications. Health information technology is
governed by various federal and state laws and regulations,
including the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability
Act (HIPAA), which provides specific protections for
electronically protected health information. However, the
Computer Fraud and Abuse Act of 1986 and the Electronic
Communications Privacy Act of 1986 were enacted before the
widespread use of telehealth and mobile medical apps and may
not fully address the privacy and security risks associated with
these types of apps.

   Therefore, while the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act of
83 | HEALTHCARE REFORM

1986 and the Electronic Communications Privacy Act of 1986
may provide some protections for individuals using mobile
medical apps, they may not be sufficient to fully address the
privacy and security risks associated with these apps. It's
important for individuals to be aware of the privacy and
security risks associated with mobile medical apps and to
carefully review the privacy policies and terms of use for these
apps before using them.

Conclusion

Innovations in healthcare are being leveraged to help curtail
the excessive costs of healthcare delivery. It's worth noting that
the healthcare system is a complex and constantly evolving
area, and there are many different opinions on the best way
to reform it. There is no quick fix. The global pandemic put
urgency on healthcare reform. The newest legislative reform
will ensure no individual or family pays more than 8.5 percent
of their total household income for their health care insurance.
The Health Care Improvement Act of 2021 was an
amendment to the Patient Protection and Affordable Care
Act to reduce healthcare costs and expand healthcare coverage
to more Americans, requiring the Secretary of Health and
Human Services to create a low-cost public healthcare option.
It aims to reduce healthcare costs and protect citizens with
preexisting conditions. The Health Care Improvement Act of
2021 would lower costs for working families by:
                                                   HEALTHCARE REFORM | 84

 Capping healthcare costs on the ACA exchanges
 Establishing a low-cost public health care option
 Authorizing the federal government to negotiate

   prescription drug prices
 Allowing insurers to offer health care coverage across

   state boundaries
 Supporting state-run reinsurance programs
 Incentivizing states to expand Medicaid
 Expanding Medicaid eligibility for new moms
 Simplifying enrollment
 Increasing Medicaid funding for states with high levels

   of unemployment
 Funding rural healthcare providers
 Reducing burdens on small businesses

 Key Takeaways

        The Affordable Care Act (ACA): The ACA, also
          known as Obamacare, was signed into law in
          2010 and aimed to increase access to
          healthcare and reduce costs. Some of the key
85 | HEALTHCARE REFORM

             provisions of the ACA include the expansion
             of Medicaid, the creation of health insurance
             exchanges, and the requirement that all
             individuals have health insurance coverage.
           Drug pricing: There has been a growing
             concern about the high cost of prescription
             drugs in the United States. In response, there
             have been efforts to increase transparency in
             drug pricing and to allow the government to
             negotiate drug prices directly with
             pharmaceutical companies.
           Mental health and addiction services: Mental
             health and addiction services have long been
             underfunded and stigmatized in the United
             States. There have been recent efforts to
             increase access to mental health and addiction
             services, including the expansion of
             telemedicine and the integration of mental
             health services into primary care.

Tort law by Nick Youngson CC BY-SA 3.0 Pix4free

Introduction

Within the intricate tapestry of law, torts occupy a significant
space, representing civil wrongs that inflict harm upon an
individual. Among the diverse landscape of tortious acts, a
prominent category emerges in the healthcare realm: medical
malpractice. This tort absorbs the concept of negligence,
where a healthcare provider's deviation from the expected
93 | TORTS

standard of care results in patient harm. In other words, it
embodies the failure to act with the prudence and skill that
a reasonably competent healthcare professional would
demonstrate in similar circumstances. Here we begin to dissect
the legal framework surrounding negligence within the
healthcare context and meticulously navigate the definitions of
duty, breach, causation, and damages, elucidating the elements
necessary to establish a successful claim.

     Learning Objectives

           Explain the requirements to prove a tort by
             negligence, known in healthcare as medical
             malpractice

           Explain issues related to proof of medical
             malpractice

           Develop business implications related to
             medical malpractice

What is a tort?

A tort is a civil wrong committed upon an individual or as
                                                                              TORTS | 94

typically termed in healthcare, medical malpractice which
falls under the legal doctrine of negligence. Strict liability
(like medically defective products) is a legal doctrine that
causes someone to be liable for the damages their actions or
product causes regardless of fault. Tort liability is determined
by the premises that: (1) one individual should not
intentionally injure another person or their property. (2)
Everyone should exercise reasonable care and caution in the
conduct of their affairs. The main difference between
intentional torts and negligence is intent which is present in
intentional torts but not in negligence.

What is Torts? And What Torts is Not. [YouTube]

Negligence

Negligence is a lesser form of fault than intentional torts, so
damages in negligence cases are limited to actual damages, not
punitive damages. It can be carelessness resulting from a
95 | TORTS

deviation from the standard of care. Unlike the intentional
tort, negligence rests on a spectrum of lesser faults. Negligence
claims are generally restricted to the redress of "actual
damages," as opposed to the punitive damages reserved for
more egregious misconduct. At its core, it stems from a failure
to uphold a requisite standard of care, resulting in foreseeable
harm.

Negligence         would do    distracted.

Gross Negligence   Intentional disregard for safety or a reckless act A surgeon leaves an instrument inside a patient.
97 | TORTS

Proof of Negligence

Proof of negligence is determined by four elements: duty,
breach, causation, and damages.

   Duty: The defendant has a duty or obligation to act
      reasonably to avoid harming others. This duty is based
      on the relationship between the defendant and the
      plaintiff. Did a physician-patient relationship exist?

   Breach: The defendant breached their duty of care by
      failing to act reasonably. This means that the defendant
      did not take the precautions that a reasonable person
      would have taken in the same situation. This is a
      deviation from the standard of care or failure to adhere
      to an obligation. Did the physician fail to meet the
      standard of care?

   Causation: The defendant's breach of duty must have
      caused the plaintiff's injuries. This means that the
      plaintiff's injuries would not have happened if the
      defendant had not breached their duty. Did the physician
      fail to meet the standard of care?

   Damages: The plaintiff must have suffered actual
      damages (foreseeable injury) as a result of the
      defendant's negligence. This means that the plaintiff
      must have suffered some type of financial or physical
      loss. Did the patient incur actual damages as a result of
             TORTS | 98

the breach?

In addition to these four elements, other factors, including the
patient's age, health, and medical history, as well as the severity
of the patient's injuries, may affect the liability of a physician in
a negligence case. Furthermore, strong incentives are provided
to take reasonable care and prevent injury.

An Overview of Tort Law: Intentional Torts, Negl

A. Duty

To determine negligence, the first question is whether or not
a duty is owed. This is established by the fact that the actions
of a tortfeasor can lead to a foreseeable risk of injury (Perry
& Thompson, 2017). Examples of tortfeasors include a driver,
doctor, landlord, babysitter, business, etc. Regular citizens are
not required to assist someone in foreseeable danger unless
they create the danger. For example, if a child is drowning, you
99 | TORTS

do not have a legal duty to save the child unless you have a duty
to protect the child, such as a parent, lifeguard, or caregiver,
or if you created the danger by allowing a hose to drain water
filling a public area.

   In a negligence lawsuit, the plaintiff must demonstrate
      the defendant owed him or her a duty of care.

   The duty of care can be highly specific or applied more
      generally to the public.

   If the court decides that the defendant did not meet his
      or her duty of care, the defendant can be found in
      "breach of duty of care."

      1. The Carrol Owing Rule

To determine whether or not standard duty or reasonable care
is provided depends on the circumstances. In the case United
States v. Carrol Towing United States v. Carrol Towing, the
judge determined negligence by using an algebraic function of
three variables: if the probability is called P; the injury is L; and
the burden is B; liability depends upon whether B is less than
L multiplied by P. B<PL Using this equation, the expected
benefit should exceed the cost and reduce the probability of
an accident (Perry & Thompson, 2017). Healthcare providers
may be sued for negligence if an individual is injured when
the provider fails to exercise the appropriate standard of care.
However, the claimant must show:
                                                                            TORTS | 100

 1. a duty existed for the provider to conform to a certain
      standard of care,

 2. the provider breached that duty of care,
 3. the claimant sustained actual loss or damage from the

      conduct or omission by the provider, and
 4. that the loss or damage suffered was proximately caused

      by the provider's breach of duty.

In general, duty is always owed under

   Common law (duty owed by provider): reasonably
      foreseeable plaintiff

   Statutory duty (mandated by laws such as the
      EMTALA)

      2. Standard of Care

Typically, the standards of care have been determined by asking
what a similar individual would do in this circumstance. For
physicians, the nature of medicine requires a comparison with
similar skill sets of similar physicians. To determine the
standard of care, courts need to determine two key items:

   The skill and knowledge ordinarily possessed by a
      reasonably competent practitioner in the same
      medical specialty. This means that the court will
      consider the level of training, experience, and knowledge
      that is typically possessed by other doctors in the same
101 | TORTS

      specialty as the defendant doctor.
   The degree of care and skill that a reasonably

      prudent practitioner would exercise under the same
      or similar circumstances. This means that the court
      will consider the specific facts and circumstances of the
      case, such as the patient's condition, the risks and
      benefits of the treatment, and the available alternatives.

      3. Location

An additional consideration of the court when determining
what a "reasonable physician" would do is the locality.
Previous courts used a strict locality standard in medical
malpractice cases, but recently courts have moved away from
this standard due to the difficulty of getting local physicians
to testify against other local physicians and the increasing
nationalization of the medical community. This meant that
the standard of care was set by the practices of other doctors
in the same community as the defendant doctor. However,
several factors have led recent courts to move away from the
strict locality standard. One factor is the difficulty of getting
local physicians to testify against other local physicians.
Another factor is that the medical community is becoming
increasingly national and specialized. This means that the
practices of doctors in one community may not be the same as
the practices of doctors in another community. Additionally,
in smaller communities, specialists may be limited, and the
standard of care for that specialty should be reviewed by the
                                                                             TORTS | 102

same type of specialist; however, this may not be true in all
states.

B. Breach

The second element in a negligent action is proof of breach
of duty. Once duty has been established and a party fails to
provide reasonable care, which may include taking a particular
action or not doing some other action, a breach is proven.
Typically, medical expert testimony is used to prove medical
malpractice. The expert must be able to show that the
physician departed from the standard of care. There are cases
where experts are not necessary to prove breach of care. For
example, an injured patient can claim negligence per se. With
this argument, a plaintiff must show that the statute was
violated and that the violation was an actual and proximate
cause of the accident. An example would be an ER provider
refusing a critically ill patient, directly violating the EMTALA.

   Additionally, accreditation bodies and regulatory standards
can specify standards of treatment. These are referred to as
"never events" or "adverse events." To better prevent their
occurrence, the [pb_glossary id="394"]National Quality
Forum[/pb_glossary] has published a list of "Serious
Reportable Events" ("SRE"s). The list of serious reportable
events, or "never events," includes:

Additionally, plaintiffs can prove breach without evidence of
a deviation from the standard of care if it satisfies res ipsa
loquitur, Latine for "the thing speaks for itself.res ipsa
loquitur Three elements are needed to show res ipsa loquitur,
which include:

 1. The accident generally would not have occurred unless
      negligence was provided.

 2. Harm was under the exclusive control of the defendant.
 3. The accident was not caused by the plaintiff.

   Res Ipsa Loquitur

C. Causation

The second element in a

negligent  action  is

causation. It is a necessary

element of many legal claims,      Breach of duty by Nick
                                   Youngson CC BY-SA 3.0
including negligence, product      Pix4free

liability, and intentional torts.

There are two main types of

causation in law:

 Factual causation, also known as actual causation,
   meaning "but for" breach of duty, the injury would not
   have occurred.

 Proximate causation means the injury must be a
   foreseeable outcome.

However, causation can be difficult to prove, especially in cases
where harm could be the result of many causes. The burden of
proof rests on the plaintiff. Proof of causation includes expert
testimony and is most difficult to prove in the medical context.
If the defendant can show that the injury would likely have
happened regardless of their direct care, the defendant is not
liable. Meaning the outcome was inevitable.

Analougus duty is used to describe the relationship between
causation and duty of care. To determine if an analogous duty
already exists, the following are needed:
107 | TORTS

   Foreseeability
   Proximity

Arguments in favor of the existence of an analogous duty in
causation:

   The law of torts is based on the principle of fairness. It is
      unfair to allow someone to cause harm to another
      person without any legal liability.

   The concept of analogous duty is already used in other
      areas of law, such as the law of negligence.

   There is a growing trend in the law to recognize the
      importance of preventing harm, even if there is no
      explicit duty of care.

Arguments against the existence of an analogous duty in
causation:

   The law of torts is based on the principle of fault. It is
      unfair to hold someone liable for harm that they did not
      intend to cause.

   The concept of analogous duty is too vague and
      uncertain. It would be difficult to apply it in practice.

   The law of torts should not be used to create new duties
      of care. This would lead to increased litigation and
      uncertainty.

Statutes of         Did the plaintiff file their claim
Limitations         in time?

D. Damages

The final element of proof of negligence is to show damages
suffered as a result of the breach of duty by the defendant.
This can be as straightforward as economic salary loss, pain/
suffering, or death. Reform attempts have been made to limit
the amount of pain and suffering damages awarded in tort
litigation. The purpose of tort litigation is to compensate
victims for injuries incurred by the fault of another party.
Victims typically hire attorneys to collect damages, and
attorneys are compensated through a contingent fee system,
which means they receive a percentage of the recovery.
Contingent fees make the legal system accessible to all,
regardless of their ability to pay. However, some people believe
that contingent fees are unfair when the injuries are very
109 | TORTS

substantial and liability is easily established. For example, in a
case where a victim is awarded $15 million for the loss of two
legs, it may be difficult to justify an attorney's fee of $5 million.

      1. Compensatory Damages

Compensatory damages are intended to compensate the
victim for their actual losses, such as medical expenses, lost
wages, and pain and suffering. They are meant to make the
victim whole as if the injury had never happened.
Compensatory damages can be awarded in a variety of cases,
including personal injury, property damage, and wrongful
death. The amount of compensatory damages awarded will
vary depending on the specific facts of the case. No amount of
money can replace an arm, eye, or life, but monetary damages
can help with the costs of damage to property or hospital bills.
Experts use life expectancy tables to compute compensatory
damages with a degree of accuracy.

      2. Punitive Damages

Punitive damages are intended to punish the defendant for
their wrongful conduct and to deter others from engaging in
similar behavior. They are not meant to compensate the victim
for their losses. Punitive damages are not awarded in all cases.
They are typically only awarded in cases where the defendant's
conduct was particularly egregious, such as in cases of
intentional torts or gross negligence. Punitive damages can be
                                                                             TORTS | 110

subject to limitations. Courts suggest that these damages
cannot exceed a 10:1 ratio with the initial award amount.
Many states have been more aggressive with punitive damage
limits for personal injuries, with fixed caps starting at $250,000
in some states and up to $10,000,000 in others.

      3. Limitation of Damages

Limitation of damages refers to laws that restrict the amount
of damages that can be awarded in certain types of cases. These
laws are often put in place to protect defendants from excessive
liability. Limitation of damages laws can vary from state to
state. Some states have no limitations on damages, while others
have strict limits on the amount of damages that can be
awarded. Limitation cap amounts can range from $250,000
to $800,000; however, all make exceptions for cases involving
death and serious injuries like the loss of a limb during surgery.
Cases that provide these exceptions either permit a higher
damage cap or eliminate the cap altogether. Few states have
placed damage caps for personal injury claims.

Malpractice

Malpractice is a type of negligence that occurs when a hospital
or professional, such as a doctor, lawyer, or accountant, fails
to provide the care that a reasonably competent professional
would have provided in the same circumstances. Malpractice
111 | TORTS

can result in harm to the patient or death, and it can lead to
a lawsuit. Four elements must be proven to establish medical
malpractice:

   The healthcare professional has a duty of care to the
      patient.

   The healthcare professional breached that duty of care.
   The patient suffered damages as a result of the breach.
   The damages were caused by the breach of duty.

In medical malpractice cases, even though the standard of care
is determined by experts, the question of whether negligence
occurred is ultimately decided by a jury. In many cases, juries
find that liability exists, even when members of the profession
contend that the care provided was reasonable.

     UAE Medica Liability & Malpractice Law Explai

The number of malpractice suits against doctors and hospitals
has increased rapidly in recent years, and the size of the verdicts
                                                                             TORTS | 112

has also increased. This has had a significant impact on the
practice of medicine and the cost of malpractice insurance.
Many doctors have been unable to obtain adequate
malpractice insurance coverage, and some have been reluctant
to attempt medical procedures that could result in a
malpractice suit. As a result, many doctors are practicing
defensive medicine, which is more costly. Malpractice cases
against lawyers have also increased significantly, but the impact
on the cost of legal services is not as great as it is on medical
services. Malpractice litigation against accountants is another
area of growing significance.

   Defensive medicine is the practice of ordering tests or
procedures that are not strictly necessary to protect oneself
from a malpractice lawsuit. Defensive medicine can be costly
for both patients and healthcare providers. The cost of
malpractice insurance has increased significantly in recent
years, which has passed on costs to patients through higher
medical bills. Some doctors have changed their practice
patterns in response to the threat of malpractice lawsuits. For
example, some doctors may be less likely to perform risky
procedures or to admit patients who are considered to be high-
risk. Additionally, some states have had a shortage of specific
specialties due to the costs associated with malpractice
insurance for those providers.

How Can Doctors Avoid Malpractice Suits? Be Nice

Strict Liability

In tort law, strict liability is a legal doctrine that holds
someone responsible for the harm they cause, even if they did
not intend to cause harm or were not negligent. This doctrine
is based on the idea that certain activities are inherently
dangerous and that the people who engage in these activities
should be held responsible for the harm that they cause,
regardless of their intentions or level of care. The law of strict
liability began with owning dangerous animals and has since
expanded to include other types of activities, such as the
manufacturing of fireworks, toxic chemicals, and explosives.
In healthcare, this can extend to defective medical products
and equipment. These activities are also considered to be
inherently dangerous, and the people who engage in them
should be held responsible for the harm that they cause. Under
                                                                             TORTS | 114

strict liability, the plaintiff does not need to prove that the
defendant was negligent. Instead, the plaintiff only needs to
prove that the defendant engaged in the dangerous activity,
that the activity caused the harm, and that the plaintiff suffered
damages. This means that even if the defendant took all
reasonable precautions, they can still be held liable for the
harm caused by their dangerous activity.

   Restatement (Third) of Torts shows product liability
through three avenues: manufacturing defect, design defect,
and warning defect. The Restatement of the Law (Third) of
Torts is a multi-volume treatise on tort law published by the
American Law Institute (ALI). It is a revision of the
Restatement of the Law of Torts, published in 1934. The
Third Restatement is still under development, but it has been
published in several volumes, including:

   Liability for Physical and Emotional Harm (2010/2012)
   Apportionment of Liability (2000)
   Products Liability (1998)
   Liability for Economic Harm (2020)

The Third Restatement is a comprehensive and authoritative
source of tort law. It is used by judges, lawyers, and scholars
to interpret and apply tort law. The Third Restatement also
guides legislators and policymakers who are considering
changes to tort law. The Third Restatement has been criticized
by some for being too complex and for departing from
115 | TORTS

traditional tort principles. However, it is still considered to
be an important work of legal scholarship. The Restatement
(Third) of Torts 47 is a section that deals with the issue of
emotional harm. It provides that a plaintiff may recover for
emotional harm alone if the harm is severe and the defendant's
conduct is extreme and outrageous. This is a significant
departure from the traditional rule, which required plaintiffs
to prove that they had also suffered physical harm to recover
for emotional harm. The Restatement (Third) of Torts 47 has
been cited by courts in several cases, and it is likely to have a
significant impact on the law of emotional harm.

   A plaintiff must show that medical products depart from
the intended design to prove a manufacturing defect. A design
defect is determined by providing an alternative design that
provides similar benefits but a lower risk of harm. A warning
defect is a product defect that occurs when the manufacturer
fails to provide adequate warnings about the dangers of using
the product. examples include:

   A power tool that does not have any safety instructions.
   A children's toy that does not have a choking hazard

      warning.
   A medication that does not have a warning about its side

      effects.
   A car that does not have a warning about its blind spots.
   A lawnmower that does not have a warning about the

      dangers of operating it near children.

What is Strict Liability Crime? [YouTube] 2015 b

Intentional Torts

Intentional torts involve (1) interference with the personal
freedom of an individual, (2) interference with property rights,
(3) interference with economic relations, and (4) wrongful
communications.

 1. Assault
 2. Battery is defined as the harmful touching of someone

      without their consent.
 3. False imprisonment is the unlawful physical restraint

      of a patient. For example, when a patient is locked in a
      room and not permitted to leave.
 4. Invasion of privacy which occurs with improper
      disclosure of medical treatment information and
      violations protected under HIPAA. All patients have a
117 | TORTS

      right to the reasonable expectation of privacy. Other
      circumstances also exist outside of the medical industry,
      including phone tapping and the use of photos or
      images without permission.
 5. Mental Distress is a tort that occurs when someone
      intentionally or recklessly causes another person severe
      emotional distress. It can be caused by the high-pressure
      tactics of collection agencies, including violent cursing
      and accusations of dishonesty. However, it is not a tort
      when someone simply insists on their legal rights, even if
      they know that it will cause emotional distress.

                -Using publicity that places a person in a false

             light in the public eye

Defenses

In a tort case, the plaintiff must prove that the defendant's
actions were negligent and that the negligence caused the
plaintiff's injuries. The defendant can then raise an affirmative
defense to try to avoid liability. The two main affirmative
                                                                             TORTS | 120

defenses in tort law are the assumption of risk and
contributory/comparative negligence.

   Contributory/comparative negligence is a defense
      that applies when the plaintiff's own negligence
      contributed to their injuries. Awards to the plaintiff may
      be reduced or eliminated if the defendant can show that
      the plaintiff was negligent. For example, if a patient is
      noncompliant with treatment (medication regimes).

   Assumption of risk is a defense that applies when the
      plaintiff voluntarily and knowingly exposes themselves
      to the risk of harm. For example, if a person signs a
      waiver before participating in a dangerous activity, they
      may be assuming the risk of injury. For medical
      malpractice, the assumption of risk is more closely
      related to the doctrine of informed consent.

The defendant has the burden of proof for affirmative
defenses. This means that the defendant is responsible for
proving that the defense applies. The concept of informed
informed consent consent is related to the assumption of
risk. Informed consent means that the plaintiff voluntarily
agrees to an activity after being fully informed of the risks
involved. If the plaintiff does not give informed consent, they
may be able to recover damages even if they assumed the risk
of injury. Finally, tort claims may be dismissed if they are not
filed within the time of the statute of limitations. The statute
121 | TORTS

of limitations is a law that sets a time limit on how long after an
injury a person can file a lawsuit. If a lawsuit is not filed within
the statute of limitations, it will be dismissed. The following
must be disclosed for informed consent to be effective:

         a. The diagnosis

         b. What the recommended treatment is, and its
purpose

         c. Benefits and risks of this treatment

         d. What alternatives are available, including no
treatment

         e. Benefits and risks of alternatives
   Informed consent shields the medical personnel from
liability concerning procedures described in the consent, or
if an unexpected circumstance is addressed and the patient
is unable to be consulted. An example is life-saving measures
during surgery.

     Key Takeaways
                                                                TORTS | 122

 A tort is a civil wrongdoing. When a medical
   provider's actions or inactions fail to meet the
   medical standard of care, their behavior
   constitutes medical negligence. If their
   medical negligence causes their patient to
   suffer an injury, it becomes medical
   malpractice.

 Proof of negligence requires four elements:
   duty, breach, causation, and damages.

 The Learned Hand Rule: B<PL (B=burden,
   P=probability, L=injury)

 Standards of care are defined as the actions a
   similar individual would do in that
   circumstance.

 Defenses for tort include contributory
   negligence, assumption of risk, informed
   consent, and statute of limitations.

 Correlation does not equal causation.
 Types of damages: compensatory (actual

   losses) and punitive (punishment wrongful for
   conduct)
 Strict Liability is a legal doctrine that holds
   someone responsible for the harm they cause,
   even if they did not intend to cause harm or
   were not negligent.
123 | TORTS

           Intentional torts are willful wrongdoings that
             interfere with an individual's freedom or
             rights.

CONTRACT LAW

Contract disputes by Nick Youngson CC BY-SA 3.0 Pix4free

Introduction

One of the most significant areas of business law is contracts.
All industry relationships are shaped by contracts, which are
ubiquitous. An agreement is created whenever a business hires
a worker, a company purchases a product or service, or a
patient seeks a healthcare provider. Contracts are structured
promises. A patient commits to pay the doctor's reasonable
125 | CONTRACT LAW

price in exchange for the doctor using her best judgment in
treating them. Beyond making promises, another way to see a
contract is as a record of a relationship. The agreement outlines
each party's obligations and rights. Contracts can typically be
express (written or verbal), implied by fact (handshake), or
implied by law. Both express and implied contracts are the
product of an agreement between the contracting parties. This
consensus of opinion is known as mutual assent. In an
express contract, the parties formally agree to the terms of
the agreement through written or verbal communication. A
contract that is implied in reality is one where the actions of
the parties and the environment indicate that they agree on
the conditions. Voidable contracts allow one of the parties (but
not the other) to escape the legal obligations of the contract.
In an implied contract, the conduct of the parties and the
surrounding circumstances show mutual assent to the terms.
Contracts implied in law are recognized by the law on the basis
of justice and equity but may not include the literal assent
of both parties. These unique situations are referred to as
contracts "implied in law," "quasi-contract," or "quantum
meruit" (Perry & Thompson, 2017).

What is a contract?

Essentially, a contract is a legally enforceable promise.
Typically, a contract is formed with two or more parties
agreeing to something, and if one fails to uphold the
agreement, that is considered a breach of contract. To be
considered a legal contract, the following items must be
present: mutual assent, consideration, legality, and capacity.
The elements of a contract, whether written or verbal, include
offer, consideration, and acceptance. An enforceable
contract is legally binding. A breach of contract occurs when
one or more of the terms of the contract are violated (Perry &
Thompson, 2017).

Elements of a contract

For a contract to be legally enforceable when executed, several
factors must be considered. The first is the competency of the
parties. Certain classes of individuals (minors, prisoners, or
mentally incompetent) are considered incompetent in a legal
capacity to create a binding contract. Whether verbally or
written, the following elements of a contract must exist: offer,
consideration, and acceptance (Morgan, 2019).

A. Offers

An offer must be created with reasonable expectations where
the offeror presents a commitment in exchange for one of the
three following responses by the offeree:
                                                              CONTRACT LAW | 128

 1. does something (performs an act),
 2. refrains from doing something (forbearance), or
 3. promises to do something or to refrain from doing

      something.

Contracts: The Offer [YouTube] 2012 by Center fo

Elements of an offer:

 1. Intent (intent to be bound to terms) statements lacking
      intent

 2. Definite terms: material and essential terms
 3. Communication by offeror or offeree

Duration

The duration of an offer typically refers to the period during
which the terms and conditions of a particular offer or
proposal are valid. The duration of an offer is important
129 | CONTRACT LAW

because it sets a time limit for the recipient to accept the offer
before it expires. The specific duration of an offer can vary
widely depending on the context and the intent of the parties
involved. In some cases, offers might be open for a short
period, such as a few days or a week, while in other cases,
they might have a longer duration, such as several months.
The duration of an offer is often outlined in the offer itself or
accompanying documentation (Morgan, 2019).

   It's important to note that if an offer has a stated expiration
date or time frame, the offer generally becomes invalid once
that time has passed. If the recipient wishes to accept the offer
after it has expired, they would need to reach out to the offeror
(the party making the offer) to see if the offer can be extended
or renegotiated. For legally binding contracts and important
agreements, it's advisable to clearly specify the duration of the
offer to avoid misunderstandings and ensure that all parties are
on the same page regarding the timeframe for acceptance. The
offeree has the power to accept until the offer is terminated.
An offer that has been properly communicated continues in
existence until it

 1. lapses or expires,
 2. is terminated by operation of law (illegality and

      incapacity),
 3. is rejected by the offeree,
 4. is revoked (directly or indirectly) by the offeror, or
 5. receives a counteroffer (Morgan, 2019).
                                                              CONTRACT LAW | 130

Methods of terminating an offer:

       1. Lapse of time
       2. Termination by operation of law
       3. Rejection by offereeCounteroffer
       4. Revocation by offeror
       5. Counteroffer

Mutual Assent

For a contract to be formed, parties must voluntarily agree
to the terms, which is mutual assent (Perry & Thompson,
2017). Once an offer is made by the offeror and accepted by
the offeree, it is validated, provided the following exists:

 1. Present intention to contract
 2. Reasonably definite terms
 3. Communication of offer to the proper party

Once an agreement is reached, an offeree performs tasks
requested by the offeror. Tasks must be clearly communicated;
otherwise, there is no mutual assent. Moreover, there is a need
for clarity in defining the specific terms.

Contract Defenses for Lack of Mutual Assent: Mis

B. Consideration

Consideration is not a concrete concept. For consideration to
exist, there must be a legal detriment (forgoing something a
person is entitled to or doing something a person does not have
to do) as a result of "bargained for exchanged." An example
of this could be the exchange of money. Furthermore, courts
do not determine if consideration is fair; however, if no money
is exchanged for the promise, the courts will not enforce it
because it lacks consideration. In the absence of fraud,
oppression, undue influence, illegality, or statutory limitation,
parties have the freedom to make any contract; moreover, the
fact that it is onerous or burdensome for one or the other has
been immaterial (Perry & Thompson, 2017).

C. Acceptance

Once an offer by one party (offeror) has been made, the
acceptance by the offeree is an indication of their willingness
to be bound to the terms of that offer. Once accepted in the
affirmative, there is typically a written or electronically signed
offer. It must be noted that the offeree is the only person that
can accept the offer. In other words, the offeree cannot assign
the offer to a third party. Offerees are protected by a rule
making the acceptance effective at the time of dispatch, also
known as the mailbox or deposited acceptance rule. However,
applying the mailbox rule can be avoided if the offeror states
that the offer is not effective until it is actually received (Perry
& Thompson, 2017). Courts can enforce offers that prescribe
an exclusive method of acceptance. A valid acceptance requires
the following:
                                                               CONTRACT LAW | 134

C. Other Requirements

For a contract to be lawful, other requirements in addition to
mutual assent and consideration are needed. Both parties must
have sufficient legal capability to enter the contract. This is
similar to consent for treatment in healthcare. For a party to
have capacity, the person must be conscious, have the ability
to understand the contract, or has a legally appointed guardian
by the court (Perry & Thompson, 2017).

   Contracts must also contain legality. Courts will not
135 | CONTRACT LAW

enforce contracts that extend over the limits of public policy.
One common example is a "non-compete clause" where one
party promises not to compete with the other prohibiting
them from working for competing businesses. Most courts
hesitate to enforce this because it reduces competition and
limits labor mobility. Whether to enforce a non-compete
clause is determined by whether:

   (1) there is a legitimate business interest for the clause and
   (2) whether the clause is tailored to protect legitimate
business interests (Perry & Thompson, 2017).

Non-compete agreements are generally violations of public
policy and are unenforceable in many states unless:

   It protects legitimate property interests or some
      legitimate interests of the employer

   It is reasonably tailored to the circumstances, including
      time, location, and business activity, within reason

It should be noted that these types of contracts must be put
in writing to be enforceable. The Statute of Frauds requires
certain contracts to be in writing. These contracts include
contracts for real estate, contracts for goods over a certain
value, suretyships, and contracts that cannot be performed
within one year. To enforce a contract that falls under the
Statute of Frauds, there must be a written document signed by
both parties (Perry & Thompson, 2017).

Balancing Test

The balancing test is a complex and evolving legal concept.
However, it is an important tool that allows judges to make
informed decisions about the enforceability of contracts. In
contract law, a balancing test is a judicial test in which the
judge weighs the importance of multiple factors in a legal case
(Morgan, 2019). The factors that are weighed may vary
depending on the specific case, but they may include the
following:

 The intent of the parties to the contract
 The fairness of the contract
 The public interest
 The economic consequences of enforcing or not

   enforcing the contract

The balancing test is often used in cases where there is no
clear rule or precedent to apply. In these cases, the judge must
weigh the competing interests of the parties and decide which
interest is more important. One example of a balancing test
in contract law is the unconscionability doctrine.
Unconscionability is a doctrine that allows a court to
invalidate a contract if it is found to be unfair or one-sided.
The balancing test is a flexible tool that allows judges to take
into account the specific facts of each case. However, it can also
be criticized for being subjective and unpredictable (Morgan,
2019).
139 | CONTRACT LAW

   Here are some other examples of balancing tests used in
contract law:

   The reasonable expectations test
   The good faith and fair dealing doctrine
   The economic duress doctrine
   The adhesion contract doctrine

Remedies

Remedies are an important part of the legal system. Remedies
help to ensure individual rights are projected and wrongdoing
should be compensated. In terms of legal remedies, it is divided
into two main categories: legal remedies and equitable
remedies. Legal remedies are based on the law and awarded by
the court. Equitable remedies are based on fairness and justice
and are awarded by a court of equity (Perry & Thompson,
2017).

   Table 2. Legal and Equitable Remedies
Legal Remedies                       CONTRACT LAW | 140

Reliance                Injunction
Expectation             Specific Performance
Consequential (must be  Rescission
foreseeable)
Liquidated

Often, the calculations of damages can be uncertain. However,
contracts can stipulate the level of damages in the case of
breach, and this is termed liquidated damages. Liquidated
damages act to provide assurances that both parties intend to
uphold their portion of the contract. Unfortunately, courts
may hesitate to enforce liquidated damages, specifically if they
are seen as punitive. Enforcement of liquidated damages relies
on whether or not the agreed-upon damages are reasonable
estimates of damages based on the information known at the
time of contracting. Consequential damages arise when the
breach of one contract affects the breached-upon party's
ability to perform another contract. Punitive damages are
awarded to discourage particular behaviors, like fraud (Perry &
Thompson, 2017).

   Injunctions are court-enforced orders that require one
party to do or refrain from doing something, and it can be
either temporary or permanent. Damages are monetary awards
141 | CONTRACT LAW

that are given to compensate someone for a loss that they have
suffered. Damages are typically awarded when someone has
been injured or harmed by the wrongful act of another person.
Damages are a liability rule because they allow the injured
party to recover money from the person who caused the harm.
An injunction is a court order that requires someone to do or
refrain from doing something. Injunctions are typically used
to prevent someone from causing harm to another person or
to protect someone's rights. Injunctions are a property rule
because they allow the person who is being harmed to prevent
the harm from happening in the first place. In other words,
damages are a way of compensating someone for harm that has
already been done, while injunctions are a way of preventing
harm from happening in the first place (Perry & Thompson,
2017).

                     CONTRACT LAW | 142

Equitable Doctrines

Equitable doctrines are a set of legal principles typically used
to supplement the common law. Equitable doctrines are an
important part of contract law. They help to ensure that
contracts are fair and just and that they are enforced in a way
that is consistent with the principles of equity (Morgan, 2019).
Equitable doctrines can be used to intervene in contract law in
a number of ways. For example, they can be used to:

 Invalidate a contract that is
   unconscionable: Unconscionability is a doctrine that
   allows a court to invalidate a contract if it is found to be
   unfair or one-sided.

 Prevent a party from enforcing a contract that they
   have obtained through fraud or duress: Fraud and
   duress are both grounds for invalidating a contract.

 Order-specific performance: Specific performance is a
   remedy that requires a party to a contract to perform
   their obligations under the contract. This remedy is
   typically only available when damages are not an
   adequate remedy.

 Remedy a breach of contract: If one party breaches a
   contract, the other party may be able to seek equitable
   relief, such as an injunction or specific performance.
143 | CONTRACT LAW

Promissory Estoppel

Promissory estoppel is a legal doctrine that prevents a party
from withdrawing a promise made to another party if the
latter has reasonably relied on that promise. A promise made
without consideration is generally not enforceable. Estoppels
were created as rules of evidence, and some (such as estoppel
by deed and judgment estoppel) remain evidential in character.
It has the same binding effects as a valid contract, where a
breach can result in reliance damages or expected damages
(Morgan, 2019).

Quasi-Contract (Quantum Meruit)

A quasi-contract (implied contract) is a legal obligation
imposed by the court to prevent one party from unjustly
benefiting at the expense of another party and arises when
one party provides services to another party without any
agreement. Courts can award a reasonable value for services
provided. Quasi-contracts can be imposedunjust enrichment
by law to prevent unjust enrichment. In the absence of a true
contract, it is either expressed or implied in the fact.
However, because quasi-contracts are not true contracts,
mutual assent is not necessary. Furthermore, when a party sues
for damages under a quasi-contract, the remedy is typically
either restitution or recovery under the theory of quantum
meruit (Morgan, 2019).

Introduction

For more than 2,500 years, patient privacy has been a
fundamental principle in healthcare, as demonstrated by the
Hippocratic Oath and other early Greek medical texts. This
chapter provides a thorough overview of the legal aspects
associated with privacy, confidentiality, and information
management in the healthcare delivery setting. In addition,
intellectual property law is critical in healthcare, as some of the
most significant healthcare advancements are safeguarded by
intellectual property doctrines. We will explore each principle
and its role in securing healthcare business assets (Perry &
Thompson, 2017).

Privacy and Confidentiality

The commitment to privacy has guided healthcare for
centuries. The AMA Principles of Medical Ethics (2001) state,
"A physician shall respect the rights of patients, colleagues,
and other health professionals, and shall safeguard patient
confidence and privacy within the constraints of the law." The
Hippocratic Oath, attributed to the ancient Greek physician
Hippocrates, required physicians to "abstain from whatever
is deleterious and mischievous," seeking only the benefit of
their patients. Since 1847, the AMA code has been revised
extensively but has maintained the secrecy surrounding the
patient-provider relationship (faqs.org, n.d.).

   The principles of privacy in healthcare give rise to laws and
regulations that dictate patient confidentiality, which involves
protecting personal health information. Fundamentally,
patients have a reasonable expectation that their health
information will remain confidential, except in certain
circumstances. Exceptions to confidentiality may be
exceptional, as in the Tarasoff case, or routine, such as when
processing insurance claims, conducting quality control
         PRIVACY, INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY, AND CYBERLAW | 150

reviews, or fulfilling research or medical education goals. The
importance of respecting patient privacy cannot be
understated. Furthermore, legal and regulatory penalties
against violations of confidentiality can be significant (Perry &
Thompson, 2017).

Confidentiality

The obligation to uphold patient confidentiality arises from
the fiduciary bond between a patient and their healthcare
provider. The basis for this duty is the notion that respecting a
patient's privacy will inspire them to seek medical care. Courts
typically view confidentiality breaches unfavorably (Perry &
Thompson, 2017).
151 | PRIVACY, INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY, AND CYBERLAW

Exceptions

Although it is the responsibility of healthcare providers to
prioritize patient privacy and confidentiality, some exceptions
exist. The intricacies of any given situation can complicate the
application of legal principles, so the possibility of exceptions
should always be taken into account when analyzing a case
(Perry & Thompson, 2017).

   There are situations where healthcare providers or
organizations may have a responsibility to disclose confidential
information to parties other than the patient. For example,
quality control or peer review may allow for the disclosure
of private information in some cases. In other cases, state or
federal law, as well as common law, may require confidential
information to be shared to protect a specific third party or the
broader community. Statutory examples of situations where a
breach of confidentiality may be justified include:

   Reporting of communicable diseases to state public
      health authorities;

   Wounds (from either a knife or gunshot) that appear to
      be non-accidental;

   Suspected child abuse;
   Suspected elder abuse; and
   Diagnosis of epilepsy among those licensed to drive or

      operate heavy machinery (Perry & Thompson, 2017).

Health Information Privacy

In 1972, New York designed a law to prevent drugs from being
diverted into illegal channels. The law required State Health
Department officials to collect personal information,
including the name, address, and age of anyone who received
certain Schedule II drugs with a prescription from a doctor.
This information was to be transferred to computer files and
kept for five years, with safeguards in place to protect patient
privacy. However, a group of patients who regularly received
Schedule II drugs and their prescribing physicians challenged
the constitutionality of the patient identification
requirements. The lower court ruled that the doctor-patient
relationship is protected by the Constitution's right to privacy
and that the law's patient identification provisions were too
broad. In 1977, the Supreme Court made a significant ruling
in Whalen v. Roe that recognized a limited constitutional right
to privacy for health information. While upholding the state
law, it recognized a "statutory or regulatory duty to avoid
unwarranted disclosures" based on the Constitution (Perry &
Thompson, 2017).

Health Insurance Portability and
Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA)

On August 21, 1996, President Bill Clinton signed the Health
Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 into law.
153 | PRIVACY, INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY, AND CYBERLAW

HIPAA established protocols for safeguarding personally
identifiable information held by the healthcare and healthcare
insurance sectors against fraud and theft and addressed
restrictions on healthcare insurance coverage. Covered entities,
such as healthcare providers and businesses, are prohibited
from disclosing protected information to anyone other than
the patient and their authorized representatives without
consent, subject to certain exceptions. Patients are free to
receive information about themselves and are not restricted
from voluntarily sharing their health information (Perry &
Thompson, 2017). HIPAA is made up of five titles:

   Title I safeguards health insurance coverage for workers
      and their families,

   Title II sets national standards for electronic health care
      transactions and national identifiers, and

   Titles III, IV, and V govern pre-tax medical spending
      accounts, group health plans, and company-owned life
      insurance policies, respectively.

In January 2013, the Final Omnibus Rule updated HIPAA
to include the HITECH Act requirements. The revised
regulations enhanced safeguards for patient confidentiality,
granted additional privileges to individuals concerning their
medical data and bolstered the government's capacity to
uphold compliance with more severe penalties for HIPAA
violations. However, the HIPAA Privacy Rule provides
         PRIVACY, INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY, AND CYBERLAW | 154

waivers during times of natural disaster (Perry & Thompson,
2017).

   It is important to note that HIPAA defines a "Covered
Entity" and prohibits the use of personal health information
(PHI) for any purposes other than treatment, payment, or
health care operations. This excludes any information that has
been de-identified. To be considered de-identified data, the
information may not contain the following information:

   Name
   Address (all geographic subdivisions smaller than a state,

      including street address, city county, and zip code)
   All elements (except years) of dates related to an

      individual (including birthdate, admission date,
      discharge date, date of death, and exact age if over 89)
   Number of relatives in the household
   Vehicle or other device serial numbers
   Employer
   Telephone numbers
   Fax number
   Email address
   Social Security Number
   Medical record number
   Health plan beneficiary number
   Account number
   Certificate or license number
   Vehicle identifiers and serial numbers, including license

      plate numbers
   Device identifiers and serial numbers
   Web URL
   Internet Protocol (IP) Address
   Finger or voice print
   Photographic image: Photographic images are not

      limited to images of the face.
   Any other characteristic that could uniquely identify the

      individual (Loyola University Chicago, 2023).

      A. HIPAA Myths

HIPAA permits healthcare providers to discuss a patient's
condition with others in a semi-private room or over the phone
with the patient, another provider, or a family member. It
also allows providers to leave messages on a patient's home
answering machine and to display a patient's name next to
their hospital room door or a patient care sign, such as "fall
risk" or "diabetic diet," at the patient's bedside or outside their
hospital room. However, HIPAA does NOT grant patients
an unlimited right to their healthcare information. Requests
for records may be denied if the information contains
psychotherapy notes or was compiled for use in a civil,
criminal, or administrative proceeding. Also, if a patient wants
a copy of their medical chart, they are responsible for the cost
of copying it (Perry & Thompson, 2017).
         PRIVACY, INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY, AND CYBERLAW | 156

      B. Enforcement

If there are accusations of noncompliance, the Department of
Health and Human Services (HHS) is obligated to investigate
and ascertain if the violations were due to "willful neglect."
In reality, "willful neglect" does not require a high level of
proof, and penalties can be substantial. In October 2009, the
HHS Office of Civil Rights began publishing the names of
healthcare entities with reported data breaches, thus creating
the "HIPAA Wall of Shame." Details include the name of
the covered entity or business associate that experienced the
breach, the category of breach, the location of the breached
PHI, and the number of individuals affected. Because of the
intricacy of HIPAA regulations and the potential for huge
fines for non-compliance, it would be wise for firms and
individuals to proceed with an excess of care when using and
contemplating the disclosure of PHI (HIPAA Journal, n.d.).

Health Information Technology for
Economic and Clinical Health
(HITECH) Amendment 2021

In 2018, the HHS issued a Request for Information to explore
ways to alleviate the administrative burden of HIPAA
compliance and improve healthcare coordination through
better data sharing. In response, many covered entities and
business associates requested a safe harbor provision in the
157 | PRIVACY, INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY, AND CYBERLAW

event of a data breach if they had adhered to the safeguards of
the Security Rule. The HITECH Act was amended in 2021,
resulting in the HIPAA Safe Harbor law, which provides the
Office for Civil Rights at HHS with the flexibility to refrain
from enforcing action, mitigate penalties for HIPAA
violations, or shorten the duration of a Corrective Action Plan
if the offending party has implemented a recognized security
framework and has been operating it for twelve months prior
to the breach or other security-related violation. According to
Astra Security (2023), "The third quarter of 2022 saw 1 in
42 healthcare organizations targeted by ransomware attacks.
The healthcare sector saw a 60% increase in attacks in 2021,
with an average of 1426 attacks per week. 90% of healthcare
institutions have experienced at least one security breach in the
previous few years."

         PRIVACY, INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY, AND CYBERLAW | 158

Breaches

There were no federal requirements to notify patients of a
healthcare privacy breach before HITECH. After its
implementation in 2009, HITECH now mandates that all
affected individuals be notified when protected health
information (PHI) is breached. HITECH further defines a
breach as "the unauthorized acquisition, access, use, or
disclosure of PHI, which compromises the security or privacy
of the information." Furthermore, a breach is anything that
poses a significant risk of financial, reputational, or other harm
to the individual due to the compromise of PHI (Perry &
Thompson, 2017). Common breaches include:

 1. Lost, missing, or stolen laptops or other portable devices;
 2. Disposal of documents, computers, or other materials;
 3. Hacking; and
 4. third-party mistakes.

To protect its PHI, a covered entity must establish
administrative, physical, and technological safeguards, as
mandated by the HITECH regulations. HITECH provides a
safe harbor for encrypted devices. Apart from this, the covered
entity must have administrative safeguards such as policies,
procedures, and documentation to ensure that the policies and
procedures have been put into effect. HITECH necessitates
that the covered entity conduct a risk analysis and devise a
risk management plan to mitigate identified vulnerabilities.
159 | PRIVACY, INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY, AND CYBERLAW

Therefore, the covered entity should have a documented risk
analysis policy and a corresponding risk management plan in
place (Perry & Thompson, 2017).

Notification Requirements

Once an incident constitutes a breach, a covered entity must
decide on the appropriate method of informing the impacted
patients, as per HITECH regulations. HITECH requires that
the covered entity should notify each individual whose
unsecured PHI has been breached in writing, using first-class
mail, unless the patient has previously consented to receive
email communication. In cases where there is a possibility of
imminent misuse of the PHI, the notification can be made
via telephone. If the covered entity lacks enough information
to notify 10 or more individuals, substitute notice becomes
necessary. The substitute notice involves a conspicuous
posting on the covered entity's website for 90 days or a notice
in major print or broadcast media in areas where the affected
individuals are likely to reside. If 500 or more individuals in
a jurisdiction are affected, notice to prominent media outlets
is required, along with immediate reporting to the Office for
Civil Rights (OCR). The notification must be expedited no
later than 60 days after the date of discovery of the breach
(Perry & Thompson, 2017).

The notification to affected individuals must contain various
details, such as a description of the incident, the breach date
         PRIVACY, INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY, AND CYBERLAW | 160

(if known), the date the breach was discovered by the covered
entity, the type of compromised PHI, recommendations on
measures individuals can take to protect themselves from
potential harm, a description of the investigation, the
mitigation or protection measures implemented by the
covered entity to prevent future breaches, and contact
information, including a toll-free number, for addressing
affected persons' questions. State laws could influence the
notification's content based on the data elements involved. For
example, if an electronic breach of PHI in Florida includes
social security numbers and impacts patients residing in
Florida, it may necessitate an analysis beyond HIPAA/
HITECH requirements. The notification requirements for
each state are different, and some states may have stricter
regulations than HITECH. In Florida, notification to
residents must occur within 45 days, with the attorney general
receiving notification as well. A covered entity must look
beyond just notification to patients and include attorneys
general, other consumer agencies, OCR, law enforcement, the
media, and credit reporting agencies when social security
numbers are involved in the breach (Perry & Thompson,
2017).

Response

According to HHS.gov, the HITECH Act does not define
"harm," nor does it provide direction to aid HHS in defining
161 | PRIVACY, INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY, AND CYBERLAW

the term. When a breach occurs in a covered entity, it should
activate its breach incident response team, which is comprised
of individuals from the C-Suite and a multidisciplinary team
including legal, compliance, information technology,
communications, and customer relations. In some instances,
security and human resources may also be involved (Perry &
Thompson, 2017).

   Crisis management processes should include:

   daily status report meetings;
   daily goal setting;
   assignment of tasks for the team to accomplish;
   tracking of progress; and
   decision making.

Priorities for the crisis management team include:

   end the compromise of security or remedy the risk
      control deficiencies;

   restore the functioning of the affected systems;
   determine the root cause of the incident and mitigation

      and protection to be utilized;
   evaluate any notice obligations (federal, state, and

      contractual);
   outreach to key customers and business partners;
   prepare media and internal communications; and
   issue notification.
         PRIVACY, INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY, AND CYBERLAW | 162

Costs

In 2022, IBM Security's "Cost of a Data Breach Report"
provided evidence that healthcare data breaches cost an average
of $10.1 million per incident. This was a 9.4% from the
previous year and a 41.6 percent increase from 2020.
Healthcare sectors suffered higher ransomware attack costs
on average, at $4.82 million ($1 million more than the average
cost for other industries) (McKeon, 2022).

   In the event of security breaches involving sensitive data,
healthcare establishments should consider credit monitoring
and utilizing internal call centers. Also, considerations should
be taken for partnering with a crisis management firm for
effective communication strategies and protecting the
healthcare entity's reputation. Lastly, they should engage
experienced healthcare privacy and data breach attorneys for
guidance on regulatory compliance and overseeing the
notification process.

Post-Breach

After a healthcare data breach, organizations must address
media and affected individuals' concerns, especially for
breaches impacting over 500 people. These breaches can
undermine community trust and attract significant media
attention. Patient inquiries and effective communication by
the incident response team are essential. Following the crisis,
the Office for Civil Rights (OCR) investigated the entity's
163 | PRIVACY, INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY, AND CYBERLAW

HIPAA/HITECH compliance and the breach's cause,
potentially resulting in fines and penalties. Compliance
documentation is crucial, and organizations may face requests
from other regulatory bodies or legal actions related to
Protected Health Information (PHI) disclosure (Perry &
Thompson, 2017).

Protection and Prevention

To ensure compliance with HIPAA/HITECH, covered
entities must maintain constant vigilance and implement
preventive measures against breaches and violations. These
measures include adhering to administrative requirements,
designating a privacy officer, conducting a risk analysis, and
executing a risk management plan. Additionally, organizations
should employ technical and physical safeguards, prioritize
encryption, provide staff training on PHI disclosure
repercussions, and incorporate IT audits. Acquiring cyber
liability insurance or exploring alternative risk financing
options can add extra protection against healthcare data
breaches (Perry & Thompson, 2017).

Exceptions

Patients cannot access all medical records under HIPAA.
Providers can withhold certain categories, like psychotherapy
notes, and have the discretion to deny disclosure if it may harm
the patient. Some test results follow state-specific or federal
         PRIVACY, INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY, AND CYBERLAW | 164

regulations on disclosure, such as HIV tests or substance abuse
cases.

Emerging Issues

As healthcare increasingly adopts electronic platforms, health
law continues to evolve for better protection of individuals
affected by data breaches. Electronic Health Records, health
information exchanges, and patient portals introduce new
vulnerabilities as organizations focus on user-friendliness.
Wireless and mobile devices increase the risk of accidental
losses and potential disclosures, especially when lacking robust
security measures. The growing use of cloud computing and
offshore data storage adds further challenges in protecting
Protected Health Information. Collaboration between
stakeholders, policymakers, and technology developers is
crucial to establishing guidelines, standards, and regulations
that ensure the responsible implementation of AI in EHR
systems.

   The integration of AI with EHRs presents several
challenges, including data privacy and security concerns, issues
of bias and fairness, interpretability and transparency of AI
models, questions of liability and accountability, the need for
data quality and standardization, and ethical and legal
implications. These concerns must be carefully addressed to
ensure effective and safe AI applications in electronic health
records (Perry & Thompson, 2017).

Intellectual Property in
Healthcare

The concept of intellectual property pertains to non-physical
assets that embody the creations of the human intellect, as
opposed to physical labor. The legal entitlements associated
with intellectual property encompass those elements of
intellectual property that can be safeguarded according to a
country's laws. Typically, the safeguarding of intellectual
property rights falls into one of the following categories:
patents, trademarks, copyrights, or trade secrets (Perry &
Thompson, 2017).

Intellectual Property [YouTube] 2016 by DurhamUn

Protecting intellectual property is crucial because it prevents
misappropriation, encourages creative thinking, and fosters
innovation for a thriving economy. It holds significant value
for businesses, with Fortune 500 companies estimating that
         PRIVACY, INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY, AND CYBERLAW | 166

45-75% of their value is attributed to intellectual property.
Ensuring its security maintains its value for its proprietor
(Morgan, 2019).

Patent

Patents are government-granted monopolies for a limited time,
with utility, design, and plant patents being the most common
types. To apply for a patent, the inventor must draft claims
and ensure the invention is new, useful, and nonobvious. A
patent search and consideration of prior art are crucial steps
to proving an invention's novelty and its nonobviousness must
167 | PRIVACY, INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY, AND CYBERLAW

be evident to someone skilled in the relevant field (Perry &
Thompson, 2017).

      A. What can be patented?

Patent litigation is complex and costly for healthcare
businesses. Historically, patents covered processes, machines,
manufacturers, or compositions of matter, while natural laws,
phenomena, and abstract ideas were not patentable. However,
the U.S. Supreme Court expanded patentable subject matter
to include some algorithms between 1972 and 1981 (Perry &
Thompson, 2017).

      B. Patent Trolls

Patent trolls, or non-practicing entities, pose significant
problems for healthcare businesses by filing infringement
lawsuits without creating new products or ideas. They
capitalize on the high costs of patent litigation, leading to
increased technology development costs and potential market
delays. The healthcare industry, particularly the electronic
medical record (EMR) sector, is increasingly targeted by patent
trolls, requiring more attention to patents as both valuable
assets and potential business threats (Perry & Thompson,
2017).
         PRIVACY, INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY, AND CYBERLAW | 168

      C. Patent Infringement

Patent infringement involves the unauthorized making, using,
selling, offering to sell, or importing of patented inventions.
Encouraging such acts and supplying components of a
patented invention also constitute infringement. The
Supreme Court has broadened penalties and interpretations
to reduce troll activity, limiting the Federal Circuit's authority
to overturn infringement decisions and setting an "abuse of
discretion" standard for attorney fees under 35 U.S.C. Section
285.

Trade Secrets

Companies face a choice between filing for a patent or
protecting an invention as a trade secret. Trade secrets offer
limited protection, only allowing the owner to sue those who
improperly disclose them. Patents provide more extensive
monopoly rights. Trademarks are used to identify products
and services, preventing consumer confusion while not
restraining legitimate competition. Trademarks are words,
symbols, logos, and marks used to identify projects and
services. The purpose of protection is to identify the source
of the product or service and avoid consumer confusion;
however, the trade-off is that the protection of a trademark
should not restrain legitimate competition (Perry &
Thompson, 2017).

Copyright

The copyright system encourages the creation and
dissemination of new, creative works by granting authors
         PRIVACY, INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY, AND CYBERLAW | 170

rights such as copying, distributing, and creating derivative
works. These rights apply to various types of works, including
literature, music, and architecture. However, limitations exist,
such as the difference between expression and underlying idea
and the "fair use" exception. Authors generally hold the
copyright of their works, except in cases of work-for-hire where
it belongs to the employer unless agreed otherwise (Perry &
Thompson, 2017).

Copyright Protection: What Can Be Protected and

A company website contains various copyrightable elements
such as text, images, videos, and sound recordings. The
company must ensure they either own the copyright, have a
license, or use public domain content. Additionally, they
should acquire permission from individuals in images due to
"rights of publicity." This also applies to promotional
materials and other documents used to support healthcare
services and products (Perry & Thompson, 2017).
171 | PRIVACY, INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY, AND CYBERLAW

   However, there are some gray areas regarding copyright
laws. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) allows
generic manufacturers to use the same labels and user guides
and requires identical labeling for generic medications.

   The U.S. Copyright System has conflicting goals of
encouraging creativity but also enabling distribution. It
protects expression, but not ideas or facts. It protects the
author under "works for hire," and no registration is required.
Further, it provides protection for a very long period. It
protects against copying but not independent creation. There
are exceptions for "fair use" of copyrights permitted (Perry &
Thompson, 2017).

     A. Work for Hire

The owner of a copyright can be someone other than the
creator if the situation falls under the work-for-hire
doctrine. There are two categories of works that are considered
"works made for hire" under U.S. copyright law. The first
category includes works created by employees within the scope
of their employment. In this situation, the employer is the
copyright owner of the work.

   The second category includes works created by independent
contractors, but only if the work is specially ordered or
commissioned, comes within one of nine limited categories of
works, and there is a written agreement between the parties
specifying that the creation is a work made for hire.
         PRIVACY, INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY, AND CYBERLAW | 172

   The nine limited categories of works are:

   A contribution to a collective work
   Part of a motion picture or other audiovisual work
   A translation
   Supplementary work
   A compilation
   Instructional text
   A test
   The answer material for a test
   An atlas

If a work does not fall into one of these nine categories, it
cannot be considered a work made for hire unless there is a
written agreement between the parties specifying that it is. In
general, it is important to be aware of the work-made-for-hire
doctrine if you are creating or commissioning a work that is
protected by copyright. By understanding the doctrine, you
can ensure that you are the rightful owner of the copyright in
the work.

   Here are some additional details about the work-made-for-
hire doctrine:

   The work-made-for-hire doctrine is a default rule that
      applies if the parties do not have a written agreement
      specifying otherwise.

   The work-made-for-hire doctrine can be beneficial for
173 | PRIVACY, INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY, AND CYBERLAW

      employers and independent contractors because it can
      simplify the process of transferring copyright ownership.
   However, the work-made-for-hire doctrine can also be
      disadvantageous for employees and independent
      contractors because it can prevent them from owning
      the copyright in their own work

     B. Copyright Infringement

According to Morgan (2019), "copyright infringement
occurs when a party copies all or a substantial amount of a
copyrighted work without the owner's permission." There are
two popular defenses to copyright infringement under the
Copyright Act of 1976: the first sale doctrine and the fair use
defense. The first sale doctrine allows the resale of copyrighted
works after they have been sold by the copyright holder. The
fair use defense allows the use of copyrighted works for certain
purposes, such as education, literary criticism, research, and
social comment (Morgan, 2019).

   The fair use defense is a complex one, and the four factors
that courts consider in deciding whether it applies are:

   The purpose and character of the use by the defendant,
      particularly whether it was for profit

   The nature of the copyrighted work
   The amount of work used by the defendant
   The impact of the use by the defendant on markets for
         PRIVACY, INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY, AND CYBERLAW | 174

      the copyrighted work

Copyright infringement can be either direct or indirect. Direct
infringement occurs when a party copies all or a substantial
amount of a copyrighted work without the owner's
permission. Indirect infringement occurs when a party copies
a copyrighted work by using a derivative work that is based on
the original work. The fair use defense is a limited exception
to the exclusive rights granted to copyright holders. The fair
use defense is not available for all uses of copyrighted works,
and the four factors that courts consider in deciding whether
it applies are not always easy to apply. If you are sued for
copyright infringement, you may be able to defend yourself by
asserting the fair use defense. However, it is important to note
that the fair use defense is not a guarantee of success.

Trademark

A trademark can be a sign, symbol, design, or expression
indicating the specific source of the good or service. Businesses
wanting to register a trademark must use a distinctive mark
that will not cause consumer confusion with an existing mark.
Therefore, organizations should fully investigate the mark and
its similarity to any existing marks. Trademark Infringement
occurs when someone other than the rightful owner of a
trademark uses it without permission (Perry & Thompson,
2017).

To win a trademark-infringement lawsuit, the rightful owner
of the mark must show validity and priority of use, which are
typically established by federal registration, and the likelihood
of consumer confusion based on the following:

   Distinctiveness (strength) of the plaintiff's mark
   The similarity of the two marks
   The similarity of goods or services associated with marks
   The similarity of the facilities the two parties use in their

      businesses
   The similarity of advertising used by all parties

 Copyright

 Trade Secret

Multiple types of intellectual property rights can be attached
to one product or service at the same time. For example, Coca-
Cola asserts trademarks for its lettering and color scheme and
deems its recipe a trade secret. However, to obtain a patent for
any recipe, a company must make the recipe public. Rather
than disclosing this information, Coca-Cola asserts its rights
under trade secret law, which does not require the disclosure
of the recipe.

Intellectual Property: Trademarks [Youtube] 2013

A trade secret is valuable, non-public information used in
commercial enterprises. Inconsistencies in trade secret laws led
to the development of the Uniform Trade Secrets Act
(UTSA) in 1979, aiming for standardization across the
United States. The UTSA provides a detailed definition of
trade secrets, highlighting their economic value, a wide variety
of applicable information, and the requirement for reasonable
secrecy measures. A national consensus on trade secret law has
been achieved, with 48 states adopting relevant portions of
UTSA. The UTSA ( 1.4) provides the following definition
of a trade secret as information, including a formula, pattern,
compilation, program, device, method, technique, or process,
that:

   derives independent economic value, actual or potential,
      from not being generally known to and not being readily
      ascertainable by proper means by other persons who can
      obtain economic value from its disclosure or use, and

   is the subject of efforts that are reasonable under the
      circumstances to maintain its secrecy (Legal Information
         PRIVACY, INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY, AND CYBERLAW | 178

      Institute, n.d.).

Proper means may include information obtained legitimately
from the Internet where no expectation of privacy is present.
This process is called reverse engineering and is considered a
legal method of obtaining information that may be intended
to be secret. As an extension of the Economic Espionage Act of
1996, Congress passed the Defend Trade Secrets Act (DTSA)
in 2016 to allow owners of trade secrets the ability to sue when
secrets have been misappropriated.

                               Over the last three

                               decades, the Internet has

                               been the most influential

Tiffany Jackman                instrumental on a global

                               scale. As quickly as

technology has evolved, the internet has also provided

potential security concerns. The healthcare industry did not

embrace emerging technology as quickly as other industries for

various reasons. The main reason is the sheer cost of

purchasing a product that can hold large amounts of

information and protect the privacy of that information. In

addition, meaningful use requires the ability of these

integrated systems to talk to one another at some point in the

future. With the risk of data and privacy breaches at an all-time

high, the laws regulating cyber security were creeping slowly

into existence. The first cyber law was the Computer Fraud

and Abuse Act (CFAA), which was passed by the United

States Congress in 1986. The CFAA prohibits unauthorized
181 | PRIVACY, INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY, AND CYBERLAW

access to computer systems and data. However, the Health
Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health
Act (HITECH Act) was not passed until 2009. The HITECH
Act provides financial incentives for healthcare organizations
to adopt electronic health records (EHRs) and to implement
security measures to protect EHR data. Cyber laws on
healthcare have also been passed in other countries, such as
the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation
(GDPR). The GDPR applies to all organizations that process
the personal data of individuals located in the European
Union, regardless of where the organization is located. Cyber
laws pertaining to healthcare are constantly evolving as
technology changes and new threats emerge. Healthcare
organizations need to stay up-to-date on the latest laws and
regulations so that they can protect patient health information
(Morgan, 2019).

Patent

For over four decades, it has been possible to secure a patent for
a process that involves a computer program. The U.S. Supreme
Court has affirmed that software can be patented because it
includes a mathematical formula that puts a formula into
practice within a structure or process.

   A unique challenge arises when it comes to a specific
category of utility patent applications, especially in the context
of software and internet-based businesses. These applications
         PRIVACY, INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY, AND CYBERLAW | 182

seek patents for innovative ways of conducting business,
known as business method patents. Examples include
Amazon.com's one-click shopping system and Priceline.com's
online reverse auction. The U.S. Supreme Court supports the
patenting of business methods, provided they meet the criteria
of novelty and non-obviousness and fall within an acceptable
subject matter category. However, a significant challenge in
obtaining patent protection for business methods is
demonstrating that these methods go beyond abstract ideas, as
abstract ideas are not eligible for patents (Morgan, 2019).

   Recognizing the potential impact of granting patents for
internet-related business methods on commerce, a portion of
the America Invents Act of 2011 (AIA) introduced
streamlined post-issuance review procedures for certain types
of business method patents. This review process is limited to
patents that involve data processing or other operations related
to financial products or services, excluding those covering
technological innovations. In one notable case, the Patent Trial
and Appeal Board (PTAB) declared in 2013 that a previously
granted business method patent was invalid because it was
deemed "abstract." This decision had a significant impact, as
the patent holder had previously won a $345 million
infringement case against a challenger. Consequently, the
PTAB's decision nullified the infringement judgment
(Morgan, 2019).
183 | PRIVACY, INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY, AND CYBERLAW

Trademark

Website operators, online content owners, and software
developers have the freedom to use trademarks in the digital
realm. A famous example is AOL's use of the trademark
"You've got mail" online. This means that both trademark
infringement and trademark dilution can occur in the online
space. Certain practices, such as linking to other websites, deep
linking, and deploying pop-up ads, can potentially violate
trademark protections. For instance, there was a case where a
defendant's software used a plaintiff's trademark to generate
pop-up ads, but the court didn't find infringement because
the ads never displayed the trademark, and they opened in
new windows, reducing the likelihood of confusion. However,
the legal landscape regarding trademark infringement through
pop-up advertising is uncertain and will evolve over time
(Morgan, 2019).

   When someone registers a domain name that is identical
or very similar to a trademarked domain with the intent to
profit unfairly from another's trademark, it constitutes
"cybersquatting" under the Anticybersquatting Consumer
Protection Act (ACPA) passed in 1999 by Congress. Violating
the ACPA can lead to statutory damages ranging from $1,000
to $100,000 per domain name involved in cybersquatting.
Alternatively, successful plaintiffs can receive actual damages,
and courts have the authority to award triple actual damages
due to the "bad faith" element of this action. Typically,
         PRIVACY, INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY, AND CYBERLAW | 184

cybersquatters are compelled to transfer the domain to the
legitimate trademark owner, and in exceptional cases of
wrongful domain name registration, attorney's fees may also
be awarded (Morgan, 2019).

Copyright

Copyright law is a crucial tool for protecting intellectual
property in the digital age. Most content on the internet is
copyrighted, and the act of sharing this material involves
making copies. Copyright safeguards the tangible expression
of information but not the underlying idea. For example, while
the idea behind a computer game cannot be copyrighted, the
computer program running the game can be. This means that
someone can create a similar game as long as they use a
different program. The fair use doctrine applies to software,
allowing copyrighted software to be used in educational
settings without requiring permission or royalties (Morgan,
2019).

   In 1980, amendments to the Copyright Act extended
copyright protection to certain aspects of computer programs.
A computer program is defined as a set of instructions that
a computer uses to achieve a specific outcome. Courts have
made it clear that literal copying, where the actual code is
duplicated, constitutes copyright infringement. Even
disguising the origin of a copy doesn't usually prevent
copyright holders from proving this type of infringement.
185 | PRIVACY, INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY, AND CYBERLAW

However, when it comes to nonliteral elements like structure,
sequence of operations, interfaces, and functions that can be
copied without directly duplicating the code, courts have had
mixed opinions on whether they are subject to copyright
protection (Morgan, 2019).

   In 1998, Congress passed the Digital Millennium
Copyright Act (DMCA), which focuses on preventing the
circumvention of copyright protection systems for digital
content like software, music, videos, and books. The DMCA
provides limited liability for Internet service providers (ISPs)
and websites. They are not held liable for copyright
infringement unless they are aware of a subscriber's violation.
Additionally, ISPs and websites hosting infringing material
must follow specific procedures, such as responding to
takedown notices, to secure protection under the DMCA's
safe-harbor provision (Morgan, 2019).

Trade Secret

Trade secret protection is a vital aspect for most businesses,
as it applies to creative ideas at various stages of development.
Trade secret law safeguards product ideas and information,
often superior to trademark and copyright protection.
Trademark protection primarily focuses on specific product
characteristics, while copyright law only safeguards the
expression of an idea. In contrast, trade secret law offers
broader protection without requiring disclosure, unlike patent
         PRIVACY, INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY, AND CYBERLAW | 186

registration, which demands that an invention be novel and
non-obvious. For trade secrets, the main criteria are that the
information is valuable and reasonable efforts have been made
to keep it secret (Morgan, 2019).

   However, businesses must strategically approach the
protection of their trade secrets. Implementing reasonable
security measures is crucial in determining whether something
qualifies as a trade secret. For instance, in industries like
computer and Internet-related businesses, where employee
turnover is high, it's vital to take comprehensive precautions.
Confidentiality agreements and non-disclosure agreements
(NDAs) are commonly used to ensure the protection of trade
secrets. Moreover, efforts should be made to restrict access to
trade secrets only to employees who genuinely require it. For
example, encryption is employed to prevent access to software
codes, and decryption capabilities are granted only to those
with a legitimate need (Morgan, 2019).

   The implementation of provisions from the Uniform Trade
Secrets Act (UTSA) throughout most of the United States has
created a uniform framework to ensure consistency in defining
trade secrets, determining what qualifies as reasonable
measures to maintain secrecy, and specifying the remedies
available in cases of misappropriation (Morgan, 2019).

           A commitment to healthcare privacy has been
             guided for centuries through codes of ethics
             and now with laws to protect the patient-
             provider relationship.

           There are a few exceptions to these principles
             including communicable diseases, wounds
             from acts of violence, and suspected abuse.

           HIPAA (1996) provided protocols for
             safeguarding personal information, and
             HITECH (2013) added further protection for
             electronic medical record data. HITECH was
             amended in 2021 to provide safe harbor
             provisions in the event of a data breach if
             adherence to the Security Rule is observed.

           Examples of data breaches include lost/stolen
             electronic devices, disposal of materials with
             identifiable information, hacking, and thrid-
             party mistakes. In the event of a data breach,
             several notification steps are required.

PART I

ETHICAL
CONSIDERATIONS

Introduction

The legal and financial aspects inherent in the field of medicine
inevitably lead to ethical and professional questions. This
chapter is dedicated to exploring these ethical and professional
inquiries and lays the groundwork that will be utilized
191 | ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS

throughout the course. Ethics pertains to the process of
deciding how to behave based on a collective assessment of
what is morally right and wrong. This can be represented
collectively by a profession, a company, an industry, or society
as a whole. The determination of what constitutes goodness
or rightness is made concerning established ethical standards.
While an individual's personal morals certainly factor into
discussions about ethical behavior, it's important to note
that the term "morals" typically implies something distinct
from ethics. Morals consist of individual principles linked to
one's conscience that aid in discerning what is right and
wrong.

Ethics and Compliance

Ethics and law are important parts of healthcare. Part of the
ethical decision-making process includes the consideration of
alternatives. A comprehensive understanding of healthcare
laws and how they govern the application of healthcare is
needed to make sound ethical decisions. Ethics is often referred
to as a person's personal values or beliefs; furthermore, these
beliefs are influenced by an individual's religion,
socioeconomic conditions, geographic location, culture,
family, and friends. Healthcare workers must develop a set of
beliefs that coincide with their field. For example, a surgical
technologist must have a sterile conscience about the sterility
of instrumentation and supplies to ensure that patients do not
acquire an infection that could be fatal.

   To ensure healthcare personnel are making ethical
healthcare decisions, a Code of Ethics, similar to standards
of care, governs professional organizations. Compliance with
these standards is monitored by medical boards, credentialing,
licensure, certification, and policies and procedures. Each state
has the authority to set standards for credentialing;
furthermore, some states offer reciprocity to those
credentialed in other states. This recognition allows healthcare
providers to practice in different locations without having to
repeat the entire credentialing process. Once an individual's
education, training, licensure, and certification have been
verified, they are granted privileges. The term privileging
193 | ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS

means that the board has made sure the provider has the
appropriate training and experience to meet the minimum
requirements and all authorizations to carry out requested
procedures at a specific facility. Credentialing generally refers
to primary source credentialing (background check), also
known as primary source verification. Lastly, payer enrollment
is completed, which is the process by which a medical provider
gets entered into insurance plans, networks, Medicare, and
Medicaid, so the provider and facility can be paid for services
rendered to patients by that provider.

   Once privileging is complete, each provider has a
determined scope of practice. The scope of practice sets the
boundaries determined by the Medical Board and Practice
Act. Working outside of the professional scope of practice is
not permitted and is considered a violation of the law. It is
important to note that if a provider steps outside their scope,
malpractice is analyzed using the standards of care they
stepped into, not their own.

   Healthcare institutions have a fiduciary obligation to
maintain moral commitments in the face of challenges posed
by economic changes in the delivery of care, which involve
organizational integrity. Organizational integrity is essential to
the fundamental elements of decision-making and group
behavior. This applies not only to societal units in general
but also to organizations in particular. What's even more
challenging than the increasing number of healthcare
providers engaged in patient care within modern healthcare
                                ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS | 194

institutions is the intricate interplay among these individuals

and the impact of the organization's contextual factors on

their conduct. It's often overlooked that many ethical

dilemmas in healthcare facilities are beyond the control of

individual actors, given that the delivery of patient care is

embedded in a complex network of organizational structures,

relationships, and processes. Consequently, instead of solely

attributing ethical responsibility to individual professionalism,

it's crucial to recognize that the moral dimensions of patient

care are significantly shaped by the dynamics of the

organization.

Healthcare organizations

continuously encounter

new sets of ethical issues due

to the changes in the

delivery and financing of

care. The ethics of an

organization are deeply         Ethics And Compliance by
rooted in its culture. What     Nick Youngson CC BY-SA 3.0
do we do when duty              Alpha Stock Images

conflicts with our interests? Given the complexity and risks

associated with the healthcare environment, most health

systems have compliance officers who monitor ethics training,

corporate policies, and violations of laws. However, ethics and

compliance differ. Compliance seeks conformity through

mandated rules and regulations. While compliance seeks to

avoid litigation or paying fines, ethics seeks to make the right
195 | ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS

decision for the patient's health. What do we do when the
patient's welfare conflicts with the financial solvency of the
institution? It should be noted that patient care outcomes are
largely influenced by the organization's culture of ethics rather
than by individual professionalism. An individual's behavior
informs us that an organization's corporate culture, structures,
and processes are important determinants in achieving
organizational integrity (Perry & Thompson, 2017).

   Attaining organizational integrity entails a dedicated effort
to align the organization's stated mission and values with
decision-making and behaviors at every level of the institution.
In essence, an institution must articulate a clear vision and
mission, choose a set of guiding values to support its mission,
and most importantly, develop a consistent inclination to
make choices and take actions that align with these chosen
values. In practical terms, organizational ethics centers on the
pursuit of organizational integrity.

   Developing and maintaining a comprehensive compliance
program entails creating and upholding internal policies and
procedures designed to prevent any form of illegal, unethical,
or improper conduct within the organization. These policies
also include establishing standards of conduct and educational
and training programs aimed at fostering an environment
where individuals are encouraged to report suspected fraud,
abuse, waste, or other improprieties without fear of retaliation.
Achieving organizational integrity consists of two major
components:
                                               ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS | 196

          a) The culture, rooted in its fundamental values,
       guides decision-making.

          b) The organization's framework, including its
       structures and processes, serves as crucial mechanisms
       for bolstering those core values and ensuring that
       decisions, actions, and outcomes are in harmony with
       these foundational principles.
   Furthermore, the organization should have a structured
approach for addressing alleged violations of rules, regulations,
policies, and procedures, as well as internal standards. This
involves initiating investigative procedures and overseeing a
consistent system for handling any reported violations.
Internal communication processes, such as a dedicated
compliance or ethics hotline, should be in place to facilitate
this reporting mechanism.
   In addition to these measures, continuous monitoring is
essential across all activities within the healthcare enterprise.
This monitoring encompasses various aspects, including
research data, institutional review board (IRB) processes,
patient records, billing records, marketing efforts, and
contractual obligations. The objective is to identify any
potential issues related to referrals and payments that could
trigger anti-kickback statutes or regulations prohibiting
physician self-referral.
197 | ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS

Culture

The culture within organizations varies widely, emphasizing
a different set of ethical values. There isn't a universally ideal
culture that suits all types of organizations. The prevailing
notion is that organizations perform best when their culture
aligns with the specific context and strategic goals, meaning
they choose values that encourage behaviors crucial for
achieving their objectives. For instance, a culture promoting
quick decision-making and minimal bureaucracy can boost
performance in a competitive mergers and acquisitions
advisory firm but might hinder a traditional life insurance
company. Similarly, a culture valuing technological excellence
benefits a computer manufacturer but wouldn't suit a
symphony orchestra. Finally, organizations prioritizing
customer service may prefer a culture emphasizing teamwork,
positive customer relations, respect, collaboration, and social
responsibility.

   While most topics of organizational culture address the
values of the employees, it would be amiss not to mention
the culture of the community we serve. This includes patients
with different ethnicities, social groups, geographical
classifications, sexual orientations, religions, etc. The term
epoche refers to the suspended personal judgment
temporarily. Moreover, a healthcare provider's personal beliefs
about a patient's cultural components should not hinder their
ability to provide care. Oncologist Dr. James Salwitz states,
                                               ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS | 198

      "Doctors must be without judgment or prejudice and
      must treat every person without regard to what they
      believe, what they have done or who they are. Murderer,
      mother, monster, saint, slumlord, sex offender, nurse,
      noble or Nazi, the physician is tasked with treating each as
      human and patient. This creed is not only every doctor's
      calling; it is the utopian vision which medicine offers the
      world... I have learned to see and accept without judgment
      the human frailties and deviation as part of the
      constellation of each individual. And to use those traits,
      even when other forums might judge, to guide and help
      each patient... The peril is that the shift in tolerance,
      diversity, and compassion of our society may penetrate so
      deeply that it will poison even the healers... If blame and
      hate grow like a disease, it may infect the whole of us... It is
      our calling not only to care for the sick without judgement
      but to teach the value of life. The altruistic voice of
      physicians must remind us of the beauty and potential of
      all persons, and we must help others see through fear to
      accept that while we may be different, we are more deeply
      the same. Any society which holds anyone as "less" by
      anger, bigotry or hubris has within it a spreading disease.
      Doctors must heal. They must guide and remind us that in
      the end, we are all human."

These cultural beliefs are applicable to any area of care: illness,
pregnancy and childbirth, death and dying, etc. While it is our
duty to respect all aspects of the patient's beliefs and wishes,
there are times when healthcare must deviate from the
patient's desires to effectively provide care. The most common
example is the Jehovah's Witness blood doctrine. Courts will
199 | ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS

override parental consent in cases involving life-saving
measures for children. Religion also plays a critical role in
treatment and healing. Things to consider are dietary
restrictions, fasting holidays, medications with animal by-
products, herbs/alternative medicines, communication issues,
access to care, transportation issues, and gender norms for
attending providers. All of these considerations affect the
approach to providing care. Physicians, nurses, support staff,
and administrators may need to coordinate care with a
dietitian, pastoral service, translator, case manager, social
worker, hospital general counsel, etc. to fully address the needs
of a patient's cultural preferences. The HELP Model (Connor,
2012) is recommended when working with culturally diverse
populations:

   Hear what the patient perceives to be the problem.
   Encourage the patient and healthcare professional to discuss
the similarities and differences.
   List treatment options and make recommendations.
   Provide a chance to negotiate treatment.
   The culture of a healthcare organization may be determined
by the type of organization as well. Catholic hospitals have a
mission deeply rooted in the healing ministry of Jesus Christ
and the Catholic Church. As such, these organizations may
omit performing procedures that deviate from the beliefs of
Catholicism. They prohibit procedures that are "intrinsically
immoral," including abortion (including ectopic), IVF,
contraception (also in the case of rape), physician-assisted
                                              ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS | 200

suicide, gender reassignment surgery, and direct sterilization.
These directives extend to any facilities that involve mergers
with a Catholic health facility.

Systems Thinking

Systems thinking in organizational ethics shifts the focus
away from individuals as the sole targets for improvement.
Instead, it emphasizes understanding interconnectedness,
communication, ongoing processes, and root causes of
behavior. The goal is to change interactions or redesign the
system itself to promote different behaviors. This approach
represents a significant departure from the traditional quality
assurance approach, which relies on standards and penalties
to ensure ethical behavior and primarily centers on individual
actions rather than addressing flawed organizational structures
and processes. Within a blameless culture, leaders blame
processes, not people. This shifts the focus on understanding
why something happened, not who is responsible. By striving
to identify the root cause of an issue, it creates systems that
prevent errors from happening again. This process of
depersonalizing mistakes can make a large impact.

   While quality assurance is reactive, a systems thinking
approach actively seeks to drive change and uphold workplace
integrity. It bridges the gap between an organization's vision/
mission and its actual performance, illustrating how the
organization's structures and processes have shaped its current
201 | ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS

state. Systems thinking also underscores the importance of
continuous improvement by demanding constant attention to
the structures and processes that influence ethical conduct.
This application of systems theory to organizational ethics
aligns with the principles of continuous quality improvement
and total quality management seen in the healthcare sector,
where hospitals aim to enhance the quality of healthcare
outcomes.

Developing Organizational Culture

There are several steps to developing a corporate ethical
culture. The first is a well-developed mission statement, vision,
and guiding values. These define the core values and guiding
principles of the organization and set expectations along the
path toward achieving its vision. In conjunction, the support
of leadership helps develop an ethical infrastructure. Leaders
should personally commit to doing the right thing even when
no one is watching. According to Perry & Thompson (2017),
a good leader is visible and supportive, taking responsibility for
making ethical decisions. Other steps include implementing
the following:

 1. Code of Ethics: The organization should establish a clear
      code of ethics. This code helps to articulate the
      organization's values and offers practical guidance on
      how to apply these values in everyday operations.
                                            ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS | 202

2. Ethics Forums: Create forums at various levels within
    the organization where ethical issues can be openly
    discussed. These forums should include individuals
    from different hierarchical levels to ensure diverse
    perspectives are considered.

3. Administrative Case Rounds: Develop a formal
    platform for discussing decisions that impact the ethical
    aspects of practice and patient care in the organization.
    This forum should involve both administrative and
    clinical staff to address issues that overlap their respective
    areas.

4. Appeals Process: Implement a mechanism for principled
    dissent when individuals have ethical concerns about a
    practice or policy. Encourage open discussion and
    resolution rather than punishing those who raise ethical
    issues.

5. Alignment of HR Systems: Ensure that the performance
    measurement, appraisal, and reward systems within the
    human resources department are aligned with the
    organization's ethical values. This alignment reinforces
    ethical behavior.

6. Ethics Training: Provide ethics training to employees at
    all levels of the organization. This training should
    increase awareness of ethical issues, clarify ethical
    frameworks for decision-making, and enhance ethical
    decision-making skills, especially in situations involving
    conflicting values.
203 | ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS

 7. Ethics Officer: Appoint a high-ranking ethics officer to
      emphasize the organization's commitment to ethics.
      This individual would be responsible for integrating
      ethics throughout the organization, signaling its
      importance.

 8. Organizational Ethics Committee: Consider establishing
      an ethics committee dedicated to addressing the ethical
      dimensions of organizational issues. This committee
      would function differently from clinical ethics
      committees and provide a space for ethical reflection on
      various organizational matters (Perry & Thompson,
      2017).

Monitoring and Evaluating

Monitoring and evaluating ethical performance within
healthcare organizations involves various approaches, such as
conducting patient and family satisfaction surveys as well as
staff satisfaction surveys. Additionally, an ethics climate survey
can assess whether the organization aligns with its ethical
standards and values. Information systems should provide
timely reports on key indicators, including morbidity and
mortality statistics, infection rates, incident reports, sentinel
events, and patient complaints. Evaluating service performance
in terms of specific outcomes, such as pain relief for patients
following hip replacements, is also essential. Furthermore,
gathering insights through focus groups and interviews can
                                               ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS | 204

shed light on various ethical situations encountered by
different members of the organization, some of which may not
be brought to the attention of the clinical ethics committee
(Perry & Thompson, 2017).

   The increasing emphasis on organizational culture and
integrity management in healthcare mirrors trends in the
business world over the past few decades. The recognition of
the importance of integrity in the workplace grew in response
to corporate misconduct and ethical lapses in various
industries. These issues were often the result of a failure to
integrate integrity into an organization's culture, structures,
and processes. In healthcare, administrators face challenges
such as limited financial resources, reduced staffing, intense
competition, and the demand for high-quality care.
Understanding and addressing the organization's culture and
ethics are essential for effectively managing these challenges.
Recognizing the underlying forces can help administrators
understand employee behavior, identify necessary
organizational changes, and improve overall organizational
efficiency. While many may view ethical behavior and legal
compliance as common sense, the complexity of
organizational relationships necessitates proactive
management of the ethical climate to achieve organizational
integrity (Perry & Thompson, 2017).

   Ethical tendencies of a leader contribute greatly to the
outcomes of morale within the organization. Leaders going
beyond the typical "boss" role inspire employees and help
205 | ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS

establish higher morale and better job attitudes and
productivity. Employee morale has a direct impact on the
ethical tendencies of individuals within an organization. When
employees are motivated, satisfied, and have positive morale,
they are more likely to exhibit ethical behavior in the
workplace. High morale can contribute to a culture of ethics
in the workplace. Unfortunately, while the jester of an
appreciation with a pizza party may be well intended, it is
condescending to support staff when other, more pressing
issues need to be addressed. These attempts do little to boost
employee morale. A more comprehensive approach is needed,
including addressing burnout, clinician wellness councils,
mental health programs, cost-of-living/hazard pay, bonuses,
recharge rooms, peer support, employee recognition programs,
flex work schedules, and remote work when applicable
(Gooch, 2023). Organizations lose valuable resources when
they focus more on staff recruitment issues than on the
retention of current employees.

Mandatory Reporting

Mandatory reporting is a legal requirement that obligates
individuals or entities to report certain specific information
or incidents to relevant authorities or agencies. The purpose
of mandatory reporting is typically to protect public safety,
ensure compliance with laws and regulations, and facilitate
the detection and prevention of specific issues or abuses.
Vulnerable populations of often at greater risk of abuse and
                                              ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS | 206

deserve special attention. Laws requiring healthcare personnel
to report signs of abuse are called mandatory reporting laws
(Stanford, & Connor, 2020). Mandatory reporting can cover
a wide range of areas, including:

 1. Child Abuse and Neglect: In many jurisdictions,
      professionals such as teachers, healthcare workers, and
      social workers are mandated reporters who must report
      suspected cases of child abuse or neglect to child
      protective services.

 2. Elder Abuse: Similar to child abuse, certain
      professionals may be required to report suspected elder
      abuse or neglect.

 3. Healthcare: Healthcare providers often have mandatory
      reporting requirements for certain diseases, injuries, or
      adverse events to public health agencies. This can
      include notifiable diseases, medical errors, and adverse
      drug reactions.

 4. Financial Institutions: Banks and financial institutions
      may have mandatory reporting requirements for
      suspicious financial transactions to combat money
      laundering and fraud.

 5. Workplace Safety: Employers may be required to
      report workplace accidents or injuries to occupational
      safety and health authorities.

 6. Educational Institutions: Some educational
      institutions have mandatory reporting requirements for
207 | ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS

      incidents like bullying, harassment, or threats of
      violence.
 7. Animal Cruelty: In some places, individuals are
      required to report suspected animal cruelty or abuse.
 8. Ethical Violations: In certain professions, such as law
      and accounting, there may be mandatory reporting of
      ethical violations by members of those professions to
      their respective regulatory bodies.
 9. Domestic Violence: Healthcare providers and others
      may have mandatory reporting requirements for
      suspected cases of domestic violence.

Failure to comply with mandatory reporting requirements can
lead to legal consequences, including fines or penalties. The
specific reporting requirements and who is obligated to report
can vary widely depending on the jurisdiction and the nature
of the issue being reported. The aim of mandatory reporting is
to ensure that potential problems or dangers are identified and
addressed promptly in the interest of public welfare and safety.

Difference Between Ethics and
Compliance

Ethics and compliance are related concepts in the context of
organizational behavior, but they have distinct meanings and
purposes. Ethics pertains to the moral principles and values
that guide behavior based on what is considered right or
                                              ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS | 208

wrong, while compliance is about conforming to established
rules and regulations to avoid legal consequences and maintain
organizational integrity. While both ethics and compliance are
essential in organizations, they serve slightly different
purposes, with ethics encompassing broader moral
considerations and compliance focusing on legal and
regulatory requirements. Two prevailing approaches to
regulating employee behavior within organizations are the
compliance-based and integrity-based models. These two
models represent distinct philosophies for managing employee
behavior. The compliance-based model relies on external
regulation and enforcement, while the integrity-based model
focuses on internal self-governance and the promotion of
shared ethical values to guide employees in their actions (Perry
& Thompson, 2017).

   Compliance-based model: This model relies on external
regulation and the use of threats and punishments to influence
employee behavior. It primarily views employee conduct
through a legal and regulatory lens, emphasizing the need to
deter illegal or unethical actions and incentivize behavior in
line with organizational values. Essentially, it operates on the
premise of "comply or face consequences."

   Integrity-based model: In contrast, the integrity-based
model takes a different approach to employee management. It
emphasizes self-governance, the cultivation of shared values,
and the recognition of employees' ethical aspirations as
motivational factors for adhering to rules and standards. This
209 | ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS

approach aims to instill a sense of employee accountability
rooted in a commitment to the organization's mission. Rather
than just teaching employees to follow laws and rules, it seeks
to integrate ethics into their decision-making processes and
inspire them to embody the company's ethical ideals.

   Both compliance and integrity approaches involve elements
like organizational codes of conduct, legal training, and
penalties for misconduct. However, the integrity strategy has
been proven to encourage responsible employee behavior and
a strong ethical identity rooted in the organization's values.
When employees perceive that an organization follows an
integrity-based approach, it leads to benefits such as increased
commitment to the organization's mission and a stronger
sense of trust in the organization's support. These positive
outcomes are not as prominent in organizations that primarily
emphasize employee compliance with rules and regulations.
Additionally, employee behavior can be influenced by their
perception of the organization's cultural objectives, whether
compliance-oriented or integrity-focused.

   Creating an organizational climate of integrity,
characterized by self-governance and shared values among
employees, is particularly challenging in the complex
healthcare delivery system. However, it is crucial for the success
of healthcare providers. Healthcare organizations, given their
responsibility for the well-being of patients, must strive to
establish harmonious work environments where all healthcare
personnel can thrive in serving patients. Trust is also a crucial
                                               ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS | 210

component of building a culture of integrity, and healthcare
organizations dedicated to patient care and public health
should set an example in fostering cultures of trust and
integrity. Emphasizing integrity over mere compliance can lead
to more responsible and ethical employee behavior, but
creating such a culture in healthcare settings is complex yet
essential for the success of healthcare providers and the well-
being of patients.

Ethics in Medicine

The relationship between physician and patient is infused with
deep trust, intimacy, and vulnerability. Often, exams require
a patient to disrobe and answer personal questions. These
encounters can be frequently marked by fear, discomfort, and
uncertainty regarding the potential life-and-death
consequences of decisions made; therefore, authoritarian
figures in healthcare must be guided by ethical principles.
Regardless of their socioeconomic status or level of education,
patients must ultimately trust their healthcare providers with
their well-being. There is said to be a gross disparity in the
bargaining power of the customer in healthcare (Perry &
Thompson, 2017). Financial incentives for providers can clash
with patient care, tipping the scales between profit and well-
being. In this sense, ethics boil down to daily choices, and in
medicine, those choices carry weighty consequences.

   When health policy decisions involve making choices
211 | ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS

between conflicting values and distributing advantages and
burdens, ethical reflection becomes indispensable.
Furthermore, healthcare is fundamentally a compassionate
endeavor, rooted in the notion of providing care rather than
being solely profit-driven as seen in other businesses. Given
its unique nature, individuals in the healthcare sector,
particularly those directly involved in patient care but also
those in administrative roles should prioritize ethics. This is
essential both as a professional safeguard against the influence
of competing economic interests driven by external investors,
which could compromise the healthcare profession's core
commitment to patient well-being and as a practical strategy
for protecting healthcare providers from medical malpractice
liability claims (Perry & Thompson, 2017).

   Guidelines for maintaining a professional physician-patient
relationship include the following:

 1. Build trust
 2. Provide privacy (when dressing and undressing)
 3. Use appropriate language
 4. Another healthcare professional should be present

      during an intimate examination
 5. Listen to the patient without judgment
 6. Do not overstep personal boundaries
 7. Avoid all sexual contact, including flirting
 8. Do not visit a patient outside of the healthcare setting
 9. Never make promises to a patient

Resolving Ethical Dilemmas

Our ability to recognize ethical dilemmas is compromised by
implicit prejudice, obedience to authority, and time pressures
of decision-making. No individual is immune to elements that
can compromise our ability to make ethical decisions. The
elements are called an unconscious bias. According to UCSF
(2023), individual strategies to address unconscious bias
include:

   Promoting self-awareness: The Implicit Association
      Test or other instruments to assess bias are helpful tools
      to mitigate unconscious bias.

   Understanding the nature of bias is also essential to
      helping individuals approach their own biases in a more
      informed and open way.

   Discussions with others (especially those from socially
      dissimilar groups) can be helpful by promoting
      conversations in a safe space; furthermore, individuals
      must be open to alternative perspectives and viewpoints.

   Bias literacy training in the workplace reduces the impact
      of bias.

What is implicit bias? [YouTube] 2021 by Center

Healthcare providers and leadership should look beyond the
issue of mere legal compliance and finance and pay attention
to the dynamics of the situation. Gut instincts can manifest
when moral dilemmas are met with ethical blindness. These
feelings can manifest as profuse sweating, headaches, or pain
in the belly, and such instinctual reactions can often provide
very useful signals that moral territory where one's character
is about to be tested may be compromised. When the stakes
are high and reputations, stock prices, and people's livelihoods
hang in the balance, emotional reactions are not as rational
as once thought. Mitigation and/or resolution of these ethical
dilemmas start by gathering and clarifying relevant facts. A
complete process of ethical deliberation will yield a logical
solution that should be monitored, and steps should be taken
to avoid this type of dilemma in the future.

   Ethical decision-making, as described by the Potter Box
(Hagen, 2017), includes the following:

Key Takeaways
215 | ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS

           Ethics refers to the guiding standards of
             conduct expected of the members of a group.

           Ethics is often used as the basis for creating
             legal standards where the law reflects
             society's view of right and wrong.

           An ethical framework will assist an individual
             in making an ethical decision and should
             include deciding legality, establishing the
             problem clearly, determining relevant values,
             exploring the views of stakeholders,
             considering the impact on the decision-maker,
             and reflecting on possible courses of action.

           A culture of ethics begins with a strong
             commitment from top management.

           Code of Ethics governs organizations, and
             compliance with these standards is monitored
             by medical boards, credentialing, licensure,
             certification, and policies and procedures.

           Healthcare institutions have a fiduciary
             obligation to maintain moral commitments in
             the face of challenges posed by economic
             changes in the delivery of care, which involve
             organizational integrity.

           Healthcare organizations continuously
             encounter new sets of ethical issues due to
                                  ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS | 216

   the changes in the delivery and financing of
   care.
 Achieving organizational integrity consists of

  two major components: a) The culture,
  rooted in its fundamental values, guides
  decision-making. b) The organization's
  framework, including its structures and
  processes, serves as crucial mechanisms
  for bolstering those core values and
  ensuring that decisions, actions, and
  outcomes are in harmony with these
  foundational principles.

 Organizational culture is the shared values
   that have been reflected on and articulated by
   the members of an organization and have
   been accepted as the normative for culture.

 Systems thinking is a way of making sense of
   the complexity of the world by looking at it in
   terms of wholes and relationships rather than
   by splitting it down into its parts.

 Mandatory reporting is a legal requirement
   that obligates individuals or entities to report
   certain specific information or incidents to
   relevant authorities or agencies.

           Unconscious bias are social stereotypes about
             certain groups of people that individuals form
             outside their own conscious awareness.
             Everyone holds unconscious beliefs about
             various social and identity groups, and these
             biases stem from one's tendency to organize
             social worlds by categorizing.

PART I

LEADING FOR
SAFETY

Introduction

Most people head to work each day with the expectation of
returning home in a similar state of health as when they left.
Unfortunately, for a distressingly large number of workers, this
expectation does not hold true. Incidents in the workplace
persist, and consequences can vary from minor property
                                                      LEADING FOR SAFETY | 220

damage to tragic fatalities. In certain instances, the connection
between an injury and a specific workplace factor is
immediately evident, such as a roofer fracturing a leg after
falling off a ladder, a data entry clerk experiencing arm strain
due to repetitive motions, or a nurse sustaining a needle stick
injury. However, in other scenarios, establishing a direct link
between an injury or illness and the workplace is not
immediately apparent. Examples include individuals working
in a bar who develop noise-induced hearing loss, custodians
who develop dermatitis, or firefighters who develop leukemia
after retirement. In these cases, factors like the time elapsed
between exposure to workplace hazards or engagement in
other activities can complicate the process of linking a
workplace factor to an illness (Graham & Rowley, 2017).

           Describe the Different Types and How to
             Identify Hazards in the Workplace

Occupational Safety

According to the U.S.

Bureau of Labor Statistics,

the United States has more   BIOFLIORGEICAL HBIIGOHLVOOGLTICAGAEL

than 3 million incidents of

occupational injuries and

illnesses reported annually

(2021). An injury refers to a sudden and often traumatic

wound or physical condition of the body resulting from

external forces, which can include stress or strain. Typically,

injuries are linked to a specific event, incident, or a sequence of

events or incidents that transpire within a single workday or

shift. An occupational injury, specifically, is a physical harm

that stems from an accident occurring within the workplace.

Additionally, occupational illness results in 25 percent of

employees taking time off from work to recover or receive

treatment.

The roles of occupational safety and health experts have

evolved beyond their traditional functions, which included

tasks like carrying out safety inspections, providing training,
                                                      LEADING FOR SAFETY | 222

probing into accidents, and pinpointing hazardous behaviors
and situations. Nowadays, safety professionals have a broader
scope of responsibilities that extend throughout an
organization. They actively contribute to fostering
innovations in occupational safety and health that can elevate
the overall performance of the organization. They collaborate
with individuals across all levels within the organization, as
well as with government agencies, regulatory bodies, and
business associations, to formulate comprehensive
occupational safety and health plans and initiatives. This
directly affects productivity. Even worse, it is estimated that
between 4,000-5,000 people die each year from work-related
injuries or illnesses (Graham & Rowley, 2017).

Culture of Safety

A workplace safety culture pertains to the shared attitudes,
values, and conduct within an organization that places a
paramount emphasis on the welfare and security of its
employees. This culture serves as a critical foundation for
upholding a secure working environment. According to the
Society for Human Resource Management (SHRM) (2008),
safety cultures can assume diverse forms, often categorized
into four primary types:

 1. Forced culture- uses bribes and threats to motivate
      employees
223 | LEADING FOR SAFETY

 2. Protective culture- implements safety programs for
      employees (policies and procedures)

 3. Involved culture- characterized by safety training
      sessions for employees and monitoring performance

 4. Integral culture- characterized by safety training sessions
      and safety officers that have budgets and authority

Just Culture promotes reporting mistakes without punitive
retaliation to efforts to address and prevent future occurrences.
This concept is closely tied to patient safety and recognizing
errors or near-misses. It focuses on the processes in place that
led to the incident and how to improve those processes, rather
than placing blame on those that reported the incident.

   Leadership plays an integral role in shaping and promoting
a safety-oriented culture. Leaders must lead by example, accord
priority to safety, and effectively communicate its significance
to the workforce. A robust safety culture is distinguished by its
sustained endeavors to elevate safety standards and protocols.
This entails ongoing training, the identification of potential
hazards, and the establishment of feedback mechanisms.
Engaging employees in safety initiatives cultivates a sense of
ownership and unwavering dedication to safety concerns.
Encouraging the reporting of safety issues without fear of
reprisals holds paramount importance.

   Safety in terms of healthcare extends not only to the patients
but also to the medical professionals and support staff.
Whether it be a needle stick, medication errors, or physical
                                                      LEADING FOR SAFETY | 224

assaults, the goal of workplace safety is to create a safe
environment for all who enter the facility. It is important to
acknowledge that any error resulting in harm or death of a
patient is also devastating to the clinicians involved and has
been known to lead to self-harm, depression, isolation, and
even suicide. Considering the high stakes associated with the
impact of enhancing workforce and patient safety, healthcare
leadership should prioritize improving quality and safety
through its core values.

Safety Culture in Healthcare [YouTube] 2014 by D

Workplace Violence and
Harassment

Within the healthcare sector, workplace violence (WPV) is
acknowledged as a potential danger. WPV encompasses
actions or expressions of physical aggression, harassment,
bullying, coercion, or any other form of menacing and
225 | LEADING FOR SAFETY

disruptive conduct that takes place in the workplace. This issue
can impact various stakeholders, including employees,
patients, customers, and visitors. WPV encompasses a wide
spectrum of behaviors, ranging from verbal threats and abuse
to physical assaults and, in the most extreme cases, even lethal
acts (OSHA, 2012).

   People susceptible to workplace violence include individuals
engaged in tasks like handling money transactions with the
public and interacting with unpredictable or emotionally
unstable individuals. Those who operate in solitary or
secluded settings may also be more vulnerable to potential
violence. Occupations involving the provision of services,
caregiving, or work in establishments where alcohol is served
could heighten the likelihood of encountering violence.
Moreover, variables such as the time of day and the workplace's
location, such as working late at night or in areas characterized
by elevated crime rates, should also be taken into account
when addressing workplace violence concerns. Among the
high-risk groups are employees engaged in cash transactions
with the public, delivery personnel, healthcare providers,
public service workers, customer service representatives, law
enforcement officers, and individuals who work alone.
According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics Census of Fatal
Occupational Injuries (CFOI), in 2019, there were 761 cases
of intentional injury by another person that led to fatalities in
the U.S. Women made up 8.6 percent of all workplace fatalities
                                                      LEADING FOR SAFETY | 226

but represented 14.5 percent of intentional injuries by a
person in 2021.

Preventing Workplace Violence

The best prevention is identifying and addressing potential
problems early. Workers may exhibit sudden changes of typical
behavior, deteriorating job performance, poor relationships
with coworkers and patients, refusal to accept criticism or
comply with rules, outbursts of rage, odd behavior and
isolation, avoidance of eye contact, and/or others who do not
want to work with them. Signs of escalating aggression could
include pacing, rapid breathing, and/or aggressive posturing.
They may begin to speak faster, more loudly, or use a
threatening tone. According to the safety video below, de-
escalating tense situations in a non-violent manner can be
approached by:

 1. Do not confront an angry person
 2. Do not get into a power struggle
 3. Do not roll your eyes, interrupt, or show frustration
 4. Speak slowly and calmly
 5. Ask how you can help
 6. Use their name, if applicable
 7. Provide options to resolve the situation
 8. Use terms like "we" and "us"
 9. Don't make promises that you can't keep
227 | LEADING FOR SAFETY

10. Have witnesses when comforting the angry person
11. If necessary, put space between you and the aggressor

Workplace Violence Training for Healthcare Worke

In 1996, OSHA published guidelines for preventing
workplace violence for healthcare and social service workers,
recommending that each facility create its own workplace
violence prevention program. Additionally, the American
Nurses Association's recommendations for preventing
workplace incivility and bullying include the following:

 1. Setting a "Zero Tolerance" policy
 2. Encouraging employees to report violent incidents
 3. Developing a comprehensive violence prevention

      program (with security measures in place)

Personal Protective Equipment

The workplace can be

fraught with various risks.

Personal    protective

equipment (PPE) serves as a

means to safeguard against

these risks. While PPE does

not completely eradicate hazards, it does mitigate the impact

on the wearer. Even when PPE is employed correctly, there

remains a slight risk of injury, although such injuries are

typically less severe than those incurred when PPE is neglected.

It is vital to identify both existing and potential hazards

associated with a specific task to determine the most suitable

protective gear. Personal protective equipment (PPE)

comprises attire and/or gear that employees wear or utilize to

lower the risk of injury, illness, or disease resulting from

workplace tasks or conditions. It's important to note that PPE

should not be the sole reliance for protection against hazards;

rather, it should complement other safety measures. OSHA

regulations that address PPE for general industry are specified

in OSHA 1910 Subpart I--Personal Protective Equipment. In

healthcare, the most common types of PPE are hair bonnets/

caps, surgical masks, N-95 masks, gowns (reinforced and

isolation gowns), gloves, laser goggles or face shields, and shoe

coverings.

Exposure Pathways

According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics Census of Fatal
Occupational Injuries (CFOI), exposure to harmful
substances or environments led to 798 worker fatalities in
2021, the highest figure since the series began in 2011. OSHA
mandates the utilization of personal protective equipment
(PPE) to decrease worker exposure to dangers in cases where
engineering and administrative measures are impractical or
                                                      LEADING FOR SAFETY | 230

ineffective in reducing exposure to safe levels. Exposure
pertains to coming into contact with a substance through
ingestion, inhalation, absorption, or injection. Exposure can
be categorized as brief (acute exposure), moderate in duration,
or extended (chronic exposure). Many hazardous agents have
more than one exposure pathway. This term refers to the
methods of injury a person may contact a hazard through
either absorption, inhalation, or physical contact.

The Shocking Story of the Radium Girls: What the

1. Absorption

Toxic or hazardous materials can enter the body by permeating
the skin, eyes, or mucous membranes. Absorption through the
skin can happen without notice to the person being exposed,
which is common with chemicals in the workplace. Once the
toxic material penetrates the skin, it can enter the bloodstream.
231 | LEADING FOR SAFETY

2. Inhalation

Toxic or hazardous materials in the form of gases, fumes, and
aerosols can be breathed through the nose and mouth, gaining
access to the respiratory system. Inhalation hazards can exist in
the air. The concentration of the substance and exposure time
will determine the amount of harm. The cycle of air exchange
in areas like surgical unions should also be monitored for air
quality.

3. Physical Contact

Contact between two people or between a person and an
object can lead to injury. Any compromised skin integrity,
such as lacerations, punctures, or scrapes, can allow pathogens
or hazardous materials to enter the body. Injuries by
contusion, burns, or crushing are also categorized as physical
contact.

4. Additional Hazards Considered

Each workplace should have current guidelines for potential
hazards that a worker may encounter in the workplace and
training for appropriate methods for handling these hazards.
X-ray radiation, noise, chemical eye hazards, radiant energy,
and biological agents should all have policies and guidelines for
use and potential exposure. This includes the proper methods
                                                      LEADING FOR SAFETY | 232

of handling and disposing of laboratory chemicals,
biohazardous materials, and waste.

Safety Laws

Most safety laws are a result of the Industrial Revolution and
lobbying for safety regulations and safe working conditions.
Factories were riddled with numerous hazards. Mass
production during the war required women and children to
work long hours exposed to these hazards. The earliest laws
addressed working conditions to prevent injuries. Congress
passed the Walsh-Healey Public Contracts Act in 1936,
authorizing the Department of Labor to ban federal contracts
for work performed under hazardous conditions. The
Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 was the primary
law established in the U.S. to ensure the safest and healthiest
working conditions possible for everyone. According to this
Act, employers have a legal responsibility to provide safe and
healthy working conditions and to comply with occupational
safety and health standards. Overseeing federal agencies
includes:

   The Occupational Safety and Health Review Commission-
is an independent federal agency that reviews enforcement
priorities, actions, and cases. The National Institute for
Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH)- is a federal agency
responsible for conducting research and making
recommendations for preventing work-related injury and
233 | LEADING FOR SAFETY

illness. The Occupational Safety and Health Review
Commission (OSHRC)-is an independent federal agency that
reviews enforcement priorities, actions, and cases. General
inspections and citations for violations are conducted by a
compliance safety and health officer (CSHO). Serious
violations could result in fines between $1,500 and $7,000
depending on the severity. Willful violations could be fined
between $250,000 and $500,000 and/or up to 6 months
imprisonment. Repeat violations within a three-year period
could be fined up to $70,000.

   While there are many agencies that provide oversight for
specific industries such as mining, highway safety, pipelines,
nuclear energy, and much more, The Food and Drug
Administration (FDA) established standards for food,
medications, vaccines, tobacco, blood and tissue products,
medical devices, cosmetics, and products emitting
electromagnetic radiation. Established under Nixon in 1970,
the Environmental Protection Agency Environmental
Protection Agency (EPA) developed standards to enforce
environmental regulations. Environmental regulations are
created from environmental acts including the National
Environmental Policy Act, the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water
Act, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, and the
Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation,
and Liability Act.

Additional Employee Protection
      LEADING FOR SAFETY | 234

Laws

The U.S. Department of Labor enforces over 180 federal labor
laws (Kurt, 2022). The coverage can vary from unemployment
insurance benefits, Social Security benefits, healthcare
coverage, and safety laws. According to Kurt (2022), other
employee protections include:

1. The Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) covers various
    labor standards, including minimum wage and
    workplace safety regulations.

2. Whistleblower protections protect employees from
    retaliation when they report unsafe conditions or illegal
    activities in the workplace.

3. The Civil Rights Act Title VII of 1964 made it illegal to
    discriminate based on "race, color, religion, sex, or
    national origin. In 2020, it added protections for the
    LGBTQ+ class of workers.

4. The Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act of 2009 prohibits wage
    discrimination against women and minorities.

5. Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) signed into law
    in 1993 by President Clinton provides eligible employees
    up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave per year in the cases of
    childbirth, adoption, or serious personal or family
    member illness.

6. Thirty-six U.S. states (and the District of Columbia)
    recognize an implied contract exception to the at-will
235 | LEADING FOR SAFETY

      employment doctrine. Employees cannot be fired except
      for good cause when a contract is implied. Additionally,
      employers may be found liable for breach of contract
      otherwise. However, the employee has the burden of
      proof (Muhl, 2001).

Workers' Compensation

Workers' compensation is a government-mandated program
that provides benefits to workers who become injured or
disabled while performing their job duties (Kagan, 2023). The
purpose of worker's compensation is to ensure that injured
employees receive the appropriate medical care and
compensation for lost wages if they are injured on the job.
Coverage varies from state to state and requires the employee
to follow specific reporting guidelines.

   It is important to note that some businesses can file for
workers' compensation exemptions for the self-employed,
independent contractors, and/or volunteers. Other state
exclusions include those with mental health issues (not work-
related), injuries from a fight or self-inflected, and injuries
received away from work. When an employee is designated
as `workers' compensation exempt,' it signifies that they lack
coverage under workers' compensation insurance. If such an
employee sustains a work-related injury or illness, they will
not be eligible for benefits aimed at aiding their recovery.
Consequently, they, or their employer, will be responsible for
                                                      LEADING FOR SAFETY | 236

bearing the costs associated with medical bills, ongoing
healthcare expenses, and treatment outlays. Furthermore, if an
exempt employee is unable to work due to a job-related injury
or illness, they will not receive compensation for lost wages.

Workplace Wellness

Workplace wellness encompasses initiatives and strategies that
encourage and promote positive health behaviors among
employees. This can range from conducting health screenings
and organizing health education events to implementing
fitness programs and offering healthcare benefits,
demonstrating various ways in which organizations can
cultivate a culture of well-being. This concept has been highly
recognized given the global pandemic, economy, and political
climate stressors over the last few years. Why is this important
to healthcare leaders?

 1. Healthy workers absorb less healthcare costs
 2. Healthy workers have fewer absences from work and

      fewer road accidents
 3. Healthy, happier workers are easier to retain (Aldana,

      2023)

Healthy workers are beneficial to employee morale,
organizational culture, and the bottom line. Organizations
must commit to investing time and resources into meaningful
237 | LEADING FOR SAFETY

support endeavors. Wellness programs that focus on the
detrimental consequences of smoking, maintaining a healthy
weight, addressing depression, managing stress, and alleviating
emotional strain due to work-related factors can address the
most significant concerns and challenges faced by employees.
Creating policies that support healthier living and encompass
aspects of physical and mental health, as well as encouraging
preventative care are good starting points.

Effective Workplace Wellness

Approaches to improve workplace wellness start with effective
onboarding. Provide professional development for continued
educational growth and encourage team-building. Gone are
the days of 40-hour work weeks being chained to a desk. If
feasible, employees prefer flexible work schedules or the ability
to work from home occasionally. Some incentives, according
to Forbes (2023), to boost employee wellness include:

 1. Offer competitive salaries and raises
 2. Create mentorship initiatives
 3. Remote work
 4. Flexible scheduling or reduced workdays
 5. Encourage a work-life balance
 6. Recognize and reward employees
 7. Create a culture that employees want
 8. Provide lifestyle coaching (Mediation/Yoga)
                                                      LEADING FOR SAFETY | 238

 9. Teamwork
10. Addressing and preventing employee burnout
11. Wellness offerings
12. Job perks
13. Professional development
14. Allocate a healthy budget to retention, not just

      recruitment
15. Create a wellness team
16. Build employee engagement

Employee Engagement

Employee engagement should be sincere. Often, employees are
asked for their opinions or support on an issue, but the
decision has already been determined or the consensus of the
employees has no impact on the final decision. This can
potentially have a more detrimental impact on morale than
completely excluding employees altogether from decision-
making. Another warning is providing incentives that do not
incentivize but rather reduce morale, such as performance or
merit-based raises. Too often, employers will down-rank
employees to keep these costs from rising. It can be very
degrading when an individual worker is not valued for their
hard work and dedication. Moreover, having those poor
performance reviews affect their potential income could
inadvertently cause lower motivation. Good employees who
know their value will leave, and should.
239 | LEADING FOR SAFETY

   Additionally, employees should have transparent knowledge
of the organization's vision or current state. Communication
is critical. This could include potential bonuses and raises,
open positions, layoffs, furloughs, and changes in policy.
Open, transparent communication builds trust. When
employees are not happy, there should be avenues to address
those complaints without fear of retribution. Open lines of
communication should not be punitive; however, they should
follow the proper chain of command or be addressed with the
union representative.

Conclusion

Mental and physical workplace safety are interconnected. A
safe and healthy workplace addresses both the physical and
psychological well-being of employees (and patients), leading
to improved safety outcomes and overall organizational
success. Leadership should focus on providing safe equipment,
implementing safety protocols, and maintaining a hazard-free
environment to ensure that employees can perform tasks
without the risk of injury or harm. They should also create
an environment where employees feel supported and free from
excessive stress, harassment, or discrimination. Mental safety
is crucial for maintaining a healthy work atmosphere and
promoting employee engagement and productivity
(Breeneman, 2023).

Key Takeaways

 More than 3 million incidents of occupational
   injuries and illnesses are reported annually.

 Workplace safety culture pertains to the
   shared attitudes, values, and conduct within
   an organization that places a paramount

PART I

ORGANIZATIONAL
LIABILITY

Introduction

Healthcare organizations can be held directly accountable for
accidents that occur partly as a result of their own negligence.
245 | ORGANIZATIONAL LIABILITY

A patient may be injured due to the inadequate care of a
specific doctor, but the healthcare organization to which that
doctor was connected may be responsible for putting that
patient with that specific doctor. Thus, there is a need for
liability insurance. The purpose of liability insurance is to
distribute the costs and economic losses of risks. Premiums
increase as needed to cover the costs of litigation. Due to the
rising costs of malpractice premiums, physicians may limit
their risks by refusing new patients or limiting the complexity
of patients they will treat. Several factors affect malpractice,
including uncertainty with healthcare policy, inflation,
emerging technologies, and high-risk procedures (Pozgar,
2021).

     Learning Objectives

           Identify the institutional liability that may
             result from apparent authority

           Recognize the circumstances under which
             institutions are subject to direct Tort liability

           Differentiate between an employee and an
             independent contractor in the healthcare
             context

           Analyze Tort liability through the application
             of Respondeat Superior

Direct Tort Liability

Direct tort liability is a legal principle where an individual or
entity is legally obliged to take responsibility for causing harm
or injury to another person or party due to their own actions
or negligence. In this context, "tort" denotes civil wrongdoing,
such as negligence, intentional harm, or a breach of duty, that
results in harm or losses for someone else. With direct tort
liability, the person or entity directly responsible for the
wrongful action or negligence is held accountable for the
resulting damages without needing to establish any
intermediary or third-party liability. It involves holding the
party directly at fault legally accountable for their actions or
failures and pursuing compensation or legal remedies for the
harm inflicted. When the negligent actions of two different
parties contribute to the ultimate injury, the two parties are
considered joint tortfeasors and will face joint liability.
Plaintiffs can recover the full amount of any award from either
defendant in this case. This is concerning for healthcare
entities that employ negligent providers (Perry & Thompson,
2017).
247 | ORGANIZATIONAL LIABILITY

A. End of Immunity

For decades between the 1940s and 1990s, charitable
healthcare organizations and religious hospitals possessed
immunity from legal liability under the charitable immunity
doctrine. Over time, the doctrine faced criticism for allowing
these organizations the ability to evade responsibility for harm
caused by their negligence. Changes in the evolving healthcare
system have moved away from these types of exemptions;
furthermore, Britain and Canada have abandoned this
doctrine entirely. While charitable immunity has been
completely abolished in some states, others still maintain some
version of it. Legal scholars are predicting the possible
extinction of the charitable immunity doctrine in the near
future (Perry & Thompson, 2017).

B. Establishing Direct Tort Liability

A healthcare organization can be held directly accountable for
accidents that occur partly as a result of their own negligence;
immunity is no longer applicable because the organization is
showing negligence by not complying with proper
supervision, monitoring, selection, and/or utilization reviews
of those providers.
                                             ORGANIZATIONAL LIABILITY | 248

      1. Monitor and Supervise

To safeguard patients, hospitals are required to monitor and
assess the treatment patients receive. Although doctors are not
required to guarantee specific outcomes, it is still expected that
treatment plans are regularly assessed based on the patient's
condition and do not significantly depart from established
standards of care. Hospitals must also carry out these
assessments to ensure that each patient receives appropriate
attention from the attending physician. These principles give
rise to hospitals having a general responsibility to monitor and
supervise the physicians they employ (Perry & Thompson,
2017).

      2. Selection

When a hospital initially brings a physician on board, it is the
hospital's responsibility to ensure that the physician possesses
the necessary education, training, and experience suitable for
the designated role. These inquiries must be revisited when the
hospital assigns a specific role to the physician, such as working
in the emergency room, or when considering the physician's
ongoing employment. These obligations also extend to
hospitals that grant independent contractors access to their
facilities. They should also be aware of any malpractice
lawsuits against the physician. These duties also apply to
hospitals that permit the usage of their facilities by
independent contractors (Perry & Thompson, 2017).
249 | ORGANIZATIONAL LIABILITY

      3. Cost Containment and Utilization
      Review

One area where an insurance plan could potentially be held
directly responsible for negligence is in the execution of
utilization review processes. Utilization review occurs when
the health plan assesses a physician's request for the approval
of a specific treatment. It serves as a secondary evaluation of
treatment decisions, primarily aimed at controlling expenses.
Managed care organizations that prioritize cost-effective
healthcare delivery may also employ some form of utilization
review (Perry & Thompson, 2017).

   However, these reviews must be conducted with the
appropriate level of care because a denied treatment can have a
significant impact on the patient. The determination of what
constitutes an appropriate level of care is specific to the
individual circumstances. Two cases from California,
occurring within a five-year period, serve as examples. In the
first case, the court ruled that the plan was not negligent, but
in the second case, the court identified enough evidence of
potential negligence to send the case back to the trial court for
further consideration (Perry & Thompson, 2017).

      4. Conclusion

Organizations can be held liable for inadequate selection of
                                             ORGANIZATIONAL LIABILITY | 250

providers, insufficient training and monitoring, as well as
improper utilization reviews. Reasonable precautions should
be taken by organizations to ensure the best approach for
developing rules for conduct, selection, supervision, and
monitoring is followed to discourage being held liable.
Constant communication with staff and enforcement of
policy are best practices. The ability to show a failure to follow
the rules established does not automatically excuse the
organization; however, inadequate rules could show direct
negligence liability for the organization (Perry & Thompson,
2017). Organizations may be held liable for negligent practices
such as:

 1. Allowing a physician to practice outside his/her scope of
      practice

 2. Not providing consistent time for supervision
 3. Lack of emergency coverage and procedures
 4. Lack of sufficient monitoring of physician's practice

      and/or documentation
 5. Lack of consistent feedback prior to evaluation
 6. Violation of professional boundaries

Vicarious Liability for Torts of an Agent [YouTu

Respondeat Superior

The primary approach for torts by agents is respondeat
superior which is the legal doctrine that ascribes the
responsibility to a party for the acts of others known as
vicarious liability. This doctrine stipulates that employers can
be held responsible for the wrongful actions of their
employees. This concept stems from the nature of agency
itself, where a principal delegates a task to an agent, who agrees
to carry it out while operating under the principal's authority.
In essence, the agent is considered an extension of the
principal, acting on their behalf and under their control.
Therefore, when an agent commits a tort, it can be inferred
that the wrongful act was executed on behalf of and under
the control of the principal. Consequently, it is reasonable to
attribute vicarious liability to the principal. This extension of
liability also serves the purpose of ensuring that plaintiffs have
the opportunity to seek damages from additional parties who
may have the financial means to adequately compensate them,
                                              ORGANIZATIONAL LIABILITY | 252

promoting fairness in the legal system (Perry & Thompson,
2017).

   According to Perry and Thompson (2017), when
distinguishing between an individual being classified as an
employee or an independent contractor, the key factor to
consider is the level of control involved. If a principal has the
authority to control the way an agent carries out the services,
especially regarding the physical aspects of the work, the agent
is considered an employee.

   When control only extends to the specific outcome of the
work and not the methods used, it increases the likelihood
of classifying someone as an independent contractor. Other
factors to take into account include the payment method (such
as salary or output-based compensation), the provision of tools
and workspace, and the level of expertise required in the given
occupation. Combining these elements results in a somewhat
complex assessment to determine whether an individual
qualifies as an employee or an independent contractor. It may
be helpful to create separate lists of factors that indicate
employee status and those suggesting independent contractor
status, followed by an overall analysis to determine which
category is more applicable. It's essential to remember that
control often plays a pivotal role in this determination. Lastly,
there should be a determination of whether the harm caused
was within the "scope of employment" and part of the job
(Perry & Thompson, 2017).
253 | ORGANIZATIONAL LIABILITY

Independent Contractor vs. Employee

The scope of employment is straightforward for most
healthcare providers. What is a bit more convoluted is whether
or not they are actually considered hospital employees. In a
traditional view, nurses and administrative staff are considered
employees of the hospital. However, some nurses could be
employed by a physician and contracted by the hospital. In
this circumstance, the physician is the employer of the nurse
in cases of respondeat superior. Alternately, physicians who are
under contract with hospitals are functioning as independent
contractors (Perry & Thompson, 2017).

   At times, courts used legal restrictions on the corporate
practice of medicine to argue that hospitals and insurance
plans could not be held indirectly responsible for the mistakes
of the doctors they were affiliated with. Additionally, in some
cases, courts applied the "captain of the ship" doctrine, often
in conjunction with the "borrowed servant" doctrine. This
doctrine asserted that the attending physician had overall
control over the patient's entire treatment, making it difficult
to assign vicarious liability to the hospital. Courts are more
likely to consider contracting physicians as employees. Once a
hospital chooses to employ a provider, then that provider is
no longer independent of the hospital. However, this concept
becomes more complex in areas like surgical teams that consist
of many different members performing various functions
                                              ORGANIZATIONAL LIABILITY | 254

(surgeon, anesthesiologist, nurse, physician's assistant, surgical
technologist, etc.).

Apparent Authority

Apparent authority is a legal doctrine that deals with the
authority of individuals or entities to act on behalf of another
party based on the appearance or perception of authority
rather than actual or express authority. In the context of
contracts and agency law, it typically arises when a principal
(a person or entity) leads a third party to believe that an agent
(another person or entity) has the authority to act on the
principal's behalf, even if that agent does not have actual
authority to do so. Under this doctrine, hospitals can be liable
for the torts of nurses and physicians. Through words, actions,
or circumstances, the principal (a hospital) must create a
reasonable belief in the third party (patient) that the agent
(physician) has the authority to act on the principal's behalf.
The third party must reasonably rely on the representation or
appearance of authority when interacting with the agent. The
third party must suffer some form of harm or detriment as a
result of their reliance on the agent's apparent authority.

   Apparent authority is distinct from actual authority, where
the agent genuinely possesses the authority to act on behalf of
the principal, either explicitly (express authority) or implicitly
(implied authority). Apparent authority is based on the
perception of authority created by the principal's actions or
255 | ORGANIZATIONAL LIABILITY

representations. A similar theory is provided in Restatement
(Second) of Torts  429 (1966):

      "One who employs an independent contractor to perform
      services for another that are accepted in the reasonable
      belief that the services are being rendered by the employer
      or by his servants is subject to liability for physical harm
      caused by the negligence of the contractor in supplying
      such services, to the same extent as though the employer
      were supplying them himself or by his servants."

Furthermore, the conditions for applying the concept of
apparent authority in tort cases involve the principal's actions
or expressions that cause a reasonable belief in the third party
that someone is acting as their apparent agent, followed by the
third party's reasonable trust in this belief. It's important to
emphasize that when seeking compensation from a healthcare
institution based on apparent authority, it's a form of
secondary liability. To establish such liability, evidence of the
primary liability of the healthcare professional involved must
be provided (Perry & Thompson, 2017).

   When a patient chooses a hospital for their healthcare, the
contractual relationship between the physician and hospital
may not be clear. Nonetheless, patients trust that the
physicians treating them have been vetted by the hospital
where they practice.
               ORGANIZATIONAL LIABILITY | 256

Conclusion

Both respondeat superior and apparent authority are methods
through which the legal system assigns vicarious liability to
healthcare institutions for the wrongful acts of their
physicians. In the case of respondeat superior, liability arises
when the organization exercises a significant degree of control
over the physician. A healthcare institution might consider
reducing its liability by loosening this control. However, there
are often valid reasons for maintaining some level of control
over physicians. Regardless of whether physicians are legally
classified as employees or independent contractors of a
healthcare institution, the public perception of the institution
is heavily influenced by the actions of these physicians. To
establish and uphold a positive reputation, healthcare
institutions may find it necessary to maintain a certain level
of control over their physicians, despite the potential liability
implications. Conversely, apparent authority stems from
insufficient communication between the healthcare
institution and patients. This issue can typically be addressed
by improving communication practices (Perry & Thompson,
2017).

ABUSE

Fraud by Nick Youngson CC BY-SA 3.0 Pix4free.org

Introduction

Federal legislation addressing healthcare fraud and abuse
includes the False Claims Act, the Anti-Kickback Statute, and
Stark Laws, or "Ethics in Patient Referrals Act." The Federal
Government and society place enormous trust in physicians,
                                                         ANTI FRAUD ABUSE | 260

and physicians must strive to work ethically, render high-
quality medical care to their patients, and submit proper
claims for payment. Patients are most vulnerable and rely on
the provider, placing trust at the core of the physician-patient
relationship. Additionally, Medicare, Medicaid, and other
federal healthcare programs rely on physicians' medical
judgment to treat beneficiaries with appropriate services and
to submit accurate and truthful claim information.

Dishonest healthcare providers who exploit the healthcare
system for illegal personal gain have created the need for laws
that combat fraud and abuse and ensure appropriate quality
medical care. These federal laws guide physician relationships
to help avoid potential conflicts of interest and liability.

Anti-Fraud Legislation

Established anti-fraud laws function in three ways: protecting
taxpayers' funds, protecting consumers, and encouraging fair
competition in the market.

   Protecting Public Funds and Taxpayers:

   Prevent financial losses: Healthcare fraud is estimated
      to cost billions of dollars annually in the US
      alone. Antifraud laws aim to deter and punish such
      activities, safeguarding public funds and taxpayer dollars
      used to finance healthcare programs like Medicare and
      Medicaid.

   Ensure program sustainability: By curbing
      fraud, these laws help ensure the long-term financial
      viability of healthcare programs, allowing them to
      continue providing crucial services to eligible
      individuals.

Protecting Patients and Consumers:

   Preventing unnecessary or harmful
      procedures: Some fraudulent schemes involve billing
      for unnecessary services or even harmful
      procedures. Antifraud laws help protect patients from
      being unknowingly subjected to such practices.

   Safeguarding access to quality care: Fraudulent
      activities can distort healthcare delivery and prioritize
      financial gain over patient well-being. Antifraud laws
      help ensure patients have access to ethical and high-
      quality healthcare.

   Maintaining trust in healthcare systems: Widespread
      healthcare fraud can erode public trust in healthcare
      providers and institutions. Antifraud laws aim to uphold
      ethical standards and build confidence in the healthcare
      system.

Promoting Fair Competition and Market Integrity:

   Leveling the playing field: Fraudulent practices can
      give some providers an unfair advantage over
      others. Antifraud laws help create a level playing field for
      legitimate healthcare providers, fostering fair
      competition and market integrity.

   Discouraging unethical business practices: These
      laws act as a deterrent against illegal practices like
      kickbacks, bribery, and self-referrals, which can distort
      market dynamics and lead to inefficient allocation of
263 | ANTI FRAUD ABUSE

      resources.

Context

According to the American Medical Association (2023), U.S.
healthcare spending reached $4.3 trillion in 2021. The
majority of these payments came from the federal government
(Medicare/Medicaid) or private insurance plans. Since payers
are not present for the exchange of business transactions, the
opportunities for fraud and abuse are enormous.
Consequently, a variety of federal laws have been created to
deter and penalize fraud and abuse cases.

False Claims Act (31 U.S.C. ㎣
3729-3733)

During the Civil War, the False Claims Act (FCA) was enacted
in 1863 to combat fraud by contractors supplying the Union
Army and to stop war profiteers from defrauding the
government. In 1986, the law was expanded to include
whistleblower projections in its scope (Perry & Thompson,
2017). The act itself states:

      (a)Any person who (1)knowingly presents, or causes to
      be presented, to an officer or employee of the United States
      Government or a member of the Armed Forces of the
      United States a false or fraudulent claim for payment or
      approval; (2) knowingly makes, uses, or causes to be made
      or used, a false record or statement to get a false or
      fraudulent claim paid or approved by the Government; (3)
      conspires to defraud the Government by getting a false or
      fraudulent claim paid or approved by the Government; . . .
      or (7) knowingly makes, uses, or causes to be made or used,
      a false record or statement to conceal, avoid, or decrease
      an obligation to pay or transmit money or property to the
      Government, . . . is liable to the United States Government
      for a civil penalty of not less than $5,000 and not more
      than $10,000, as adjusted by the Federal Civil Penalties
      Inflation Adjustment Act of 1990, plus 3 times the
      amount of damages which the Government sustains
      because of the act of that person . . . .

The term "knowingly" means that an individual has
269 | ANTI FRAUD ABUSE

knowledge of the information and acts in reckless disregard
of the truth or deliberate ignorance of the truth. Under FCA,
no proof of specific intent to defraud is required. The
whistleblower provisions allow individuals to file suit on
behalf of the federal government. A whistleblower might be
current or ex-business partners, hospital staff, patients, or
competitors. A private citizen filing suit acts as a qui tam
plaintiff on behalf of the government and is protected against
retaliation by the employer.

   Each civil claim can lead to an award of both five to ten
thousand dollars plus treble damages as well as lead to
criminal penalties with an individual fine of at least $250,000
and an institutional fine of at least $500,000 per false claim.
This could include billing for services not provided or
falsifying medical records or documentation to gain money.

Anti-Kickback (42 U.S.C. ㎣
1320a-7b(b))

   The Anti-Kickback Statute (AKS) was created in the Social
Security Act Amendments of 1972. This statute makes paying
for referrals a crime in federal healthcare programs. It applies
to those who offer pay remuneration and recipients of any
kickbacks, bribes, or rebates either directly or indirectly,
overtly or covertly, in cash or in-kind in return for referrals.
Violations are federal offenses, and penalties can include fines
                                                         ANTI FRAUD ABUSE | 270

of up to $25,000 and/or up to 5 years of imprisonment (Perry
& Thompson, 2017).

   Physicians are a great source of referrals for services from
other physicians and pharmaceutical/medical supply vendors
and are therefore attractive targets for kickback schemes.
Physicians are in a unique position because they select what
medications their patients use and who they refer the patients
to for further care. There is justification for these practices,
warranting a criminal statute with significant jail time and
financial penalties. Courts recognize the presence of
"knowingly" committing this action indicates a scienter
requirement. The statute further guides that kickbacks in
healthcare can lead to 1) overutilization 2) increased program
costs 3) corruption of medical decision-making 4) patient
steering 5) unfair competition. Therefore, the statute prohibits
all sources of referrals where Medicare and Medicaid programs
require copays for services. Waiving copays or advertisements
for copay forgiveness could implicate the Anti-Kickback
Statute. However, copays may be waived if the patient is
unable to financial afford to pay or all collection efforts have
failed. Free or discounted services can be offered to the
uninsured population (Morgan, 2019).

   In cases of AKS violations, the government does not need to
prove patient harm or financial loss. If services were rendered
medically necessary, a physician can still be found guilty of
violating AKS. Any financial incentives, gifts, etc. from a
vendor are unjustifiable (Morgan, 2019).
271 | ANTI FRAUD ABUSE

Safe Harbors

There are several safe harbors concerning AKS. Safe harbors
listed below are examples of payments or arrangements that are
generally considered to be fair and reasonable, and that are not
likely to influence a healthcare provider's clinical judgment.

   Discounts that are disclosed and tied to the actual costs
      or charges incurred

   Employee compensation, but not compensation for
      independent contractors

   Group purchasing rebates, under certain conditions
   Certain risk-sharing mechanisms

The Department of Health & Human Services established 25
other safe harbors that include:

   fair market value leases (leases are in writing, signed by
      both parties and for at least one year),

   fair market value personal services contracts,
   fair market value for the sale of practices, and
   payments for referral services for patients with the

      proviso that the amount of the remuneration cannot
      depend on the number of referrals (Perry & Thompson,
      2017).
                                                         ANTI FRAUD ABUSE | 272

Stark Law (42 U.S.C. ㎣ 1395nn)

Enacted in 1989, the Stark Law, also known as the Physician
Self-Referral Law, is a federal law that prohibits physicians
from referring Medicare or Medicaid patients to receive certain
designated health services (DHS) payable by Medicare or
Medicaid from entities in which the physician or an immediate
family member has a financial relationship unless an exception
applies.

   The Stark Law is intended to prevent conflicts of interest
and to protect patients from being referred to providers who
may not be in their best interests. According to Perry and
Thompson (2017), the law applies to a wide range of DHS,
including:

   clinical laboratory services;
   physical therapy, occupational therapy, and outpatient

      speech-language pathology services;
   radiology and certain other imaging services;
   radiation therapy services and supplies;
   DME and supplies;
   parenteral and enteral nutrients, equipment, and

      supplies;
   prosthetics, orthotics, and prosthetic devices and

      supplies;
   home health services;
   outpatient prescription drugs;
273 | ANTI FRAUD ABUSE

   inpatient and outpatient hospital services; and
   Outpatient speech-language pathology services

Proof of specific intent to violate the law is not required since
Stark law is a strict liability statute. Violation penalties
include fines and exclusion from participating in federal
healthcare programs. While both the False Claims Act and
Anti-Kickback Law require a showing that the wrongdoing
was done "knowingly," the Stark Law has no such requirement
for intent. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services
(CMS) will deny payment when a Stark Law violation is
determined and the entity can be fined up to $15,000 for each
referral; and potentially $100,000 for an arrangement
designed to circumvent the law followed by exclusion from
participating in Medicare and Medicaid. Moreover, Stark
violations may lead to False Claims Act violations because
courts can find that an entity submitting an illegal claim under
Stark is equivalent to making a false claim.

   The Stark Law is complex, and there are many nuances and
exceptions. Physicians and healthcare organizations need to
have a good understanding of the law to avoid compliance
violations. Here is a summary of the key points of the Stark
Law:

          Prohibits physicians from referring Medicare or
            Medicaid patients to receive DHS from entities in
            which the physician or an immediate family
                                                          ANTI FRAUD ABUSE | 274

            member has a financial relationship unless an
            exception applies.
          Applies to a wide range of DHS, including
            laboratory services, imaging services, physical
            therapy, and occupational therapy.
          There are several exceptions to the law, including
            exceptions for in-office ancillary services, hospital-
            based physician services, bona fide employment
            arrangements, personal services arrangements, and
            shared savings arrangements.
          Physicians and healthcare organizations should
            have a good understanding of the law to avoid
            compliance violations.

Exceptions

Due to the strict liability nature, once a referral is made that
would violate Stark Law, an exception must apply to allow for
a claim to be submitted. There are several exceptions to the
Stark Law, including exceptions for:

   In-office ancillary services
   Hospital-based physician services
   Bona fide employment arrangements
   Personal services arrangements
   Shared savings arrangements
275 | ANTI FRAUD ABUSE

Bona Fide Employment Relationships

A Bona fide employment relationship under the Stark Law
Statute includes:

   (A) the employment is for identifiable services,

       (B) the amount of the remuneration under the
employment--

          (i) is consistent with the fair market value of the
services, and

          (ii) is not determined in a manner that takes into
account (directly or indirectly) the volume or value of any
referrals by the referring physician,

   (C) the remuneration is provided pursuant to an agreement
that would be commercially reasonable even if no referrals
were made to the employer, and

   (D) the employment meets such other requirements as the
Secretary may impose by regulation as needed to protect
against program or patient abuse.

   Subparagraph (B)(ii) shall not prohibit the payment of
remuneration in the form of a productivity bonus based on
services performed personally by the physician (or an
immediate family member of such physician).

Accurate Billing and Coding

Physicians are trusted by payers to provide necessary, cost-
effective, and quality care. Physicians exert significant influence
over what services their patients receive and control the
documentation that describes those services. This
documentation is used to bill insurers. The government pays
claims based solely on the information provided in these
documents.

   Because the government invests so much trust in physicians,
it has powerful criminal, civil, and administrative enforcement
tools to prosecute fraud. The government has broad
capabilities to audit claims and investigate providers when it
suspects unscrupulous abuse. This suspicion may be raised by
irregular billing patterns or reports from others, such as staff,
competitors, and patients. In other words, the government
                                                         ANTI FRAUD ABUSE | 278

expects physicians to be honest and ethical in their billing
practices. If there is any evidence of fraud, the government will
investigate and take action.

   When a claim for services is submitted for a Medicare or
Medicaid beneficiary, the bill is filed with the federal
government and must certify that the payment requested is
earned and complies with billing requirements.

The attempt to collect unearned money after submitting a
false claim constitutes a violation. A common type of false
claim is "upcoding," which refers to using billing codes that
reflect a more severe illness than existed or a more expensive
treatment than was provided. Additional examples of
improper claims include:

   billing for services that you did not actually render;
   billing for services that were not medically necessary;
   billing for services that were performed by an improperly

      supervised or unqualified employee;
   billing for services that were performed by an employee

      who has been excluded from participation in the Federal
      health care programs;
   billing for services of such low quality that they are
      virtually worthless; and
   billing separately for services already included in a global
      fee, like billing for an evaluation and management
      service the day after surgery.
279 | ANTI FRAUD ABUSE

Upcoding

Medicare uses Evaluation and Management (E&M) codes to
pay for many physician services. New patient visits generally
take longer than follow-up visits for established patients, so
E&M codes for new patients pay more. Upcoding is when
you bill for a higher level E&M code than the services actually
provided. For example, if you provide a follow-up office visit
but bill for a comprehensive new patient office visit, that is
upcoding which is a serious offense that can result in fines,
imprisonment, and exclusion from Medicare and Medicaid
programs.

   Another example of upcoding includes the misuse of
Modifier 25 to claim payment for an E&M service when the
patient care rendered was not significant, was not separately
identifiable, and was not above and beyond the care usually
associated with the procedure.

Physician Documentation

Physicians must keep accurate and complete medical records
and documentation of the services they provide. They must
also ensure that their claims are supported by this
documentation. Medicare and Medicaid may review
beneficiary medical records. Good documentation helps to
ensure that patients receive the right care from all providers
and that physicians can defend their bills against challenges.
Physicians must document everything done for their patients,

both for the patient's benefit and to protect themselves from
accusations of fraud.

Physician Investments in Healthcare
Business Ventures

When physicians invest in outside businesses that provide
ancillary services to their patients, they may refer
disproportionately more patients to those businesses, leading
to excessive and medically unnecessary referrals, which waste
government and beneficiary money and can expose patients
to harm. This can be a conflict of interest and may lead to
patients receiving medically unnecessary and expensive
services. These investment relationships have serious legal risks
under the AKS and Stark Law.

Physician Recruitment

In some communities that possess multiple hospitals where
the competition for patients is high, financial incentives to
recruit physicians may be illegal. Meaning, that competition
for loyalty to a specific hospital can cross the line into illegal
arrangements for which the physician and the hospital can
be liable (Perry & Thompson, 2017). Hospitals may offer
financial incentives to attract physicians to underserved areas.
However, competition between hospitals for patient referrals
can lead to illegal inducements. As such, physicians must be
281 | ANTI FRAUD ABUSE

aware of the Stark Law and Anti-Kickback Statute (AKS)
regulations governing recruitment arrangements. Hospitals
can provide legitimate relocation assistance and practice
support, but cannot offer payments, free rent, or other benefits
designed to influence referrals. Patient admissions should be
based on medical needs or patient preferences, not promises
to be admitted to a specific hospital. Physicians offered
recruitment packages should not negotiate benefits in
exchange for referrals unless they are hospital employees. If
pressured to admit patients to specific locations, seeking legal
counsel is crucial. Legal counsel should be sought if someone
enters into a relationship that requires patient admission to a
specific hospital or practice group.

Considerations for Directors

Keeping in mind that a medical director of a nursing home or
other facility may be held professionally responsible for their
patients as well as other attending physicians' patients by State
and Federal authorities, the following tips are recommended.

   Directly manage and monitor the quality of clinical care
      provided in the facility.

   Guide and inspire the medical staff to consistently meet
      and exceed the established standards of care.

   Champion ongoing learning and development
      opportunities for all healthcare professionals, including
                                                         ANTI FRAUD ABUSE | 282

      physicians, nurses, and other staff members.
   Proactively identify and address any issues or concerns

      impacting patient care quality.

Samples

Pharmaceutical samples from industry representatives can be
legally provided free of charge to a physician; however, it can
be problematic. In theory, it is a good way to get low-income
patients started on a medication. However, is it fair to provide
samples to friends of the physician? How many samples should
one patient receive? What happens if the medication gets
recalled? How will those sample distributions be tracked?
How will the clinic prevent theft, tampering, or reselling of
samples? Billing Medicare patients for free samples has led to
physician prosecution. If a clinic decides to make samples
available to offer, several precautions safeguarding the above-
mentioned concerns should be considered.

   A Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) and policy
      should be developed which clearly documents the
      proper process for accepting samples.

   A trusted individual should be responsible for accepting
      samples and logging them into an inventory log.

   Have a reliable system in place to safely store the samples
      and ensure that samples are not commingled with
      commercial stock.
283 | ANTI FRAUD ABUSE

   Log books for signing samples in and out should be
      available in the cabinet.

   Monitoring for expiration, par levels, and compliance
      should be performed routinely.

Vendor and Sales Rep Relationships

Sales representative and physician collaboration is critical in
supporting medical advances and using new innovations in
the medical field. However, these relationships must be kept
at a professional level to avoid conflicts of interest. Most
companies are aware of laws forbidding free lunches,
subsidized trips, and gifts (bribes) to providers in exchange
for loyalty to their product; however, there are some
circumstances where the company may offer financial
incentives for research, speaking engagements, etc. The
relationship can be kept legal if the physician asks the following
questions:

   Does the vendor's company really need the provider's
      particular expertise or input?

   Does the amount of money the company is offering
      seem fair, appropriate, and commercially reasonable for
      what the provider is being asked to do?

   Is it possible the company is paying the provider for their
      loyalty so that they will prescribe its drugs or use its
      devices?
                                                         ANTI FRAUD ABUSE | 284

Contributing time and effort can be legally compensated
within the fair market value, and a provider can serve as a bona
fide consultant. However, if providers are urged to prescribe a
particular drug or medical device, it could likely violate fraud
and abuse laws.

Transparency

The Department of Justice and OIG require "transparency"
in physician-industry relationships, including the public
disclosure of payments any physician receives from a vendor.
The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010
requires drug, device, and biologic companies to publicly
report nearly all gifts or payments made to physicians
beginning in 2013. Academic medical institutions have strict
limitations on vendor interactions and policies concerning
industry-sponsored research. Additionally, the pharmaceutical
and medical device industry has adopted codes of ethics for
provider-industry relationships.

Conflicts-of-Interest Disclosures

Healthcare providers are required to disclose their financial
relationships with the pharmaceutical industry to their
patients and institutions, even if legal, due to conflict-of-
interest policies set by institutions, grant funders, or the FDA.
Managing these conflicts involves understanding relevant
285 | ANTI FRAUD ABUSE

policies, openly disclosing industry funding, and following any
restrictions. A conflict of interest (COI) arises when an
individual's personal interests potentially influence their
professional judgment or actions in a way that could harm
patient care or public trust. This can happen in healthcare
and pharmaceutical relationships which is a serious concern
because it can lead to:

   Overuse or inappropriate use of medications
   Increased healthcare costs
   Reduced quality of care
   Loss of public trust in healthcare providers and the

      pharmaceutical industry

Serval measures should be in place to prevent COIs including
disclosure of financial relationships; obeying laws that regulate
COI, abiding by the professional code of either, and providing
transparency. When unsure, consult someone.

Continuing Medical Education (CME)

Drug and device manufacturers sponsor many educational
opportunities for physicians. Not all educational sessions are
created equal. Watch out for industry-sponsored events,
especially those promoting specific brands over broader
treatment options. Even if presented by a respected doctor,
their talk might be less about education and more about
                                                         ANTI FRAUD ABUSE | 286

marketing. Beware of off-label recommendations in medical
talks, especially for drugs or devices not approved for those
uses. Double-check any such claims against independent data.
While doctors can prescribe off-label, manufacturers can't
promote it. Remember, all drug ads must be truthful and
approved-use focused. Help the FDA catch misleading ads
through their Bad Ad Program. If an advertising violation
occurs, it should be reported to the FDA.

Compliance and Monitoring

Maintaining a compliance program acts like a shield against
fraud and guarantees accurate medical claims. Written policies
and procedures outlining best practices for billing, coding, and
other key areas should be clear. There should be a designated
compliance officer responsible for overseeing and enforcing the
program and should proactively audit and review billing and
coding practices to identify errors. Lastly, swift response to
violations should involve identifying compliance issues with
corrective measures and disciplinary actions. The Patient
Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010 requires that
physicians who treat Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries
establish a compliance program. The Office of Inspector
General of the Department of Health & Human Services and
the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services provide
organizations with advice on these issues. However, the entity
287 | ANTI FRAUD ABUSE

must disclose relevant facts and state specifically what the
opinion is for (the specific grounds and law that it addresses).

Key Takeaways

      Federal legislation addressing healthcare fraud
        and abuse includes the False Claims Act, the
        Anti-Kickback Statute, and Stark Laws.

      The False Claims Act (FCA) was enacted in
        1863 to combat fraud by contractors
        supplying the Union Army and to stop war
        profiteers from defrauding the government.

      The Anti-Kickback Statute (AKS) was created
        in the Social Security Act Amendments of
        1972. This statute makes paying for referrals a
        crime in federal healthcare programs.
291 | ANTI FRAUD ABUSE

           Enacted in 1989, the Stark Law, also known as
             the Physician Self-Referral Law, is a federal
             law that prohibits physicians from referring
             Medicare or Medicaid patients to receive
             certain designated health services (DHS)
             payable by Medicare or Medicaid from entities
             in which the physician or an immediate family
             member has a financial relationship unless an
             exception applies.

           There are several exceptions to the Stark Law,
             including exceptions for (1) In-office ancillary
             services, (2) Hospital-based physician
             services, (3) Bona fide employment
             arrangements, (4) Personal services
             arrangements, and (5) Shared savings
             arrangements.

           Four key elements of a bona fide employment
             relationship under the Stark Law Statute:

                      (A) Identifiable Services: The
                      physician must be employed to provide
                      specific, identifiable services, not just
                      generally to generate referrals.

                      (B) Fair Market Value & No
                      Referral-Based Compensation: The
                                                   ANTI FRAUD ABUSE | 292

                physician's compensation must be
                based on the fair market value of the
                services they provide, and it cannot be
                directly or indirectly tied to the volume
                or value of referrals they make to the
                employer.
                (C) Commercially Reasonable
                Agreement: The employment
                agreement itself must be commercially
                reasonable, meaning it would be
                considered fair and appropriate even if
                no referrals were expected.
                (D) Additional Requirements: The
                Secretary of Health and Human
                Services may impose additional
                requirements through regulations to
                further protect against program or
                patient abuse.

INSTRUCTIONS FOR THE CASE
BRIEF ANALYSIS

Lawyers approach legal issues with a structured, thorough
analysis. To learn health law material, it is helpful to apply a
similar approach. The standard approach for legal analysis is
called IRAC, for:

1) ISSUE 2) RULE 3) ANALYSIS 4) CONCLUSION

When applying this approach, analyzing a particular case is
called "briefing" the case. To complete a brief, you should do
the following:

 1. Identify significant legal issue(s) in the case.
 2. For each issue, identify the legal rule that is relevant to

      that issue.
 3. Use the legal rule to analyze the facts of the case.

          Address each requirement of that legal rule.
          Use a relevant fact to analyze each requirement.
          Then, connect the facts to the rule with an

            appropriate explanation.

4. Finally, make a reasonable conclusion based on your
analysis.

Legal Writing: What is IRAC? [YouTube] 2015 by L

INSTRUCTIONS FOR THE CASE
BRIEF ASSIGNMENT

Format the briefing case using the following sections:

 1. CASE NAME: Title of paper
 2. FACTS: State any relevant circumstances of the case.

      Remember, no opinions, please.
 3. ISSUE(S): This is the legal "question" you are asking the

      court to resolve. Be concise. (example: Was there a legal
      contact? Was it breached?)
 4. DECISION: What is the court's "answer" to the
      question on the issue?
297 | IRAC ANALYSIS & WRITING A CASE BRIEF

 5. REASONS: This is why the court ruled the way it did;
      use your legal terms from the chapter.

 6. MANAGERIAL IMPLICATIONS: What is the
      significance? Consider that you have been hired to
      address the issue in this case; how will you prevent future
      similar litigation for the organization? Remember to tie
      in the content from the chapter.

When you begin, list the relevant facts and think about what
seems to be the most important facets of the case. These facts
can help you develop your analysis. When you get stuck on
what to do next in your analysis, look back at the facts and see
if one of those facts can help you get started again. The issue
is the question for the court to determine, and the decision is
the court's answer. Finally, when you are done with the legal
analysis, you should step back and ask yourself, "What does
this all mean for you as a healthcare executive or administrator?
How can you prevent this type of litigation from happening
again?"
          GLOSSARY | 298

GLOSSARY

negligence per se

      is a doctrine in US law whereby an act is considered
      negligent because it violates a statute. The doctrine is
      effectively a form of strict liability. Negligence per se
      means greater liability than contributory negligence.

qui tam

      is a Latin phrase that means "he who sues for the king as
      well as for himself." It is a legal term that refers to a type
      of lawsuit in which a private citizen brings a lawsuit on
      behalf of the government to prosecute fraud against the
      government.

res ipsa loquitur

      a legal doctrine that doesn't require proof of breach

respondeat superior

      is a Latin phrase that literally means "let the master
      answer." It is also a legal doctrine applicable in many civil
      claims throughout the United States. Under the legal
299 | GLOSSARY

      doctrine, an employer can be held accountable for
      negligence or wrongdoing committed by their employee
      or agent.

Factual causation

      refers to whether the act or omission was a necessary
      condition for the harm to occur. In other words, would
      the harm have happened anyway, even if the act or
      omission had not occurred?

acceptance

      A statement by one party (called the offeree) that he/she
      is prepared to be bound to the contractual position stated
      in an offer, the second essential element to the meeting of
      the minds of the contracting parties

analogous

      having a similar relationship to something else

Apparent authority

      is a legal doctrine that deals with the authority of
      individuals or entities to act on behalf of another party
      based on the appearance or perception of authority,
      rather than actual or express authority.
                    GLOSSARY | 300

Assault

an intentional act that puts another person in reasonable
apprehension of imminent harmful or offensive contact.
No physical contact or injury is required

at-will employment

any hiring is presumed to be 'at will'; that is, the employer
is free to discharge individuals 'for good cause, or bad
cause, or no cause at all,' and the employee is equally free
to quit, strike, or otherwise cease work.

B<PL

Id. at 173.

battery

is the harmful touching of someone without their
consent or unlawful physical restraint, which may lead to
false imprisonment

blameless culture

is a workplace environment that fosters transparency,
open communication, and a focus on learning from
mistakes rather than assigning blame to individuals or
teams.

breach

      Failure to take reasonable care

capacity

      denotes a person's ability to satisfy the elements required
