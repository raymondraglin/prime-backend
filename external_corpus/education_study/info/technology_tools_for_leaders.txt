Overview

Design thinking refers to the set of procedures used by designers
to create solutions to resolve problems. It is often associated with
the innovation of products and services within many workplace
contexts. It is relevant to technology and leadership, because it will
provide a framework for identifying needs, developing solutions,
and the maintenance of those solutions over time. An idea is a
valuable asset, but planning and protocols need to be structured
prior to execution to verify the sustainability and long-term role the
idea will have within the future of the organization. Solid leaders

                                                                                        Chapter 1 | 1

from the course.

History

Watch the short video below from Harvard Business Review, which
shares a brief history of design thinking and how it can be used to
transform your leadership.

General Framework

The five stages of design thinking.
There is a general framework for design thinking but above all else,
remember design thinking is a human-centered design focus. Here
are the elements of design thinking outlined by Berman (2019):

   The people come first.

                                                                                        Chapter 1 | 3
       
            Assess the actual needs of your stakeholders. The people
            within your organization and possibly the people your
            organization serves will be affected by the choices. It is
            important to understand how users will interact with the
            technology proposed, as their potential interactions (or
            the lack of!) will likely fuel your eventual decision. Putting
            the people first goes beyond surveying users, it is also
            bringing relevant people to the conversation to
            throughout the process, rather than just at the beginning.
            The more invested your constituents are, the more
            successful the initiative!

   Learn to fail successfully.
        The art of failing will be discussed in more detail in
            Chapter 6. However, the overview is failure does not
            inhibit success, it can often encourage greater successes
            when we are forced to pivot and overcome challenges.
            Design thinking will support a project, offering ways to fail
            without extensive costs. For example, prototyping a tool

4 | Chapter 1
            can help identify challenges as well as solutions before it is
            launched organization-wide.
   Brainstorming = Idea Generation
        Brainstorming is a common technique, to flex your
            creative muscles as you develop new strategies.
            Brainstorming, with the added benefit of the human-
            centered approach, will provide a means for all to
            contribute, giving a voice to those who may not have it
            otherwise.
   Creative thinking will invite new solutions.
        Once the mindset has shifted from "you cannot fail" to
            "you have the freedom to fail", there are no limits to the
            solutions. The freedom and autonomy to creatively
            address challenges builds connection, increases
            confidence, and often leads to better results.

Relevance

Technology Tools for Leaders is going to show you the process
of design thinking as you develop a program charter, budget, and
progress report on a scenario of your choice. Then, you will work
through other elements related to technology implementation
including communication, failure, continuous improvement, and
privacy concerns. You will investigate the technology needs for an
organization and then prepare the organization's members for
changes in technology, while also developing the initiatives for
technology changes which will maximize organizational
effectiveness.

                                                                                        Chapter 1 | 5
Exercises

Before we dive into some design thinking exercises, please
remember these rules in relation to brainstorming:

   Defer judgment of all suggestions. Maintain an open mind;
      nothing is impossible (yet).

   Encourage unique, wild, and innovative ideas.
   Build on the ideas of others.
   While you want to encourage all the ideas, stay focused on the

      specific initiative.
   Everyone should be respectful in their communication; one

      person should speak at a time to ensure everyone is heard.
   Offer visuals such as a white board if in person or Google Jam

      Boards if you are virtual.
   No idea is a bad idea: Track all ideas, high quantities of ideas

      are expected!

Chapter 2: Program Charter

Overview

A program charter summarizes the benefit of the intended project,
including the purpose, goals, key people, potential problems,
deadlines, and the budget. The program charter is essential in
aligning the vision of the technology with the mission of the
organization. Additionally, it provides necessary transparency, to
keep all parties involved informed of the project goals and
objectives. When proposing new technology, it is important to
properly measure the "solution-level" benefits and align those
benefits with objectives, as well as long-term returns
(Braunschweig, 2019). Learn more about the specifics of the
process and the charters alignment by viewing this page on
Business Process Management.

   In this section of the course, you will work through Lesson 1 and
Lesson 2 of "Manage a Project with Digital Tools". You will develop a
program charter related to the scenario selected in Week 1. Then,
you'll submit it to your focus group and receive helpful feedback.

Planning Technology-Based Outreach

As you begin planning your
technology-based outreach it is
important to remember several
key factors.

   Verify the program you are
      developing aligns with the
      mission detailed in the
      technology scenario. If for
      example you are shifting
      people to remote work,
      make sure the technology
      purchased to support the endeavor is not superfluous and all
      employees have equal access to the same things.

   Recognize who you are intending to serve, understand the
      profile of the key persons affected. How you communicate
      with a specific population will vary greatly. Consider the
      difference between speaking to senior executives in
      technology as opposed to senior executives in a library system;
      it is likely how you communicate will be different. Convey your
      message well, in an appropriate manner which all can
      understand, but do not condescend.
        Beyond the standard conversations, it will likely be
            beneficial to have more personal conversations in small
            groups or with individuals to understand needs.
            Developing rapport with those involved will promote
            successful inclusion and acceptance of the program; you
            may even find advocates to the cause which you can use to
            bolster the program implementation.

   Consider the amount of training and practice required in order
      to become proficient in the use of a specific form of
      technology. Even just switching from a corded keyboard to a

                                                                                       Chapter 2 | 9
      wireless one can require some troubleshooting. Here are some
      questions to consider when implementing new technology,
      adapted from Berman (2019):

        How "robust" is it? Will it travel well? Is it waterproof?
            Does it need a case, bag, or another form of protection?

        How easy is it to use? Is it accessible for all users? Will all
            personnel be able to use the tool without
            accommodations?

        Can you add security elements to the resources to prevent
            theft?

Review the following questions, to begin planning for the program
implementation adapted from Berman (2019).

Executive Summary/Brief

                         One more document to be

                         aware of when preparing for a

                         project is the executive

                         summary, also known as an

                         executive brief. The document

                         provides an overview of the

                         technology        while              also

                         informing the audience of your

                         research. An executive

                         summary will include the

                         following items:

 Overview: A concise explanation as to why the technology
   should be used.

 Problem Identification: Roughly a paragraph which documents
   the problem, using outside sources to support your
   perspective.

 Solution Explanation: Provide one to two paragraphs where
   you explain how your solution will solve the problem. Cite
   relevant examples where possible.

 Highlights: Provide research insights as to how the integration
   of the technology can be successful for the specific situation.
   You can combine written information with a properly
   formatted table to highlight the appropriate information.

                                                              Chapter 2 | 11
   Keys to Success: Share a framework for how you implement
      the technology, including measurable steps.

   Conclusion: Conclude the summary with final thoughts,
      wrapping up the proposal.

Chapter 3: Budgeting for New Technology

After determining what equipment and software are needed, the
next step is to decide how much to spend, how to best acquire it,
and what vendors best met the business's criteria.

   How much to spend
   No business has unlimited
resources. For technology
acquisition it is critical to
determine your needs and
return on investment (ROI).
Some additional considerations
include:

   Which choices cover most of the businesses needs? Multiple
      platforms can lead to lost data and increased potential for
      downtime and compatibility issues.

   What choices make the most sense from a user-need
      standpoint? The technology should unnoticeable to customers
      and users.

Some considerations to consider from a business and asset
standpoint include:

   Existing skill levels and experience of personnel
   Compatibility with current technology
   Physical space available to house new hardware
   Access to needed service providers and local

      telecommunications

Leasing

14 | Chapter 3
Leasing can be a good option if you need to quickly get a lot of
equipment, if the equipment you need is very expensive, or has a
relatively short usable life. Sometimes software is only available as a
subscription or "leasing" model. Leasing can be useful for equipment
because there is no need to dispose of the equipment at the end of
its useful life. Commercial space can also be leased, so you can rent
a place to run your business. In some cases, leasing can actually be
less expensive than purchasing with a high-interest loan.

   Some leasing benefits:

   Less cash or credit needed upfront
   Short-term leases allow for a way to test out the equipment
   Maintenance is sometimes included at no extra cost
   Lease payments for business assets are typically tax deductible

Potential leasing disadvantages:

   The lifetime cost is normally higher than buying

                                                                                      Chapter 3 | 15
   Replacing it when the lease is up could be expensive
   Depreciation of leased assets typically are not tax deductible
   Every lease is structured differently. It is import to look

      carefully at the details of the each agreement

Confirming the details of a lease
There are two general kinds of leases; operating and capital. Since
the accounting treatment is different, the kind of lease can have a
significant impact on taxes.

   Operating lease

   Works like a traditional rental
   Does not get added to the business's balance sheet
   Payments are operational expenses
   Low maintenance, risk, or tax obligations

Capital lease

   Works more like a loan
   Asset is "owned" for accounting purposes
   Added to the balance sheet
   It is possible to claim depreciation and interest expenses
   Requires all maintenance, risk, and tax obligations

There are other considerations. Leases sometimes have buyout
options that let you fully purchase the asset at the end of the lease.
The length of a lease can vary, and shorter leases typically have
higher monthly payments. There are often steep early-termination
penalties for leaving the lease early.

   It would be worthwhile to have an attorney review a lease before
signing, especially if any of the terms or conditions are unclear.

        technologytoolsforleaders/?p=23#h5p-11

Buying

Buying equipment is a good option if there is enough cash or credit
available and will be using the assets for a long time.

   Buying benefits:

   Depreciation is claimable for taxes
   The lifetime cost to buy is usually less than leasing
   The equipment is an asset on the balance sheet

Buying disadvantages:

   More cash or credit needed upfront
   There is less opportunity to "test out" the asset
   Business is fully liable for maintenance and replacement

Buying with cash or credit
   If you buying assets with cash, they are owned in-full right away.

But it also means there is less cash available to cover operating
expenses. It is important to do the accounting legwork to make sure
it is feasible to pay with cash.

   Loans have some of the same benefits of leases by distributing the
total cost over a longer period. However, there are more fees and
interest than buying outright with cash.

   It is also possible to leverage lines of credit with a bank, or look
for other sources to get more funding.

                                                                                      Chapter 3 | 17
   Vendor decision making process
   When making any decision involving multiple points of
consideration and potential vendors, sometimes it is best to
quantify different aspects of the choice. In addition to a traditional
spreadsheet, an excellent way to do do this is with a decision matrix.
It is a simple, but powerful, tool to help budget managers and
stakeholders to narrow down the options and provide clarity.
   Each project has different factors to consider. Below is a sample
of one way to organize the data:

Purchasing surplus goods from the government is an option to
consider. Just about any tangible asset a business might need is sold
by the government at or below the price on the open market.

   When a federal or state agency has extra equipment, seized
goods, or foreclosed property, the goods are either transferred to
another government agency or sold to the public. These items are
sold "as is" by auction or negotiated sale either online, in-person, or
both. State governments tend to have a single auction site online,
while the federal government has several.

Chapter 4: Progress Report

Overview

   A progress report is essential
in large projects. Stakeholders
in the project want to verify the
money, people, and other
resources are being used
appropriately. Additionally, the
stakeholders may have a vested
an interest in the outcome and
may be interested in further
information. Progress reports
also act as a method of
persuasion: to demonstrate to clients and the administration
progress is being made, the project is on time with deadlines (Last).

   Progress reports can occur in several ways, they can be live and
in person, they could be live and virtual, or it could be a prepared
document or set of slides to share with everyone to review on their
own time. It is helpful to know how you will be assessed, in order to
create content and prepare accordingly. In this week of the course,
you will debate the values of one form of presentation over another,
complete lesson 5 of the certificate and complete a logic model
diagram to meet the goals of the progress report.

Format of a Report

                                                     A progress report should
                                                  include specific elements
                                                  including what has been
                                                  accomplished, what is being
                                                  worked on currently, and what
                                                  it is anticipated in the future.

                                               Focus on specific time frames,
                                                  such as "In the last three
                                                  months, we met these goals...",
                                                  "In the next six months, we aim

      to meet these goals...".
   Focus on defined milestones, such as ordering, purchasing,

      distribution, tech training, etc.
   It may also be beneficial on larger goals of what has been

      accomplished.
   Consider including the following section: introductions which

      covered the purpose and scope of the project; a summary of
      your project and its related history, research gathered, and
      overall appraisal of the project (Hamlin et al.)

Different Types

A progress report can very in length depending on the size and
importance of the project. While you are going to be completing
a progress report according to Lesson 5, it can be helpful to be
familiar with other forms of progress reports (Last).

   Memo: A short report, somewhat formal, which will be roughly
      one to four pages.

   Letter: A short, again somewhat formal report, which is shared

                                                                                      Chapter 4 | 21
      with those outside of your organization.
   Formal Report: A longer, more formalized report, which maybe

      be sent within your organization, but also beyond your
      organization.
   Presentation: A formal presentation given to your targeted
      audience.

        technologytoolsforleaders/?p=25#h5p-6

Logic Model

In addition to a prepared presentation, a logic model will be created
to provide a valuable visual to stakeholders regarding the project. A
logic model is a visual representation of a project, much like a flow
chart, map, or a table (Department of Health and Human Services).
Logic models function as a story about your program, documenting
how the changes will impact the intended audience. The model is an
engaging tool to connect the stakeholders with the most important
parts of the project; you are establishing the impact.

   There are some required components for a solid logic model.

Chapter Five: Communication

                                                  Change can be tricky in an
                                                  organization. "Messaging" is
                                                  critical both for both internal
                                                  and external communications,
                                                  be it a Fortune 500 company or
                                                  small 501c3. It impacts
                                                  everything from employee buy
                                                  in and retention to fund
                                                  development and outreach.
                                                  Getting ahead of potential
                                                  misunderstandings is a useful
way to save time, money, and aggravation.
   Consider the following:

   Snarky comments:
        You look good for someone your age.
        You would have made more sales if you sounded like you
            knew what you were talking about.

   Positive comments:
        I love your unique outfits!
        Let's practice some techniques for increasing sales this
            quarter.

Which example is more motivating and creates a better sense of
belonging?

   When leaders implement change it impacts the whole staff.
Messaging is important. Having staff on board and informed of what
changes are coming improves efficiency.

Positive Messages

Business related messages

are sent everyday, sharing

information,  requesting

information or actions,

expressing gratitude and so on.

Most of the time these are

positive or neutral messages

even when they involve small

complaints or claims where you

request that an error be

corrected. These are all direct  "Gotta love happy day messages from
approach messages, in which      fellow artists left on random canvases"
the main idea comes right        by kstrandlund is licensed under CC
upfront and details follow.      BY-NC 2.0.

Occasionally, you must

communicate bad news in writing, which requires a more careful,

indirect approach. All of these situations involve conventions that

business professionals follow to minimize miscommunication and

its fallout, and thus keep their operation running smoothly.

Please note when action is expected to come of a request, the

opening question may not require a question mark. Never forget,

however, the importance of saying "please" when asking someone

to do something. Notice also that the list in the message body

helps break up dense detail, so the request message is more reader

friendly. All of the effort that the writer of the above message made

to deliver a reader-centered message will pay off when the

recipient performs the requested procedure exactly according to

these clearly worded expectations.

If you expect resistance to your request, an indirect approach

is more effective. Ideally, you'll make such persuasive pitches in

person or on the phone so that you can use a full range of verbal and

non-verbal cues. When it's important to present your argument in

                                    Chapter 5 | 25
writing, however, such requests should be clear and easy to spot but
buffered by goodwill statements and reasonable justifications.

   When responding to information or action requests, simply
deliver the needed information or confirm that the action has been
or will be completed unless you have good reasons for refusing.
Ensure the accuracy of all details and utilize the "you-attitude."
Note that sometimes manager approval may be necessary before
providing the information. Organizationally, a positive response to
an information request delivers the main answer in the opening,
proceeds to give more detail in the body if necessary, and ends
politely with appreciation and goodwill statements.

Expressing gratitude

"Congratulations!" by The U.S. Army is licensed under CC BY
2.0.Such messages should be short and simple as well as quick and
easy to write. For that reason, not sending them when someone
does something nice for you appears ungrateful, rude, and
inconsiderate. In fact, sending a thank-you note within 24 hours of
interviewing for a job, for example, is not just extra thoughtful but
close to being an expected formality. In most situations, email or
text is an appropriate medium for sending thank-you messages.

26 | Chapter 5
Expressing congratulations

   Celebrating the successes of
your professional peers shows
class and tact. Such messages
create positive energy in the
workplace and should be all
about he person you are
congratulating.

Expressing sympathy

Few situations require such sincerity and care with words as
expressions of sympathy. Misfortune comes upon us all, and tough
times are just a little more tolerable with the support of our friends,
family, and community-including those we work with. When the
loved-one of a close associate dies, for instance, expressing
sympathy for their loss is customary, often with a card, rather than
an email or text, signed by everyone in the workplace who knows
the bereaved. You can't appreciate email messages the same way
you can a collection of cards from people showing they care.

   Remember that these messages should be selfless. Offering your
condolences in the most respectful, sensitive manner possible is the
right thing to do.

Negative Messages

Business doesn't always go smoothly and bad customer experience
can have long-lasting consequences. Customers can be
disappointed with a faulty product or poor service; shipments might
get damaged, lost, or arrive late; or one business might infringe on

                                                                                      Chapter 5 | 27
the rights and freedoms of another. In all such cases, customers
or clients are likely to make your company aware of what went
wrong and what they want o be done about it. Indeed, it's their
consumer right to do so and the business or organization receiving
such a message should take it as valuable intelligence on customer
expectations that must be met for the business to be viable.

   A claim explains what went wrong and demands compensation
from the offending party while a complaint explains what went
wrong and merely demands correction or apology. Minor
complaints are best communicated in person, on the phone, or by
email (if it's important to have them in writing) so they can be dealt
with quickly. More serious complaints or claims are delivered as
formal letters to lay down a paper trail in case they need to be used
as evidence in a lawsuit.

   When customers are reasonable about communicating a problem
with a situation or business transaction, the customer service
representative or manager dealing with the matter is more likely
to respond positively and meet the needs of the client. However,
ineffective complaints or claims often merely vent frustrations,
issue threats, don'ts say what they want or only vaguely imply it,
or demand completely unreasonable compensation. Assume that a
business will take your complaint or claim seriously if it's done right
because, no matter the industry, companies are rightfully afraid
of losing business to negative online reviews. In this day of social
media, good customer service is crucial to business survivability.
A complaint provides a business with both valuable information
about customer expectations and an opportunity to win back a
customer-as well as their social network if a good endorsement
comes of it from the now-satisfied customer-or else risk losing
much more than just the one customer.

28 | Chapter 5
                                      Effective complaints or

                                      claims are politely worded and

                                      motivated by a desire to right

                                      wrongs and save the business

                                      they remind the business that

                                      you have been a loyal customer

Complaints and claims take the direct approach of message

organization even though they arise from dissatisfaction. They

follow the usual three-part message organization.

Message delivery

Most introductory college communications courses require
students to create a memo. Why is a form of communication that
is so seemingly out-of-date still taught? Simply because email is
essentially a memo. Understanding the purpose and procedure for

                                                                                     Chapter 5 | 29
a traditional business memo is an excellent way to know how to
create a polished and professional email.

   In fact, the main difference between emails and memos is that
non-email memos exist on paper and there is one major format
difference; the signature.

   Paper memos never have a closing and signature. Historically,
memos were typed up by stenographers and taken back to a boss
for approval the writer would indicate that they really wrote the
memo by initialing by his or her name in the paper heading using
blue or black ink. This is where the "cc" and "bcc" line came from
in an email. Those abbreviations should still be used both in memo
writing and when writing business letters. It is also important to
note the inclusion of any attachments at the bottom of each letter
or memo.

Images and visual media such as websites

Communication is increasingly visual. Making your message easy
to read and understand is almost as important as what you say.
Some useful tips for communication design outside of memos and
business letters:

30 | Chapter 5
   Never center text.
   Choose simple fonts over more complicated ones.
   Eleven and twelve point fonts are typically the easiest to read

      in a paragraph.
   If you are using multiple font sizes, make the difference at least

      two to four font sizes larger or smaller.
   Use italics for titles and foreign languages only.
   Use bold and underlining sparingly.
   Stick to two fonts on a page. If one is a "serif" type, chose a

      "sans serif" for your other font.
   Don't use all caps. Screen readers can't read it and it just looks

      like shouting in printed material.

Here is a short, but very useful, .pdf that showing how much impact
good design has in something as mundane as a contract:
http://www.flussobjekte.at/hpall/award/2630/nzknvgh8cz.pdf

   Social media and blogs are as important as any formal
communication. Not only to are they a way to increase your
business presence, they are a great way to quickly undermine your
project and lose credibility with your staff and clients. Never put
anything "out there", even privately, that you wouldn't say in a
meeting at work.

   A useful resource for anyone who finds themselves needed more
instruction on good design should find an inexpensive copy of Robin
Williams' The Non-designer's Design Book. Many libraries have it
available: https://www.worldcat.org/title/1036760501

Copyright awareness

Although of minimal concern when writing a memo, copyright and
plagiarism can creep into day-to-day writing thanks to the
increasing use of AI. AI is a useful tool to help managers organize
thoughts, set up basic communications, and help with refining
language. AI isn't plagiarism, but use it carefully for material you
represent as something created by you. It is also possible to
repurpose training information from different sources. Below are
two excellent websites that can help you to stay legal:

   https://creativecommons.org/ and www.copyright.gov
   AI
   Lying with Statistics
   So, "lying" is probably too strong of a word choice, but both
when creating your communication and when reading information
created by others, watch carefully for the perspective and context
of the information.
   When you are shopping for product, it is nice to see a visual
showing the product that you would like to purchase is superior to
another. Make sure that you understand the context of any statistic
you either share or read yourself.

Chapter 6: Failing Successfully

Overview

Learning how to fail successfully is almost an art form. Especially
with technology involved, failure is a very real possibility. Address
your concerns early and develop solutions for overcoming them.
It is very likely something will not proceed according to plan.
Remember, this is not a reflection on you: it happens! Thankfully,
design thinking addresses some of these concerns, releasing us
from the traditional, rigid mindset which says failure is not an
option. Before jumping into resilience models and strategies for
managing and overcoming failure, let's discuss some myths and
inspirational role models for failure.

Myths and Inspiration

Resilience Models

Resilience is what occurs after challenges, adversity, or failures.
Resilience occurs when there is a positive mindset, social supports,
34 | Chapter 6
and effective coping mechanisms. Resilience models (also called
growth mindsets) are a good way to identify strategies to mitigate
risk factors, through the use of protective factors. It will improve
outcomes as well as worker well-being. Review the image below to
learn more about the Resilient Workplace Model (Van Breda, 2011).

Workplace Resilience Model (Van Breda, 2011)

   In Bill Wooditch's book: Fail More: Embrace, Learn, and Adapt to
Failure as a Way to Success (2019), he shares some quick strategies
for managing your obstacles and therefore overcoming the fear of
failure, real or imagined:

   Change your mindset. Accept the changes, failure, and
      obstacles, willingly. "Intelligent risks" (Wooditch, 2019)
                                                                                     Chapter 6 | 35
      promotes skill-building and pushes us beyond our limits.
      Anything worth creating will likely have some challenges to
      face. It's part of the game.
   Zoom out for the bigger picture. It is easy to become very
      invested in a project and too focused on the finer details.
      Taking the time to detach the emotion from the project and
      tasks can provide a new perspective and highlight areas for
      improvement, change, or even new directions.
   Avoiding failure or obstacles does not change its existence. It
      is unavoidable. There will be problems, elements which will try
      to prevent you from succeed. Dealing with them at the start
      and preparing for those obstacles will promote success. Social
      supports, resources, and other strategies are effective ways to
      manage your obstacles.

Other noteworthy elements to consider (Wooditch, 2019):

   Praise effort, not talent.
   Commit to continuous improvement.
   Interpret challenges as opportunities instead of threats.
   Again: failure is not a reflection on you.

Continuous improvement and procurement process are well-
established ideas. For technology, these processes are especially
applicable. The Return on Investment (ROI) has as much to do with
how things are implemented as they do with what was purchased.

   Some minimal considerations:

   Making the most of what you have in place:
        make sure to maximize current personnel knowledge; will
            additional training or new staff be necessary or helpful?
        consider maintenance costs. Remember to include
            invisible costs such as web hosting and staff time to
            implement updates.

   Who on staff is in charge of software updates and hardware
      maintenance? Are they the only ones who have this
      knowledge? Is this regularly scheduled?

   Is the existing/new technology being used to its full extent? If
      not, why? Does it duplicate other software or hardware that
      can be replaced?

   What are the best practices to implement now that will
      eliminate issues later. For example, is data collected into a
      format that will be easy to export later?

End-user and personnel feedback is helpful for making decisions
around additional purchases, to increase productivity, and get the

                                                                                      Chapter 7 | 37
most out of the technology. Additionally it can help alleviate staff
concerns. This is also critical with public-facing technology.
Customers and clients will simply move on if an interface is difficult
or non-functioning. Creating a log or form though a platform like
Google Forms or Microsoft Forms to report issues is a quick and
easy way to quickly collect user suggestions, needs, and to head off
potential problems.

   Obsolesce. What comes next was likely considered when the
initial purchase was made. Will it be an update or upgrade? How
can you prolong the life of the technology you have? Both software
and hardware companies are increasingly sunsetting products by
ceasing to offer updates. Staying current on discontinuation plans
may help leaders to plan for a carefully-timed "last update" to give a
little more time to determine what comes next.

   Appropriate data gathering and cybersecurity are important
aspects of continuing improvement. After all, it is not possible to
conduct business if a criminal is holding your data hostage.

   Cybersecurity
   Although sometimes it seems like it, updates aren't all about
increasing vendor profits by creating planned obsolescence.
Cybersecurity is a constant threat to businesses.
   According to the National Cybersecurity Alliance, many small to
medium-sized businesses (SMBs) have the misconception that their
data is not valuable and that, in turn, they are unlikely to be the
target of a cyberattack. However, 28% of cyberattacks involve small
business victims. Schools, heath care organizations, and non-profits
are increasingly targeted, as well. All data is valuable. The most
common types of cyberattacks include:

             Phishing: Phishing is when cybercriminals send an email
          or text that appears to be from a legitimate organization or
          known individual. These emails often entice users to click on
          a link or open an attachment containing malicious code.

             Viruses: Viruses, a type of malware, are harmful programs
          that spread from computer to computer, giving cyber
          criminals access to systems.

38 | Chapter 7
             Ransomware: Ransomware is a type of malware that
          restricts access to a computer or server until a ransom is
          paid.
   It is worthwhile for managers to assess the threat to their
organization. An IT professional is helpful for this, but the
government also has tools for cybersecurity risk assessment:

   Federal Communications Commission (FCC) Planning Tool: The
      FCC offers a cybersecurity planning tool to help you build a
      strategy based on your unique business needs.

   Cyber Resilience Review: The Department of Homeland
      Security's (DHS) Cyber Resilience Review is a non-technical
      assessment to evaluate operational resilience and
      cybersecurity practices.

   Cyber Hygiene Vulnerability Scanning: DHS also offers free
      cyber hygiene vulnerability scanning for small businesses.

   Cyber Essentials: Cybersecurity & Infrastructure Security
      Agency's (CISA) Cyber Essentials is a guide for leaders of small
      businesses as well as leaders of small and local government
      agencies to develop an actionable understanding of where to
      start implementing organizational cybersecurity practices.

While a risk assessment can help develop tailored cybersecurity
plans, there are also general best practices that all businesses can
adopt to reduce vulnerability to a cyberattack. These include:

   Beefing up existing cybersecurity protections: simple acts like
      changing passwords with stronger ones made up of random
      letters, numbers, and special characters can help prevent
      cybercriminals from gaining access to data

   Using multifactor authentication for accounts and services
   Updating anti-virus software and securing Wi-Fi networks
   Training employees
   Protecting sensitive data and backing up the rest: While

      firewalls and other tech protections are important to warding

Technology Privacy Concerns

warehouses. Also, companies also sell the information they collect

from sources like warranty registration cards, credit-card records,

registration at websites, personal data forms required to purchase

online, and grocery store discount memberships. Telemarketers

combine data from different sources to create fairly detailed profiles

of consumers.

The September 11, 2001, tragedy and other massive security

breaches have raised additional privacy concerns. As a result, the

government began looking for ways to improve domestic-

intelligence collection and analyze terrorist threats within the

United States. Sophisticated database applications that look for

hidden patterns in a group of data, a process called data mining,

increase the potential for tracking and predicting people's daily

activities. Legislators and privacy activists worry that such

programs as this and ones that eavesdrop electronically could lead

to excessive government surveillance that encroaches on personal

privacy. The stakes are much higher as well: errors in data mining by

companies in business may only result in a consumer being targeted

with inappropriate advertising, whereas a governmental mistake

could do untold damage to an unjustly targeted person.

Consumers and privacy advocates are working to block sales of

example, they want to prevent state governments from selling
driver's license information and supermarkets from collecting and
selling information gathered when shoppers use barcoded plastic
discount cards.

is to find a balance between

consumers to check to prevent
the company from selling their names. Many companies now state
in their privacy policies that they will not abuse the information they
collect. Regulators are taking action against companies that fail to
respect consumer privacy.

ethical best practices around privacy.
