Foreword by Dr. Emily Berger

It is with great pleasure that I write this foreword for the book: Trauma-Informed Education: Interdisciplinary
Insights. The book is a collection of interviews by Dr. Govind Krishnamoorthy and Dr. Kay Ayre with childhood
trauma and trauma-informed practice experts. As an emerging field of practice and research, the book is
timely in bringing together interdisciplinary views and the expertise of experienced practitioners. I have been
very fortunate to work with numerous dedicated and highly knowledgeable researchers, practitioners, and
teachers. Dr. Krishnamoorthy and Dr. Ayre are among those I consider leaders in trauma-informed practice.
Through their work on trauma-informed behaviour supports, Dr. Krishnamoorthy and Dr. Ayre have pioneered
the way we think about trauma-informed practice in schools, both in Australia and internationally. This book is
another example of their influence and significant contribution to trauma and trauma-informed practice.

   Edited by Ms. Dayna Schimke, an experienced psychologist in the area of child maltreatment, this book
includes international experts, together with contemporary research and resources. The conversational and
accessible language in the chapters provides an engaging introduction to how we support children exposed
to trauma. Within these conversations, you will find insights guiding the future of research and practice in
trauma-informed education. While the book is primarily designed for educators, the information provided
is invaluable for researchers, health practitioners and policymakers. As evident in the interdisciplinary
discussions in the book, inclusive education for students exposed to trauma is the responsibility of everyone.
We all have a part to play in working together to provide the highest level of care for children, youth, and
families exposed to trauma.

   The narratives in the book acknowledge the complexities and challenges of today's classroom, while
illustrating practice and research-informed ways for educators to practice trauma-informed care. Significant
highlights from the book include chapters on the background of trauma-informed practice, how trauma affects
children's development and school functioning, and, notably, how teachers can support students exposed to
trauma. The book provides many practical strategies for teachers to support the needs of students in their
classrooms. The interviews provide examples from teachers' everyday interactions with students and how they
can apply trauma-informed approaches to improve student outcomes. In addition, the interviews challenge
the reader to think of trauma-informed practice as more than just brain breaks and sensory tools. The whole-
of-school perspectives of this book are essential to ensure the ongoing success and sustainability of trauma-
informed care in schools. These ideas in this book elevate the discourse about trauma-informed education
by challenging the current assumption and paradigms of the role of schools in the growth and wellbeing of
children.

   Finally, I commend the authors for making this an open educational resource - freely accessible to anyone
wanting to learn about trauma-informed practices. Trauma-informed education is, at its heart, about
educational equity. Its mission is to mitigate social, psychological, economic, and political forces that maintain
the educational disparities between children, families, and educators. The design and dissemination of this
book as a free resource reflects these values.

   Thank you to the book's editors and experts for sharing their wisdom and insights. I hope the stories,
theories, and research spark your curiosity. There is much work to be done to improve the education and
wellbeing of children. I hope this book inspires you to join us in this mission.

Introduction

If you are reading this book, you are likely motivated to make a difference in the lives of children. If you
have been a disciple of trauma-informed practices, you would know that loss, grief, emotional pain, and fear
in childhood affect one's life. Equally, acts of compassion and support linger in our memories, providing us
hope in the darkest times. While it may seem simple and obvious to support a struggling student, the realities
of such tasks highlight the challenging and complex nature of such acts. Schools respond to the complex
needs of students exposed to traumatic and adverse experiences as part of an interconnected system of
care. These systems of care include health care, child welfare, juvenile justice, housing, and a variety of other
community services. Legislation around the world increasingly mandates interorganisational collaboration and
attention has turned to considering how educators and professionals of other disciplines and services interact.
As demands on educators to meet the diverse needs of students continue to grow, the challenge of providing
an inclusive educational environment places a significant burden on educators. Educators are required to be
informed about various learning and mental health concerns facing children in the school environment.

   Such requirements necessitate interdisciplinary collaborations - both within a school and with those in other
services and sectors. Attitudinal and systemic barriers have long kept educational institutions siloed from
other child services, with recent policy and legislative changes enabling such interdisciplinary partnerships to
occur more readily. The conversations in this book demonstrate the complex interplay between the impact
of trauma on our brains and nervous systems (biology) and our thoughts and behaviours (psychology). We
are learning that trauma impacts how we interact in relationships, organisational systems, and communities
(sociology), how we make meaning of the world, and how we understand our purpose (philosophy). The
willingness to be curious and continually learn is essential to inclusive education. Respecting and accepting
another's perspective and the consistent and critical exchange of ideas is a hallmark of productive
interdisciplinary collaboration.

   The prioritisation of 'coming together `requires practitioners to actively seek opportunities to meet and
collaborate with those from other disciplines. The emergence of digital technologies - through video
communication software and podcasts - has enabled us to leverage the wisdom and resources of a range
of practitioners worldwide in disseminating and co-creating interdisciplinary resources. Such efforts of
interdisciplinary joint work with interactions between diverse community members represents increasingly
sophisticated levels of interdisciplinary boundary crossing.

   We hope reading this book offers you a space for reflection and learning. Ultimately, however, the book is
a call to action. It is an invitation to examine the state of your schools and decide what kind of education you
want for the children in your community. It is a call to re-examine what we have long assumed to be true about
how education is structured and delivered. Advocacy and innovation in education mirror the efforts of the
traumatised child - as educators attempt new practices and risk a state of vulnerability and uncertainty in the
hope of new learning and growth. The conversations in the book highlight how thinking and acting to support
the complex needs of students can instigate social change, one interaction at a time.

Helping Traumatised Children Learn with Dr. Dave
Ziegler

   Dr. Dave Ziegler

                                               Dr. Dave Ziegler is a psychologist and founder and
                                            director of Jasper Mountain, a world-renowned healing
                                            facility for children aged three to 12. Located on more than
                                            90 acres of beautiful forest, Jasper Mountain hosts a
                                            residential treatment facility, an integrated school, an
                                            assessment and crisis centre, and a foster care
                                            programme. Jasper Mountain has consistently achieved
                                            remarkable outcomes for some of the USA's most severely
                                            traumatised children for over 30 years. Dr. Ziegler is the
   author of several books, including Raising children who refuse to be raised, Achieving success with impossible
   children, Traumatic experience in the brain, and Beyond healing: A neurological reparative therapy.

Dr. Ziegler: I began my career as a family therapist in Arizona, down in the desert, a long way from the forest
in Oregon. While family therapy brought much value to many families, there was a group of children we
couldn't reach. They had serious issues that went beyond what we could do in a outpatient, community clinic.
Meeting once or even twice a week was not enough. Some colleagues and I decided to set up a centre that
would be a place of healing and learning for these children. To see if there was a way that we could get to the
most severe kids and help them. We didn't want these kids to become society's casualties through criminal
justice or drug and alcohol issues. So in the last thirty-five years, I have worked with the most severe kids at
our centre in Jasper Mountain.

CHALLENGES FOR TRAUMATISED CHILDREN AT SCHOOL

Dr. Ayre: In your paper, `Optimum learning environments for traumatized children', you write about some

children process information. It changes the ability of

children to be vulnerable, an essential aspect of learning. It teaches children that they can't trust some adults,

or maybe they can't trust any adults. There is a close connection between learning disabilities and complex

trauma as they often come together, impacting learning.

Trauma activates the fight or flight response. When symbols or recollections of trauma come up in the

academic setting or classroom, children will either fight or act out, or they will flee, which is sometimes to go

into their own space. Many teachers consider these children to be daydreamers or, what we call in psychology,

dissociators. It's simply the way that the brain is handling reminders that come up in the classroom or triggers

that are related to their trauma.

Our schools are not designed to help children with significant trauma learn because you have to approach

how you teach them differently. If we do not reach these children through education, they continue with

their learning disability, and they perceive education as not particularly useful. Their brains are designed for

survival, and they are focused on survival. Learning about language, arts, history, and math - it is a stretch to

have a traumatised child feel like that information is important to them. They're concerned about how they

can be safe tonight from their alcoholic parent. How can I keep Uncle Charlie from coming into my room and

sexually abusing me this weekend? Those are the critical things to traumatised kids.

The traumatised brain does not want to be vulnerable. It does not want to be hurt again, yet you cannot

learn without vulnerability. You cannot learn without making mistakes, which is a difficult challenge for kids

with trauma.

                 Optimum Learning Environments for Traumatised Children

      In Dr. Ziegler's article, he writes about how trauma and learning in school do not mix well
   together. This is not to say that trauma does not result in significant learning for the child. The
   child learns not to trust, learns to be anxious around adults, and learns to be vigilant of the
   motivations of others. What a child learns from trauma negatively impacts learning in an
   academic setting. If the goal is for a child to come into an academic setting ready to learn,
   ready to emotionally experience the enjoyment and excitement of discovery, then the effects
   of traumatic experience will hinder learning in a variety of ways.

TRAUMA INFORMED EDUCATION

Dr. Ayre: What is your education model at Jasper Mountain, and how has it been designed to be trauma-
informed?

   Dr. Ziegler: You have to teach these kids differently. If you want to reach them, these are some of the factors
we have found to be very helpful at Jasper Mountain.

   First of all, the educational process is very active rather than passive. Many times in classroom settings, the
children are given a desk, they sit at their desks, they're told to be silent, to raise their hand, and they're told
to do their work. We do the opposite. We have a very active process where the children are physically up and
about and active in the classroom. They go to learning centres throughout the room. Every half an hour or so,
5                                                                                              DAYNA SCHIMKE

we stop the process, and we might put on some music, do some dancing, get very active and then stop and go

back to the learning process. It's a dynamic thing that most children are very used to doing.

   We try to remove negative stress in the classroom. Too often in our schools, we have a competitive setup

where we might say, "let's see who can do the best job on this maths test or spelling test". This produces stress

for all children, but sometimes for some children, it's positive stress, which can be a significant motivator for

learning. Negative stress isn't a motivator for learning, so we try to eliminate any negative stress. Negative

stress will produce a fight or flight response for kids that have trauma.

                                                        We want an expressive environment where we want

   We want an expressive environment        kids to express their opinions. We want them to draw
   where we want kids to express their      things, to write, and to sing. The environment has to be
   opinions.                                fun. In my learning many years ago, the goal was not to
                                            make learning a fun process. I believe that not only do

                                            children learn more when they're having fun, I think

adults learn more when they're having fun.

   We also need to be very careful about the adult-mediated activity. It doesn't take very long for a child to take

a risk and try to give an answer or try to do something they're not very good at, and if they're made fun of, that

immediately stops. We need adults to be right there, onsite, and help this to be a positive process. We don't

want children taking advantage of other children and making them feel bad.

   The situation must be predictable, so we have our schedules on the board, and the kids know what's coming

next. We try to give them a five-minute warning when there's a transition. Kids with trauma do a lot better

when they can predict that here comes a change to maths, or we're going to go to lunch next, or we're going

to go out for recess.

                        Kids also need to have more successes than failures. Too often, when you don't know

                        something, you will make lots of mistakes learning. We have to build in elements that

                        kids will be successful in some ways because none of us will continue to do something

                        we continue to fail at. The classroom also needs to be based on relationships. It has to

                        be between the individual and the teachers. What we do in our classrooms is we have

                        no more than ten children. They're all traumatised kids, but ten children in a classroom

                        with three teachers. One of the teachers is a certified special education teacher with a

                        master's degree. The other two teachers are teachers' aides, or what we call their direct

                        care staff. There are also staff who are part of treatment teams trained in mental health.

                        We have both mental health and

                        academics in the classroom      We have both mental health and

                           Now, in regards to
                        competition. Competition can

                        You have to change that competitive process so all children have a chance of winning, or

we have found they will simply not compete. We put much more emphasis on cooperation rather than

competition. We want children to learn together, and we want them to teach each other. We want some of the

children who are a little bit older, who may be more skilled, to help some of the younger children. One of the

best ways to learn something is to teach someone else. These are some of the different approaches to

education or learning that we use to really change the environment in the classroom so that it's conducive for

traumatised children to learn.

Dr. Ayre: How do you manage teaching different age groups? Are children grouped according to traditional
grade levels?

   Dr. Ziegler: Years ago, when we started our school in 1989, I wanted to return to the one-room schoolhouse
where everybody learned together. We managed to do that for several years, but when our numbers started
getting up to 80 children, we couldn't teach that number of children in one room anymore. The modern school
is like the way Henry Ford built motor cars. We're assembly lines. We think in first grade, we're going to teach
them this. In second grade, we're going to put the tyres on. In third grade, we'll put the muffler on, and in fourth
grade, we'll have the engine. It makes much more sense to have older children learn with younger children.
Younger children then see the modelling from the older children, and we don't have these `age ghettos', where
all children are the same, working through the years of schooling. What we do, is we combine children by
abilities rather than age. So, you could have a much younger child with an older child if their ability in reading
or maths or language arts were similar. We combine the children by ability groups rather than simply ages.

UNSCHOOLING THE EDUCATIONAL ENVIRONMENT

Dr. Ayre: You write about the need to `unschool' educational environments to avoid triggering memories of

school failure. What do you mean by this?

Dr. Ziegler: When I say we need to unschool educational environments, we need something vastly different

                                           than a traditional school for traumatised children.

When I say we need to unschool             Children who have experienced trauma perceive

children.                                  worse. That doesn't have anything to do with what
                                           good teachers are doing in the classroom.

                                           We need to give these kids a new perception of what

happens in school. That school is a resource where you will learn what you need to succeed in life, and a

teacher is somebody who is a resource person to meet your goals. When I talk about the unschool, I'm saying
7  DAYNA SCHIMKE

that school needs to look different, it needs to feel different, and it needs to be different. The education
process needs to fit the child rather than the child fitting into the educational process.

   All children learn a little bit differently. We need to spend the time to find out how individual children learn
and then build a fun, exciting, active process around them so that they can be successful. Our ultimate goal
is to instil a genuine love of lifelong learning, and we don't just want children to get up to their grade level or
succeed in their testing. We want them to be excited about learning. There is nothing that should be easier
than getting a child to get excited about learning. Yet, somehow in our educational process, we have turned
off a lot of children. Learning is not as much fun, and it's not exciting anymore.

   Dr. Ayre: I would suggest many teachers would feel the same way.
   Dr. Ziegler: Yes. If we do not have excited, happy teachers, we don't have excited, happy students.

CHALLENGES FOR EDUCATORS

Dr. Ayre: What challenges do the educators face at Jasper Mountain when working with students in a trauma-
informed way?

   Dr. Ziegler: We set our vision and goals pretty high. We have 80 children in our school, and every day they
come in from about twenty-four different school districts from around the United States. They almost always
are the most challenging child in their school district. If you have a school district of fifteen thousand children
and you have the most challenging child, try to imagine that same child with 79 peers who are the most
challenging child in their school. So right off the bat, there are some real challenges which is why we have a
high adult-to-child ratio. This helps the teachers to be able to not only handle the behaviour but also to give
individualised attention to children, that's important.

   I've mentioned children all learn differently. Even if you have ten kids in your classroom, it's pretty
challenging to figure out how these ten kids are going to best learn. To figure that out in a way that fits into
a structure, within the day, and where we want to go as a group is tricky for teachers. You want an active
educational process and an active environment, but you don't want chaos. There's a balance between children
being up and moving around and doing things and dancing, listening to music and then stopping and doing
some math facts, etcetera. Chaos will work against the traumatised brain and make it even more difficult to
engage and learn.

   Our teachers struggle with the fact that education is secondary to the children's healing at Jasper Mountain.
Teachers are not used to hearing that. They're used to believing the most important thing in their classroom is
the educational activity. With our children, they have to understand that sometimes it takes them six months,
sometimes the whole school year, to prepare these children to learn and grow. We must start with where they
are, which is often needing to heal the wounds that have been produced by trauma in other settings, including
in other school settings. Almost all of our children have failed universally. They've failed in school, at home,
and then in our environment, they succeed, sometimes for the first time.
HELPING TRAUMATISED CHILDREN LEARN WITH DR. DAVE ZIEGLER                              8

                                                      The other challenge is to transition them back into public

                                                      school settings where they may encounter the same factors

                                                      that produced the failure, to begin with. How we transition

                                                      them back from this very conducive environment into a

                                                      much less responsive, fun, and exciting environment is all

                                                      important. Fortunately, if done right, we can make that

                                                      transition and have them get up to speed, return to a public

                                                      school, and succeed, but only once they're healed in our

                                                      environment.

"Image" by Gerd Altmann is in the Public Domain, CC0     Dr. Ayre: So, the experiences and skills they take with
                                                      them holds them in good stead when they're back in those

                                                      very different environments?

Dr. Ziegler: Yes, it does, although one of the most important things that has to happen is that we need to

change the child's perceptions about school. They're used to walking into school and believing that the teacher

wants them to fail. Why else would they circle all their mistakes in red? Why would they give them bad grades

if they didn't want the child to fail? Children misperceive, so we need to have them develop a new perception

of school as something fun and interesting. As a place where you can learn about things you can use, and you

have guides and resources called teachers that want to help you learn the things that you want to learn. With

children transitioning back to regular school, we have found that if we've been able to alter those perceptions,

the children make even more academic progress after leaving us than when they were with us. That tells

me that the children plug back in with their peers in public education. They're excited about catching up and

learning; having had some success, they're ready to have more success.

Dr. Ayre: Is there a time limit for the children who come to your programmes to transition back to public

education?

Dr. Ziegler: We have six different programmes. I'll talk about the most intensive programme, which is our

long-term residential programme. Children stay in that programme for an average of 14 months. We have

found that with younger children, we can often get to a place of healing and growth quicker than with some of

the older children. We don't have children in our setting longer than needed.

We use a variety of scales and standardised tests to assist with knowing when they're ready to transition

out. When children can cope and engage themselves in families, in public school, and the community, that's

when we know they're ready to transition. We want them to be able to do all those things successfully before

they leave us. While they can't do that, we're working in our very intensive structured programme. We have

the advantage that when children are in our residential programme, they go to our onsite school. We can also

have children move on from the residential programme and continue in our onsite school, so we don't try

to have all the transitions happen simultaneously. We have about half and half in our onsite school. Half the

children attend from our residential programme and about half attend as a day student only. The length of

time children are in our school varies. However, we generally like to have an entire school year to work on the

misperceptions of school, build some successes, get the children excited about learning, and see that school

can be a lot of fun.

Dr. Ayre: How do you bridge that gap for a traumatised child to return to Public Education successfully where

the learning process looks and feels very different than it does at Jasper Mountain?

Dr. Ziegler: We build a relationship with the school and the teacher to whom the child will transition. We will

meet with the school and the teacher and say we have a unique challenge for you. Teachers don't necessarily

like a problem, but they do like a challenge. Teachers are receptive when I tell them, "I will help you succeed,

you can rely on my team, and if you have a problem, you can call us, and we will assist you". Teachers can

also see how this child has progressed in our setting and how things can improve. There's nothing quite like

a teacher that takes on a challenging child and succeeds. We begin by transitioning the child back into the

classroom one period and one hour at a time so that they have a foot in both worlds. Jasper Mountain teachers

will go to the child's public school classroom, and we will continue to provide psychological help. We continue

to be a backup during a crisis and build a team with the public school and the teacher. If we can do that and
9                                DAYNA SCHIMKE

connect to them, the teachers generally say, "yes, we will do our best". If we all work together, we can begin to
help both the child and the teacher see some successes.

   Transition Toolkit

                                    We know routines and planning are key to always supporting
                                 students. This is especially true at times of change and transition.
                                 Here we provide a range of suggestions and ideas. Some will be
                                 specifically relevant to a primary or high school transition; others
                                 will be universal and relevant to any transition point for any
                                 students. Some ideas will be dependent on your child and their
                                 learning and development.

                                       Dr. Ayre: When you see that success, that's the reason you do what you do. You
only need to see one little glimmer of a step through the doorway today with a smile and it makes it all
worthwhile.

   Dr. Ziegler: That's why we're all in this business of helping children. To see learning happening in front of us
and a future that can make a difference to children.

   Recently, I had a visit from a young man that I hadn't seen in 18 years. Unannounced. He came to my office
and said, "I just want to thank you". He was one of the most traumatised children I have ever worked with.
He said everything changed when he was here, and when he thinks of his childhood, he thinks of me and this
place. He said, "You are my family, and I want you to know that I am a successful and happy adult". That's
why we're in this business! The importance of having fun, having success and being able to expect and predict
what's coming next are elements vital to teaching traumatised children.

   Something not yet mentioned is the importance of disconfirmation. What I mean by disconfirmation is
that we need to disconfirm not only the perceptions of the child about school, but their perceptions about
themselves. We need to disconfirm their belief that they are not a good learner, are not successful, and are not
a likeable child. Unfortunately, when we don't disconfirm, many adults will do important things like hold kids
accountable and have consequences for their behaviour. Through this, we confirm the child's negative view of
themselves. We will then never turn that child into a good learner. So the process of disconfirming is crucially
important.

   We also don't see enough integration between academic
and psychological support. Everywhere I go, I plead with
people, have your educational people and have your
psychologist, and your mental health people work together
for children. What we do in our setting is, in real-time,
integrate our treatment and our academics in one place.
We bring it to the child rather than send them to a clinic and
a school and give them unintegrated bits and pieces. The
adults need to be working together to help these very
traumatised children.

   At Jasper Mountain, we focus not only on our treatment
but also on the whole child. We want to touch their mind,
their body and their spirit. We do a lot of physical things, "Image" by Tim Mossholder is in the Public Domain, CC0
and we do a lot of things in terms of their minds and their

healing, their trauma and their psychological treatment. We also address their spirit. We want children to feel

a connection, the universal sense that we belong to something greater than ourselves. That could be belonging

                                                  to a team, belonging to a family, or a classroom. We

We want children to feel a                        want our academic programme to touch the mind,

than ourselves                                    always have to start with where the child is.

                                                     Although you have a curriculum that says this is step

                                                  one, two and three, we're all going to move down this

road together. But here is Susan or Charles in the classroom, not ready to learn because they are still fearful

of the adults around them, of what's happening next, or of being vulnerable. We need to start and prepare the

child to learn, and sometimes that may take some time before they're ready to take that first step academically.

My experience has been that if we meet the needs of a particular child, we usually can't hold them back from

learning. Sometimes we think we need to prod and push kids into learning, yet if we only understand that if

we can get on the same page and understand where the child is coming from, they'll get excited about learning,

so stand back because they're going to take off and they're going to learn whatever they can.

This young man that came into my office recently is a mechanic on a world-class aeroplane, and he has to

know all the various manuals. He had to go to school for years, and this young man was standing there saying

to me, "I learnt here how to learn, and now I am in a position where I make a real difference and teach others

the skills I have". You could see the pride on his face. He came to us at age four and said he was likely never

to do well in school, and now this young man is an expert on one of the most sophisticated aeroplanes in the

world. I think that's why we have found that even after they leave our academic and treatment environment,

the children grow exponentially in the first few months rather than deteriorate.

STAFF WELLBEING

Dr. Ayre: Given the nature and complexity of the children you teach and the effect that can have on staff, how

do you look after your team and their wellbeing?

Dr. Ziegler: We're the only non-profit, non-government organisation that I'm aware of that has a mission

statement that says, "we are committed to the development of mind, body and spirit of our staff". The first

thing we know about job satisfaction is that whatever we do works, and we feel like we're making a difference.

I want you to consider, if you worked for me in one of my classrooms and you saw children coming in after

having failed everywhere they had been in school, and now they're succeeding for the first time, how would

you feel going home at night?

Dr. Ayre: I'd feel absolutely delighted.

Dr. Ziegler: Once a year, we ask all the staff in detail how they feel about their job. Universally, what they say

back in terms of the things that are most important about working at Jasper Mountain, and I have people that

have worked here for two and three decades and can't wait to come to work the next day, they universally

say that making a difference in the lives of these kids, makes all the difference to them in terms of their own

energy. Despite how hard it is and how much you have to give when you see that there is success, there's

nothing like that to give you more energy and say, "well, I'm going to do it some more".

We provide our staff with excellent supervision, and research now indicates that your relationship with your

supervisor and the support you get is all-important, as is the support you have with your peers. The second

most important thing our staff say about working for us is that they work for a team of very committed

individuals who want to make a difference. They don't

want to let down the team. They want to do their part.      "let's get back at it and let's change
One of the questions we ask all of our 135 staff is, "what                             some more lives"
are your plans for the future?" and 80 percent say they

want to spend their entire careers at Jasper Mountain. I

don't know how to respond to that. I'm so impressed that people would like to stick around and work and

make a difference and be a part of this team. Along with working and living in one of the healthiest and most
beautiful places in the US, those things all contribute to making a team of people that go home at night tired,
maybe in tears, but they sleep well, then get up in the morning and say, "let's get back at it and let's change
some more lives".

CHAPTER SUMMARY

        · Trauma gets in the way of learning by changing the brain structure of children and how information
            is processed.

        · Minimising sources of negative stress is vital in the classroom and may lessen the likelihood the
            stress response system of the child with trauma will be activated.

        · Unschooling the educational environment for children with trauma is essential. School needs to look,
            feel and be different to traditional schools where these children have failed.

        · Changing the child's perception about school is important for the child to succeed when it comes
            time to transition back to a mainstream school.

        · Teachers need ongoing coaching and support to learn they can teach a child with trauma
            successfully. It is important to have fun, success and be able to predict what's coming next. These are
            vital elements for teaching traumatised children.

Educating Students with Blocked Trust with Dr. Kim
Golding

Helping students feel safe is a hallmark of trauma-informed education. For some children, feeling secure in
relationships is difficult. Well-intentioned teachers often lack the skills required to communicate and reinforce
a sense of trust amongst these students. In this episode, we speak with Dr. Kim Golding about her book,
Working with Relational Trauma in Schools.

   Dr. Kim Golding

                                               Dr. Kim Golding received a doctorate in Clinical Psychology
                                            from Leicester University and has established and evaluated an
                                            integrated service for fostered and adopted children in
                                            Worchester, United Kingdom. The service provides support for
                                            foster, adoptive and residential parents, schools and a range of
                                            professionals around the children growing up in care or
                                            adoptive families. Dr. Golding has been trained and mentored
                                            by Dr. Daniel Hughes in using Dyadic Developmental
                                            Psychotherapy and Practice. Based on what we understand about the attachment and
   trauma needs of children, this approach underpins the support offered to foster, adoptive and residential parents,
   schools and professionals through consultation, training and supervision. Dr. Golding's book, Working with Relational
   Trauma in Schools, written with Sian Phillips and Louise Michelle Bomber, explores how educators can easily use
   Dyadic Developmental Practice to help vulnerable students thrive.

Dr. Krishnamoorthy: How has your own experience of school influenced the work you do now?
   Dr. Golding: I was a product of the grammar school system - a private school that typically selects its

pupils based on academic abilities. My sister wasn't chosen to attend the same school, so I have a first-hand
experience of how divisive the school system can be and how the effects of that stay with you for life. I also
completed school, and she didn't. At the grammar schools, we were frequently told we were the elite of the
elite. My sister had the opposite experience in a public school where she was repeatedly told she wasn't good
enough. I'm the academic one of the family, and she's the creative one. She's always minimised that as a skill
and her intelligence. The school system can do that to you in the early days. There's a lack of understanding of
how children are experiencing the pressures of school systems and what that experience of passing or failing
school means for students.

                                                                                                         13

TRAUMA, ATTACHMENT AND BLOCKED TRUST

Dr. Krishnamoorthy: How do you make sense of trauma and interpersonal trauma in your work? And how do

you conceptualise the idea of Blocked Trust that you discuss in your book?

Dr. Golding: As we speak, the world has experienced a significant trauma impact over the last 12 months with

the COVID-19 pandemic. The pandemic is a trauma outside of the family, and children experience the family

as a source of protection. Children have their family members to help them feel safe. They feel connected with

their family, and this connection allows them to manage what feels like a very unsafe situation for them. One

way to think about trauma is as being outside of the family. We can also think about trauma originating from

family relationships. When you think of trauma this way, you're taking away that sense of family protection.

You're removing the people who can support you through these traumatic events. Who protects you if the

trauma comes from within the parenting you experience? Who comforts you? Who can you turn to when in

need? Who can you trust? Who's got your back?

Those people who should be there protecting you and comforting you are the ones that are scaring and

frightening you. The experience for the child then is a profound sense of mistrust in the parenting they're

experiencing, in the relationships that should be helping them to feel safe in the world. When that experience

of trauma is pervasive, starting early in life, it becomes a block to trusting other relationships . Even if your

parents are in a better position to keep you safe and

protected later, or whether you're moving to             When that experience of trauma is

behaviour. It's more profound than that - a deep sense of `I can't find anyone to trust in the world, so I have to

do this myself.'
15  DAYNA SCHIMKE

                   Blocked Trust

      Blocked Trust occurs when children have experienced abusive or neglectful relationships with
   their primary caregivers early in life, resulting in an inability to trust and experience safe
   relationships with others.

      Click or scan the QR code read about addressing blocked trust in children in this resource from
   the Mental Health Foundation in Wales.

Dr. Krishnamoorthy: There's a lot of information about the development of attachment styles in children from
safe and unsafe relationships with primary caregivers. What does blocked trust look like in the various types
of insecure attachment that children experience?

   Dr. Golding: If we think about attachment, we also have to think about intersubjectivity, two sides of
a relationship experience that children need early in life. People who can offer you comfort at times of
distress, a reciprocal relationship experience, and people who can share their experience of you and the
experience of the world. Children learn about themselves and the world through their parent's eyes, which
is the reciprocal part of the relationship experience. If we think about Blocked Trust, we must consider the
impact on both people. The effect of attachment is that children develop an insecure attachment because
they cannot feel safe. They don't have a source of comfort to turn to reliably. Hence, they find ways to
adapt to that. Blocking trust with others is how children adjust to and develop an insecure attachment style.
Children essentially find different ways to feel safe in the world because those relationships offer insecure
patterns. For instance, if I feel wobbly, I turn to you, you might be less wobbly, but you're not available to
me. Children will learn different ways of adapting when parents aren't available to comfort them. People
will be familiar with avoidant attachment, where we become more self-reliant, and ambivalent attachment,
where we become more attachment needy. Those are the two predominant styles of insecure attachment.
The disorganised attachment style then takes avoidant and ambivalent attachment styles to a more extreme
position. Additionally, suppose you're working hard to feel soothed in an attachment experience. In that case,
you can't relax and enjoy the reciprocal relationships that may or may not be available to you to feel safe.

                   What is Attachment?

      Attachment theory attempts to explain attachment and attachment behaviour. Attachment
   behaviour is the observable action that the person does to be able to be physically close to the
   attachment figure and remain there. Attachment behaviour is evident throughout our life, and
   to know there is a significant `attachment' person who will help us in times of need provides us
   with protection.

DYADIC DEVELOPMENTAL PRACTICE (DDP) AND PACE

Dr. Krishnamoorthy: How would you describe the Dyadic Developmental Psychotherapy approach on which
your book is based?
EDUCATING STUDENTS WITH BLOCKED TRUST WITH DR. KIM GOLDING  16

   Dr. Golding: Dan Hughes originally developed DDP in America (check the box below for a video about DDP).
Dan is a Clinical Psychologist working with adopted and foster children and found the usual ways of providing
therapy for these children weren't helping them. So, Dan developed his model based on the experience of
children who've missed out on healthy relationship experiences early in life and finding ways of recovering
that healthy relationship experience later in life or with foster or adoptive parents. The word Dyadic indicates
that we can't work with children independently and must work with children and their parents within a safe
relationship. Children need to work with safe parents to recover the relational experience they need for secure
attachment and the trust that comes with that safe relationship. The `Dyadic' in DDP represents the trust in the
relational experience that the children didn't have early in life. The `Developmental' within DDP is based on our
understanding of child development. Helping children have a successful developmental pathway fundamental
to the model. `Psychotherapy' in DDP is because it is a therapy model with a therapeutic approach. Over
time more and more professionals were being trained in the model who weren't psychologists but worked in
Social Work, Residential Care, or Education which has prompted the name change to Dyadic Developmental
Practice. There is now Dyadic Developmental Psychotherapy, Dyadic Developmental Parenting, and Dyadic
Developmental Practice to highlight this is greater than just a therapy model. The therapy is still there, but
around the therapy is a parenting model, and around that is a systems model that includes education systems.
The goal is to bring the same principles into all the environments the children live in, with education and
schools being an essential part of that environment.

   PACE is the attitude that is central to and underpins the DDP model. It's an attitude based on what we offer
healthy relationship experiences to our young children. Within those healthy relationship experiences in DDP,
we offer children an attitude of Playfulness, Acceptance, Curiosity and Empathy. We're interested in their inner
world and what's going on within them, what they're thinking and feeling. Imagine having a conversation with
a baby. We have the words they don't have yet. All our words are about what's happening inside them, for
example, "you're feeling happy today", "Oh, no, no, now you're upset".

   We talk about what's going on internally and tend to do
that naturally through infancy and toddlerhood. It tends to
fade away after that, which is quite sad as we expect
children to know by then they're in a world, and we don't
need to make sense of it anymore. All children, and most
adults, like to have our inner world made sense of by
others. PACE, then, is an attitude that can apply to all
relationships. Dan realised that if we're going to help
children heal from relational traumas, then the PACE
attitude is critical. Making sense of a child's inner world in a
playful, accepting, curious and empathic way is essential to
helping them feel understood. It's critical to assist them in
learning to trust that others are reliable and can help them "Image" by Esi Grünhagen is in the Public Domain, CC0
in their distress. When a child is distressed, good parenting
feels like making the distress go away. To help a child, to help another colleague, another human, we must
make them feel understood and heard. People want others to sit with them when it's uncomfortable. If you
were expressing a level of sadness about a recent event to me, you don't want me to come in and say, "it'll be
all right", "by next week, this will all be in the past", or "why are you worrying"? "What you want is someone to
say that sounds tough, you're having a tough time right now, and I get it, and I think it's making you very
worried." Then I feel a bit better because you get it, you understand. I feel better because I know someone else
understands what I'm going through. That's at the heart of PACE. The PACE model is sitting compassionately
with another person's experience. Within DDP, we talk a lot about slowing down, which we don't usually take
the time to do. Slowing down looks like "let me listen to you", "let me hear and know your story". "Let me share
17                                                                                            DAYNA SCHIMKE

    Slowing down looks like "let me   what I'm hearing about your story and allow me to add
    listen to you", "let me hear and  a little to it with my curiosity into your story."
    know your story".

       Click or scan the QR code to watch this interview of Daniel Hughes introducing Dyadic
    Developmental Practice from the Scottish Attachment in Action Conference [11:43].

Dr. Ayre: From a teacher's point of view, unless a student is unsafe, we don't always have to
act immediately, which is hard to do. Just because something's disrupting at the moment for you, you don't
have to jump in straight away and do something to "fix it". The word therapy instantly brings up thoughts: "I'm
not a therapist; I can't do a therapeutic thing because I don't have training in it". You tend to quickly flick the
responsibility outside your classroom because that's not something you know how to do.

   Dr. Golding: Teachers have a whole classroom of children that need educating, and it can feel overwhelming,
and you ask yourself, "how have I got time to do this"? "You're asking me to slow down, but I've only got so
many hours in the day, and I've got so many children to attend to". An important message here is that slowing
down is just about saying, "have I understood or do I need to have a bit more understanding here"? That can
happen with an acknowledgement to the child, such as saying, "you're having a tough day, and I'm here". That
doesn't have to take very long. I knew a primary school teacher who would just put a note on the desk if he
noticed a child struggling that said, "I've noticed", "I'm noticing you're struggling today". He often wouldn't even
have a conversation with the student. Slowing down doesn't have to mean hours and hours of sitting and
talking to a student.

                  Attachment, School and Learning

      Students who have attachment difficulties engage in misbehaviour to cope by `getting'
   control over people - adults and other children - through coercion, deception, and
   aggression (verbal, physical). These children may have learned to use such behaviours to get
   them access to preferred activities and objects and proximity to adults. Let us look at a
   framework of practice to support these students.

THE TWO HANDS OF TEACHING

Dr. Golding: Dan Hughes initially talked about two hands of parenting, and the two hands of teaching is an
adaptation of that. The phrase `connection before correction' is one of Dan's phrases. The connection is the
emotional connection with the person, and the importance of ensuring the relationship is there. Correction is
about the doing. It isn't about punishment but learning and teaching. It might be changing something I'm doing
EDUCATING STUDENTS WITH BLOCKED TRUST WITH DR. KIM GOLDING                                            18

                                         because what I'm doing with you is not working; hence

Correction is about the doing. It isn't  the correction is about action. The connection is my
about punishment but learning and        emotional relationship with you, which will help the
teaching.                                doing happen more successfully. In schools, we have
                                         the connection, on the one hand, which includes

                                         warmth, empathy, nurturing, and curiosity about your

internal experience. There is also the doing part. You hit your peer, which isn't an acceptable way of managing

things. We need to think about how we can make sure that doesn't happen again and how we can help you

repair the relationship with your peer. If we do that alongside the connection, the child will find it much easier

to engage with and be less defensive. If students are less defensive, they're much more likely to learn from the

experience where we're supporting them. We want a child to learn how to manage conflict with peers without

hitting them or just going straight to the correction. If we go straight to discipline without connection, the child

becomes defensive and starts feeling like they're bad. Children don't like feeling like they're bad, so they may

go into shame. An experience of shame takes you away from learning about the world because it becomes

very self-focused. Children can't learn when they're in a state of shame, they can't learn academically, and they

can't learn how to resolve the conflict next time. Suppose we can put the second hand in there, connect with

the child, and make sense of their experience of what got them so angry. In that case, we can work with the

child to resolve the conflict experience. Remember that being angry is a feeling which is neither right nor

wrong. We need to help the child understand and then empathise with that experience. Collaborative

consequences[1], rather than coercive consequences[2] where the adult imposes a consequence on the child,

are more effective in helping the child learn they can help make things better and repair relationships. This will

help them learn how to deal with friendships and relationships in the real world as they grow older.

Dr. Krishnamoorthy: One of the things I found powerful about the PACE model is that the focus is always on

the relationship rather than just the doing of calming someone down. The focus is always on understanding

the child and providing them with the experience of feeling understood.

Dr. Golding: The relationship is more important than the goal. In de-escalation, you have a clear purpose of

calming yourself down. Then life is easier for all of us. It's not an unreasonable goal, but we go a step further

than that. My goal is to understand and get to know you. I'm hopeful that that will also help you calm down and

make life easier for all of us. Then we talk about storytelling and finding the story or the narrative. I want to

understand your experience here, so I'm not just going to come in to calm you down. I can do that, and there

are techniques for doing that, but I'm going to do something additional. I want to help you calm down, but I

also want to know you, and I want to know what's going on for you. I want to discover your story, the story

of this moment, your story of this experience. I'll have a more profound empathy for you in understanding

that story. When you receive empathy, you will feel more deeply understood, which will help the calming down

process. It will also get your thinking brain working so we can figure out what went wrong and we can figure

out what we could do another time. In that sense, it's much, much bigger than just de-escalation.

Dr. Krishnamoorthy: With de-escalation, we often fall into the trap of stepping into that control and coercion,

whereas with PACE, it's about relationship building and care and concern for the child.

Dr. Golding: De-escalation, at its best, isn't about controlling people, but it is focused on using techniques and

is goal orientated. PACE is much broader than that with its relational focus. The central element of DDP is that

it's a relational model. The relationship is more important than anything else. The belief is if we understand

our students and have a relationship with them, that will calm their nervous systems down and help them feel

                                         safe. It will support their emotional well-being, so

The belief is if we understand our       they're in a much better learning state. We can then
students and have a relationship         achieve our secondary goal of teaching them. This can
with them, that will calm their          sound a little strange to teachers. Why would teaching
nervous systems down and help            be a secondary goal? If we think about how we work as
them feel safe.                          human beings, we learn when we're emotionally safe. If
                                         we're not emotionally safe, our nervous system puts us

                                         in a state to deal with the danger, not to learn. While we

have an overall goal to teach our children, our primary purpose must be to help them feel safe and emotionally

supported to learn. When they feel safe and emotionally invested, then we can achieve our goal of teaching
them. Unfortunately, that's not often understood in the education system.

PRACTISING IN THE MOMENT

Dr. Golding: The model starts with `noticing'. Notice if something needs attention, and take immediate action to
keep everyone safe. For example, if Billy and Joe are fighting, we must break up the fight for safety. The fast
route we usually take then, what's the consequence here for fighting? Maybe it's detention after school or at
lunchtime. That's the quick route of managing the children but with no connection. I've tried to show what the
slow route looks like, which is more effective in emotion regulation. The next part of the process is to notice
your reaction and focus on yourself. Ask yourself, how am I doing in this situation? Am I regulated enough to
help these kids, or do I need to take care of myself first? If I need to take care of myself, can I hand the children
over to someone else because these children need support right now? If I can't, can I at least take a breath,
EDUCATING STUDENTS WITH BLOCKED TRUST WITH DR. KIM GOLDING                                                   20

have compassion for myself, focus on the children, and breathe? I can remind myself this is hard, and it's okay.

I might struggle, but we'll get through it. Compassion for yourself can allow you to be more open and engaged

                                                 with the children. Instead of saying, "what the heck is

Compassion for yourself can allow                going on here"? You can now calmly say, "hey boys,
you to be more open and engaged                  you're having a hard time today. Let's figure out what's
with the children.                               going on here". Then it's essential to think about
                                                 emotion regulation for the children. Are they

                                                 regulated? If they're not emotionally regulated, it's no

point in doing anything else because they're not in a state to receive it. We have to put our attention on

regulation first. We might say, "come on, boys, we're going to go for a walk. I want one of you on either side of

me, and while we walk, we'll think about what's going on". Walking and movement is doing something to help

the regulation process. We know from occupational therapists that all sorts of things can help children regulate

at a sensory and an emotional level.

                                                 Once the children are calm, you can say, "Okay, you've

                                                 had a hard time, let's figure this out", which is Dan Hughes'

                                                 favourite phrase! Another vital part of this process is to not

                                                 immediately say, "I want you to think about the other

                                                 person and the impact on them". We need to start with

                                                 ourselves first. If I'm talking to Billy, who was going for Joe,

                                                 it's no good to be asking Billy what you think Joe's feeling

                                                 right now. Billy will go straight into shame and

                                                 defensiveness, thinking shuts down, and I've lost my

                                                 opportunity to connect with him. Instead, starting with Billy,

                                                 we ask something like, "what was going on for you"? "I

                                                 wonder what made you so angry"? During this process, we

                                                 must remember anger is just a feeling, and it's neither right

"Image" by PIX1861 is in the Public Domain, CC0  nor wrong. It just is. We may say, "help me understand why
                                                 you got so angry". When you understand, you give back

                                                 with empathy, "that was hard for you when that happened".

Now the child is feeling like you get it. He's not feeling shame now, he's starting to feel a bit of guilt, and he's

starting to feel some remorse. Billy then thinks, `I didn't want to hurt Joe. He's my friend, and I don't know what

to do about that, but I feel it. Now Billy's receptive to some ideas. If we move from shame to guilt, guilt allows

remorse and the desire to make amends. So now Billy is in a receptive state. We can think about Joe. "Joe's

upset with you. I don't want him to be upset with you. I wonder what we can do about that"?

The next part of the sequence is the action part. What are we going to do about this? Here, the collaborative

consequence comes in. The adult takes some responsibility here as well. It might be that maybe you guys

aren't ready to play together for half an hour. Perhaps you need a little more supervision or structure to play

together? That's my responsibility as an adult to put that in place, but maybe there's something you can do

that lets Joe know that you are sorry you upset him. Something that lets him know that you want to be friends.

I wonder what that could be? And Joe might not be quite ready to hear it yet. Can you be patient with that?

That leads us to the relationship repair part of the sequence, which is the last part, where we help the

child repair the relationship. It's also the adult's role to think about and ask if there is anything we need to

do to repair the relationship. We can reflect and realise that at the beginning, I wasn't so PACE-ful. I can then

acknowledge that I was initially frustrated with you boys, and that's down to me. I'm glad we managed in the

end, though, and this is doing your repair of the relationship. Doing your part of the repair also shows children

that repair is an excellent thing to do. We can always reach out and acknowledge we got something wrong. It's

trying to capture PACE and the two hands mentioned earlier.

                  Teaching in the Moment

       Here is a full description of Dr. Golding's `Teaching in the Moment' [PDF] framework - with
    prompts for each of the seven steps in the framework.

TEACHER SELF-CARE

Dr. Krishnamoorthy: For teachers to be able to implement this framework, they would need to be feeling safe

themselves. Regulated and calm but on some level safe in the environment they're in as well. Safe in the

knowledge that colleagues and administrators have their back when needed.

    Dr. Golding: Whole schools must use a consistent framework, so everyone supports everyone else in a very

PACE-ful way. We can then build schools that are safe for everyone, including teachers and other staff. The

well-being of the adults is critical to the well-being of the children. If we can't put well-being for adults in place,

we're not going to get it right for the children. It's so

important we look after the adults here. I've also got to   The well-being of the adults is

we all go into our defensive nervous systems, which
never goes well for anyone.                                                                children.

    Dr. Ayre: Commonly, teachers tend to put themselves

last. The children always come first, and teachers are not consciously thinking about themselves. Suppose

you've got a school where everybody consistently supports each other and similarly responds to children. In

that case, the mentality of `this child is your problem because he's in your classroom' reduces. Everybody then

takes on some responsibility for helping all students. It helps everybody to say we need great teachers with

great well-being to be able to help each other and to help our students. Therefore, my priority as your

colleague is ensuring you're okay.

    Dr. Golding: The common phrase `you put your oxygen mask on first, I can only support you if I look after

myself' is relevant here. A story that helps define the importance of this is of the father in the desert. I don't

know the story's author, but it's where a father and a son are walking in the desert, and they're lost. They can't

find their way out. They've got one bottle of water between them, and the son is getting thirsty because it's

scorching, and the son says to his Dad, "Daddy, can I have some water? I'm thirsty". The father says, "I'm so

sorry, my lad, I'm going to drink the water". The son says, "but Daddy, that's not fair. I'm thirsty. Why are you

drinking the water when it's like this"? The father says, "If I drink the water, I'll keep myself going, and I can

find a way to get us out of this desert. If I give you the water, I won't be able to do that". That story shows us

fundamental reasons why we take care of ourselves first.

SOCIAL EMOTIONAL SCHOOLS

Dr. Golding: There's a school that I've supported in England called `Nurture Learning'. It's a very small school,
and it's for children who are failing in mainstream schools because of social-emotional difficulties. The school
has a wonderful group of teachers who offer the children a PACE-ful experience. What we see are children
who settle and flourish in school. There was once a young girl who was 14 or 15 when she came into that
school, and she was having a tough time. She had a complicated upbringing with her parents. She had
failed in mainstream school, and her learning was compromised. She was significantly underachieving. What
EDUCATING STUDENTS WITH BLOCKED TRUST WITH DR. KIM GOLDING                                                       22

impressed me was how the staff could focus on her social and emotional support and how they didn't get

preoccupied thinking they had to teach this girl academics. They knew this child wasn't in a place to learn

right now. They felt able to give her the time and space she needed to feel safe in the school and to build

relationships around her to improve her emotional well-being. Only after that were they able to see her start

to flourish and move towards learning. She achieved the qualifications and all the things we wanted to put

out at school. Without the initial focus on safety and her social-emotional well-being, she would never have

achieved that learning.

There's a lot of preoccupation in schools, particularly for

adolescents who need to get their Year 12 certificates or

qualifications, on getting them to catch up if they've had

disrupted learning. There's an ongoing debate with the

government, who are pushing to use some of the school

holidays to help these kids catch up academically. These

kids are frightened. They're coming back to school after

being confined to home. They have been told there's

something perilously dangerous in the world, and now

we're saying go to school and catch up with your learning.

We're missing some steps here. We need social-emotional

safety for our adolescence just as much as for our younger

children. We need to help them integrate back into schools "Image" by kellysikkema is in the Public Domain, CC0

and their peer groups. If we attend to their social and

emotional needs, they'll catch up because they learn when they're in the right emotional state. Humans have a

thirst for learning and will achieve what they need to succeed. That isn't always understood.

                                    Dr. Krishnamoorthy: When we think about big groups

understood.                         Interestingly, the social-emotional needs of people are
                                    never a key feature of how things are managed in

                                    society.

Dr. Golding: And that's understandable, the crisis came, and we had to deal with it quickly. Like in my model,

the first thing you must do is attend to the immediate danger. There is a knock-on effect, though. For example,

we know that adolescent suicides are increasing now, and mental health everywhere has been compromised.

As we ease out of this pandemic, we must attend to this. It can be easy to say, "everything's normal again",

"get the kids back into school, get them caught up on their learning, and they will be fine". It's not as easy

as this. These kids have been through some awful trauma through this pandemic, whether it's touched them

personally or whether they just watched it on the news and heard about it. We've all been affected by the

trauma of this and some children in a very, very personal way. They've lost parents or family members, and this

is an excellent example of working with massive trauma. We're going to help these children return to school,

but we've got to do it safely, in an emotionally healthy way.

CHAPTER SUMMARY

· Trauma can occur from influences outside of the family and from within family relationships.

· Blocked trust develops out of pervasive trauma early in life, which creates a block to trusting other
   relationships.

· PACE principles help promote the experience of relational safety between adults and children.

· Collaborative consequences are effective in helping a child learn they can make things better and
   repair relationships.
23  DAYNA SCHIMKE

    · If students are understood and have a relationship with teachers, their nervous system will calm, and
       this will help them feel safe at school. Then they can learn academics.

    · The well-being of teachers is crucial to the well-being of children. Teachers need to feel supported
       and safe to implement relational frameworks with students.

Trauma Informed Classroom Management with Betsy
de Thierry

   Betsy de Thierry

                                               Betsy de Thierry is the founding director of the Trauma
                                            Recovery Centre, a charity offering therapy and alternative
                                            education to children and young people impacted by
                                            trauma. Betsy is a psychotherapist with over 20 years of
                                            experience working with vulnerable children, young people
                                            and adults. She is also a trained primary school teacher. The
                                            combination of education and psychotherapy has led her to
                                            provide expertise in trauma support for children and
                                            families.
      Betsy has authored seven books, including Teaching the Child on the Trauma Continuum and The Simple Guide to Child
   Trauma: What it is and How to Help. Her books are written mainly for teachers and caring adults supporting traumatised
   children, providing complex information in an easy-to-read and understandable format.

Ms. de Thierry: When I completed my university training, you couldn't just be an educational psychologist. You
had to complete five years in education first, which led me to teaching. Teaching was the best way for me to
be with kids, help kids and get to know kids. I loved being a classroom teacher. I'd always try to work out how
to help the kids that are troubled, misunderstood and not flourishing.

THE TRAUMA CONTINUUM

Dr. Ayre: In your book, Teaching the child on the trauma continuum, you write about the importance of thinking
about trauma in terms of a continuum. Why is this important?

   Ms. de Thierry: I think the continuum is vital. I sit in many conversations where teachers tell me that all their
children are traumatised. How can I be pointing at one in particular? When speaking to educators, I often draw
a line and say, `let's look at the difference in terms of trauma symptoms, trauma experience and the child's
environment'. For example, what is their parental situation? As we look at those three areas, we can have an
informed discussion on how traumatised a child is. This leads us to match an appropriate intervention for their
level of trauma. Over here in the UK, supporting the attachment relationship between children and adults has
become quite a big deal. We have many attachment-aware initiatives that are brilliant for the first half of the
trauma continuum. For the second half of the trauma continuum, students with more complex mental health
concerns and severe behaviour difficulties, it's more complicated. The practices of support and intervention

                                                                                                         24
25                                DAYNA SCHIMKE

for children on the second half of this continuum are often like band-aids over heart wounds. Heart wounds

                                  that need heart surgery. While many of these

    Heart wounds that need heart  interventions are well intended, can lead to feelings of
    surgery.                      increased shame in educators. They may feel like
                                  failures that the intervention didn't work. This is why I

                                  am passionate about the second half of the trauma

continuum and those children with complex trauma getting the response and appropriate intervention they

need.

IMPACT OF TRAUMA IN THE CLASSROOM

Dr. Ayre: Can you highlight how trauma affects the brain and body of children, and what this looks, sounds
and feels like for a classroom teacher?

   Ms. de Thierry: We recognise that trauma primarily impacts the body and the mind. Many classroom
teachers would ask me, "can you just tell me what these children's triggers are"? "What are the things that will
cause them to react in a way that's inappropriate or problematic"? I generally laugh and say, "do you know
what your triggers are?"

   I often tell people a story to help explain the difficulty in identifying `triggers' in others. The story is of a little
boy who went for a walk with his dog and ended up having his foot run over by a car. At the same time, he
was carrying a banana milkshake that spilled everywhere. After the car ran over his foot, he ended up in the
hospital, and it was all very traumatic for him. Many months later, the little boy was happily chatting in the
lunchroom at school when somebody spilled a banana milkshake. His reaction was to run, just to run as fast
as he could, while he also screamed and yelled as if the car was running over his foot again. The little boy is
ten, and this embarrassed him. I explained that there was no cognitive sense for this little boy of when his foot
was run over by the car. The trauma of the car running over his foot while drinking a banana milkshake will be
entangled in his head. That means whenever he sees a spilled banana milkshake, he might get frightened as
the trauma of his foot being run over will be activated.

   That's an example of `what wires together, fires together'. But for those teachers or this little boy, there was
no cognitive understanding of this. Essentially, when this boy's foot was run over, the sensory neurones all
fired off in his head simultaneously. The smell and sight of spilled banana milkshake, the sound of the car, the
feeling of terror, the feeling of pain in his foot, the scent of the dog, all those senses and neurons would have
fired off in his head at the same time. That's how they `wired together', meaning they tangled together in the
subconscious. The little boy could have equally screamed and yelled and had a trauma response if he'd seen
a dog at the same time as having a headache because the sense of pain and sight and smell of the dog might
have triggered a similar response, like a flashback of what happened to him when his foot was run over. The
smell of banana milkshake was a sensory memory held in his subconscious, which remembered the accident,
which then caused him to have a physiological response of pain, which we would call a flashback.

Dr. Ayre: That makes it tricky for the teacher to identify the specific trigger. There's no logical sense to what's
happening in front of them to try and help the child.

   Ms. de Thierry: They are challenging for the teachers and tough for the kids. The kids don't know what's
just happened and are freaked out themselves. They don't understand why they did what they did. Unless
we teach children about the subconscious and how it works, they can feel terrified by themselves and their
responses. The response from an adult at that point, whatever background the adult has, must be empathetic,
kind, curious, and not furious. They need to be thoughtful, proceed with caution and reaffirm that what's just
happened is okay. Let the child know you're not mad, and perhaps they've just had a response that related to
their experience of trauma.

   The first question teachers generally ask is, "why did you do that"? What the child is doing is looking to the
adult and asking, "Why did I do this"? The problem is professionals will often question why their behaviour is
escalating. If a child is screaming or having a temper tantrum publicly, running out and hiding under a table,
or maybe hitting somebody or being aggressive, and afterwards thinks, "why did I do that"? And there's no
adult to tell this child why they did it, and there's no one to explain that it's a response to fear. You might be
27  DAYNA SCHIMKE

  so frightened that your behaviour will escalate because you feel so powerless and terrified. So, adults must be
  kind, empathic and curious about the behaviour to help the child feel safe.

  DISSOCIATION IN CHILDREN

  Dr. Ayre: One response to trauma is often dissociation. What are some of the behaviours or signs that are
  indicative of dissociation in children with trauma?

      Ms. de Thierry: Many professionals here in the UK would refer to dissociation as glazing over and
  daydreaming. Some forms of dissociation are a normal adaptive behaviour, and it's something we all do when
  we're driving or watching a film or something. Dissociation is also a way of coping with unrelenting traumatic
  experiences. It's a form of shutting down and fragmenting. It's a internal system - a complex internal response
  to terror and powerlessness.

      Essentially, it leads to confusion and chaos internally. In children under eight years old, this could present
  as occasionally glazing over or daydreaming. Dissociation presents differently at different times. For example,
  you could have an eight-year-old who is a maths-loving, typical little eight-year-old in one moment. The next
  moment, for no apparent reason (because we understand that triggers aren't logical), that same eight-year-old
  may be rocking in the corner, sucking her thumb like a baby and wetting herself. She may be very verbally
  articulate, wise, or mature for her age. Then the next minute says, "I've no idea what you're talking about. I've
  never wet myself, I've never been like a baby". That's the different presentations and ways of presenting her
  different parts or her different ego states.

      I often talk to children about buckets. You have a muddy
  bucket and a shiny golden bucket. In the shiny bucket, you
  put all the happy things, the lovely moments, the stickers,
  the rewards, the friend saying, "I want to choose you." Then,
  in the muddy bucket, you put in all the stuff that's hard to
  deal with, the tough stuff, the things you feel pained by and
  you stick those in your muddy bucket. And if your muddy
  bucket is full, it begins to overflow. This overflow behaviour
  is being grumpy, irritable, a little bit
  spiky, sharp, or maybe aggressive.

      When children have been significantly traumatised, they
  have one muddy bucket that gets too full and then leaks.
  The leaks are the behaviours that begin to cause the child "Image" by 5598375 is in the Public Domain, CC0
  to have less love, less nurture, and less kindness and
  empathy from others. Then they must use another bucket, and then another bucket, and another bucket, and
  each bucket holds different memories, experiences, feelings, and different ways of being.

      I also use another metaphor, the daisy theory. I would say that each bucket is like a daisy petal. It's a different
  holding bay for emotions, memories, and experiences. We usually start with talking about the buckets. Then
  when somebody does begin to show tangible evidence that they're highly dissociative, we then do what I call
  the daisy with them. We've got hundreds of children around the country that we're doing the daisy with. We
  draw a Daisy, and the middle circle we will say is their apparently normal part1 (ANP), which comes from
  the structural dissociation theory2 of van der Hart, Nijenhuis and Steele3, that's their normal presenting part,
  the part that gets on with life. Then we will map out all their petals. They'll begin to acknowledge that maybe
  they've got a baby petal (or part of themself) that sometimes, like the story I just told you, wets themselves
  and sucks their thumb for no reason. And maybe they've got an older petal (or part). A maths-loving petal,
  and maybe they've even got an aggressive petal, and perhaps a petal that is sad and possibly suicidal and
  desperate. Those kids will be aware of those parts somewhere in the middle of the dissociative continuum.

1. The rational, grounded and present-oriented parts of an individual.
2. Posits personality is integrated over time and this integration can be disrupted by childhood trauma.

   When they get to the other end, the furthest end of the continuum, they won't be aware of those parts
because they'll have a form of amnesia or memory loss. They'll not be aware that those parts exist. That's when
kids are often told that they're lying, "Did you do that behaviour"? and the child will say "No" because they can't
remember it. After all, it's a different part of them, and then they're told they're lying when they honestly can't
remember.

   An eleven-year-old boy was here a few years ago, and he was sexually abused from birth. He ended up
showing some sexualised behaviour. Quite often in the classroom, he would suddenly put her hand up the
teacher's skirt. This would generally make him feel terrified that he did it because it would shock him, and he'd
end up having a big meltdown and losing the plot. By the time he managed to recover from the meltdown, and
sadly they would often have to restrain him and do all sorts of unpleasant things, he'd be dragged to the head
teacher's office. At the office, the head teacher would ask, "why did you put your hand up the teacher's skirt"?
"Why did you do that?" And the child would stand there and say, "I have no idea what you're talking about. I
didn't do that". And to an extent, he didn't do it. Another part of him did it. When this little boy understood what
was happening to him, he had the language to explain to the adults around him that he took full responsibility
for his behaviours. It's not a way to avoid that, but it's another part of him that has different responses and
ways of responding to triggers, pain, and fear.

  ATTUNEMENT

  Dr. Ayre: What key strategies can you suggest for teachers who support trauma-affected students?
      Ms. de Thierry: The key is being attuned4. As a trainer, I have to attune to the people I'm training. I have to

  notice when they start to look tired and need a break. Or when I haven't let them talk enough to digestwhat
  they're learning. I have to notice if it's near lunchtime and they're hungry. I have to notice when maybe they've
  taken up too much information, and they need to get into groups and go outside and chat. As a trainer,
  that's what keeps them listening, and if I'm not attuned to them, I'll have half of them asleep in the room and
  not listening. Being attuned as a trainer is vital as I can be responsive in the room. I would argue that that's
  precisely the same as being a teacher.

      When you attune, you're aware when one child in the corner is just staring out the window. You're attuned
  that there's a little gaggle of girls being nasty to each other. If you're aware, even with 30 plus students, you
  know what's happening, and you pick up the vibe in the room. I think as an attuned teacher, you can respond to
  that. You can go "let's all jump up and do our spaghetti wiggle. We can do regular brain gym exercises, physical
  exercises that cause the endorphins to run again and break the tension, boredom, hard work, or whatever is
  going on to let you change the atmosphere". When you can attune to the needs of your students, you've got
  a happy class, so I would argue that attunement is the most essential skill to develop. Many schools say, "give
  me the strategies," and I'll be like, "not until you understand attunement". Strategies on their own won't be
  successful if you're not attuned to your students. Many of the strategies only work in attuned relationships.

                     Attunement in the Classroom

4. Aware of, attentive or responsive to others.
TRAUMA INFORMED CLASSROOM MANAGEMENT WITH BETSY DE THIERRY                                                   30

   Attunement helps children to feel safe with us and is the building block of secure
attachment. Discipline tools should be used with attunement. From this perspective,
non-violent discipline methods are not good or bad in themselves, rather, they should be
evaluated according to how well they fit with the needs and signals of the child.

CHALLENGES FOR STUDENTS AT SCHOOL IMPACTED BY
TRAUMA

Dr. Ayre: What have you noticed is the biggest challenge for students experiencing traumatic stress at school?

Ms. de Thierry: The biggest challenge is that children are dependent on peer relationships and a

relationship with a trusted adult. Yet very often, their behaviours are the very thing that pushes them away

from having a relationship. The frustration and conflict of knowing deep inside that they're desperate for

friends and to please their teacher. They're desperate to have that sense of satisfaction that the teacher is

pleased with them. They also know they're doing the behaviour that pushes children away so they won't be

invited to birthday parties. They are frustrated with their teachers and think their teachers just don't like them.

We know that relationships are the key to healing from trauma, the key to recovery. Yet, they're the very thing

that children struggle with most.

   Dyslexia wasn't understood well when I was training      We know that relationships are the

notion then that you could have highly intelligent

people like Einstein, who also had dyslexia. Now we know that if we help children with dyslexia, we can see

them become like Einstein, we can see them become some of our creative geniuses. We need to give them

extra support in one area to allow them to excel. I would love trauma to become the same, for it to be obvious

and for teachers to acknowledge and use the trauma continuum to see where the kids sit on it to know what

intervention might be appropriate. Let's then provide that intervention now.

                             "Image" by truthseeker08 is in the Public Domain, CC0
If we can work out how to appropriately intervene when a child has been traumatised and help them recover,
31  DAYNA SCHIMKE

we will change communities. We will transform families and we will reduce the pressure on the mental health
system. We will change the pressure on the criminal justice system. We will literally change the world if we can
crack the question of `how to help a child recover from trauma.' We know that one-on-one support and early
intervention when the kids are seven or eight will cost us financially for a couple of years. Still, we know long
term it will save money. It will save money in terms of their ability to contribute positively to society as they
grow into adults, which will likely reduce anti-social behaviour due to unhealed trauma. This will then minimise
the use of, and impact on, our mental health and criminal justice systems. This is money worth spending on
early intervention while students are at school. I think if we can crack that, then I'll be happy!

THERAPEUTIC MENTORING ROOMS

Ms. de Thierry: The Therapeutic Mentoring Rooms concept came from having run the Trauma Recovery
Centre charity in the United Kingdom. There we would see about one hundred children who were coming in
for therapy or intensive education in one of our centres each week. I realised that some of the children coming
for treatment each week were being sent in taxis that our local government paid for. It seemed very un-trauma
informed to me that these little vulnerable kids were being put in taxis with unknown taxi drivers, sometimes
driving an hour to our centre for an hour of play therapy. Whilst it's brilliant therapy, and the kids benefitted
from it, I found it very disturbing that they were in a taxi for two hours, often with an adult they didn't know.

   To make the whole process trauma-informed, I thought, `why don't I train people in the school to be
trauma-informed and deliver therapeutic support to these kids?' I developed a 14-day course called the
Therapeutic Mentoring Certificate. To support the implementation of these practices, we started therapeutic
mentoring rooms. In some mainstream schools, it's a physical room set up like our therapy rooms with giant
colourful beanbags and sensory kits. They don't look like classrooms at all. The therapeutic mentors who have
completed the 14-day certificate work with the children there in a different way from us as therapists. We
have trauma-informed therapists who go into the school six times a year and, after completing comprehensive
assessments, will devise treatment plans for the most traumatised children that the therapeutic mentor will
then implement. We also offer the therapeutic mentors' clinical supervision' - a chance to debrief and learn
from their experiences that week. This occurred every six weeks to support them in implementing the support
plans.

   One example is a little eight-year-old boy who came for therapy one hour a week. This cost the local
government hundreds of pounds a week. So instead of continuing this, we got the child to have breakfast
with the therapeutic mentor each day for an hour. At breakfast, the mentors and children could just play -
with playdoh for example - and chat about how he's doing. In that hour, the therapeutic mentor would also
implement activities that a therapist had written in his treatment plan.

   If there were any problems or anything complicated arose, then the therapeutic mentor could talk to us
as we were providing ongoing support. We see fantastic outcomes this way. Children that were going to be
excluded are no longer excluded. Children are building on the relationship they've already got with a member
of staff within the school, and they don't have to travel out for therapy to learn how to build relationships as
it's happening right there as part of their education.

CHAPTER SUMMARY

        · The trauma continuum looks at three areas of a child's life, their trauma symptoms, trauma
            experience and their environment. The trauma continuum can help to identify and match
            appropriate interventions to each child's need.

        · Triggers in children at school can be difficult to identify by teachers and the children themselves. A
            teacher's response to a trigger and a trauma behaviour needs to be empathetic, kind, gentle and
            curious.

· Children can suffer memory loss and amnesia as a form of dissociation in response to trauma and
   may not remember certain behaviours enacted when triggered.

· Attunement is a key skill for teachers to develop to manage various children's needs in a classroom.

Ms. Kuypers: As an occupational therapist working in schools, I saw a huge need to support students with
their ability to self-regulate. I supported many students on my caseload who needed help with their sensory
regulation. I was finding I would show up to a classroom, and the teacher would push a student out the door
to me, saying, "he needs to calm down". I would bring them to my sensorimotor room and get them to this just
right level of arousal.

   As I brought the student back, the teacher would say, "we're five minutes into maths. Catch up to problem
six". This makes the student upset and dysregulated because they missed the first five minutes of maths. The
teacher then looks at me with an expression of "now what are you going to do?". I'm often left looking at
the teacher like, "I'm not sure?". Many of us at the school were unsure of what to do in these situations. This
helplessness would often lead to a culture of relying excessively on punishment. If students couldn't quickly
comply with the demands from the teacher, they were escorted out of the classroom, or they exploded, and
then there were punishment and consequences. There wasn't any teaching on how to help the student have a
more adaptive, prosocial response to stressors in the school environment.

   When I was getting my Master's in Education and a Graduate Certificate in Autism, it was through the
coursework and applying the coursework to my caseload that I started thinking, "how can we do this
differently?", "how can we look beyond teaching a student a lesson to truly teaching them a self-regulation
lesson?".

                                                                                                         34

SELF-REGULATION & EMOTIONAL CONTROL

Dr. Krishnamoorthy: How do you explain the idea of self-regulation to teachers?

    Ms. Kuypers: Self-regulation is an umbrella term that covers other groups of complex skills like self-discipline,

self-control, anger management, and emotional control. It also includes regulating our level of arousal or

alertness. For example, some of us immediately wake up to the alarm and hit snooze. This shows a very low

level of arousal or alertness. Some of us are startled by the alarm, which is a heightened arousal level. And

some of us lie in bed, thinking about our day and planning. That's just a more grounded, organised level of

arousal or alertness.

    We need to constantly adjust this level of arousal and how we reveal our emotions. We need to do this in a

way that's adaptive to the social context and in relation to the goals or the tasks we're trying to achieve in the

environment. For many students, those goals or tasks are just getting through the work and moving on in their

daily schedule. It often includes having fun, pleasing parents and teachers, and having friends to eat lunch with

and play with. We make many adjustments to how we express those innate emotions and manage that level

of arousal to move more smoothly through our day.

    Dr. Krishnamoorthy: It almost seems foundational to manage our arousal and emotional expression before

we can do any higher-level cognitive learning.

    Ms. Kuypers: It's such a foundational skill, and you're not going to be in a place for learning and taking on that

challenge of academics, turning that information into knowledge if you're not in this calm, regulated, grounded

state. I see an increasing number of schools

understanding the value of this and wanting their             you're not going to be in a place for
students to achieve high-level academic scores. They're                   learning and taking on that
putting the work in and building the self-regulation skill
set to give their students success. The research is         challenge of academics, turning that
backing this up too. It's been exciting to see the          information into knowledge if you're
pendulum swinging and more research showing the
value of self-regulation.                                                 not in this calm, regulated,
                                                                                            grounded state

                   Self-Regulation: The Fundamentals

      We depend on executive functions and emotion management daily--did you know these skills
   can be taught? Research shows that students with better self-regulation skills have higher
   academic achievement, are more likely to get along with others, and are better able to build and
   maintain strong relationships. Learn more by watching this brief video from the Committee for
   Children [2.22]. Click or scan the QR code to start watching.

Dr. Krishnamoorthy: When did you realise that sensory regulation strategies were effective and made a
difference to students?

   Ms. Kuypers: I had a kindergarten student who came from a home environment where he had a parent who
was incarcerated. He was raised by a single mother and had a brother with a disability. We knew there were
illicit drugs in the home, and he had a cognitive impairment. We worked on making a routine and helping the
family understand his emotions first.

   As we were working through and using the Zones of Regulation framework with him, he put his picture into
the red zone to show he was in this heightened state of arousal. The red zone is where emotions are at their
max. He then put himself into a time-out, and that wasn't something we were teaching with the red zone. This
was an `aha' moment when I saw a student who could barely go through the ABCs or spell his name but could
recognise his emotional state. He could recognise he was furious at that moment. What typically happened
TEACHING SELF-REGULATION WITH MS. LEAH KUYPERS    36

when he's angry is he ended up in time-out. So he let us know he was in that heightened state and put himself

in time-out. We wrote a different ending to this routine teaching him red zone tools he could use instead of

timeout, like deep breathing and taking a break.

I began noticing that students have this `little bit of control when they're in that super heightened state and

the red zone. With that little bit of control evident, we could help these students diverge from, or change, their

                                                  typical expression of those heightened states. In that

students diverge from, or change,                 something, or whatever disruptive behaviour is
their typical expression of those                 protective for the child. We can teach them to
heightened states.                                recognise when they're in that heightened state and
                                                  that they can have a different ending or outcome. They

                                                  can have a calm, quiet place, but they don't associate

anything punitive with the heightened state. When we reduce the shame of being heightened, children can

learn helpful, effective strategies to manage.

By the end of the year, this student would identify he was in the red zone and participate in yoga

independently at his spot. This student had been previously going into a time-out, out of the classroom.

He'd had behaviour reports for disruptive and aggressive behaviour. Sometimes his behaviour led to a locked

seclusion situation. He was going to time-out multiple times a day. After the intervention, he was sent to time-

out perhaps once a week, if that. He was also doing yoga instead. That was a pivotal place where I thought,

"okay, I think this has something of value."

                  Self-Regulation Strategies: Feel Your Best Self

      Feel Your Best Self (FYBS) is a unique partnership between the Collaboratory on School
   and Child Health (CSCH) and the Ballard Institute and Museum of Puppetry at the
   University of Connecticut. The collaboration was initiated during the COVID-19 pandemic
   to address the emotional challenges schools, children, and their caregivers faced. Pairing
   collective expertise in educational psychology and puppetry, the team designed fun,
   engaging ways to learn simple strategies to calm yourself, catch your feelings, and
   connect with others. The initial response was overwhelmingly positive, with the project
   evolving synergistically into the complete FYBS toolkit.

ZONES OF REGULATION

Ms. Kuypers: The Zones of Regulation is a framework for thinking, and it comes packaged up in a curriculum.
This is a systematic approach to classifying all the different feelings and states, levels of arousal, and energy.

   The curriculum has four zones that help us make this abstract, emotional world more systematic. Essentially
what we're feeling inside, we're giving or assigning to a zone. Once we can recognise our emotions and the
corresponding zone, we can identify tools that support regulating that zone.

   The red zone is that very heightened level of arousal, those intense, overwhelming emotions. Sometimes
red zone emotions can be positive but intense like when we're elated our sports team won the state
championship, it's a big, exuberant experience.

   The yellow zone is elevated emotions. Emotions have intensified, but there's some cognitive control in the
yellow zone. Some feelings in this zone might be worried, silly, excited, wiggly, irritated, or overwhelmed.
37                                                                        DAYNA SCHIMKE

   The green zone is when we're more controlled, an organised state where we might be happy, calm, and
focused.

   Then there's the blue zone. The blue zone is the lower arousal levels, those down, feelings like sad, sick,
tired, or bored.

   This systematic approach to emotional awareness and regulation gives a visual structure and helps ease
communication. As part of the curriculum, we learn about our emotions, and we talk about what zone it falls
into. Then when we do get in those less regulated states, we can point to the zone we're in or use the colour
to identify the zone and efficiently communicate our emotions to others. This allows the adults to co-regulate
with the student and support them in finding the tools that help regulate that emotion.

                 The Zones of Regulation: Free Resources

                             The Zones of Regulation provides a common language and compassionate framework to support
    positive mental health and skill development for all while serving as an inclusion strategy for neurodiverse learners,
    those who have experienced trauma, and have specific needs in terms of social, emotional, and behavioural
    development. Click or scan the QR code to access the free resources from the Zones of Regulation website.

Dr. Krishnamoorthy: What's good about the zones is that it's a helpful tool for all students. It covers the

spectrum of students without singling out just the challenging students.

    Ms. Kuypers: We all work on emotional regulation all the time. Emotional regulation is an ongoing life skill for

all of us. There's not an adult among us who doesn't

have some reflection after they've been dysregulated       Emotional regulation is an ongoing
and thought, "that didn't work out so well for me. I need                        life skill for all of us.
to work on that." The reality is that we get stressed and

overwhelmed as adults. We get angered and worried

and don't always manage those emotions as well as we want to.

    The zones are something that I initially designed for my students who had special needs - those with neural

biological impairments. I think the reach is far beyond just those students, though, because all students are
learning this, and many adults are using it. I find many adults familiar with the framework talk in the colours
of the zones to their colleagues. They'll say, "I'm in the yellow right now" or "oh, I was getting close to the red
zone" it's just simple language, and it's a way to co-regulate even as adults.

KEY STRATEGIES

Ms. Kuypers: The programme works a lot at helping students build emotional awareness in a very user-friendly

way. I find the colours and language around the zones make it tangible for people to implement, use and adapt

to their cognitive style. There are four colours, and many students find it simple and easy to grasp. Teachers,

therapists, and parents also use it as it feels approachable for them.

We're not going to be able to use a tool to regulate ourselves if we don't first have the awareness that we're

in a less regulated state. A lot goes into building that self-awareness and recognising when we're dysregulated

and moving into a different zone.

                                                Another positive is that the zones are intended to be

                                    different emotions. Therefore, we share all these

different zones are okay. It's our job to work on recognising our zone or feelings and find healthy ways to

manage them.

BARRIERS TO IMPLEMENTATION

Dr. Krishnamoorthy: What barriers have you come across for the teachers and the schools when they attempt
to adopt a framework like this?

   Ms. Kuypers: Teachers have so much on their plate already, and they have increased pressure to have high-
performing test scores from their students that it can feel like this is one more thing they must be doing.
If teachers set aside a little time upfront each day to teach, the zones can then just be embedded into the
conversations in the classroom. This helps remove the added pressure of it being something extra to teach.

   The zones framework helps stressed teachers manage their classrooms as it gives a visual structure to
support the students learning. Teachers can overlay the zones in their academic instructions. Students can use
the characters they're reading about, and discuss what zone they may fall in, and what tools would help them
move between the zones. Also, if they're teaching written expression, they could choose a topic on the zones
and have the students do their written expression around that topic.
39                                                                                     DAYNA SCHIMKE

                                                  The zones framework offers teachers a way to build

                                                  student self-regulation, which helps move that burden

                                                  away from the teacher's shoulders. The students can build

                                                  responsibility in their self-regulation in a non-punitive and

                                                  non-shaming way. It does take some time upfront to put

                                                  the framework in place in the classroom, including

                                                  displaying visuals. Allowing routine time to practise the

                                                  tools, just five minutes from your daily schedule, means you

                                                  will spend much less time managing student conflicts in the

                                                  classroom as the students can regulate themselves.

                                                  Teachers can then use the zone's framework to support

                                                  their students in doing more self-regulation versus teacher-

                                                  Dr. Krishnamoorthy: A common dilemma we've likely

encountered is where teachers feel students with lots of difficulties get a lot of extra support - while other

students miss out. Some teachers find that hard to keep things fair with the other students who don't require

as much support.

    Ms. Kuypers: The zones framework tries to support kids in finding individualised tools that work for them.

Each student has many opportunities for individualising tools within the framework because we want the

students to be empowered to use those tools. I often found myself saying, you need to take a break, you need

to calm down because I thought that was what the student needed. That only worked about half the time,

though. Instead, I learned the students needed to build that self-awareness of what they needed and what

worked for them. That said, some students' tools may involve a little more than others. They might need more

time with their tool or more resources for their strategy to succeed. I also find that the tools we initially work

for a student are often only a starting point. We can still stretch those students to be working towards finding

more adaptive strategies that are less disruptive to the classroom or their learning.

    For example, taking a break and using a calming corner is a tool. This is much less disruptive than lashing out

at another student or destroying property in a school environment. It's a step in the right direction. We also

want students at their desks learning. Our aim over time might be to stretch that student to get to where he

can just put his head down to regulate rather than leave his desk. To go from a student destroying a classroom

to putting their head down to regulate is sometimes too big of a leap at once. So we've got to work towards

that incrementally. It can be encouraging for some teachers to see that when we weigh our options up, taking

a break in a calming space, albeit slightly disruptive, is much better than destroying a classroom.

                  Social-Emotional Learning and Differentiation

      The 2016 Daryl Dugas article, `Group Dynamics and Individual Roles: A Differentiated Approach to Social-Emotional
   Learning', describes a differentiated classroom management approach based on group dynamics that focuses on
   developing group norms and roles. By teaching students about the task and social-emotional roles and positive and
   negative roles, this approach provides venues for constructively talking about student misbehaviours. You may be able
   to access this article through your library.

INCLUSIVE CLASSROOMS

Ms. Kuypers: Part of what we're teaching with the Zones framework is all the Zones are okay and we use tools
to help us regulate it. Although in the green zone we're calm and regulated, we also have tools to support our
TEACHING SELF-REGULATION WITH MS. LEAH KUYPERS                                                                40

green zone. These tools can help maintain the organised sensory state associated with the green zone. Often
they are proactive strategies rather than waiting until we've moved into the yellow, red, or blue zones.

   What can we be doing to support that student in their green zone to keep them in a more regulated state
for longer rather than wait until they're dysregulated? Can we find some green zone tools to support their
sensory needs in the classroom so they can be engaged in the learning while supporting what they need to
stay regulated?

   The zones are also a proactive approach to regulation
rather than a reactive approach. As students get older,
they'll be at the helm of their self-regulation. They must
gain that emotional regulation skill set, so it's not just us
adults in the background trying to be the puppet master
and have everything lined up so we can keep them in a
regulated state.

DATA COLLECTION

Dr. Krishnamoorthy: How do you collect data or check to see

if interventions are effective within the zones curriculum? "Image" by tolmacho is in the Public Domain, CC0

Ms. Kuypers: There is a self-regulation checklist that a

parent can fill out pre- and post-interventions. There's also

a student self-assessment that the students can complete too. In the book itself, there are a lot of

opportunities for the students to be compiling data as they're self-monitoring. By reviewing that self-

monitoring data, we want to see if their day has become more regulated, if they've increased their repertoire

of tools, or if they're using their tools more frequently. By doing this, we can see if the intervention for the

student is effective. Data recording is embedded into the lessons because self-regulation is a complex skill to

measure.

Research shows there isn't an all-encompassing self-regulation tool available and that often we're measuring

sub-skills of self-regulation. We can look at executive functioning, sensory processing, modulation and social

cognition, which are all related to the ability to self-regulate. A standardised tool can measure deficits in those

areas and determine how they retest over time. Still, it's

hard to do when observing self-regulation to see what            it's valuable to have the student

Dr. Krishnamoorthy: You mentioned giving measures to parents to complete. Have you had
any experience with this from a school context and involving parents in the process?
41  DAYNA SCHIMKE

   Ms. Kuypers: Its important students don't go home just talking about colours as parents have no insight into
the programme. They might ask their kids, "what do you mean you're in the red zone"? In the book, there
are reproducible's, and there's a page for parents explaining the programme. A one-page visual can also be
sent home for parents to display. There's also a glossary that can be sent home for parents to understand the
terminology of the programme so they can support their kids with the zones too. I encourage schools to have
a parent training night to welcome parents and give some information on the zones programme and what to
expect.

   Two apps can be used with the programme, which will help engage the students in the zones and help the
parents understand what it's all about. One app is called the `Zones of Regulation', and the other is called
`Exploring Emotions'. The apps are an excellent way to bridge the divide between school and home and help
parents understand what the schools are working on. Then, as students work through the curriculum, we
ensure we send home the work they're putting together so that it can continue to be compiled and extended
at home.

INDIVIDUAL PROGRESS

Dr. Krishnamoorthy: What's your general advice to teachers with students for whom the strategies don't work
immediately or as quickly as other students?

   Ms. Kuypers: Self-regulation is a developmental skill, like learning to walk and talk. Hence, we must be mindful
that many of our students will not be developmentally ready to jump from where they are to where you desire
them to be quick. These students might be 10 to 15 years old chronologically. Still, developmentally, their self-
regulation skills are that of a four-year-old. Because of that, they're not going to make that leap in progress in
half a year like other students with more neurotypical self-regulation developement.

   Rather than working through a new lesson each week, we need to look at each student and see where
they are in the curriculum. Do they need more time for the development of a particular skill? Are they
demonstrating that knowledge? A lot of our students can spout or talk about that knowledge, they describe
about the zones upside down and backward, but are they demonstrating those skills that we're trying to teach?
If a student isn't showing a skill, to layer on another skill before they've mastered the original skill indicates
we are moving too fast, and that student may become resistant. I encourage people to slow down and pace
the instruction based on where the student's skills are. We can ask ourselves, "what are they absorbing and
starting to demonstrate?" "What do we see emerging?" That should give us the clues that they're ready to add
more to this and extend it another step. It's important to acknowledge that this takes time. There is a lot of
effort, and teaching needs to be placed up front when the students are calm and regulated. This will lead to a
payoff down the road when students become dysregulated. I caution people to think if you introduce this (The
Zones), you will see the effects immediately. Rather, it takes time, practice and repetition to see results. Many
students need more intense support and to go at a slow and steady pace to be successful.

CHAPTER SUMMARY

        · The Zones of Regulation is a systematic approach to classifying different feelings, emotional states
            and levels of arousal.

        · There are four Zones of Regulation:
                     Green zone - controlled, organised, calm, regulated, focused
                     Yellow zone - elevated, still have some cognitive control, worries, silly, wiggly, irritated
                     Red zone - very heightened, intense, overwhelming emotions, angry, elated
                     Blue zone - down, sad, tired, sick, bored.

        · Emotional regulation is an ongoing life skill for children and adults.

Conscious Discipline with Dr. Becky Bailey

We live in the age of the brain. With increasing research and knowledge about childhood trauma and its impact
on the brain, we want to know how educators can put this science to use in the classroom. We had the privilege
of speaking with Dr. Becky Bailey about her ground-breaking Conscious Discipline Program.

   Dr. Becky Bailey

                                               Dr. Becky Bailey is an award-winning author, renowned
                                            educator, and internationally recognised expert in
                                            childhood education and developmental psychology. She is
                                            the creator of Conscious Discipline, which has impacted an
                                            estimated 17 million children while inspiring and training
                                            more than 3.5 million educators and caregivers. Conscious
                                            Discipline is practised in over 73 countries with resource
                                            materials offered in 22 languages. Over 2.5 million of Dr.
                                            Bailey's top-selling books are in circulation. With over 35
   years of experience working with the most challenging children, Dr. Bailey deeply believes we must transform the lives
   of adults first and children second.

Dr. Bailey: I've always been a teacher, though growing up, I initially thought I wanted to be a medical doctor.
When I was getting my PhD, I interned at a toddler school. My experience at the toddler school spurred me on
to learn about how the brain works and how we can use optimal environments and strategies to grow to our
maximum potential. I've also had some trauma in my personal life, so that led me to want to be a teacher and
work with marginalised children.

THE CONSCIOUS DISCIPLINE PROGRAM

Dr. Bailey: I'll describe the program in two ways. The official academic description of the program is that it's
a `comprehensive brain-based self-regulation program' that combines social and emotional learning, school
culture and discipline into a systemic whole. Now how I explain it to people in everyday language is that with
Conscious Discipline, we're trying to help people of all ages, adults, and children, be disciplined enough to
set and achieve their goals, despite distractions. That's my definition of discipline. It's not punishment. You're
conscious enough to know you're off track and willing enough, which means you're loved, cared for adequately,
and feel you belong enough to return to your path to living your highest values.

   Dr. Krishnamoorthy: I'm curious about the way you explain discipline. It struck me that it taps into the
concepts of persistence and grit. These attributes don't exist in isolation. You can persist in and have discipline

                                                                                                         43
CONSCIOUS DISCIPLINE WITH DR. BECKY BAILEY               44

with things when you feel cared for, and someone takes an interest in your persistence with the task, in this
case, emotional regulation.

   Dr. Bailey: I believe we need to have `consciousness' to know you're going down the wrong path. For instance,
you can persist, be vigilant, and be a serial killer. The `consciousness' implies we have to have an `integrated
brain' to get to the higher centres of our brain; we need to have space and time for thinking and reflection.
This thinking and reflection is the key to being `conscious'.

   Dr. Ayre: Traditionally, discipline is seen as punishment. discipline is usually seen as something done to
people or children to extinguish a particular behaviour, not to help them learn. In thinking and reflecting, the
element of consciousness is not incorporated into this view.

   Dr. Bailey: Yes, you're right there. I like the quote, "discipline is not something you do to children; it's
something you develop within them". Once you flip that definition, it's a whole different ballgame.

   Dr. Ayre: Several countries and regions have discipline policies within their education systems that include
terms like safe, supportive, and disciplined school environment. However, I'm not convinced that an
explanation of this is adequately communicated or understood. It's usually assumed that all educators
understand these concepts in the same way when they read them in policies, but this is often far from the
truth.

   Dr. Bailey: It's tough for people to change their thoughts about discipline. This change in thinking requires
`transformational change', which means people change their deep-seated beliefs about punishment resulting
in a shift in how they believe it's effective. People may think that if I don't use punishment, I fail my duty as
a parent or teacher. That's a very deep-rooted way people think about punishment and discipline in many
countries and cultures. It's like it's almost in everyone's DNA.

                  Discipline and Child Brain Development

   Bryson, PhD, are the pioneering experts behind The Whole-Brain Child who now explore the
   ultimate child-raising challenge: discipline. Learn more by watching this video of Dr. Siegel and

   parent reacts to misbehaviour [6:10]. Click or scan the QR code to start watching.

TRAUMA SENSITIVE PRACTICE

Dr. Krishnamoorthy: How would you define trauma-sensitive practices and describe this in the school context?
   Dr. Bailey: If you understand how the brain works, what helps the brain develop optimally, and what inhibits

its development, the question becomes how do we support optimal growth, even through trauma? Schools
I see in the United States, regardless of the program they use, the ones with a better understanding of the
brain and the emotional states we experience have a better understanding of how to manoeuvre from one
emotional state to another. I don't think you can get to that understanding without being trauma sensitive. I
believe that that's almost a by-product of being trauma-sensitive, even if it's unintentional.

   Once you get a defensive brain, a brain geared for protection, instead of an engaging brain, many strategies
are like trauma-sensitive practices in how to help a student drop that defence. Dropping those adaptive skills
for that defensive brain are very similar regardless of the specific traumas the child has experienced. There
are specific strategies you can use when you learn about traumas, but that starts to move into a mental health
or psychology focus rather than a trauma-sensitive focus in education. A teacher needs this basic information
about trauma all the time. It should be in every university and be bound together with education. My PhD is
in education and developmental psychology, and I never could understand how we separated any of that to
begin with, and that was back in 1970. I completed my PhD in 1979, so I was trying to combine things people
hadn't thought about yet.

   Dr. Ayre: What a challenging, groundbreaking perspective to question. Why separate education and
developmental psychology in the first place? Even today, we still separate developmental psychology and
education training.

   Dr. Bailey: That's what led me to leave the university system. I thought we've got to go a different route in
teaching children with trauma. Twenty years ago, `trauma-sensitive' didn't exist in the United States. Sadly,
I've also discovered that we have people following the money. For the last 15 years, I've been pushing a ball
uphill regarding trauma-sensitive practices. Just in the previous five or six years, it's starting to catch on. Big
educational companies are making kits, putting a little puppet in a couple of videos and showing a 30-minute
presentation to teachers and staff about how we need to be respectful to children in schools. Then those same
teachers are screaming at the children the next day to shut up and behave, so it's a difficult journey and, as
mentioned, hard to change those deep-seated beliefs.

BRAIN DEVELOPMENT

Dr. Krishnamoorthy: Are there any essential things you believe teachers should know about brain development
in children, particularly in times of stress?

   Dr. Bailey: In the Conscious Discipline program, I use a very simple brain model, yet accurate enough to
teach how our brain works, especially under stress. Then I teach what `safe enough' means from a teacher's
perspective. Our brain needs safety, connection, and the ability to problem solve because we have social

brains. When we work with typically developing children, in other words, with an engaged brain, teachers need

to think about how to keep the student emotionally safe. We don't want teachers thinking about how to make

the student behave but how to keep the student safe enough to learn.

Children with a defensive brain are generally unfamiliar with what `safe' is as a concept and a feeling. They are

unfamiliar with being `safe' in any biological, neurological, or psychological way as their life has not been safe.

If you imagine flipping the brain over, you can reach those kids by connecting with the emotional part of the

brain. The goal is to build a relationship with the student with a defensive brain. To do this, you must develop a

relationship with this student through their successes. The more you can notice their success or achievements,

any achievements, including from activities outside the classroom they enjoy doing, like skateboarding or

fishing. The more you use those activities to notice their success, it will help you get the connection with the

student, and from that connection, build a relationship and move into safety. When we understand that a

developing brain is geared to adapt to keep children safe, not to learn reading or writing, we can learn to flip it

over to establish a connection. Our goal then becomes how do we reach a relationship resisted child who will

push you away at any given time?

Children who feel like they are defending against life tell

you through their behaviours that they're going to shut

down or use their fight or flight response. We start with

noticing anything they do successfully. Noticing means not

judging, not saying, "you did this well", "you held that door

open so Kevin could come in, way to be helpful". You must

start with their name and then describe what they did,

noticing the success. For example, you're very good at

skateboarding; you draw beautiful pictures, let's hang them

up and show everybody; what a great song you sang, you

shared your talent with us by singing something that

touched my heart. The noticing is the conscious part of it,

helping the students become aware of their success. Once

you can do that, you need to find something in common

with the child to strengthen that relationship. It could be

basketball, rugby, dogs, whatever it is that child enjoys, but

you have to have it in common. You can't fake it. You can't

say, oh, this student likes basketball, so now I'm going to "Image" by GingerMarie12 is in the Public Domain, CC0

must find something you and that student have in common

to make that connection. It's like when you go to a cocktail party, you're standing around, and you don't know

anybody, and suddenly someone says, oh, I've been to Florida, and you say, oh my gosh, I live in Florida! That's

where your defences drop, there's a breakthrough moment, and you connect with that other person. That's

what you want to create with that student through that

common interest.                                                   Teachers must be very present in

you can make eye contact and connect through touch.

Teachers must be very present in that moment of play

and create positive interactions with the child, including eye contact and touch. That's how we start changing

that defensive brain through a safe relationship.

CHAPTER SUMMARY

· Conscious Discipline is a `comprehensive brain-based self-regulation program' that combines social
47  DAYNA SCHIMKE

       and emotional learning, school culture and discipline into a systemic whole.

    · Thinking and reflecting is the key to being `conscious'.

    · Discipline is something to be developed in children; it's not punishment.

    · Trauma-sensitive practices include being aware of how the brain typically develops, what inhibits
       brain development in children, and the various emotional states we experience.

    · Teachers need to think about how to keep a student emotionally safe, not how to make a student
       behave, to get an engaged brain ready to learn academically.

    · Students with trauma or a defensive brain often do not understand or know what feeling `'safe'' is.

    · Disruptive students in classrooms who lose control offer an opportunity for all students in that
       classroom to regulate and learn social-emotional skills.

    · Relationships between adults in charge of a family affect a child's ability to self-regulate more than
       the adult-to-child relationship itself. In schools, this means teachers and other staff must have
       positive relationships and support each other to regulate to affect the students in the school in the
       same way.

Preventing Challenging Behaviours with Dr. Laura
Riffel

Educators are among the most critical influence on a child. Still, it's no secret that managing behaviour
issues in the classroom are what teachers struggle with most. Children's emotional and life challenges can
create problem behaviours that may seem complex. But when a student's behaviours are monitored and
evaluated correctly, educators can discover the appropriate intervention to modify the problem behaviour.
The modifications made in a classroom can set a child up for success or failure. But are some children simply
too challenging to respond to such classroom modifications?

   Dr. Laura Riffel

                                               Dr. Laura Riffel has more than 40 years of experience. She
                                            has trained thousands of teachers, parents, counsellors,
                                            psychologists, administrators and even bus drivers on how
                                            to make data-based decisions to change behaviour. Dr.
                                            Riffel began her career volunteering at the school for the
                                            blind, which led to her love of children and special
                                            education. She has taught pre-kindergarten through to
                                            adults in general and special education. Now retired from
                                            public education, she presents seminars worldwide on
   behaviour at the universal, targeted, and intensive levels.

CHALLENGING BEHAVIOUR AND BEHAVIOUR SUPPORT

Dr. Riffel: On reflection, there are two things in my career I'm most proud of. The first is a statewide program
called the Behavioural Intervention Programme, where we had five full-time behaviour therapists. If you had
a student who had challenging behaviour, you could contact us for free. One of our behaviour therapists
would then come to your location and help you figure out the function behind the child's behaviour. Once
the function was identified, the therapist would help you devise a plan to modify that behaviour. It didn't
matter if you were a parent, a daycare centre, a school or a residential setting. We would come and support
you in modifying that challenging behaviour. We could have served many more children than we did, but I
had to keep the numbers manageable for the behavioural therapists doing that work. While my staff were
out doing the Behavioural Intervention Program, I ran a day clinic for the children with the most severe
behaviours, where we brought the kids into the clinic to work with them. We were very successful at being able
to transition them back into their home or school and restabilise them after that transition. Then we would

                                                                                                         48
49  DAYNA SCHIMKE

reverse integrate a class around this highly trained team of teachers we had worked with to ensure the return
transition was successful.

   The second thing I'm very proud of is that my husband, I, and our whole family, chose to live with an adult
who had autism. Let's call him Jay. Jay, wanted to live independently, and they needed housemates to make
that happen. When my husband and I became empty nesters, and our kids were in college, we didn't like the
empty nest syndrome, so we asked Jay's parents if we could live with Jay. We loved it so much that we decided
to live with Jay until we needed to live in a nursing home. Unfortunately, Jay passed away in 2009 due to a
sudden heart attack. He was the best teacher we ever had as he taught me what it's like to live with a disability
and how to build a quality life for that person.

   Another driving force was when I was in kindergarten. My mother had to take me to school every day
and drop me off; one day, she didn't come back and get me, which was quite scary for a five-year-old child.
Eventually, my grandmother came and picked me up, she was nervous and upset about something, and when
we got home, my mom was crying. She kept repeatedly saying, "if only I'd said hold on". She was beside herself.
What had happened was my mother had dropped me off that morning at kindergarten. As she was driving
away, my little two-year-old brother opened up the car door as she was going around the corner, and she said
the words, "don't let go". What my brother heard was "let go". We didn't have seatbelts or car seats in the fifties,
so he just fell out of the car while she was driving.

   My mother internalised this accident as her fault. She believed if she had said `don't let go' differently, it
might not have happened. It made her analyse her parenting, and she realised that kids don't hear the first
word, like don't, stop, quit, etc., that are spoken. They hear the last words. From that point forward, my mother
changed her parenting style, and she told us she wouldn't tell us what not to do, but here's what I want you
to do instead. Years later as a teacher, I heard about this thing schools were trying called Positive Behaviour
Intervention and Supports (PBIS), and they said, we're going to tell the kids what to do instead of what not to
do, and that just made so much sense to me, and I jumped right on that bandwagon!

                  A Trauma-informed Approach to Positive Behaviour Support

      Positive Behavioural Interventions and Supports (PBIS) provides an effective multi-
   tiered framework for incorporating the knowledge about childhood trauma into an
   established system of support, rather than focusing on trauma as a separate and
   perhaps competing initiative.

      Following the Interconnected Systems Framework (ISF) process for integrating PBIS
   and school mental health into a single system (Eber et al., 2019), trauma-informed
   practices become part of one multi-tiered continuum of support, benefitting from the
   structures that contribute to efficiency and effectiveness. Learn more by watching this

THE TEACH, IMPRINT, PRACTICE AND PRAISE (TIPP) METHOD

Dr. Riffel: We can't hold kids accountable for behaviours if we haven't taught them what those behaviours look
PREVENTING CHALLENGING BEHAVIOURS WITH DR. LAURA RIFFEL                                                    50

like, sound like and feel like. So I talk to people about

what I term the TIPP (teach, imprint, practice, praise)          We can't hold kids accountable for
method.                                                             behaviours if we haven't taught

   You have to Teach the behaviour you want to see.               them what those behaviours look
You can't just say, "be good". You've got to teach what                   like, sound like and feel like.
you expect. For example, this is what I mean by being

respectful, responsible and prepared or whatever your

focus is. Then you have to Imprint it by modelling. That's the I in TIPP. So often, the schools that I work with will

have the words up on the wall, be respectful to your teachers. Still, in the hallway, kids are overhearing things

being said that are not very respectful about teachers or each other. We've got to imprint it by modelling what

we want to see for the kids, and then we must practice it with them.

Practice is the first P in TIPP. If we want to talk about behaviour on the bus, we need to bring a bus out to

the school and show them what that behaviour looks, sounds, and feels like on that bus.

Then the last P in my TIPP is to Praise approximations when you see them. Generally, people don't really

like that one because they think kids should do it because they should do it. But how do you know what's

extrinsic value or intrinsic value? If you are not extrinsically motivated to behave a certain way, you will unlikely

internalise this behaviour or expectation. If you think about a baby learning how to walk, people clap and

cheer, and the baby knows he's on to something and must keep doing it.

Once you learn to walk, you walk everywhere. Nobody claps or cheers because you internalised that that was

an excellent way to get around. And you'll know that a child has internalised that value or behaviour because

if you compliment them, they'll go, "oh, that's okay, it was just the right thing to do". When children move to

internalise these behaviours, we call that the universal level.

                                                        Then there are the kids who need `booster shots' or tier-

                                                        two interventions. These children need a reminder: "now

                                                        remember, before we go out in the hallway, where do our

                                                        hands and feet need to be?" Or maybe you have a secret

                                                        signal with a student. For instance, I had a child who had

                                                        ADHD and was very hyperactive. Sometimes his

                                                        hyperactivity would be very disruptive to all the kids around

                                                        him. He and I had a secret signal that if I tugged on my ear,

                                                        he needed to check himself and ensure he wasn't bothering

                                                        someone around him. Only he and I knew that secret signal,

                                                        and he wasn't singled out because he needed extra

                                                        support. It was like a tier-two intervention because his

"Image" by AbsolutVision is in the Public Domain, CC0   individual booster shot helped him. He got the universal

                                                        support, everybody gets those, but on top of that, he also

had a little tier two booster shot. Teachers often do these things naturally and don't even realise they're doing

a tier two intervention. Then there's a minimal number of students who need those tier three interventions

that are more intensive.

We once made a video with a student of what `raising your hand' and `waiting to be called on in class's sounds

like and feels like. In this example, we included the parents and asked them to show the video at home before

the student came to school each day, and then we gave him booster shots during the day and little reminders

of what he needed to do. Then at night, when the child goes home, the parent might ask, "how did you do

today remembering to raise your hand and waiting to be called on"? Another intervention, for that example,

might include the teacher wearing a bright red bracelet on their wrist. Every time they want students to raise

their hands, the teacher holds up their hands with that bright red bracelet. Previously though, they've taught

that child in private to tune in to that red bracelet.

Dr. Ayre: What a great visual reminder for students. It doesn't single any child out. You've taught the student

previously to tune in to it.

Dr. Riffel: Students need environmental cues to help them, and we could use various things. For example,

they could wear a watch that vibrates every 15 minutes, which reminds them to check in on themselves. They
51                                                                                                DAYNA SCHIMKE

could use a tracking sheet where they make a tally of the things they're working on, for example, each time
they're out of their seat or wandering around. Nobody else knows that the student has this plan to help them
be successful. Environmental cues are everywhere. For example, when we board a plane, no matter how many
times we've flown before, the flight attendant stands in the middle of the aisle and holds up a seat belt and
says, "you insert the flat end into the buckle, to release the seat belt you lift the buckle". The first time I heard
that I thought, well, that's ridiculous, that's a seat belt. Then after they go through that little spiel about the
seatbelt, they say they cannot take off until everybody has their seatbelt fastened. The flight attendant then
walks down the aisle, leans over and says, "please buckle your seat belt" or "I'm sorry that your building's
burning down, but you need to get off your telephone, so we can take off". Such different levels of support,
they're alive and well everywhere. At school, we talk about different levels of support, and if you start looking
at the world around you, they're alive and well everywhere you go. It's no surprise that children need help and
support as they learn, while adults in the world need the same intensive support.

                  Trauma-Informed Social Emotional Learning

       Social and emotional learning is about learning how to control & express feelings, manage
    friendships and solve problems. Children who have developed social and emotional skills and
    it easier to manage themselves, relate to others, resolve conflict, and feel positive about
    themselves and the world around them. This guide is designed to be a comprehensive
    collection of trauma-informed SEL strategies, activities and resources.

THINKING FUNCTIONALLY ABOUT BEHAVIOUR

Dr. Ayre: What key elements of thinking functionally about behaviour are essential for teachers to know and

utilise in their classroom?

    Dr. Riffel: We first need to help everybody understand that they don't need to do something immediately

unless a child is in danger. We need to learn how to take a deep breath and think about that behaviour. That's

the hardest thing in understanding and learning what

to do. We know this behaviour is happening for a      We need to learn how to take a deep
reason. It's communication. This student is                       breath and think about that
communicating something to me somewhere, and                                                behaviour.
somehow, someone has taught them, usually

inadvertently, that this behaviour has a particular

payoff. It's like learning the child's secret code and figuring out what this child wants.

    What I teach to teachers, and even to veteran teachers who've been teaching for a long time, is that there

are three things that children might be trying to get. Firstly, they might be trying to get attention. Secondly,

they might be trying to get access to a preferred item or a preferred activity. Lastly, they might be trying to

gain sensory input. Sensory input is something we don't talk much about at the service level, and it's enormous

with us as adults and with children. Often when you are teaching college classes, you'll look out and see people

giving themselves proprioceptive input (see video below to learn more about proprioception and sensory

modulation). That is, they are fidgeting and fiddling with things, or they're doodling on their paper to be able

to sit and pay attention effectively. We must understand that we haven't taught kids how to get that sensory

input in a socially appropriate way. Those are the things that kids are sometimes trying to get.
PREVENTING CHALLENGING BEHAVIOURS WITH DR. LAURA RIFFEL  52

                  The Proprioceptive System and Sensory Modulation

      Proprioception is the process by which the body can vary muscle contraction in immediate
   response to incoming information regarding external forces, by utilizing stretch receptors in
   the muscles to keep track of the joint position in the body. Proprioception, also often referred
   to as the sixth sense, was developed by the nervous system as a means to keep track of and
   control the different parts of the body.

   proprioceptive system [4:36].

Children also communicate through behaviour things that they might be trying to avoid, such as schoolwork. It
might be because the work is too tricky or because they are dealing with something emotional and cannot take
on new information at the moment. They might be trying to avoid attention. Usually, this attention is from the
adults because they will ask them to do something they might not feel comfortable doing. They also might be
trying to avoid other children, and that might be because their mom doesn't do laundry as frequently as most
moms do. They had to wear dirty clothes; they know they smell a little and don't want to get around other kids
because they smell. It's like playing detective, and we're always trying to decipher what a child's behaviour is
telling us.

   Children can also have challenging behaviour because they're trying to avoid emotional or physical pain,
especially young children or children who don't use words. They don't have enough words to explain the pain
they're feeling. They don't want shirts that say mom and dad had a huge fight last night, or we got kicked out
of our apartment, and our furniture is on the front lawn, and I don't know where I'm sleeping tonight.

   The last thing children might be trying to avoid is too
much sensory input. I always find it amazing how many
people are bothered by noise. We'll talk about different
little noises, and I get teachers to imagine hearing that one
noise that drives you over the edge but ten times louder.
For some children, too much noise can make it difficult to
attend, concentrate and learn, so they may try to avoid
situations or environments that are overly noisy. I often
hear from teachers that children are just behaving in a
particular way to get attention. I want to tell you that it is
vital for everybody to remember that it's true that children
do want attention, but we need to understand why. As a
society, we've decreased time spent together in the same "Image" by Denise Perrier is in the Public Domain, CC0
space by about 63 per cent. During the 1950s, we
frequently sat at the dining room table as a family. Only rich people had television sets then, and if they had a
TV, they only had one, so we had a lot of face-to-face time with our family. We played outside more, hugged
each other more, and dug in the ground like we were searching the other side of the world and all those
physical play activities. As a result, we made and received eye contact with others and got their attention.

   In today's society, we'll go to a restaurant to eat, and eight people will sit together at a table. Yet you look
over, and all eight people look at their phones rather than interacting. Kids are desperate for eyeballs and
attention. If we give them attention before they start seeking it, we'll avoid the problematic behaviours children
53                                                                                                 DAYNA SCHIMKE

use to gain the missing attention. This is the proactive

part that I want teachers to utilise in their classrooms.         If we give them attention before
   I've found with the teachers that I've worked with, if    they start seeking it, we'll avoid the
                                                            problematic behaviours children use

hour or every time they come back to class at the                     to gain the missing attention.
elementary level, every hour for secondary, I tell them

to do TUMS (touch, use their name, make eye contact,

smile).

    Consistently throughout the day, we need to Touch, give them a high five or a handshake; Use their name in

a positive way, for instance, "how is P.E. Charmaine?" or "glad to see you today, Ferris", this shows that you've

taken an interest in them; Make eye contact, give it on the front side in a positive way; and then Smile. Because

we're so busy thinking, sometimes we don't think about what we're doing with our faces. Sometimes our faces

don't look very friendly, and kids get most of their information about us from our body language. We need to

make sure we're smiling most of the time. Teachers who have done this have found 45 to 72 percent fewer

disruptions in their classroom, supporting the notion of giving eyeballs or attention on the front side. We've

timed it, and it takes about three minutes, and it's worth the three minutes.

    When you think about how long the disruption of children seeking your attention stops learning, that three

minutes is time well spent. The older the kids are, the more critical it is to give that attention straight away.

Most teenagers' primary mode of communication is texting, so they're not getting the face-to-face feedback

and attention they need for their development. So you see, if we put iPad holders on baby strollers, they will

not get the face-to-face feedback they need for early development. Imagine what that's going to do to those

kids' brains by the time they're teenagers.

    If I could only share one piece of advice with teachers, that would be to be proactive. What's the function of

the behaviour? And what can you put in place before that behaviour has a chance to happen? I think greeting

them at the door will make a world of difference.

                  Observing Behaviour and Thinking Functionally

       Thinking functionally about disruptive student behaviour assumes that behaviour is
    maintained by something in the environment where the behaviour is happening. To find out
    why or the function, we examine the antecedents, the behaviour, and the consequences. That
    is, we watch or observe the behaviour directly and document the A, B and C of that disruptive
    behaviour.

IMPLEMENTATION

Dr. Ayre: I've witnessed several teachers who have seen the value in this form of behaviour support. But when

the school is not supportive, the teachers try to implement these practices in isolation. What advice do you

have for teachers in this situation?

    Dr. Riffel: It is tough to implement behaviour support in isolation, but I tell teachers that success sells. For

example, I know of a fourth-grade teacher who

supports PBS, yet her school is not buying into it too      It is tough to implement behaviour
much. She did everything she knew she was supposed                  support in isolation, but I tell
to do. She created expectations for her classroom,                     teachers that success sells.
taught them, imprinted them by modelling, practised

with the kids, and praised it. Now it's later in the year,
PREVENTING CHALLENGING BEHAVIOURS WITH DR. LAURA RIFFEL                                                      54

and her kids are all still following the expectations. For example, they're supposed to walk on a specific side
of the hall, and they're supposed to have their hands a certain way, they're supposed to stop at the stop
signs when they get to corners and look both ways before they cross the hallway; they're not supposed to go
inside the classroom until the teacher sends them in, that way kids aren't inside a classroom without adult
supervision. All the other teachers' kids are running in the classrooms, past stop signs in the hall, and generally
not following the rules. Yet, at a grade level meeting, another fourth-grade teacher asked, "how come your kids
are doing what they're supposed to be doing and ours aren't?" and this teacher said, "let me tell you about
PBS". She's been able to sell it to the other fourth-grade teachers, and now it's starting to catch on.

   Teachers now see the value in taking the time to do these things rather than saying, "I shouldn't have to do
that. Kids should just know how to behave". To those teachers, I ask, "how's that working out for you?" If it's
working, go ahead, but if it's not working, why not try doing what you see is working well? Remember, success
sells. You just plug along, do what you know is right, and let your kids be the shining example. When I was
teaching a class, I used to tell my kids it was a secret. They couldn't tell anybody else, but the principal liked
me better than everybody, so he always gave me the best kids. The kids just walked around like little angels
because they thought they were the best fish in the school!

   Dr. Ayre: And the kids think they're all special and chosen. That's great!
   Dr. Riffel: It probably wasn't very nice because they were out on the playground thinking they were better
than everyone else. But it did help change their attitude because I told them, "I expect you to be role models,
and kids will rise to that occasion." When the other teachers see that, they'll want to buy in, which used
to happen in the behavioural intervention program often. We would come in and help with one student.
We would support the teachers in looking at the data and determining the behaviour's function. Once that
student's behaviour changed (and everyone in the school knew this kid because of his behaviour), suddenly,
I'd get five referrals from that school. They saw the success and what that one teacher did by collecting the
data and changing things up. That's when I would call the principal and ask if I could come in to do an all-day
training on functional behaviour assessment and teach the whole staff.
   Dr. Ayre: It makes sense to empower all the teachers and
upskill everyone at once.
   Dr. Riffel: Yes! So just remember, success sells. That's how
you'll get the whole school's buy-in.

BEHAVIOUR SUPPORT FOR UNSAFE
BEHAVIOURS

Dr. Ayre: As teachers, we sometimes neglect to look at
ourselves and the contribution of our behaviour and we "Image" by Gerd Altmann is in the Public Domain, CC0

may project all the blame onto the child for the problematic

behaviour.

Dr. Riffel: It's very easy for me to come in and sit back and say the teacher's part of the problem. So I try to

be very delicate in how I see it. It's like we don't notice things about our kids as they are growing up. You didn't

notice how tall they were getting until some distant Aunt visited that hasn't seen them for months and months.

They say, "oh my gosh, you've grown like a weed," and suddenly, you look at your child, and you're like, "oh my

gosh, you're right"! But you're there day to day and don't notice it happening. That same thing happens in the

classroom. We don't realise that some of our actions are causing us pain.

For example, we got a referral for a little girl who was

burping the alphabet. While not the worst thing in the        We don't realise that some of our
world, it was very obnoxious. It made you feel ill and                actions are causing us pain.
was disruptive to the whole class. The teacher who

referred her said she does it all day, every day, and

there was no rhyme or reason to it. We came in and took ten days of data and found that every time there was

a transition, this little girl started burping the alphabet. It happened 20 times in 10 days. About twice a day.
55                                                                           DAYNA SCHIMKE

And every 19 out of 20 times, the teacher ran over and gave her attention every time she burped. Now the

attention was a little bit different each time. Sometimes the teacher would be directive, sometimes, she'd

offer her choice, but it was always the teacher giving her some attention. When we showed the data to the

teacher, I said, "let's think proactively. How can you give the girl attention on the front side to stop that burping

behaviour"? After some thought, we made the little girl Vanna White, and we made her the host of a daily

schedule in the classroom. Vanna White is in a game on TV in the United States, and she's a model who gets

paid millions of dollars to turn the letters over in the game. We made this little girl the spokesperson for the

daily schedule. It made the teacher pull her over and tell her what they were doing next before the transition,

so the little girl would get up and then flip the schedule. She'd flip what was finished backwards and then say,

"class, it's time for reading. Please open your reading books to page 147". That gave the little girl a replacement

behaviour that got her attention on the front side. She only burped one more time, and I believe just to test

the water a little bit.

    We also told the teacher if she burps, ignore it, look the other way, and give attention to another student.

Then as soon as she's quiet, give her attention.

    Another example of teachers causing their own pain is when I worked with a school when I ran the day clinic.

We had a child who, from age three to 11, who had autism and intellectual disabilities and didn't use words to

communicate, jumped up and down for hours a day screaming. At the end of four hours, he would go

horizontal with his mouth open and bite. Every time he did that from three to 11 years old, so for eight years,

the school called mom and said, "Mom, come get your child". What they did without realising it was to cause

their own physical pain. Somebody got bit every day. They inadvertently taught the child that if you scream for

four hours and bite somebody, you get to go home, and that's exactly where this child wanted to be. When we

bought him into the clinic, we padded ourselves up so

that he couldn't hurt us, and I taught everybody in the   They inadvertently taught the child

and we could put our arm up so that he would bite our

thickly padded arm, and we just acted as if nothing happened. We gave him no attention at all. Then I told

mom, "go get a job. I promise you I will never call you to come to get this child because of biting or behaviour

for any reason". I said, "I'll call you and tell you good things, but I'm never going to contact you and ask you to

come to get your child". He stopped biting within three weeks and wasn't showing that behaviour anymore. He

caught on quickly that that behaviour doesn't pay off anymore. He ended up doing all the same work as all the

moderate students. He really was quite brilliant. The teachers had just caused their own pain by sending him

home and accidentally creating a pattern.

KEY CLASSROOM STRATEGIES

Dr. Ayre: Are there any key strategies you would recommend for teachers to use with students whose

behaviour would be red zone behaviour in that tertiary level?

Dr. Riffel: The most effective strategy is to think proactively. When you get home at night, go through the

behaviours that happened and think about these three things I call the triple T's: 1) Trigger - What was the

trigger that set that behaviour in motion? A lot of times, we don't think there is one. If we reflect on an incident,

we can often identify a trigger. We need to know that trigger so we can intervene before the trigger occurs next

time; 2) Target behaviour - What is the behaviour you want to target for change? We used to call this the `bad'

behaviour and the `problem' behaviour. The truth is, though, that makes you think negatively about the child.

Thinking negatively about the child sometimes makes you think you want the child to disappear, when in fact,

we don't want the child to disappear, we want the behaviour to disappear. I call this the trigger in the target; 3)

ImpacT - in a way, it is the consequence of the change

we want. The word consequence confuses people               Thinking negatively about the child
because they think of consequences as punishment                sometimes makes you think you
rather than the impact of something. So those are my
triple Ts. What were they wanting, or what were they      want the child to disappear, when in
getting out of having this behaviour? Sit down at the             fact, we don't want the child to
end of the day, and if you can write those three things
down, you can proactively put a plan in place that'll be  disappear, we want the behaviour to
                                                                                                 disappear.

effective.

You need to put three things in place when considering a plan for any student, and I call them the triple Rs.

The first thing that you have to do is revise the environment to set the student up for success. That might be

the red bracelet you wear or some little secret code you've set up in the background. It might be a particular

worksheet you give the student where you give them double what you want them to do. You then tell them

they can only do half, so they have some autonomy over which problems they do. They're the proactive

environmental strategies that you might implement to help the student succeed.

The second R stands for replace, replace the behaviour. We can't just say don't, stop, quit, or no. We've got to

teach students what we want them to do instead. For example, teaching a student that when you're feeling all

bouncy, and you feel like you need to get up and run around the room, here's a stretchy band we're going to

put on the two front legs of your chair. Please put your feet on it and bounce your feet when you feel the need

to get up and run around. This gives the student some replacement behaviour that will help them proactively

with what they need or want to do or provide the input they seek.

The last R is to reframe our response. This one's the hardest to do and the one we hate the most. Suppose

we haven't taught the student a replacement behaviour. In that case, we can't be angry with them for running

around the room because we haven't taught them what to do instead. If teachers could use the triple T and

triple R approach to intervention, it would help those kids in the red zone, which in turn will help you go home

at night feeling much more relaxed. I like to tell teachers, let's take one behaviour and focus on that. If you can

get that one behaviour under control, what happens is a lot of the other behaviours disappear.

Dr. Ayre: It's like a domino effect.

Dr. Riffel: It really is, so don't try to focus on all eight behaviours that you want to change. What is the one

behaviour that would make your life better if it went away? Start your journey in helping the student there -

small goals and small steps quickly lead to big changes.

    · Behaviour is communication. Students may be trying to get to something or away from something,
       or seeking sensory input by using problematic behaviour.

    · Use TUMS as a proactive means of giving attention; Touch, use their name in a positive way, make
       eye contact & smile.

       behaviour; Reframe your response.

Trauma Informed Social-Emotional Learning with
Professor Maurice Elias

There have long been debates on the inclusion of social-emotional skills in the school curriculum. Some say
life skills and competencies are the responsibility of parents and carers. In contrast, others advocate for the
education of the whole child. The pressures of adhering to curriculums and preparing for standardised testing
has meant educators have had to be creative in meeting students' different learning and social needs. Is this
possible, or are we asking too much of our teachers?

   Professor Maurice Elias

                                               Professor Maurice Elias works in the Department of

Prof. Elias: My training is as a clinical psychologist. In my work, primarily with children and families, I noticed
the importance of social-emotional factors in everything that happens. I was drawn increasingly toward the
prevention side of things. I also found myself very interested in what happens when kids are in school. This
is where kids spend such a vast proportion of their lives. It seemed to me that many of the difficulties that
kids were encountering and the routes to improving their lives took place in schools. About 40 years ago,
I devoted my career to working directly in schools and understanding how schools promoted kids' social-
emotional needs. My early career work was with kids with severe behavioural and emotional difficulties. Again,
these are the kids whose social-emotional competencies are critical.

   When I was doing a practicum placement during my training in graduate school, I would sit in the staff
room, and no one would notice me or talk to me. Still, I could hear everything they were saying. It was like I
had a Harry Potter cloak of invisibility, and everyone was complaining about `if the school would do this and
if only the school would do that. If only the school had been doing this'. Listening to everything they were
saying, I would often think that there was no reason these things can't happen. Then as I was seeing clinical

                                                                                                         59

cases, it became clear how often kids were being ill-served by what was happening in their schools and, of
course, sometimes in their homes and communities. That experience drew me much more working toward
strengthening schools to be a positive influence on the lives of children.

IMPORTANCE OF SOCIAL-EMOTIONAL SKILLS AND COMPETENCIES

Dr. Krishnamoorthy: How do you define social-emotional skills and competencies, and why do you think they're

important for teachers and schools to work on?

Prof. Elias: I view social-emotional competencies to be

a lot like oxygen in that they are essential for life. We                      I view social-emotional
are social beings, and virtually everything we do          competencies to be a lot like oxygen
involves other people. We are not islands of
independence; therefore, we exercise our social-                in that they are essential for life.

emotional skills from birth. From the moment kids

learn how to cry - to get their parent's attention - all the way through to the end of life. Our ability to interact

with other people is an essential life skill. We need to learn to manage and recognise our emotions, work in

groups, and be good problem solvers. These are things that are foundational to being a human.

One analogy that I like to talk about is reading. Of the many critical academic skills, I think we would agree

that if you don't know how to read, your life will be far more difficult than otherwise. My analogy is that if you

don't know how to read people, your life will be far more difficult than it otherwise could be. So, I view social-

emotional competencies as integral to life's success.

Dr. Krishnamoorthy: We hear a lot from teachers and

others who attend our training, asking `when did social-

emotional skills become the work of teachers?' Shouldn't

this be the work of parents and families? How would you

respond to this?

Prof. Elias: If we reflect on the teachers that we valued

most, that were most influential on us growing up, we will

mostly conclude that the social-emotional aspects of those

teachers made the difference to us. When I think about why

we go into education, the answer is typically not to help kids

get test scores perfect but because we want to touch the

lives of children. We want to touch their hearts and souls

and help make their lives better. To do that, we must Image by by Gerd Altmann is in the Public Domain, CC0

may not feel that way, and I quite honestly feel bad for their students, but it's not an either/or, it's a both. We

can improve our student's academic competencies and skills while not losing sight of the human element that

                                                       will enable them to use their skills for good.

be miserable.

    What we find in the data is that your instructional time increases as you develop the kid's social-emotional

skills in the classroom. You have an increased positive atmosphere for deeper discussion. You get better

listening, better questioning, and better thinking. So, teachers should not feel that somehow parents have the

province for creating decent human beings. It's a collective enterprise. I tell school administrators that even

if you hate children and only want high test scores, you should still be interested in their social-emotional

competence because if they don't have that, it's tough for them to excel academically.

    I think we have to acknowledge that social emotional skill development is not a meaningful part of most

teachers' training and preparation, so we can't be naive and think that just because it's important, you can just

do it. That's not the case. Teachers need guidance and support to do this. Not tremendously, because teachers

mostly know kids. They know about child development and have wonderful pedagogical techniques. Mobilising

all that in the service of social-emotional skill learning and building positive character takes support and some

resources. I don't want folks to think that somehow, they should just do it. But it is something that taking the

time to do and learn has tremendous payoffs.

THE VALUES, VIRTUES AND CHARACTER FRAMEWORK

Dr. Krishnamoorthy: Why is it important to be explicit about your values as a teacher?
   Prof. Elias: In past years, our work has focused on school environments - primarily urban environments and

with children of colour. We also focused on children from families living in poverty. Poverty is itself a chronic
source of trauma. Some of these kids have experienced intense violence; they have incarcerated parents, and
there's a whole litany of detrimental things. We have found that when these kids walk into the school building,
they are not first interested in finding out about the great books or in hearing about the ancient history of
something.
TRAUMA INFORMED SOCIAL-EMOTIONAL LEARNING WITH PROFESSOR MAURICE ELIAS                                              62

   They are looking to walk into an environment in which
they are welcomed. Where they are valued and cherished.
We have seen that the concept of positive purpose is an
essential anchor in working with traumatised kids.

When you've experienced trauma,
it's as if your moorings have been
ripped away.

When you've experienced trauma, it's as if your moorings

have been ripped away. It's as if the ground under your feet

is not stable. It's the fact that when you go home, you don't "Image" by Gerd Altmann is in the Public Domain, CC0
know what's going to happen, but you suspect it's not going

to be good. Then when you come into the school. If you also

don't know what's going to happen and you've come to expect it's not going to be good, this leaves you in an

awful place mentally. We want our kids to feel that they've come to a school where their sense of positive

purpose is recognised, valued and supported. You

support a positive purpose in part by building kids'                We want our kids to feel that
social-emotional competencies. Still, the question then  they've come to a school where their
is toward what end? We've identified five virtues that
we believe are essential for trauma-informed                           sense of positive purpose is
education.                                                  recognised, valued and supported.

The first virtue is `optimistic future mindednesses'.

We've got a lot of kids who've lived in a trauma context. We're worried that another trauma will happen, or

they're in a context of chronic trauma like poverty and have no sense that things will get better. When we've

done surveys of some of these kids, we found in one middle school that we work in that 50 percent of the kids

said that they don't believe they're going to have a healthy, happy life in the future. If I don't believe I will have

a healthy, happy life in the future, I won't be too motivated to learn calculus, chemistry, or anything else. We

have to help kids develop this optimistic future-mindedness. This is more than just a growth mindset. This is

willing to see themselves in the future positively, and that's not a simple thing. It is vital.

The second virtue is `compassionate forgiveness and gratitude'. We've got a lot of kids we work with who've

had bad things happen to them in their life, and they blame people for it. I don't blame them for blaming

people for it, but they hold grudges. Holding a grudge is the surest way of keeping yourself stuck in the

situation you're in. Compassionate forgiveness and gratitude are about giving the kids the virtue of being able

to accept what's happened, as bad as it is, and to be able to move on. If our kids can't move on, then they sit

in our classes, consumed with thoughts of revenge and an `oh, poor me' mindset. We need to teach kids about

forgiveness, the power of forgiveness, and the power of gratitude to open up their hearts.

Once these kids can forgive and open their hearts a little, we must engage them in the third virtue, `generosity'.
It may seem paradoxical, but we have found that many of our traumatised kids come to feel that they have
very little value. They are also the recipients of a lot of remediation. I don't know about you, but when I get
up in the morning, I don't open up my window, take a deep breath of fresh air and say, oh, I can't wait to
have remediation experiences today. This is not what I'm looking forward to, but this is the life of many of our
kids. So we ask the question, how do we help our kids feel generous? How do we help them feel that they
have something to offer? They are motivated to learn and improve their social-emotional skills and academic
knowledge when they think they have something to offer. So helpful generosity is another very essential virtue.

   The fourth virtue is `constructive creativity'. Our kids who are traumatised need to be able to think out of the
box. In fact, when you look to the future, the future belongs to the creative thinkers. The innovators. We need
them to think creatively and nurture their creativity. We need them to develop that sense that I may not have
these traditional skills, but I have something to offer.

   The fifth and final virtue of `responsible diligence'. This is not simply grit. It's more than grit. Responsible
diligence is the idea that our kids will set goals and work toward them despite setbacks. We want our kids to
be responsibly diligent. The sad truth is that our troubled kids often have to work twice as hard to get half as
far. This is sad and unfair, but it's the reality. If they're not imbued with encouragement to keep going despite
difficulties, they will probably not persist. We need them to be able to persist. Hence, from our perspective, a
set of virtues is required for kids to achieve a positive purpose, which motivates them to develop their skills.
This is particularly the case with kids who are involved in both acute and chronic forms of trauma.

Dr. Krishnamoorthy: I'm interested to understand how this gets taught and what it looks like. Can you give
an example of how this looks in the classroom? And does this influence disciplinary action? One of the
problems we often have is that schools and teachers can be overly accommodating to students' difficulties.
The students then do not have very challenging learning experiences. Or it goes the other way where teachers
have unrealistically high expectations, and it becomes and feels very punitive to the student.
TRAUMA INFORMED SOCIAL-EMOTIONAL LEARNING WITH PROFESSOR MAURICE ELIAS                                     64

Prof. Elias: This links back to the issue of bullying, where we expect individual students to somehow stand

up for bullying when they see it. This is an unrealistic expectation unless it's the norm unless we create a

whole school that is designed to be a supportive learning organisation. When that happens, it's easier for the

classroom to reflect those norms. When that doesn't happen, then the classroom is, in essence, creating a

normative island that becomes a little harder to sustain.

All learning is cumulative. The key for the individual teacher is to be very clear about the positive, supportive

classroom norms and identify and exercise the student's strengths. This is where we have high expectations,

which are not inappropriate. Still, the problem is that we set high expectations for the areas where kids need

the most assistance, which is not helpful. Then when we are lenient in the areas where the kids are weakest,

that's not helpful because we need our kids to excel. Working through our kids' strengths allows us to have

areas where we set high expectations so kids can feel competent. Then when they feel competent, they can

take on the challenges of the areas where they're not so good.

      Similarly, having low expectations of the kids doesn't do them any

      favours. We do have to recognise that we can't expect them to go

      from point A to point Z without all the intervening steps. We must

      be thoughtful about how we scaffold our expectations for the kids.

      Part of this is the incentive systems that our teachers must operate

      under. Sometimes they may feel, not inappropriately, that they're

      being asked to do miracles. They're being asked to move children

      along in developmentally impossible ways, as opposed to moving

      them along like a relay race, where the key to success is not just how

"Image" by productionpollockco is in the Public fast each person runs but how well they pass the baton. If you don't

Domain, CC0 / A derivative from the original pass the baton successfully every time, you will not win the race, no

work  matter how fast each person is. The same thing is true in education.

      For teachers, it's easier when the school has a climate that's positive

      and supportive and reflective of the same values that they would

like to have incorporated within their individual classrooms. In most countries I've ever been to, there are

schools that people say, "Gosh, that's a great school". When you go into one of those schools, you feel the

climate, you feel the warmth, you feel the support, you feel the camaraderie. If you analyse it, you'll see that

they are attending to the kid's virtues, character and social-emotional competencies. They may not be doing it

with an explicit curriculum, but when you take out the magnifying glass, you see all the signs are there.

                 Positive School Climate: Eidsvold State School

      The leadership of one small school took steps to implement a whole-school change of
   practice to build positive student and community wellbeing and along the way
   significantly enhanced learning outcomes. Eidsvold State School is a small rural Prep to
   Year 12 school located in the North Burnett Regional Shire in Queensland. The school is
   co-ed and has a high Indigenous English Language or Dialect (IELD) population with 52%
   of students identifying as Indigenous. The Wakka Wakka, Wulli Wulli and Goreng Goreng
   language and cultural groups are represented in the Eidsvold community.

DIFFERENTIATING SOCIAL-EMOTIONAL SKILLS ACROSS STUDENTS

Dr. Krishnamoorthy: How can you deliver social-emotional curriculums in a differentiated manner?
65                                                        DAYNA SCHIMKE

    Prof. Elias: My colleagues and I have a book on assessing social, emotional, and character development. It's

not simple, yet we expect teachers to do this all the time. When teachers implicitly or explicitly sign report

cards, they include information about the kids' social-emotional competencies. This is why the data shows that

long-term success is better predicted by report card grades than test scores. Report card grades implicitly and

sometimes explicitly include qualities and characteristics about the kind of person the student is.

    Let's say I'm a middle school or high school teacher, and I've got a kid I see an hour a day. Perhaps I'm

an elementary school teacher, and I've got kids I see maybe five hours a day. How can I not learn about

their social-emotional skills? If we give teachers a template that breaks down social-emotional skills for them,

including the primary areas of emotion recognition, self-control, emotion management, awareness of others,

empathy, problem-solving, and ability to work in groups. If we broke that down developmentally, teachers

would indeed be able to develop nuances for the kids. They would then be able to see what these students

need to work on.

    Teachers are fantastic. Teachers are fantastic because they get to know the students, and they make

                                         differentiations on many levels. They don't make more

    Teachers are fantastic because they  precise and explicit social-emotional differentiations
    get to know the students             because they've rarely had a framework for it. If given a
                                         framework for it, they can do it, but they're already

                                         doing it implicitly. When teachers form groups of kids

in workgroups, they often think those kids get along well. I don't want to have these kids in the group because

these kids never listen to anybody. I need to have a kid who listens, I need to have a kid to cooperate, so we

need a helpful child with these other students. I've got an inclusion class, so I'm going to have some of my kids

with the best social skills paired up with some kids with fewer social skills. Teachers are doing this stuff all the

time. They just need a little more guidance and support.

ADVANTAGES OF INCLUSION TO SOCIAL-EMOTIONAL LEARNING

Dr. Krishnamoorthy: We often hear that the most problematic students demand so much time and energy from
the teachers and the school. What are your thoughts about inclusion, particularly for the kids we need to be
trauma-informed for?

   Prof. Elias: There is a saying that is used in some schools, in essence, that we are all responsible for each
other. I believe that is a value and a virtue. If I have kids coming into my class who are having problems, I need
to be having conversations with all my class about how we help each other. This is where the strength part
comes in. I don't want kids coming in who are included to somehow be seen as a deficit.

   I have a very close colleague, Timothy Shriver, who works with International Special Olympics. Tim Shriver
says that we need to not use the term disabilities but use the term different abilities. Every child has different
TRAUMA INFORMED SOCIAL-EMOTIONAL LEARNING WITH PROFESSOR MAURICE ELIAS                           66

abilities. Every child has things they are not so good at,

and they have things that they are good at. That needs      we need to not use the term
to be part of the conversation when that kid comes in.      disabilities but use the term

   I work with a programme in Highland Park, New                            different abilities
Jersey, where they had an influx of kids who were

diagnosed with Autistic Spectrum Disorder. They

taught all students in the school about Autism. They helped the kids understand what Autism is, its symptoms,

and what it looked like when kids had difficulty. They learnt what self-stimming behaviours were and why kids

were doing repetitive talking or were not talking at all. They learnt how to support those kids. And for years,

they've had an exemplary and award-winning programme. It's summarised in an article called `To Reach for

the Stars', written by Trina Epstein. That article talks about the fact that inclusion is the keyword, and the

question is, `how do we all include one another regardless of circumstances?'

When kids have experienced personal life trauma, that's something that people need to know about and talk
about. When there's community-wide trauma, and it's all shared, that can be easier because we're all included
in that trauma. Regardless, the point is, how do we provide a safe, supportive, caring and helpful environment
for everyone that walks in that door in our classroom? And how do we see every one of those kids as a
potential asset for what we're doing rather than a liability? Not someone who will take away my instructional
time. If you're attending to me because of my competencies, you're using my assets in the classroom, then I'm
not going to cause you too much trouble. As we make kids more hopeful and generous, they will exhibit fewer
behaviour problems, and that's the link to the discipline.

   One of the things we've started is the Academy for Social-Emotional Learning in schools. We've done this
for the reasons alluded to earlier: many teachers want to get better at these things but don't have places to
go to do that. The Academy is an online certificate programme where teachers and counsellors, psychologists,
67                                      DAYNA SCHIMKE

                                        social workers, and all student support service

    As we make kids more hopeful and    providers can come to develop their expertise in
    generous, they will exhibit fewer   delivering social-emotional and character development
    behaviour problems, and that's the  to their classrooms. As well as building a positive
    link to the discipline.             classroom, culture and climate. We have many
                                        educators from many countries who have come

                                        together to build skills in delivering social-emotional

learning in schools. We find that this shared international learning environment is just wonderfully enriching.

Kids are kids all over the world, and teachers are teachers all over the world. We share this common set of

goals and problems that we can solve together. We also have a similar certificate programme for school

leaders because, as I was talking about earlier, the task of creating a welcoming, positive school culture and

climate, a school of social-emotional competence and character. We feel that without that kind of support,

we're making pronouncements to teachers, but we're not helping them to walk the talk. And we want people

to be able to walk the talk.

CHAPTER SUMMARY

    · Social-emotional skills are essential life skills and are used by humans from birth.

    · The most influential teachers we remember are generally those that expressed well developed
       social-emotional skills. Teachers can improve students' academic scores and their social-emotional
       skills, it doesn't have to be either/or.

    · The five virtues essential for trauma-informed education: optimistic future mindedness,
       compassionate forgiveness and gratitude, generosity, constructive creativity, and responsible
       diligence.

    · Creating a school-wide culture of warmth and responsiveness to social-emotional needs is essential
       to kids' success at school and staff wellbeing. Long term success is better predicted by report card
       grades as teachers are including elements of kids' social-emotional learning and capacity at an
       implicit level.

Creating Sanctuary in Schools with Professor Sandra
Bloom

For many of us advocating for trauma-informed practices, we may find ourselves isolated in schools that are
stressed, under-resourced and punitive. In these systems, compassionate and thoughtful strategies to help
students may face strong opposition and cynicism. What can be done to change such schools? We reached
out to speak with psychiatrist Dr. Sandra Bloom. Dr. Bloom's work on helping educational and health systems
through trauma-informed leadership is ground-breaking and vital. Our discussion highlights critical issues
facing our educational systems today and may shed light on ways to better care for our students and our
teachers.

   Dr. Sandra Bloom

                                               Dr. Sandra Bloom is a psychiatrist and professor at the
                                            Dornsife School of Public Health at Drexel University in the
                                            United States of America. She is the president of
                                            Community Works, an organisational consulting firm
                                            committed to developing non-violent environments. Dr.
                                            Bloom is also the director of the Sanctuary program, an
                                            inpatient psychiatric program for treating trauma-related
                                            emotional disorders. Dr. Bloom's first book, Creating
                                            Sanctuary, tells the story of understanding the connections
   between a wide variety of emotional disturbances and the legacy of child abuse and other forms of traumatic
   exposure. In more than 350 programs, considerable numbers of staff are now trained in Dr. Bloom's Sanctuary Model,
   which is currently being used in various settings, including several schools.

Dr. Krishnamoorthy: How has your own experience of school influenced the work you do now?
   Dr. Bloom: I went all the way through school at the same school district. It was called Lower Moreland - it's

in a suburb of Philadelphia in the United States. It was like growing up in a small town, in a small school. It
was a very natural, democratic environment where teachers were interested in the kids. The kids came from
middle-class families, mostly in brand new suburbs - post-World War 2. The social norm was that you helped
others in the whole community and the school community. There were 100 kids in my graduating class, so it
was small enough that everybody knew everybody. When a problem arose, it was noticed and addressed. Yet
there weren't many problems in those days. There was a stable economic situation for families. People had
jobs. I was utterly unaware that violence existed. I did not learn about violence until I got out into the world.
That was a real blessing that I didn't think about such things until I saw the enormous contrast between other
people growing up.

                                                                                                         69

   As an adult, I learned that Sociologists have come up with Dunbar's number (see the box below for more
information), which says that humans and our systems deteriorate after about 160 to 170 people. Since then,
I have thought about all of the educational system's problems, and we could probably solve all of them by just
stopping to try and save money by getting bigger schools and instead returning to small schools where there
are communities where children can learn how to be citizens. That has influenced a lot of my work in this field
and continues to do so.

                    Dunbar's Number

      Proposed by anthropologist Robin Dunbar (1992), `Dunbar's number' refers to a concept
   that limits the number of people with whom one can maintain stable social
   relationships--relationships in which an individual knows who each person is and how each
   person relates to every other person. The proposed number is said to lie between 100 to
   250 people and is commonly cited as 150 people (Dunbar, 1993).

DEFINING TRAUMA

Dr. Krishnamoorthy: Given your expansive knowledge in this area, how do you explain what trauma is?
   Dr. Bloom: When this field started, it was clear that trauma meant people had experienced a real threat

to their life or witnessed a threat to life, or death and dying and other horrible things. That remains one of
the definitions of trauma, but because we don't have one word in English that embraces what we're talking
about, particularly to children, we use the word trauma as a shorthand to also represent chronic stress, toxic
stress, relentless stress, and traumatic stress. With that caveat, I define trauma as "when the brain and body
are overwhelmed, our physiology is overwhelmed by an experience that causes suffering." In response to
suffering, people often get derailed, their development gets derailed, the way they cope or try to cope derails
them further, and we end up with complex problems. This suffering and attempt to cope isn't necessarily
directly due to the trauma itself, but due to the adaptations that children and adults make to deal with their
disordered physiology and brain regulation.

              What is childhood trauma?

   More than 20 years ago, Lenore Terr (1992) defined childhood trauma as the impact of
external forces that "[render] the young person temporarily helpless and [break] past
ordinary coping and defensive operation". Terrasi and de Galarce (2017, p. 36) suggest that
complex trauma is "the cumulative effect of traumatic experiences that are repeated or
prolonged over time".

ADOPTING A PUBLIC HEALTH APPROACH

Dr. Krishnamoorthy: You mention that defining trauma has become increasingly complex. How do you see this
complexity and resulting suffering in services and systems working with children?

   Dr. Bloom: We know from the Adverse Childhood Experiences study (ACEs study ; see the box below for more
information) and all of the follow-up research that most of the population will experience a traumatic event in
their lifetime. Most of the population have been, or will be, exposed to at least one ACE. A substantial minority
have been, or will be, exposed to four or more ACEs. We have to address this. It's a public health emergency
that affects the whole community.

   It can't be a band-aid approach to meeting the needs of specialised, at-risk groups. These are community-
wide concerns that have a multi-generational impact. This is why we need a public health approach to trauma.
We must understand and spread knowledge about what we've learned so that everybody understands these
concerns. Everyone in an organisation and community must understand the impact of trauma, from the staff,
administrators, teachers, children, and their family members.

   Let me give you an example of what I mean by a public health approach. A public health response is that
we've made laws to ensure seat belts are in every car. Will everybody have a car accident? Thankfully no but
will enough people be in danger and at high risk of having a car accident? Yes. So everybody has to wear seat
belts. We need that kind of measure in place around the issue of trauma and adversity for the same reasons.
Everybody's at risk of experiencing trauma. Even if you've had a perfect childhood, you will interact with people
who have had a difficult time growing up, and their distress will emotionally impact you. Being repeatedly
confronted and affected by such pain and distress in others and within yourself may lead you to develop
unhelpful coping skills. This is especially true in professions such as education. In this way, large groups of
people may be impacted by the pain and distress of those in need.

   This is why trauma-informed practices are critical for organisations and whole systems. We can't pretend
that this stuff isn't real any longer. It's very real, and anybody that works in any kind of workplace knows that,
in the long-term, stress kills.

THE SANCTUARY MODEL

Dr. Krishnamoorthy: Could you tell us about the Sanctuary Model and the model helps implement trauma-
informed care in organisations and systems?

   Dr. Bloom: The Sanctuary Model is an organisational approach that evolved from my original work running
a psychiatric inpatient unit for adults and adolescents for over 30 years. We learned from our patients what
it meant to help people who experienced trauma. We learned upfront, close and personal about the lived
experience of these adults. Through caring for them, we learnt how to facilitate an environment that helped
those experiencing distressing emotions related to a history of trauma and adversity.

            CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 licence.

We then applied those learnings and created a conceptual framework that we could teach other people. This
framework centres on a set of values that are critical in creating a milieu or environment that keeps people
safe. We use various tools to help people cope with the distressing emotions on a day-to-day basis.

   Every school is a community, so schools are apt to have trauma-informed systems. Every school has a
climate, every classroom has a climate, and there's been a wealth of research about the importance of school
climate for learning and classroom management.

   The Sanctuary model is a newer articulation of longstanding ideas in healthcare and education that keep
getting lost. It goes back hundreds and hundreds of years. We keep forgetting, and we have to rediscover it.
Today we can integrate this knowledge through the emerging research on how trauma and adversity affect
the brain and the body. So that's what makes it so important and helpful for schools. You don't have to think
about this as `Oh, a brand-new flavour of the month.' It's well grounded in longstanding educational principles
of how we must treat children to encourage learning.

be too stressed to pay attention to what the stressed children need to calm, regulate, and learn. This is all part

of what we mean by trauma-informed education.

                  The Sanctuary Model

      The Sanctuary Model is a trauma-informed organisational change intervention developed
   by Sandra Bloom and colleagues. Based on the concept of therapeutic communities, the
   model is designed to facilitate the development of organisational cultures that support the
   victims of traumatic experience and extended exposure to adversity.

ALIGNING PRACTICE WITH CORE VALUES

Dr. Krishnamoorthy: Why is it that we veer away from those core values? Does it have something to do with the
experience of stress or our outlook on our work?

   Dr. Bloom: I'll start with the big picture. Our educational system has been afflicted by our unidimensional
emphasis on money. If money and financial success are the only value, then it trumps everything else. And
that's what we've got happening here. Everything is sacrificed to the `God of money'. This has a corrupting
influence on everybody. Even the most well-meaning people must try to align with what the next person in the
hierarchy says about the factor that trumps everything else: "Yeah, that's all good. That's well-meaning. Yeah,
it'd be nice if we could do that, but we can't afford it." It becomes difficult for people with a clear moral compass
to challenge that moral infringement because they feel extraordinary levels of moral distress. Sometimes it's
so distressing that you start to ignore it completely. You get two selves, one responding to the power needs
of those in control of the purse strings. The other self, more genuinely you, says, "I know this is wrong, but
I'm too scared, I'm too intimidated, or I'm too threatened to be able to do anything about it." I think that's why
articulating a value system consistently becomes so critical that it should be a primary leadership role.

   Leaders should be speaking the values and walking the talk. What happens too often is that the value system
gets put on the shelf, away from our daily decisions. Every single decision we make should include the test
of whether it's a good decision. Does this support or undermine the values that we say are important? If
our purpose is to educate underprivileged children, who needs to learn things? We live in an increasingly
inequitable society, what will we as adults do about that? How are we going to speak truth to power? How are
we going to resist without becoming annihilated? It's really about money, and it's about power. It comes down
to our education systems being in a moral crisis.
75  DAYNA SCHIMKE

   So, what can the individual do? Individuals alone are very
vulnerable. We must figure out how to work together,
collectively. In an individualistic culture, that's a tough sell.
But there is little hope unless we move in that direction.
Schools are collective bodies. Schools can mobilise power
within their community if they speak with one voice.

THE S.E.L.F FRAMEWORK

Dr. Krishnamoorthy: You have a lovely framework in the
sanctuary program, the S.E.L.F framework. How can you
use that to help children with their recovery from trauma? "Image" by jarmoluk is in the Public Domain, CC0

   Dr. Bloom: S.E.L.F stands for Safety, Emotions, Loss, and
Future. We think of it as a compass. It guides professionals
to begin thinking about how to help another. For instance, a teacher is confronted by a distressed child who is
chaotic and profoundly dysregulated. Where does the teacher start? You're supposed to be educating this kid,
and this child is too hyper-aroused to be able to teach them anything. They're disrupting everybody else in the
classroom. How do you even begin to think about where to start? And that's where S.E.L.F comes in.

   You start work with a child around identifying the safety issues. When we talk about safety, we talk about the
four domains of safety, physical, psychological (within self), social (with others) and moral safety (safe within
a system of values that are dear to you). You help a child think through all of their problems as safety issues.
Underneath the S.E.L.F framework is a fundamental shift in mental models. S.E.L.F is saying, "This child in front
of me, it isn't a matter of whether they're sick or bad, it's that this is an injured child." And we need a framework
within which to think about an injured child. The first step is, how do I help you get safe in the world? That's
the S in S.E.L.F.

   It would help if you took responsibility for you being safe, and I'll help you as much as possible. We have to
help you develop abilities to calm yourself down. You have to be safe with yourself, meaning you have to make
the connection that what you're doing is hurtful to you and your self-esteem. You have to be safer with other
kids. You need to understand that when you get upset other kids catch it, and then the whole classroom gets
out of control, and that's not safe for me as your teacher.

   The E is for emotions, recognising and regulating our emotions. We know that stressed people can't manage
their emotions very well, and emotions are critical for education. Emotions direct our attention to what's
important. A child dealing with violence cannot direct their attention to reading, writing, and arithmetic. It's
impossible; their brain doesn't work that way. It's part of our evolutionary heritage as humans. It becomes
critical for teachers to develop skills to help children calm and become emotionally intelligent about their self-
regulation. Children can then help each other in the classroom regulate their emotions. To do that, you must
know what emotions you have the most problems regulating. To help a child recognise: "I'm okay until I pick up
Johnny's anger, and then I get scared, and when I'm afraid, I can't think." That is the conversation the teacher
could have. Okay, what can you do? What can we help you figure out to do when you get afraid so that you can
be less afraid?
CREATING SANCTUARY IN SCHOOLS WITH PROFESSOR SANDRA BLOOM                                 76

                                               Loss is the L which recognises that all change involves

                                               some loss. We don't think about that much because we

                                               don't like a loss. But people don't resist change; we resist

                                               loss. Therefore, if you help a child to see that if you make a

                                               change, you will have to give up something, you are

                                               honouring that child's loss. If you're going to use exercise to

                                               help yourself calm down, it's going to take time, and you'll

                                               have to give up time playing your video games. Are you

                                               willing to make that commitment to improve your emotion

                                               management skills? In this sense, all change requires loss

                                               for kids and adults. We then ask, why should we change?

                                               Well, because we envision a future, that's where the F

"Image" by Alexa is in the Public Domain, CC0  comes in.
                                                  We want something and will have to give up something in

                                               return. So we have to have a clear vision of what we want.

When you're challenging a child to make a change and manage their emotions to get safe, no human being will

do that unless they have a vision of why. What would that feel like? What will it feel like for a student to not to

have me discipline them all the time? Can they imagine taking a math test and getting an A plus? Can they

imagine that happening even though they failed every math test this semester?

You may start with a teacher using S.E.L.F and you can start anywhere in the framework. It might start with

asking where are we trying to get to? You may say "I need to talk with you, Johnny, because this is what I see

happening, and I'm worried about you. But let's start with the idea that everything works, everything you and

I are going to plan, it works, and you are successful. What does that look like to you? Give me an example of

something you've been successful at before. Now you can imagine the future goal, and then we'll link the goal

back to where we are now". This organises the chaos in the teacher-student relationship.

When using the S.E.L.F framework, many people miss the L - the loss. We don't calculate what the person

will have to give up. That's important to consider with traumatised people. Whats at stake if they stop using the

unhealthy habits they've used to cope? They have to sit with unimaginably terrible feelings, and we're not good

at understanding that. We need empathy for their experiences and emotions to help them figure out what

to do and learn to improve it. In this way, S.E.L.F is a powerful and straightforward tool, yet simultaneously

complex.

                  The S.E.L.F Framework

      S.E.L.F. is a problem-solving framework that represents the four dynamic areas of focus for
   trauma recovery. It offers a trauma-informed way of organising conversations and
   documentation for clients, families, staff, and administrators by moving away from jargon and
   towards more simple and accessible language.

Dr. Krishnamoorthy: I like how you frame unsafe or oppositional behaviour as a coping strategy for those who
are traumatised. Could you say more about this?

   Dr. Bloom: We learned this from our patients, many of whom were self-mutilating or self-harming. We tried
all kinds of punitive strategies to get them to stop self-harming. Of course, it was a complete failure. Until we
understood that the cutting was how they were coping with feelings that felt worse. We couldn't expect them
to give up an effective coping skill unless we could replace it with something healthier and just as effective.
That's how we learned to approach these kinds of problems entirely differently.

   Oprah talked about this last year on a TV program she had. She said, "This revolutionary approach, it's not
77  DAYNA SCHIMKE

`what's wrong with you?'. We've stopped asking that question. Now we ask the question, `what happened to
you?'. It was my friend Joe Foderaro, a social worker in 1991, who said that in a team meeting. When you
see that problem behaviour, you must start with: I wonder what that's about? Why would somebody react
that way? What happened that could produce that outcome or behaviour? How can we figure out how to
redirect that behaviour into more positive, self-affirming, creative, and educational channels? Unless you get
that original shift, you don't get anywhere. You just end up trying to punish people who are already profoundly
punished for doing their best at coping.

SYSTEMS UNDER PRESSURE

Dr. Krishnamoorthy: We often hear from many teachers who don't feel supported by their leaders and
colleagues to work in a trauma-informed manner. What early warning signs can people pick up on when an
organisation or a system is under stress and perhaps not functioning the way it should be?

   Dr. Bloom: The only antidote that we have to the effects of trauma is social support. For example, if you go
into a staff room in a school, and there's a lot of hostility and tension, we pick that up instantaneously. Those
are signals of danger. There's likely little social support in that environment. Other indicators of systems under
stress include chronic conflicts that are not resolved; there are no conflict management strategies routinely
in place; a lack of training on the impact of stress and trauma on the teachers, students or their families; a
punitive environment where the reaction to the breaking of rules or episodes of violence is to punish students
or adults. If you're interviewing for a job, and pick up on these signs, don't go there.

   There are also authoritarian leadership principles. Authoritarianism is a disaster for human groups unless
they are in an acute crisis. In an acute crisis, it's a good strategy to use. After that, the only thing that is going
to be effective is democratic processes. Other warning signs include a lot of secrecy, which often indicates
communication problems exist within the system; how many violent incidents have there been? And how
many times are students pushed out of the classroom and punished for their problems? Has that been rising
or decreasing? Is it being addressed, and how? How are behaviour problems at the school addressed? What
are the expectations of teachers? Is there any support for teachers? What happens if you're having a difficult
time with a child? Are there people in the school who are called in when there's any kind of emergency, not
just as police, but as real helpers? Is there attention being paid to the students and teachers?

   These are things you see in an environment that's becoming increasingly sick. Remember that organisations
are like organisms. They are living, adaptive, complex systems. It becomes a worry when everybody's reaction
to a stressful situation is to try to make a new rule, and the accumulation of rules is a very clear indicator that
social norms are eroding. Pay attention to the social norms of the system. Positive social norms will include
bringing people within the system together, talking about the rising level of incidents, and talking about what's
going on with our group and what's going on collectively.

       It's not just seeking out a new rule or a new person to punish to `fix' the system, it will never work. But that's what we
       do over and over again, and I've seen that happen in all kinds of organisations, and I've definitely seen that happen
       a lot in schools where the attitude is, these kids are out of control, so we need more punishment, and they need
       more consequences.

It's always called consequences, and there are always consequences for everything that we do. You want the
consequences to be deliberately designed for that group or that student that's going to get you more of what
you want that student to be. If you apply the same consequences to everybody, it makes no sense. It makes
the system incredibly stupid because one student will be breaking a rule because they're pushing the limits of
authority to see what they can get away with and find where the limit is. Yet another student will be breaking
the rule because it's a coping skill that they've learnt to deal with terrible stuff that's going on at home. Now, if
you consequence those two students, in the same way, you've totally missed the point.

   It's really important that people who run organisations are able to identify when their systems are getting
sick. Just like we identify the signs of the flu or a cold within ourselves, we go in for a check-up to help us
recover and heal our bodies. Systems are living bodies, they can get well and heal and recover from stress, but
CREATING SANCTUARY IN SCHOOLS WITH PROFESSOR SANDRA BLOOM  78

not if you ignore the symptoms. You're describing that the system had adapted to a sick way of functioning.
That's what whole communities do, and that's what entire societies do. We adapt to sick, inhumane conditions
and then wonder why things are so messed up. Well, they're sick, ill, and dysfunctional, and it's time that
we were willing to stake our claim around knowing what health an organisation is in. How does a healthy
organisation function? What is a healthy school? Let's get out there and say it. Those of us who have been in
lots of systems, get us all together, and we'll have no trouble talking about and voicing it. But it's not talked
about, and we don't think about it. We do this when we as individual human beings are sick. We know how bad
it feels to feel sick, and we know what it feels like to feel well. We need to be doing that at an organisational
level too.

                 Trauma-informed Organisational Change and Support

      Crisis-driven organisations sacrifice communication networks, feedback loops,
   participatory decision making and complex problem-solving under the pressures of chronic
   stress and in doing so, lose healthy democratic processes and shift to innovation and risk-
   taking resulting in an inability to manage complexity. This requires leadership buy-in and
   immersion in the change process, an increase in transparency, and deliberate restructuring
   to ensure greater participation and involvement.

RESTORING SANCTUARY

Dr. Krishnamoorthy: Let me play devil's advocate for a bit. I can hear some of the educational leaders reading
this saying, "Well, that's very nice for you, Sandy, but we've got parents at our door complaining, we've got
disruptive students, teachers threatening union action, and we don't have an endless resource of money." So
what are these practices that make for a healthy organisation?

   Dr. Bloom: What you're describing is a failure of imagination. It begins with a vision of what could be possible
if we were committed to it. Then you want to mobilise collective action to achieve that goal. What's happening
here because of the ACEs study is that various local communities are organising around, knowing we have all
of these problems; What would it look like for our community to be healthy? What would the outcomes be?
How would we know? And then they move back into what would we need to have that happen?
79                                                       DAYNA SCHIMKE

   Money is food to an organisational body, just like food is
nutrition for humans. But it isn't everything; you need more
than food to be healthy. There's a lot of work any
community, including a school community, can do about
getting better nutrition. This isn't just about getting money,
but organising the way money is spent, looking at where
the funding goes, and how to mobilise our families. How do
we mobilise the children as resources for creating the
healthier environment that we're all imagining? That means
you must include students and parents in that imagining
process. It can't just come from the people that work in the
school; it has to include all of the stakeholders.

   There are now group methods to begin the imagining
process. You get large groups of people together to start "Image" by PIX1861 is in the Public Domain, CC0
the creative process, which helps to make a value space
rather than criticism and negativism. The point of conflict
then is to figure out how to satisfy all those opposing forces. The best system humans have come up with to
do that thus far is Democracy. It isn't perfect, it's messy, it's hard, and it's time-consuming, but humans will
support what they've helped to create.

   Therefore, if you want to make a change, you have to get all the stakeholders to talk to each other after
setting up some basic standards for how people work and conduct themselves in the group. I teach a lot,
and every class I do, online or in-person, begins with the students deciding what kind of safe environment
they want. All students must have a safety plan outlining their responsibility in managing emotions. There are
simple things that, even in large groups, you can do to begin the process of reclaiming the territory so that we
can build collective skills and intelligence, which is really our only hope.

TEACHER BURNOUT AND SELF-CARE

Dr. Krishnamoorthy: Self-care and burnout. There are many complexities to the issue, but I wanted to get your

thoughts about how individual teachers can think about their self-care and advocate in a way that's sustainable

for them to continue being in the profession.

    Dr. Bloom: We use a tool called a wellness plan. It's a commitment that every individual makes to take care

of themselves. To try and achieve a better balance between work and home to maintain healthy wellbeing and

mental health. It's part of serving the organisation that, as educators, social service, and healthcare providers,

we're the only tools we have. We have nothing else except our beingness, so we must keep that shiny. It's

tough because we do emotional labour all the time.

We're picking up other people's emotions, and            We have nothing else except our
emotions are contagious. It's effortless to get dragged  beingness, so we must keep that
down when you're seeing dozens of really distressed
people. Because of this, you have to do things to leave                                         shiny.

work at work. Make a ritual transition on your way

home where you cleanse yourself and do whatever works physically, psychologically, socially, morally,

spiritually, and politically for you. Commit to implementing those things as part of your job responsibility to

keep yourself healthy and balance your work and family life. Technology has produced significant problems

for people. Some organisations are beginning to implement rules about prohibiting email responses at certain

times of the day and on weekends. Having rules about the use of technology is essential, otherwise you will

drown in it. When is work ever done? When can you put it away when there are still emails to answer? People

can help themselves by having internal rules. Still, the more the organisation supports these rules, the easier

it becomes for people to follow through on self-care. It's helpful if you can share your self-care plan with your

teammates so that when somebody sees you escalating, they can say, "Hey, why don't you go take a walk, and
CREATING SANCTUARY IN SCHOOLS WITH PROFESSOR SANDRA BLOOM                                                          80

I'll fill in for you". Those simple acts of social support mean a great deal. As does having a sense of humour.
Being able to laugh and also celebrate our successes are essential for positive wellbeing at work. There's a lot
we can do as individuals, and there's even more, we can do at an organisational level to keep our equipment
and people shiny and healthy.

TRAUMA IN FIRST NATIONS PEOPLE

Dr. Krishnamoorthy: I want to touch on trauma in First Nations People. We do some work with some of our

Indigenous communities here in Australia. In terms of trauma, they're often the people who are significantly

affected. Some of the issues are historical injustices and structural inequalities that contribute to their

intergenerational trauma . I often think people feel overwhelmed and dispirited because their trauma is so

significant.

Dr. Bloom: Let me preface this by saying I have a lot of experience working with our African-American

communities, less with our native communities. From my experience, working with these communities is that

so much of the historical injustice is about an assault on people's identity and a long-term multi-generational

assault on people as being okay, healthy, normal, and creative human beings. It erodes a sense of community

identity. The knowledge we have now about trauma and adversity is that by its very nature, these are

normalising conversations. It says, "You're not sick, you're not bad, you are injured."

In the case of historical injustice, you have been injured, and your ancestors have also been injured. Despite

that, you are a survivor and managed to thrive within the present constraints. You must validate that normality

with people to help change that negative identity. I think that's the beginning of the educational process

around trauma and adversity. It normalises these terrible things that people do and how they feel. It says, `I

can understand this because of what you've been through. Now, can I help you in some way to find outlets that

are positive and creative that will help you thrive even more? Because you've already survived, you're here, and

you're living'. I think political analysis is crucial. When I started working in residential treatment with kids, I had

this fantasy that we would help those children go from being `sick and disabled' to being political and social

activists. And that we would create an army of kids who understood what had happened to them, how they

had survived it, and what they needed to do to help the rest of the population.

Interestingly, I had an early experience in a high school that again dealt with a plague of adolescents who

died by suicide. I was part of a group of adults and students who were brought together to create a task force

to address the question `how are we going to manage this suicide cluster'? Interestingly, the counsellor who

picked the students was a wise guy. He was intelligent and well-informed and understood the issues of trauma

and adversity. The students he chose to be a part of this task force to help explain to the adults what was

happening with adolescents were all students who had been in treatment. They had all been in substance

                                        abuse facilities and knew how to talk to adults.

CHAPTER SUMMARY

        · Trauma can be defined as when the brain and body are overwhelmed, our physiology is
            overwhelmed by an experience that causes suffering.

        · Everybody's at risk of experiencing trauma. A public health approach to understanding and
            managing the impact of trauma is essential in beginning to limit the multi-generational, community

        · The Sanctuary Model is a trauma-informed organisational change framework that centres on a set of
            values that are critical in creating an environment that keeps everyone safe.

        · The four pillars of the Sanctuary Model include Safety, Emotions, Loss and Future.
        · Unsafe or oppositional behaviour needs to be understood as effective coping skills for traumatised

            functioning well, when under pressure.
        · A wellness plan is critical to maintain overall positive wellbeing for staff and to enable staff to have a

            healthy balance between work and home life.

Conclusion by Dayna Schimke

Schools can be a place of sanctuary or a place of fear and dread for the traumatised child. Danger may take
many forms - the threat of a suspension, the mocking tone of a peer's comments or the potential to appear
weak or incompetent. Such experiences are perceived as a disruption or disappointment to some children but
as a life threat to others. The scholars in the preceding chapters have discussed how our bodies and brains
are engineered for survival. The acknowledgement of these perceptions among students, and the need for the
facilitation of physical and psychological safety is the challenge of trauma-informed educators.

   How can teachers support our most vulnerable children? Small gestures, skilful accommodations, and tactful
communication. Small victories in class turn into successful days. Small celebrations that become enjoyable
weeks. While success at school is often measured in grades and rewards, there is much learning that occurs
in the day-to-day interactions at school that is often overlooked. Children are constantly learning about their
world, their emotions, their bodies, and their relationships. In this way, the experience of education is more
than the prescribed curriculum. The experience of education is the experience of the school community.

   A whole school approach is fundamental to the success of creating a culture where not only children with
trauma are well understood and supported, but teachers' well-being and self-care are also supported. Trauma-
informed education is about resisting the re-enactments of control and coercion at all levels - from students,
their families, and with staff. All successful educational leaders understand the risks of allowing systemic
pressures to undermine the autonomy and flexibility of teachers. Children with complex needs require agile
educators - those who have a deep understanding of their students and the role of pedagogy in helping them
achieve learning. A repeated message throughout the book is that educators require the support of the whole
school community for trauma-informed practice to be embedded successfully.

   I hope that reading these stories has inspired you to learn and embed trauma-informed practices into
your daily teaching. I hope you've become moved to understand the traumatised child and change the
relationships you have with your most vulnerable students - to be unrelentingly genuine, compassionate and,
most importantly, hopeful.

   I want to thank you for allowing yourself time and space to read this book. Learning is an act of great
vulnerability and bravery, and teaching is a wonderous act of care. You are the most important resource for
the future of our children. Thank you for all that you do for your students.
