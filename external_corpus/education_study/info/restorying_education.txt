Critical Perspectives in Public Education

Thor Gibbins

       "A pedagogy...must be forged with, not for, the oppressed (whether individuals or
       peoples) in the incessant struggle to regain their humanity. This pedagogy makes
       oppression and its causes objects of reflection by the oppressed, and from that
       reflection will come their necessary engagement in the struggle for their liberation.
       And in the struggle this pedagogy will be made and remade." (Paulo Friere,
       Pedagogy of the Oppressed, p. 48)

INTRODUCTION

Over the past century and a half, there have been many textbooks used to provide pre-
service educators a foundation on the import of education, curriculum, and educational
policy. This serves as a starting point for their future careers as teachers and teacher
leaders. This textbook intends to comport these goals for students beginning to study
education, content, and pedagogy. However, unlike many of this book's predecessors
and contemporaries, our intention in writing this book is to apply critical perspectives on
systemic political and economic structures undergirding public education in the United
States. For this project, we take a critical approach to how teachers, students, places, and
even languages have been emplaced within this larger educational system that continues
to replicate inequalities and, at times, oppression.

      Literacy scholar and teacher, Paulo Friere saw pedagogy and the teaching of reading
and writing in particular as a means for liberation. This type of pedagogy requires
teachers to place themselves amidst and in solidarity with their students in resisting and
reforming the systemic injustices brought on to the people with little or no economic,
social, or political capital. This book, while still providing the foundational concepts
for beginning pre-service educators, intends to position pre-service teachers and teacher
educators to critique what Friere (2018) named as the banking model of education that
2 RESTORYING EDUCATION

                                           has pervaded our educational system since its formal inception in the 19th century. In
                                           order to evaluate and critically examine the banking model, we employ the process of
                                           restorying as the primary pedagogical approach for this textbook.

                                                 Restorying, as a pedagogical approach, emerges from the social constructivist
                                           paradigm that embed learning in situ with real and relevant contexts, utilizes social
                                           negotiation and discussion as an essential part of learning, emphasizes multiple
                                           perspectives and modes of representation, encourages self-ownership of learning, and
                                           invites self-reflection on how one constructs knowledge (Slabon, Richards, & Dennen,
                                           2014). Restorying involves iterations of writing, rewriting, and discussing "personal,
                                           student-generated, domain-relevant stories to promote conceptual application, critical
                                           thinking, and ill-structured problem solving skills" (p. 505). For each chapter of this
                                           textbook, Each chapter's authors apply restorying to rewrite the underlying narratives,
                                           concepts, and ill-structured problems that form our understandings of public education
                                           from the past to the present. Each chapter includes a pre-reading activity to help readers
                                           activate background knowledge from their own lived experiences, critical essential
                                           questions to help sustain inquiry on the topics and concepts throughout the reading
                                           process, during reading activities to help guide comprehension, and an end of chapter
                                           activity, to consolidate understanding. All the activities in each chapter employ
                                           restorying as the primary pedagogical approach to encourage students to rewrite their
                                           own internalized narratives, beliefs, and attitudes on teaching, learning, and the purposes
                                           of public education.

                                                 In addition to applying restorying as the primary method to represent the
                                           foundations of public education, The editors have organized this book thematically
                                           into two sections. The first section, Teaching and Learning, focuses on our conceptual
                                           understandings of teachers and students, the curriculum that guides teaching and
                                           learning, the purposes of assessment of student learning, and the political, social, and
                                           economic educational policies. The second section, Multiple Perspectives in Education,
                                           offers disparate perspectives on education that involve alternate perspectives on linguistic
                                           diversity within communities and schools; racial and ethnic disparities that create a
                                           school to prison pipeline; teachers as agents and activists for reform; and global
                                           perspectives of education outside the United States that may offer teachers a guide to
                                           future possibilities in how we shape education in the United States. While some of these
                                           topics and chapters may appear to be outliers from traditional textbooks on education,
                                           these chapters restory pedagogy, educational theory, curriculum, and educational policy
                                           within these nuanced topics to situate and apply readers' conceptual understandings
                                           embedded within real and lived world of teachers, students, caregivers, and
                                           communities. This textbook is unique in being an Open Educational Resource (OER)
                                           available- and affordable- for all who wish to use some or all of these chapters in their
                                           education programs.

                                                 Lastly, I invite all of us-teacher educators and future educators-to forge solidarity
                                           with one another and become active in creating democratic schools where the principal
                                           stakeholders become the primary decision makers in schools in regard to curriculum
                                           and hiring educational leaders. We need to advocate for democratic practices in
                                           schools-elementary, middle school, high school, undergraduate and graduate teacher
                                                                                      RESTORYING EDUCATION IN THE UNITED STATES 3

education programs-as opposed to the corporate for-profit models. Currently, most
of the critical decisions involving education policy and curriculum are done behind
closed doors decided by the few who hold positions of power. If we are truly to shift
education for a sustainable future, we must challenge undemocratic decisions and push
for more democratic processes that value the professionalism of educators who are on
the frontlines with students working to solve the myriad problems of the world on fire.

      Let this book be a way forward in restorying public education that is equitable,
sustainable, socially and economically just.

The Cultural Narratives of Teachers

Thor Gibbins and Elyssa Stoddard

       Before We Read
       Before reading, spend some time thinking and writing on some metaphors about
       teachers, teaching, and students that you have overheard or may have used, e.g.,
       "teachers are gardeners" or "teachers are sculptors." What are the implications of
       these metaphors on what teaching means and what agency do students have in these
       metaphors? Have you seen any movies or television shows about teaching and
       teachers that you can point to as examples of these metaphors? Explain possible
       reasons writers, media producers, and distributors might benefit from creating these
       narratives about teaching, teachers, and students.
       Critical Question For Consideration
       As you read, consider these essential questions: How has the media framed
       teachers in the United States to construct cultural narratives and beliefs about
       teachers and the teaching of youth? And how have these narratives shaped how we,
       as educators, see ourselves as teachers and our students in our current or future
       classrooms?

HOW MEDIA CONSTRUCTS CULTURAL
NARRATIVES

Whatever our reasons for becoming an educator, it has been molded and shaped by
cultural narratives of teaching and teachers. These narratives spring from the spectacles
emerging from popular culture's attempts at making sense of the events of social
change. Film, television, and literature create spectacles for us to consume and
internalize. Literary theorist and philosopher Roland Barthes (1957) likened the
spectacle of professional wrestling as a cultural metaphor for how his society made sense
of the changing times in post-World War II France. Barthes, in his analysis of popular
6 RESTORYING EDUCATION

                                           culture and professional wrestling, outlined a method of scholarship that can trace
                                           narratives created by these cultural spectacles to the underlying ideologies enveloping
                                           a particular society. The purpose of this chapter utilizes Barthes' critical analyses to
                                           trace narratives about teaching and teachers within the advent of modern film and
                                           television. In doing our critical analyses, we connect these narratives to landmark events
                                           that influenced public education throughout most of the last century as well as the first
                                           part of this one.

                                         MEET A SCHOLAR

                                                       Roland Barthes (1915-1980) was a French philosopher who wrote seminal works
                                                       in the fields of literary criticism and semiotics. Barthes was an influential writer
                                                       within structuralist and post-structuralist literary theories. Structuralism asserts
                                                       that our experience of the world entails a visible level of surface phenomena and an
                                                       invisible level (Tyson, 2015). The invisible level contains structures and systems of
                                                       meaning that help us make sense of our world. Barthes proposed there are
                                                       underlying structures which produce meaning. "Texts" emerge from these
                                                       structures which allow spectators, viewers, readers, etc to experience catharsis, or
                                                       emotional release, whenever they experience reading a book, watching a movie, or
                                                       watching a sporting event. For theorists like Barthes, the world can be read as a text
                                                       and it is the underlying cultural structures that shape our interpretation of the
                                                       world.

Critical Discussion Activities:

1. Teen and coming-of-age movies have been popular cultural texts since James
    Dean starred in Rebel Without a Cause (1955). Select a popular teen movie
    from your generation and outline the character tropes within the movie. How
    does this movie portray youth? Do these caricatures connect to other social
    narratives about teens and youth cultures?

2. Choose a cultural artifact, e.g., commercial, television show, music video, etc,
    that targets teens and young adults. What type of assumptions do these media
    make about teens and youth cultures? For example, do they infanticize teens
    and/or do they create positive or negative stereotypes of youth? What are the
    implications of these narratives on social perceptions of youth?

times and may have even performed the scripts in these teacher stories early on in our
careers as educators. Our purpose of unveiling the spectacle of education is to critique
the underlying sociological purposes of maintaining these caricatures of teaching that do
not have any real connection to the lived experiences of teachers and students.

economically.                 prejudgments about public education and the role of teachers in either maintaining
                              hegemonic narratives or challenging or perhaps subverting them.

                                                            Teachers in Films Set in 1930-1950s

                              Teachers and schools were not the primary protagonists or setting in the early years of
                              cinema. However, Goodbye, Mr. Chips (1939) is one of the earliest films depicting a
                              teacher as its primary protagonist. The primary theme for the film dealt with a teacher's
                              dedication to teaching and the lives of his students. While set in England, Goodbye,
                              Mr. Chips (1939) introduces the teacher/saint (Table 1.1) about teaching and teachers
                              that can be easily traced to more contemporary movies like Dead Poets Society (1989)
                              and Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone (2001). In the film, a wise retired teacher Mr.
                              Chipping, or Mr. Chips, reminisces about his life spent as a teacher at a private boarding
THE CULTUR AL NARR ATIVES OF TEACHERS                                                       9

school for boys. Mr. Chips has dedicated his life as a teacher. The film highlights his
transformation from a bumbling beginning educator to a wise veteran teacher who
inspires the best in the young men he leads at this school where he also resides much like
priests' devotion to the church and their congregation. In a sense, Goodbye, Mr. Chips
equates becoming a teacher to joining the priesthood. While there is a love interest and
a short segway into Mr. Chips' life away from teaching, the film instills an unspoken
creed for teachers that one must adhere and devote one's whole self to teaching at the
expense of one's other interests and social life to the point of taking a de facto vow of
celibacy. It may appear as hyperbole at first glance, however, the rules for teachers from
1872 (Webster Museum, 2023) seem to outline the teacher as saint archetype that Mr.
Chips embodies:

1. Teachers each day will fill lamps, clean chimneys

2. Each teacher will bring a bucket of water and a scuttle of coal for the day's
    session

3. Make your pens carefully. You may whittle nibs to the individual taste of the
    pupils.

4. Men teachers may take one evening each week for courting purposes, or two
    evenings a week if they go to church regularly.

5. After ten hours in school, the teachers may spend the remaining time reading
    the Bible or other good books.

6. Women teachers who marry or engage in unseemly conduct will be
    dismissed.

7. Every teacher should lay aside from his pay a goodly sum of his earnings for
    his benefit during his declining years so that he will not become a burden on
    society.

8. Any teacher who smokes, uses liquor in any form, frequents pool or public
    halls, or gets shaved in a barber shop will give good reason to suspect his
    worth, intention, integrity and honesty.

9. The teacher who performs his labor faithfully and without fault for five years
    will be given an increase of 25 cents per week in his pay, providing the Board
    of Education approves. (https://www.webstermuseum.org/blog/rules-for-
    teachers/)

      Public policy on teaching was already signaling the expectations and missionary-
like dogma sixty years prior to how film and television began to frame teachers. This
teacher narrative continues to pervade media's depictions of teachers, however, unlike
the saintly Mr. Chips, some of the more modern twists the teacher as saint into teacher
as martyr, e.g., Mr. Keating in Dead Poets Society (1989).

      Dead Poets Society's romanticization of Mr. Keating as a saint/martyr teaching in
an idyllic elite boarding school set in 1959 rural Vermont mimics the pastoral musings of
the saintly Mr. Chips' teaching at an elite boarding school in England some thirty years
10 RESTORYING EDUCATION

                                           earlier. The teacher as saint or martyr trope romanticizes teachers with the media tending
                                           to frame teachers within idyllic private elite schools and settings. Unlike Mr. Chips,
                                           however, Mr. Keating's more liberal aspects of connecting students' lived experiences
                                           to the transcendentalism and romanticism spurred on by poets like Walt Whitman and
                                           Robert Frost runs afoul of the more reactionary nature of the private boarding school.
                                           When tragedy occurs, Mr. Keating must sacrifice his career for the "greater good" of the
                                           students' future roles of becoming members of the elite social class. Mona Lisa Smile
                                           (2003), also set in the 1950s, follows this similar teacher arc with a female teacher, Ms.
                                           Watson, transgresses societal expectations of young women at a private, elite liberal arts
                                           college. Ms. Watson, like Mr. Keating, must sacrifice her own career as a consequence
                                           for leading rebellion against the cultural expectations and roles of women at this time.
                                           Films about the 1950s seem to be the romantic starting point where narratives about
                                           teachers sprinkle nostalgia for the era while framing teachers as saints who must martyr
                                           themselves within the history of progress. This media framing of teachers, however, will
                                           shift abruptly during the Civil Rights Era beginning in the late 1950s through to the
                                           late 1970s.

                                             From Saints to Saviors: Narratives about Teachers in Response to the Civil Rights Era,
                                                                                    1950s to 1970s.

                                           Interestingly, there are many mediated narratives that idealize education in the 1950s
                                           era. At this time, public policy and systemic redlining in urban and suburban areas
                                           segregated schools by social class, race and ethnicity. Higher education was limited or
                                           inaccessible for many women, people of color, and working-class men. It is ironic that
                                           the media tends to romanticize an era of extreme inequity in education. In 1954, Brown
                                           v. Board of Education of Topeka ruled that racial segregation of public schools was
                                           unconstitutional-separate was not equal. The plight of urban, mostly Black and Brown
                                           working class people and the schools tasked with educating them now would begin to
                                           be depicted in film and television. Unlike the idealized wise teacher who takes vow of
                                           poverty for the greater good and to be sacrificed at the altar of progressivism, the media
                                           narratives of teachers begin to shift from saint/martyr to the white savior trope. In this
                                           framing, the white outsider comes to a chaotic urban school to save the "unwashed"
                                           masses inhabiting urban areas. This tale is the same, tired tale of the colonial narratives
                                           inherent in the Westerns and "cowboy" movies that framed our conceptions of Western
                                           Expansionism. This type of narrative, as seen in the classic westerns of this era, requires
                                           a white settler, usually fallen from grace, to tame the "wilderness" and the people,
                                           typically depicted as savages, who live in these "wild" lands. If we transpose the settler
                                           colonialism myths behind Western Expansionism and Manifest Destiny with
                                           impoverished urban centers populated with mostly working class people of color and the
                                           teacher as the white savior (settler), the stories become strikingly similar.

                                                 Chapters four and six will delve deeper into the legacy of Brown v. Board of
                                           Education, however, the impact of this monumental decision shaped how the media
                                           framed narratives on schools and teachers. The Supreme Court's decision has enormous
                                           consequences on the schools in communities of color as the era of school integration
THE CULTUR AL NARR ATIVES OF TEACHERS                                                        11

began. Many teachers of color lost their jobs as the schools in their communities
shuttered as policy makers bussed their students to schools in predominantly white areas.
These narratives of displacement and loss of community were lost in the romanticism
surrounding the 1950s with films like Dead Poets Society and Mona Lisa Smile from the
1980s to the early 2000s. Meanwhile, in the 1950s film and television began in earnest to
mythologize the white savior trope in popular culture.

      The Blackboard Jungle (1955) stands in contrast to the idealized version of the
white suburbia portrayed in popular television shows like Leave it to Beaver (1957-1963)
and Father Knows Best (1954-1960). Consider the opening preamble to The Blackboard
Jungle:

      We, in the United States, are fortunate to have a school system that is a tribute to
our communities and to our faith in American youth. Today we are concerned with
juvenile delinquency-and its effects. We are especially concerned when this delinquency
boils over into our schools. The scenes and incidents depicted here are fictional.
However, we believe awareness is a first step toward a remedy for any problem.

      Suddenly, in the wake of the landmark decision in Brown v. Board of Education,
the media created a spectacle on juvenile delinquency in schools. However, this spectacle
could not coexist with the idyllic concept of America developing in the growing suburbs
where the public policy of redlining continued to segregate people of color out of the
"white picket fence" American Dream. Films and other media like The Blackboard
Jungle that create stories about scary juveniles in these dangerous urban areas exacerbated
white flight out of urban cities like Detroit, Cleveland, Chicago, and Oakland. The
subtext of films like The Blackboard Jungle were more about alleviating white guilt as
more affluent, White people abandoned these cities than the manufactured problem of
juvenile delinquency. Cities experiencing white flight were now left without adequate
revenue streams to fund schools via property taxes. It is easy to explain away racism
and classism if there is a perceived, or manufactured threat we must flee from. After all,
the media "are effective and powerful ideological institutions that carry out a system-
supportive propaganda function...without overt coercion" (Herman & Chomsky, 1988,
p. 306). At this time, the media helped manufacture a fear of urban areas and urban
youth that can be easily seen in more modern media of our current time.

      While most media portrayed urban schools as places overrun by "dangerous" youth,
Welcome Back, Kotter (1975-1979), a sit-com set in a public high school in Brooklyn
did begin to challenge and subvert mainstream narratives about urban schools, teachers,
and youth. In Welcome Back, Kotter, a new teacher, Gabe Kotter, returns to his former
school to teach kids tracked into remedial classes. The group of kids in the remedial
program are known as the Sweathogs. Mr. Kotter was previously a Sweathog when he
was a student at that same high school. Unlike other portrayals of new teachers in urban
schools who are typically white, war veterans like Mr. Dadier in the The Blackboard
Jungle, Mr. Kotter has grown up and is a member of this community. On the first
day of class, his new students, the Sweathogs, welcome him into the classroom with a
mural painted on the wall showcasing Mr. Kotter's membership as a former Sweathog
and return to their community. The Sweathogs, like their teacher Mr. Kotter, triumph
over the deficit perspectives of the administration, teachers, and students of the school.
12 RESTORYING EDUCATION

                                           Welcome Back, Kotter is a welcome reprieve that challenges stereotypes and deficit
                                           perspectives of teachers and students.

                                                       Mike Rose (1944-2021) was a scholar and critic of literacy education and student
                                                       tracking. As a high school student, Mike Rose was placed on a vocational track due
                                                       to a combination of a mix up of test scores and his working-class background. One
                                                       of his high school English teachers advocated for Mike and was moved to the honors
                                                       or college prep track where he excelled and went on to pursue a career in higher
                                                       education. As a distinguished teacher educator at UCLA, Rose would go on to
                                                       become a vocal critic of tracking especially among students from working class
                                                       backgrounds. Mike Rose would go on to write his seminal autoethnography Lives
                                                       on the Boundary (1989). In this book, Mike Rose would challenge deficit
                                                       perspectives and normative definitions of intelligence. He encouraged high
                                                       expectations and an emphasis on critical thinking for all students rather than
                                                       remedial curriculum typical of students tracked into vocational education.
                                                       Critical Discussion Questions:
                                                       1. Have you ever experienced being tracked into specific courses based on

                                                            standardized testing? If so, how did that make you feel?
                                                       2. What are the implications of tracking on students in terms of higher educational

                                                            opportunities? Is this equitable?
                                                       3. What might teachers do to challenge ability tracking to provide more equitable

                                                            education for students in their classrooms?

From the Quirky to the Profane: Teachers in Film and Television in the 1980s and 1990s

The challenging narrative of Welcome Back, Kotter would erode, however, in the wake
of an economic and ideological shift that began during the show's span on television.
In 1983, the National Commision on Excellence spearheaded by the Reagan
administration published A Nation at Risk: The Imperative for Educational Reform.
This report would dramatically shift federal educational policy towards market-based
neoliberalism that still undergirds much of federal education policy. Chapter four will
discuss in detail how educational policy shifted from a liberal economic ideology to
neoliberalism and its effects on education. One result of the Nation at Risk report is
that public discourse began shifting the blame for inequities in education from the
material conditions of society like poverty. As the blame shifted from the material,
film and television depicted teachers and schools also moved to align with the cultural
narratives of teachers proposed by A Nation at Risk report. The report unabashedly
framed teachers and their lack of preparation as the primary reason for the "failing"
schools. Good teachers, the wise sage of the past generation's narratives, were now either
quirky diamonds in the rough or objects of justified ridicule.

      Where Welcome Back, Kotter challenged our perceptions on teachers, students,
and the social conditions influencing education, television shows like Head of the Class
(1986-1991) flipped the script on the premise of a gifted teacher returning home to
reconnect and support students tracked into remediation and failure. Charlie Moore
a substitute teacher who has "taught in the toughest high schools in New York City"
(Season 1, Episode 1) happens to land a full-time job teaching a group of overachievers
in an Individualized Honors Program (IHP).Up to this point, the IHP class worked
independently without the need of formal instruction. The substitute teacher, it seems,
was there to "just babysit and nothing more," according to the principal. Instead of
a teacher returning to his community and school, a quirky substitute teacher helps
socially awkward high-achievers navigate the social norms and expectations of teenagers
like asking someone to the dance. Mr. Moore is successful due to his idiosyncrasies
rather than professional competencies-he is "just a substitute," however. The teacher,
therefore, must rise above the profane educational system that has failed the youth
according to A Nation at Risk. The American ideal of rugged individualism has now
infected the discourse on what it means to be a successful teacher. The same students
can be seen between when juxtaposing Mr. Kotter's Sweathogs and Mr. Moore's IHP
students. Head of the Class erases the systemic and material conditions that tracked the
Sweathogs into remediation, since it is clear these kids just did not apply themselves
to rise out of poverty like the IHP kids. The teacher, then, is irrelevant to society as
a whole. Teachers and students must apply themselves individually irregardless of the
material conditions of poverty and educational consequences brought on them by food
and housing insecurity. If teachers and their students cannot rise above the mediocrity
of their peers like Mr. Moore and the IHP students, then teachers and students alike
may set themselves up to become objects or ridicule and scorn.

      Amy Heckerling's iconoclastic teen movie Fast Times at Ridgemont (1982)
quintessentially captures the shifting ridicule and scorn for teachers and students who
14 RESTORYING EDUCATION

                                           fail to apply themselves socially or educationally. While the primary focus of the film is
                                           on a hodgepodge of teens navigating the teenage wilderness where parents and caring
                                           adults are remarkably absent, two teachers, Mr. Vargas and Mr. Hand, offer tertiary
                                           guidance as the students attempt to survive another year at Ridgemont High. Mr. Vargas
                                           the zany Biology teacher offers a comic refrain where asks students to "have a heart"
                                           as he just switched from regular coffee to Sanka-a decaffeinated instant coffee powder;
                                           or, neglects to catch the entire class cheating on a test because he is too focused on
                                           solving a rubik's cube. Unlike the eccentric Mr. Vargas, Mr. Hand serves as the stern,
                                           no-nonsense foil to one of his American History students, Jeff Spicoli-a continuously
                                           stoned buffoon, who daydreams of surfing and catching a "tasty buzz." Mr. Hand
                                           derides his students for failing testing by dropping exams of his failing students like soiled
                                           linen in the hamper. He also makes Jeff Spicoli as an object of ridicule multiple times
                                           including a scene where Spicoli enthusiastically orders a pizza to the class so he can have
                                           some food and learn about Cuba. Mr. Hand and Spicoli are redeemed on the night of the
                                           last dance of the school year. Mr. Hand shows up to Spicolis house, interrupting Spicoli's
                                           plans to go to the dance with his friends. Mr. Hands decided to lecture on all the major
                                           topics of his American History class to pay back Spicoli for all the time Spicoli wasted
                                           in his class. The two end the spontaneous remediation session amicably with Mr. Hand
                                           passing Spicoli in American History.

                                                 The absurdity of teaching and teachers in Fast Times at Ridgemont High reflects
                                           the premise of A Nation at Risk: Our educational system is failing because of the
                                           unmotivated work ethic of the teachers and students. Therefore, in order to save our
                                           failing public, policymakers must shift from the traditional liberal education outlined
                                           by early educational leaders like Horace Mann in the 19th century or the principles of
                                           progressive education developed by Dewey in the early 20th century. While hyperbole
                                           in the film, the buffoonish teacher becomes an apocryphal story told by every politician
                                           who wants to shift blame for inadequately funding high-needs schools. These policy
                                           makers seek to mythologize narratives about absurd teachers who haphazardly socially
                                           promote lazy students instead of remediation or removal. Most teachers, then , must
                                           become the stern managers tasked with overseeing the mediocre, unmotivated students
                                           to ensure financially justifying the institution to taxpayers. However, if a teacher is a
                                           brave and idiosyncratic teacher who can challenge students despite the institutional
                                           failings of public education as asserted by A Nation at Risk, then that teacher transcends
                                           to become the idealized teacher-a return to the teacher as saint/martyr. One film from
                                           the 1980s that acutely depicts this phenomenon is Stand and Deliver (1988).

                                                 Stand and Deliver (1988) is a biographical account of Mr. Escalante's inspiring
                                           story on how he challenged the institutional and societal expectations of his
                                           predominantly Hispanic remedial math student. Mr. Escalante diligently challenged the
                                           deficit perspectives of his students and worked tirelessly with his students to pass the
                                           Advanced Placement by the end of their senior year. Mr. Escalante's work is admirable
                                           and his story continues to inspire teachers to this day. His story, however, again frames
                                           teaching as a saintly calling. Teachers must internalize these narratives where they must
                                           sacrifice their identities outside of teaching in order to be successful teaching, especially
                                           if their students lack the material and social resources needed to be more successful.
THE CULTUR AL NARR ATIVES OF TEACHERS                                                           15

After all, Mr. Escalante devoted much of his free time to remediating his students in
the summer over the course of several years. The cultural narratives inspired by Mr.
Escalante's success tacitly demands the successful teacher to make up for the lack of
material and social support which should be provided by the school system at large.
Every year, the tales of teachers buying their students notebooks, pencils, and other
supplies is ubiquitous to the point that it is a cultural expectation inherent in teaching.
This echoes the expectations of teachers in the 19th century common schools we
highlighted earlier in the chapter. This is just the neoliberal transformation of the teacher
as saint/martyr.

    White Saviors and Martyrs: Mediating Teachers at the Turn of the 21st Century

A key principle of neoliberalism is that limited oversight from the state leads to better
economic outcomes. Neoliberalism assumes limited oversight and the fundamentals of
the marketplace allows space for competition where those with the best "product" will
(theoretically) succeed while the inferior products will fail. In film, we see this in stories
of individual teachers who turn a failing classroom or school into a success. This success
happens, in most cases, without the support of the school system, or perhaps in spite of
it. For example, Dangerous Minds (1995) tells the story of LouAnne Johnson (played
by Michelle Pfeiffer), a former marine, during her first year teaching English at an urban
high school in California. Her class is primarily made up of low-income students of
color, many of whom are in gangs.

      The students are initially difficult, taunting Johnson and showing no interest in
doing what she asks. However, Johnson finds early success by teaching students karate
and offering them extrinsic rewards like candy and field trips. Next, she finds success in
teaching them poetry by connecting the work of Dylan Thomas to the lyrics of Bob
Dylan. While connecting poetry to her students' lived experiences can be considered
an innovative way to increase student engagement, Johnson explicitly disregards her
school's adopted curricula, often acting in opposition to school administrators and
colleagues. The message viewers can take away from this is clear: an individual teacher
was successful because she took the initiative to create and try out-of-the-box strategies
while the oversight her school attempted to provide would have prevented her success.
In other words, innovative individual teachers can be successful if they work against an
educational system that is ineffective.

      It's important to note that while Dangerous Minds is based on a true story which
Johnson wrote about in My posse don't do homework, the film portrays her relationship
with school administration as more confrontational than it really was. For example, in
the movie Johnson argues with the school principal about a book she is required to teach,
claiming it is too easy for students; in reality, this book was not required by the school but
rather one that Johnson introduced and was later removed after her students chose more
complex texts (Lowe, 2001). While we do not know the filmmakers' intention with this
change, portraying Johnson's relationship with school administration as confrontational
does support an individual versus the system narrative.

      A similar message, which scholars have described as the "superteacher" (Farhi,
16 RESTORYING EDUCATION

                                           1999) or "hero" (Lowe, 2001) message can be seen in other popular films such as Sister
                                           Act 2 (1993) and Kindergarten Cop (1990): an individual teacher is able to make
                                           significant positive changes by implementing their own ideas that are often at odds with
                                           the school system they are working in. However, there are other important messages
                                           within films such as these.

                                                 First, these remarkable teachers have no formal teacher training and instead are
                                           successful by using their knowledge and skills from previous jobs (e.g., the music teacher
                                           in Sister Act 2 was previously a lounge singer, the teacher in Kindergarten Cop is
                                           an undercover police officer). These teachers are therefore examples of the outsider/
                                           disrupter trope, reinforcing the message that anyone can be a successful teacher (and
                                           perhaps oversight of who becomes a teacher, namely state requirements of teacher
                                           training, are unnecessary).

                                                 Second, urban schools and communities are portrayed as run-down and gang-
                                           ridden with parents and students who do not value education; whereas, suburban
                                           schools and communities are safe and prosperous with parents and students who value
                                           education. Further, as in Dangerous Minds and other films like The Substitute I (1996)
                                           and The Substitute II: School's Out (1998) hearkens back to the white savior of The
                                           Blackboard Jungle. In these films the remarkable teacher who finds success in urban
                                           schools is white, sending the message that urban schools need a "white hero" (Lowe,
                                           2001) or "white teacher savior" (Cann, 2015) to save them. In doing so, these films
                                           exemplify the white savior trope, reinforcing the dominance of Whiteness and position
                                           people of color as lacking or deficient. Moreover, the ability of one white teacher to
                                           "save" their students or school ignores the very real institutional racism that has led
                                           urban schools to be under-funded and under-resourced for decades (Cann, 2015).

                                                 The sunny portrayal of suburban communities and schools is also evident in many
                                           TV shows from the 1990s, including Boy Meets World (1993-2000), Saved by the Bell
                                           (1989-1993), and even The Magic School Bus (1994-1998). Students in each of these
                                           shows (generally) attend school regularly and show respect for adults. Issues such as
                                           drugs, crime, and family challenges do occur, however they are limited to a specific
                                           individual or brief incident (e.g., Shawn in Boy Meets World is the "rebel" character or
                                           Jessie in Saved By the Bell struggling with a caffeine pill addiction in one episode) which
                                           is a sharp contrast to gangs and violence being portrayed as deep-rooted issues for entire
                                           urban school communities.

                                                 Regarding teachers, we can see both some similarities and differences in how they
                                           are portrayed in TV shows compared to the previously discussed films. For example,
                                           while the teachers in these shows all have formal teacher education, they can also be
                                           considered heroes due to the profound impact they have on students' lives. This heroism
                                           requires teachers to do more than be innovative in their teaching or push back against the
                                           system - they often need to act in ways that are unrealistic or impossible. In The Magic
                                           School Bus, Ms. Frizzle uses magic(!) to teach her students, at one point shrinking them
                                           to microscopic sizes so they can explore the inside of the human body (Jacobs, 1994).
                                           In Boy Meets World, the main teacher, Mr. Feeny lives next door to the show's main
                                           character, Cory; he often offers guidance and life advice when they see each other in their
                                           neighboring yards and has a personal relationship with Cory's parents. Another teacher,
THE CULTUR AL NARR ATIVES OF TEACHERS                                                        17

Mr. Turner, allows a student to live with him when his parents can no longer provide for
him. Here, we see aspects of the martyr trope in that teachers can have a profound impact
on students if they go above and beyond the classroom responsibilities expected of them
by the educational system. Teachers must be willing to blur the boundaries between their
professional and personal lives (or the boundaries between reality and magic) to support
students no matter where or when. Furthermore, we see aspects of the wise sage/saint
trope, as these teachers are experts in their content knowledge, put the needs of their
students first, and always seem to be able to "save the day."

      In both TV and film, we see individual teachers, rather than the broader school
system and community, as responsible for students' learning and well-being. More
importantly, we see the message that to be a teacher is to be a martyr because you must
be willing to sacrifice your personal boundaries, resources, and passions to always put
your students first both in and outside of the classroom. To be clear, this martyr image
of teachers is also true in the urban school films discussed earlier, as the challenges
the white savior teacher persevered through included spending their own money on
supplies, working with students outside of class time, and blurring the lines between
their professional and personal lives. However, we could assume this was necessary
because of the substantial challenges that urban schools present. But seeing that this
is the case for teachers regardless if they are in a tough urban school or a prosperous
suburban school shows that all teachers are expected to be martyrs.

      The white savior/martyr image of individual teachers persisted throughout the
1990s and continued throughout the 2000s. For example, scholars have discussed how
Freedom Writers (2007) echoes the white savior messages of Dangerous Minds (Cann,
2015). However, the 2000s also mark a shift in the seriousness with which teachers
are portrayed. While individual teachers can make a difference in students' lives, these
teachers are often lovable buffoons, who act unprofessionally and have messy, silly or
chaotic personal lives.

      Buffoonery in the Digital Media Age: Teacher Narratives in the 21st Century

While there were always narratives that had buffoonish teachers through most of the era
of film and television, these teachers were usually ancillary, side-characters juxtaposed
to the serious saint/martyr teacher. Consider the film School of Rock (2003), where
a struggling musician, Dewey Finn, becomes a substitute teacher by impersonating his
roommate who happens to be a teacher because Dewey desperately needs money to pay
his bills. Dewey is not trained as a teacher, yet despite this he is able to secure a long-
term teaching position using his charm and skill of deception. While acting as a teacher,
he repeatedly behaves in ways a teacher should not: he deceives school administrators,
students and parents, does not teach required content, and uses class time to have
students form a band and prepare for an upcoming music competition. In the end,
however, Dewey has not only won over school administrators and parents but has given
his students increased confidence, maturity, and passion; the film ends with Dewey
becoming a music tutor.

      While such an ending makes for a heartfelt story, the lovable buffoon trope it
18 RESTORYING EDUCATION

                                           exemplifies is problematic. First, it closely mirrors the outsider/disruptor trope that
                                           anyone can be a teacher, especially those who act in ways that contradict the educational
                                           system. Second, the lovable buffoon's ability to shift the focus of school from developing
                                           students' content knowledge to other activities results in a film that is set in a school
                                           where "school" (e.g., learning science, social studies, mathematics, english, art, music,
                                           etc.) does not actually take place. In other words, we see school become a place in
                                           which activities other than traditional learning are the priority, with no (or very few)
                                           images of student learning taking place. This can be seen in other films and TV such as
                                           Mean Girls (2004), 10 Things I Hate About You (1999), or Glee (2009 - 2015) where
                                           the teachers are messy/chaotic and, while sometimes well intentioned, the students are
                                           mostly focused on anything but academics.

                                                 This focus away from academics and formal curriculum makes sense when
                                           thinking about movie audiences-who wants to watch 90 minutes of someone learning
                                           why "the limit does not exist!"? Further, there is a very real argument to be had over
                                           what content should be the focus of K-12 schooling-does every student need to learn
                                           geometry? However, we must also consider the broader message it sends about teaching
                                           and school. For example, is it tenable or effective for narratives set in school to have
                                           the central focus of the characters and plot be the place where students are taught the
                                           knowledge needed to be effective citizens, skilled workers, and/or change their social
                                           position? Or is more tenable or effective to produce narratives about teachers who use
                                           the setting of school as an extension of their personal lives (e.g., winning a battle of the
                                           bands in School of Rock or writing a novel in 10 Things I Hate About You) instead of
                                           teaching students, who in turn prioritize extracurricular activities (e.g., music in Glee)
                                           or schemes about their social lives (e.g., romantic relationships, navigating friendships)?
                                           The images in film and TV suggest the latter, and together support a broader narrative
                                           that the K-12 education system is broken and teachers are part of the problem. Further,
                                           if these types of narratives are consumed enough, it is reasonable to see how we, as
                                           educators, and the broader public could become skeptical of teachers' knowledge, their
                                           professionalism, and even the importance of K-12 education in general. In turn, this
                                           skepticism can impact public attitudes towards things like proposed increases to
                                           teachers' salaries, union protections, or the use of standardized testing to measure
                                           teacher effectiveness.

                                                 It is important to note that the villain trope, which has been present in film and TV
                                           for decades, also contributes to this problematic narrative. The images of Mr. Rooney in
                                           Ferris Bueller's Day Off (1986), Mr. Hand in Fast Times and Ridgemont High (1982),
                                           Mr. Vernon in The Breakfast Club (1985), or Sue Sylvester in Glee (2009-2015), portray
                                           individuals who do not find joy in their work and appear to consider their relationship
                                           with students to be confrontational. As with the lovable buffoon, movie and TV viewers
                                           are left to question the professionalism and quality of instruction teachers can provide.

                                                 This problematic narrative has unfortunately continued to persist: in Bad Teacher
                                           (2011), Cameron Diaz plays a woman who hates teaching and only becomes a teacher
                                           after a divorce leaves her in need of money; Fist Fight (2017) focuses on two teachers
                                           getting into a physical altercation on the last day of school; teachers in Disney's Girl
                                           Meets World (2014-2017) and Jessie (2011-2015) complain about being underpaid,
THE CULTUR AL NARR ATIVES OF TEACHERS                                                          19

vocally dislike their jobs, and are often the butt of a joke (Attick, 2016). However, the
2010's also brought a glimmer of hope as some TV and film began to take aim at other
players in K-12 education and even portray teachers in a positive light.

      For example, the main character of the sit-com New Girl (2011-2018) is Jessica
Day, a trained teacher who cares for her students and is often trying to pull together
meaningful learning opportunities for her students. Barriers to those opportunities are
not her own buffoonery or problematic students, but issues within the broader
educational system such the connection of school funding to agendas of local politicians
or the impact of funding on students' access to technology and the ability to conduct
field trips. To be fair, supporting characters do include teacher colleagues who reflect the
buffoon and villain tropes; as a comedy, the show certainly has buffoonery. However, the
silliness and chaos are part of the quirkiness of the character rather than a detriment to
students.

      Taking a different approach, a Comedy Central sketch by Keegan- Michael Key and
Jordan Peele from 2015 takes aim at the K-12 education system by conducting a teacher
draft (Teaching Center, 2015; see references and chapter activity for link)).

       Activity:

       1. Watch the Teaching Center comedy sketch by Key and Peele discussed above:
            https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dkHqPFbxmOU&t=1s. Consider the
            following questions:

       2. How is this portrayal of teachers different from those seen in tv and movies?
       3. Why do you think this parody was presented as a sports draft?
       4. If this was really how teachers were treated, what would the impact be on K-12

            schools?

      A parody of the NFL draft, the sketch shows an alternate reality in which the
neediest schools receive the highest quality educators; in addition, the teachers drafted
to these schools are paid millions and receive lucrative endorsement deals. In reality,
professional athletes are the ones who receive this treatment while many low-performing
schools struggle to find qualified educators (Podolsky et al., 2016) while teacher salaries
continue to decline (Walker, 2023). When commenting on a "highlight" video of a high
school social studies teacher calling on a student during a discussion, one commentator
notes, "See what she did there? She's bringing an introvert into the discussion, ya'll.
That's a teacher of the year play, right there." Another commentator adds, "You know,
the confidence gained by [that student] by answering that question correctly will
enhance his performance throughout the rest of the year." This explicit recognition of
real instructional strategies that teachers use to engage students is a sharp contrast to the
silly or tyrannical methods shown in past media. Overall, this sketch is a clear critique of
how our society treats those responsible for educating our nation's youth in comparison
to those who provide entertainment.

      Up until now, most examples in this chapter have centered on White teachers.
Throughout the decades, there have been some educators of color in TV and film, but
20 RESTORYING EDUCATION

                                           these numbers are limited (in part due to issues of representation in media). Such films
                                           include To Sir, with Love (1967), the aforementioned Stand and Deliver (1988), and
                                           Lean on Me (1989). While these films portray teachers of color as caring and capable,
                                           they often tell the story of real individuals (e.g., Stand and Deliver is based on the true
                                           story of high school math teacher Jaime Escalante). More importantly, these are teachers
                                           who uphold the status quo (Beyerbach, 2005), helping students be successful in the
                                           current educational system rather than work to bring about an educational system that
                                           is more equitable and socially just.

                                                 The TV series Abbott Elementary (2021-current) may be considered a recent, and
                                           notable, step in how teachers are portrayed in popular media. The show follows a group
                                           of mostly Black educators as they navigate the Philadelphia public school system (the
                                           show is shot as a mockumentary like The Office). The focus on a diverse group of
                                           educators is a significant shift. What makes it more notable is that a primary source of
                                           conflict is the educational system (e.g., inept administrators, limited funding, insufficient
                                           district professional development; Principal Ava is... Not quite helpful, 202) rather than
                                           the teachers. In fact, conflict resolution usually occurs when the teachers come together
                                           in solidarity to support one another. For example, in the clip cited above (see reference
                                           and chapter activity for link) Janine is unable to get her classroom rug replaced by the
                                           district when her principal spends the allocated funds on a new school sign. In the end,
                                           her colleague Melissa gets new rugs through a "friend" outside of school. Here we see
                                           some buffoonery as it is implied that Melissa's "friend" works construction and stole
                                           the rug from his job renovating the Philadelphia Eagles stadium, but as with New Girl
                                           the buffoonery is part of a character's comedic quirkiness and not a detriment to the
                                           students.

                                                       Activity:

                                                       1. Watch the following clips from Abbott Elementary. Describe how the teachers
                                                            and administrators are portrayed in these clips.

                                                       2. Principal Ava is... not quite helpful: https://www.youtube.com/

                                                       3. Barbara and Melissa give Gregory teaching advice: https://www.youtube.com/
                                                            watch?v=_RObnudYWk8&list=PLRy6W5nz84Qbg7JndWxc5pV4PoWFLzgB
                                                            t&index=4&t=1s

                                                       4. Compare and contrast this portrayal of teachers and administrators to those
                                                            previously discussed in the chapter. Come up with at least two similarities and
                                                            two differences.

                                                 The theme of teachers helping teachers is a constant throughout Abbott
                                           Elementary. Another example can be seen when teachers Barbara and Melissa offer
                                           advice to Gregory who is struggling to teach math. What is notable about this clip is
                                           that not only do Barbara and Melissa help Gregory, but they do so without placing
                                           blame on students or advocating for lecture-based instructional methods; they position
                                           students from an asset-based perspective by explaining the importance, and sensibility,
THE CULTUR AL NARR ATIVES OF TEACHERS                                                          21

of what students think and offering ways to make learning more fun. Thinking back to
how teacher-student relationships were portrayed as confrontation in past media, this is
a stark contrast.

      Abbott Elementary also takes on other issues in K-12 education. Explicit
conversations about teacher Jacob's identity as a "woke," gay, White male teacher in
a predominantly Black school acknowledge the reality of white savior-ism. A gifted
and talented program leads to discussions of how tracking negatively impacts student
identities and classroom dynamics. Efforts to turn Abbott and nearby schools into
charter schools reveal why charter schools are not the magical solution they are often
portrayed to be legacy media and political discourse; charter schools are not legally
required to accept all students, often employ uncertified teachers, and are funded with
dollars that would otherwise go towards public schools.

      Overall, the message from Abbott Elementary is that the K-12 education system is
far from perfect but that teachers are not to blame. Instead, teachers are often fighting an
uphill battle against issues that can only be addressed at the systemic, or even legislative,
level. It is no surprise that teachers reportedly "feel seen" by Abbott Elementary (Juhasz,
2023). We, as educators, look forward to seeing more narratives about schools, teachers,
and students that challenge or subvert the harmful narratives of teachers and youth
depicted by popular media in the past.

WHY THIS MATTERS

This chapter is grounded in the idea that the media helps construct cultural narratives
and beliefs about teachers and teaching and these narratives shape how we see ourselves
as teachers and our students. But why is it important that you develop this critical lens
and view media differently? First, as this chapter has shown, learning more about the
dominant narratives found within media allows you to view media through a different,
more critical lens. That is, we, as educators and critical consumers of media, need to see
media as not just entertainment, but also think about the message it sends about those it
portrays. We encourage you to watch any of the different TV shows or movies discussed
throughout this chapter to "see" the different narratives we discussed (that's right - you
college textbook is telling you to go watch TV and movies!). You may be surprised at the
new things you now notice. Second, you can use this lens to critically reflect on your own
beliefs about teachers and teaching. Such reflection will allow you to think about how
your actions as a (future) teacher push back on, or perpetuate, the problematic narratives
discussed here. And finally, it can help prepare you for how others who are not educators,
but consume such popular media, may view you once you become a teacher. It will not
make it less frustrating when someone downplays the amount of time and effort it takes
for you to prepare an engaging lesson, for example, but at least you will know such a view
has been shaped by decades of media.
22 RESTORYING EDUCATION

                                         POST-READING ACTIVITIES AND
                                         CONSOLIDATING UNDERSTANDING:

                                                       1. Watch a movie that, at least partially, takes place in a school. Identify the teacher
                                                            trope(s) you see, including the evidence you used to make your identification,
                                                            and what message(s) about teaching, school, and students the movie is sending.
                                                            Analyses can be shared as an argumentative essay or presentation.

                                                       2. A key argument of this chapter is that images in the media shape our
                                                            understanding of teaching, school, and students. For this activity, go interview
                                                            three people and ask them what they think about teachers and K-12 education.
                                                            Then ask them what movie/TV teachers are memorable to them and why.
                                                            Reflect on any themes, connections, or other notable findings from your
                                                            interview.

                                                       3. Teaching is not like it is in film and television as this chapter argues. There are
                                                            many steps to becoming a licensed, professional teacher. The following list
                                                            outlines the requisite steps necessary to become a certified teacher in the state of
                                                            New York, however the steps are not in chronological order. Research the
                                                            requirements one needs to obtain your initial teaching license and put these
                                                            steps in chronological order. Different states have different requirements for
                                                            teacher licensure. However, the steps in Appendix A are very similar to other
                                                            states' pathways to becoming a teacher. After reorganizing the steps
                                                            chronologically, map out your own progress in becoming a teacher as many of
                                                            these requirements begin very early in your teacher education program. In class
                                                            facilitators may use this outline as an in-class collaborative remixing or jigsaw
                                                            discussion activity. The answer key is located as an appendix at the at of the
                                                            chapter.

                                                       Steps to Obtaining New York State Professional Teaching License

                                                       1. Complete and log your professional development hours yearly on TEACH; this
                                                            is needed for recertification.

                                                       3. Meet all of your non-degree requirements (such as maintaining a 3.0 average in
                                                            your education classes).

                                                       4. Be recommended for certification by your college.
                                                       5. Successfully complete student or clinical teaching.

GLOSSARY

Asset-Based Perspective: A way of viewing students through their strengths and the
funds of knowledge learned in their communities that they bring into the classroom.
These funds of knowledge are seen as positive assets. This perspective contrasts a deficit
perspective of students.

Deficit Perspective: A way of viewing students, typically from historically marginalized
communities, as solely responsible for the challenges they experience in education. This
perspective blames the student, parenting, and upbringing rather than the oppressive
structures and policies that created these challenges in the first place. Teachers who say,
"my students can't do this or that, because they need these remedial skills first," or "there
families just don't value education," are complicit and replicate a deficit perspective
upon their students.

Extrinsic Reward: A tangible, external reward visible to others. These rewards can be
material like food (candy) or immaterial like stickers.

Frame: The way a communicator constructs and communicates a message in order to
highlight, obscure, or hide some aspects of the message over others.

Hidden Curriculum: Unwritten lessons, values, prejudice, or perspectives on students
and learning created in the formal curriculum.

Hegemony: The systematic maintenance of oppression of a group or groups of people
over another for the purposes of exerting dominance-ideologically, socially, politically,
or economically.

Neoliberal(ism): A political and economic ideology that advocates for deregulation of
the free market. It advocates for privatization of the public commons, like schools or

                                           efficient than nationally or locally run public entities.

                                           Trope: A figurative use of a word, expression, or convention that is nonliteral and
                                           connects to more abstract concepts or ideas. Metaphors and similes are types of tropes.

                   Social Constructionism: Between the Real and the Ideal

Within the philosophical spectrum that separates Western philosophy between realism
on one side and idealism on the other, the central premise of social constructionism
connects an objective reality separate from human beings (realism) and abstract forms
and ideas existing in a non-physical, timeless universe beyond our physical reality
(idealism). Like Cordova's (2007) philosophical worldview, social constructionism
positions human beings within a universe where everything we come to know and
conceive about the world is interpreted through our embodied interaction with each
other and the world. Unlike Cordova's worldview, however, just as other philosophical
paradigms stemming from Western philosophies, social constructionism removes the
world as primordial to our lived experience and existence. Social constructionism places
the singular human as the central authority that exercises agency to interpret and rule
over the physical world. Social constructionism can help reveal how we socially construct
our conceptual understanding of our physical reality; however, we should foreground
our own embedded relationship with the world as we develop and transform our
understanding of the world.

                             a social concept continues to be redefined and constructed. For example, the Irish were
                             not seen as "white" by the socially constructed "in-group" already marked by whiteness
                             until the mid-20th century. Moreover, a racialized Other may receive "honorary"
                             membership within the "in-group" within certain social circumstances. Black feminist
                             theorist and sociologist Patricia Hill Collins (2009) recounts how she received honorary
                             whiteness on a tour of apartheid South Africa. Collins also points out that individuals
                             who may be initially marked white by the larger society may receive honorary Blackness.
                             This honorary membership occurs either by explicit transgressions against "in-group"
                             rules and norms or by growing up, living, and demonstrating solidarity within
                             communities of color. If there was any external realism or biologically determined
                             essence of race, these amorphous transformations of whiteness tied to specific historical
                             and geographic contexts would not be possible.

                                   Not only do we continually construct and reconstruct concepts like race, we also
                             socially shape our attitudes and beliefs toward these concepts. For example, take how the
                             media frames our perceptions of poverty and those experiencing the trauma of poverty.
                             Rather than framing those living in poverty with empathy and care, the media (news,
                             film, television, and social media) constructs a narrative of those living in poverty as
                             "lazy" or "mentally ill." Therefore, we, as a society, can justify ignoring their trauma
                             because they "chose" to live in poverty where they continually live in constant insecurity:
                             safety, food, and housing. If we were to see their humanity and their belonging in our
                             community, we would then have to critically analyze an economic system that creates
                             and depends on poverty to sustain itself. As Cordova (2007) points out, we need to
                             develop our determined role of how to be human in our world. We cannot care for our
                             place and community if we ignore invisible others in our place and community. The
                             continual constructed invisibility of those living in poverty is not sustainable because it

ignores the systematic structures that erode, disconnect, and alienate ourselves from our
world, place, and community.

      We, as educators, should critically examine our own attitudes and beliefs not only
about broader social issues like poverty, but our attitudes toward content and
curriculum. One example is teachers' attitudes toward reading and writing. There is
substantive research over several decades that reveal teachers' own attitudes about
reading affect their students' own attitudes and motivation for reading (Brophy, 1986;
Nathanson, Pruslow, & Levitt, 2008; Skinner & Belmont, 1993; Sweet, Guthrie, & Ng,
1998). This means that if a teacher has negative attitudes toward reading or writing,
these negative attitudes will instill negative attitudes toward reading and writing in
their students. Research (Aguirre & Spencer, 1999; Beswick, 2007; Borko, Peressini,
Romagno, et al., 2000; Conner & Singletary, 2021) has also shown a similar phenomena
in mathematics education. These studies found how math teachers' beliefs about
teaching and doing math impacted their instruction, which included the teachers' goals
and the types of teaching strategies they used. Our own attitudes toward certain content
disciplines have already been shaped by our own shared experiences as students with our
previous teachers and classmates. Our attitude toward the content we plan to teach has
been socially constructed. Therefore, we need to critically examine these attitudes and
beliefs before we can begin articulating our own philosophy on teaching and learning.

the social constructivist frameworks developed by Vygotsky, Leont'ev, and others into a
broader, more comprehensive theory of knowledge. Within Engeström's system of
activities (Figure 2.2), a subject, or subjects, interact with tools or mediating artifacts,
toward an object or goal that extends outward toward the world. Within this
engagement, there are systemic rules, which can be scientific like the laws of physics or
rules and norms determined by a larger community, that, then, affect how the subject
interacts with the mediating tool or artifacts outwardly onto the world.

      How might activity theory look within a classroom setting? Take the previous
example of using LEA in a primary-grade literacy lesson. In the LEA example, the teacher
and students work together as subjects toward an outcome of formulating a written

                                           retelling of a common experience (outcome). The object is the written draft on chart

                                           read or written as a class. There are rules of syntax, e.g., the rules governing how words
                                           form larger units like phrases or sentences, and genre which shape what type of writing
                                           the class drafts together. The classroom rules and norms established by the teacher and
                                           students create a community which shapes the interaction of the subjects as well as
                                           how the division of labor is distributed. In this case, the teacher takes responsibility as
                                           scribe and chief editor while the students take responsibility for the creative labor of
                                           providing the key details and important events of the retelling. Whenever we step inside a

                            ACTIVITIES FOR GUIDING COMPREHENSION

                            1. Observe a classroom lesson either in person or using an online video. Use Figure
                                2.2 and annotate Engeström's Activity System. Who are the subjects? What are
                                the objects and outcome? What are the meditating tools and artifacts? What are
                                the rules guiding the activity? In what ways does the community (classroom)
                                shape interaction, rules, and labor? In what ways is the labor (physical and/or
                                creative) distributed? Share your annotation with a small group or class.

                            2. Social constructivist theories of knowledge still remove the individual or
                                individuals as separate from the world according to Cordova's philosophical
                                worldview. Create a remixed visual artifact using the worlding Figure 2.1 as an

                                arrows to and from the systems and world layers to show the processes and
                                transformations. Share your visual artifact with a small group or class. (Note:
                                Instructors could model and use the ZPD by drafting a partial model of how
                                they envision this artifact for the class. Remember, there are no correct or
                                incorrect ways to create these visual artifacts. The learning goal is for all the
                                learners to begin developing their own conceptual models of how philosophical
                                worldviews shape theories of knowledge.)

                            containing a past, the present, and possible futures. The world in which discourses

German, Gaelic, and other world languages current and historical. Take, for example, the
word story (narrative or tale) which contains traces of the Old French estorie that derived
from Latin historia; therefore, story and history overlap and contain traces that affect
each word's meaning. Whenever we utter a word or phrase, we utter a word or phrase
that has a prior sociocultural history. This utterance also invites new possibilities we can
reinvent for new meanings intended for new audiences. Take, for example, how young
people have reinvented terms like "brat," "rizz" (truncated form of charisma), and "for
the plot" in relation to their peers and connected youth cultures. Language and
discourse is always in play; and this play is a social, collective dialogue with a past, present,
and future.

In what ways might we apply dialogism in our practice as educators? One study (Cohen,
2009) on the pretend play of preschoolers describes how children appropriate and
assimilate each other's utterances in pretend play either playing alone, in parallel play,
or with each other. In their play, children will adopt adult roles and discourse of their
intended role. In play, children adopt roles like teachers, doctors, scientists and learn to
develop their own conceptual understandings of the social knowledge and discourses
these roles play in the community. Teachers can employ dialogism in their daily lessons
and practices. Rather than relying on teacher-centered monologues and lectures,
38 RESTORYING EDUCATION

                                           teachers can shape their classroom community that supports dialogical interaction with

communities. Once the students begin to describe these systems, they may begin to make
changes to help solve these systemic problems. Critical literacy scholar Hillary Janks
(2014) outlines one example of how teachers may apply critical pedagogy in their
classrooms. In her commentary on application of critical literacy, Janks posits five moves
teachers can move to implement critical literacy and critical pedagogy:

       1. Make connections between something that is going on in the world and their
            students' lives, where the world can be as small as the classroom or as large as
            the international stage.

       2. Consider that students will need to know and where they can find the
            information.

       3. Explore how the problematic is instantiated in texts and practices by careful
            examination of design choices and people's behavior.

       4. Examine who benefits and who is disadvantaged by imagining the social
            effects of what is going on and of its representation/s.
40 RESTORYING EDUCATION

                                            5. Imagine possibilities for making a positive difference (p. 305).

                                           Janks describes how she worked with young people on the issue of water conservation
                                           and the problems associated with bottled water. In this project, she described how she
                                           helped guide students by naming and describing issues of water conservation. Within
                                           this naming and description, students began to focus on the consumption of bottled
                                           water as an issue for student activism. Janks and other teachers assisted students in how
                                           to find relevant, valid, and reliable information using online databases. The students
                                           then began to critically evaluate the design choices and effects of bottled water labels
                                           and how media advertises bottled water to consumers. The students then engaged in
                                           exploring the social and environmental consequences of drinking bottled water. For the
                                           final project, students designed and produced an anti-bottled water campaign as a form
                                           of subversive media to inform the broader public about the negative social, economic,
                                           and environmental consequences of consuming bottled water. Janks' five critical moves

                                           learn to describe our relationship with our place and world and outline our roles as
                                           beings in relation to our world, place, and community.

                                                 The primary focus of this chapter has been to foreground the material world (land,

                                           activities teachers use in our classrooms, these philosophies also guide the curriculum
                                           schools use to develop a path for teaching and learning that span the different grade
                                           levels and development of young people. Another chapter describes these different types
                                           of curriculum in greater detail. However, as educational philosophies continue to
                                           transform, educational philosophy shapes the practice and craft of teaching. A

                                           educational theorists a chance to world a school and classroom where teachers and
                                           students have a sense of belonging to and with their community, place, and world.

                                         CONSOLIDATING UNDERSTANDING

                                                       Most teachers are required to write and articulate their philosophy of education.
                                                       Therefore, it is prudent that you, as early-career educators, begin to develop a clear
                                                       teaching philosophy that connects to how you will practice the craft of teaching in
                                                       your classrooms. Many teachers use a guiding metaphor for teaching and learning to
                                                       describe their educational philosophy (e.g., "teachers are gardeners"). Recall,
                                                       however, that Cordova (2007) explains how a verb-centered language like the Hopi
                                                       language shapes our perceptions of the world where transformation and change
                                                       foreground experience with the world; this is in contrast to languages like English
                                                       which fixate on static nouns to categorize the world. Rather than developing a

                                                       demonstrate the transformativeness of learning within a community. Write a list of
                                                       as many verbs as you can that best describes the transformative nature of teaching

       and learning. Draw and map these verbs on to a visual that captures place,
       community, school, and classroom with all the members of this learning
       community. Prepare to share your visual in groups or with the class. (Note: A
       Gallery Walk activity would be an excellent activity that showcases a dialogical
       learning activity.)
       Choose another theory of knowledge derived from a Western perspective, e.g.
       behaviorism (Skinner), constructivism (Piaget), psychoanalytical (Freud or Jung),
       etc., and analyze the absence of place, community, and school. What might explain
       these absences? Discuss in a small group or as a whole class.

concepts of critical theory to the teaching and learning goals for the students.

Dialogism: A theory of language and learning that posits that all words and phrases are
internalized and produced in the form of dialogue with other interlocutors.

Discourse: How language is used within a particular social context. For example, words,
phrases, and gestures we might use in the context of a sporting event may not be
acceptable in a more formal social context like an office or school classroom.

Ethics of Care: A philosophical worldview where the concern and care for others,
especially others who may be more vulnerable like children or people in need of medical
treatment, is primary in relation with other beings. Philosopher of education and ethics
Nel Noddings emphasizes that an ethics of Care requires we must move beyond wanting
to act to help others towards acting because we must help others.

Eurocentric: a biased worldview that asserts the supremacy of philosophy, science, art,
and culture that originated from Western Europe. Within this worldview, people from
European descent are positioned as superior to non-Western cultures.

Idealism: Greek philosopher Plato asserted there is a transcendental of absolute and
unchanging ideas that form a higher reality than the material reality of our experience.
These ideas (tables, chairs, strawberries) have immutable essences within the ideal, higher
reality.

Laboratory School: A K-12 public school directly connected to a teaching college or
university where teachers implement innovative pedagogies for the purposes of research
and improving the best practices of teaching.

Language Experience Approach: A method of teaching literacy that uses the students'
own experiences and interactions with others and the world.

                                           Pragmatism: A philosophy that asserts language and thought are used as tools to
                                           predict, solve problems, or engage in action instead as ways to describe, represent, or

                                           Realism: Greek philosopher Aristotle asserted that the universal is embedded within the
                                           particular. Therefore, we should study the form and particulars of the things (beauty,
                                           chairs, strawberries) and their relationships as they are in reality.

                                           Social Constructionism: A theory of knowledge that posits that all concepts and ideas
                                           are socially constructed and cannot be distilled that separates the material concepts and
                                           ideas in an external reality from the social world of language and human interaction.

                                           Sapir-Whorf Hypothesis: A theory of linguistic relativity where the structure of
                                           language influences the speakers' cognition and perception of the world. The 2016
                                           Oscar-nominated science-fiction film Arrival showcases this theory as its central premise.

                                           brought to task upon the learner, there is a zone where the learner can first apply
                                           the skill, the concept, or procedure with maximum support from a more experienced

Curriculum and the Purpose of
Education

Ed Beck

Before We Read

Before reading, spend some time thinking about the different decisions that teachers
make everyday as they plan their classes. The materials teachers choose, the way they
organize a class, what is emphasized or not, and what choices are offered to the
students all shape the student experience. To be an engaged teacher, it is important
to build reflective practices and the habit of making informed and deliberate
instructional choices. Think about your favorite experiences in school. What choices
did the educators make that contributed to your experience?

                            Critical Questions for Consideration

As you read, consider these essential questions: What are the goals of education?
How is the experience of the students impacted by what is written or missing into
the curriculum? What hidden lessons are we teaching students? In what ways are
we, as educators, shaping our schools and communities through our curricular and
instructional choices?

                                  An alternative way to look at curriculum is from the students' lived experiences.
Hidden Curriculum           This more holistic view of curriculum would include the lessons taught to students both

                                  However, the hidden curriculum can also affect students' academic performance
                            and reinforce inequalities. The hidden curriculum can be the place where biases or

                            performance.

                                  Paulo Freire and other critical theorists use the term critical consciousness to
                            depict individuals' deep understanding of the world, the ability to identify political and
                            social inequities, and their dedication to taking action against those systems. As an
                            educator, having a critical consciousness means regularly inspecting your own practices,
                            the materials you choose, and the way you structure your classes. An Educator must
                            consider what message and lesson they send students.

dynasties. Remembering their own History and Social Studies instruction, the educator
feels they are at a disadvantage as well, because their own teachers didn't spend a lot of
time covering the topics. While the new teacher has ideas and resources for how to add
to a unit on Rome, they feel less prepared to teach about the cultures of Africa or Asia.

        · While this story focuses on Social Studies, each certification area might have
            its own issues. What type of similar issues about content may come up in
            other classes?

        · What message does it send to students if certain topics are given unequal
            time in the school year?

        · Do you think that students know when a topic is their teachers favorite vs
            something the teacher feels they have to cover?

        · What steps could you take to improve this situation?

     WHAT'S THE HIDDEN CURRICULUM MEAN TO
     YOU?

       As an education student you have had the experience of being a student and very
       soon you will be visiting classrooms as an observer. The hidden curriculum has
       important implications for the socialization of students, but also potential for
       inequalities.
       The hidden curriculum can have different aspects, such as cultural expectations,
       gender inequalities, racial biases, class and social privileges, and other aspects. Reflect
       on your experience in school, interactions with instructors and other school staff,
       and in classes.
       Consider when hidden messages are embedded into the way content is
       communicated or taught. In mathematics education, a traditional way of thinking
       prioritizes the learning and following of the instructors rules and procedures for a
       type of problem. Students may be expected to solve all problems of a particular type
       in a routine way. Students who follow the procedure, but get the problem wrong
       may even receive more points than students who got the right answer but did it a
       different way. What message may this instructor inadvertently be teaching their
       students about creativity?
       As you consider these questions, think both about your own experiences and your
       future classroom.

        · How does the hidden curriculum impact students' learning, attitude, and
            behavior?

        · How does the hidden curriculum reinforce or challenge mainstream ideas and
            traditional power relationships?

        · How can students and educators transform the hidden curriculum to promote
            more inclusive and equitable education?

                                THE PURPOSE OF EDUCATION

                                           The purpose of education is a fundamental question that guides the design and
                                           implementation of educational programs. However, there is no single answer to the
                                           question of what the purpose of education is and what curriculum should be. In this
                                           chapter, we will explore three major categories of curriculum that reflect different
                                           emphases on the purpose of curriculum: the learner-centered curriculum, the society-
                                           centered curriculum, and the knowledge-centered curriculum.

                           As you read these next sections, think about your definition of education. While it is
                           practical to categorize educational approaches, remember that these emphases are
                           not mutually exclusive or incompatible. In practice, educators adopt a combination
                           or balance of approaches.

Doctrine of Interest
The belief that student          One of the guiding principles of learner centered curriculum is the doctrine of

what to study.             interest. Proponents of the doctrine of interest argue that forcing a student to learn what
                           they aren't interested in is largely a waste of time. Critics contend that to truly embrace
                           the doctrine of interest, the teacher must trust that the students have the ability to
                           choose wisely what will benefit them the most in the future.

                                 The role of the instructor in the learner centered classroom has multiple
                           responsibilities. They must ensure a learning environment that anticipates students'
                           needs, interests, and appropriately challenges their abilities. While providing autonomy
                           in the learning process, the instructor needs to encourage active participation, promote
                           collaboration, and suggest activities that balance the learners' interests.

begin to explore.          allows children to work at their own pace on activities they choose. Montessori
                           education fosters independence, responsibility, and self-discipline, as well as
                           cooperation, collaboration and social skills.

                                 Walking into a Montessori classroom, a guest would not see a teacher in the front
                           of the classroom or children of all the same age. Instead, children would be grouped in
                           similar age ranges, typically 2-3 years apart, and there would be several teachers in the
                           room, who are called guides. Students choose their own hands-on learning activities
                           around the five main topics of Montessori education: Practical Life, Math, Language,
                           Sensorial, and Cultural. Students have long work periods of 2-3 hours where they can
                           work through activity-based lessons, or they have the freedom to move between several
                           activities.

                                 Montessori education prioritizes hands-on manipulatives to aid student learning
                           through experiences. A well-designed Montessori activity integrates hands-on learning,
                           includes multiple domains of knowledge and integrates them in a holistic way. A student
                           who is interested in the solar system might pick for themselves materials off a shelf. There
                           would be physical manipulatives for them to interact with, such as wood blocks that
                           symbolize the planets, or cards with facts and information about each planet. Students
                           would have tasks to do, such as classifying planets in different ways or placing them in
                           order. The instructor would observe the student, try to identify if and when to intervene,
                           and may attempt to give the student a new prompt or challenge to work through with
                           the materials they have chosen.

                                 Critics of Montessori education point to the large cost of running these schools.
                           With one adult per every twelve children, Montessori schools are often private schools
                           with long waiting lists and expensive tuition.

                                 A key part of courses that utilize project-based learning is that students work on

      Many proponents of project-based learning believe that the public product or
presentation is a key factor in the success of project-based learning. The public sharing
of projects reinforces the idea that the students are working on real world problems and
that their work is intended for an audience greater than just their own teacher or class.

      Project Based Learning can be integrated into a single course or may be used as an
opportunity to collaborate between multiple subject areas. Proponents of PBL argue
that it encourages students to deal with complex and ill-structured problems, integrate
information from multiple sources, and have ownership over their learning. Critics say
that PBL takes significant resources and time and that it may lead to missed content or
gaps in knowledge due to the time projects require.

                                                       Paulo Freire was a Brazilian educator and a leading scholar of critical pedagogy. His

                                                       bell hooks was an educator and social critic. She is best known for applying critical
                                                       theory to the American education system. As a black feminist and educator, hooks
                                                       wrote about the influences of race, capitalism, and gender on the educational

Freire's Brazil
Society-Centered Curriculum for Societal Change

Freire's philosophy on education was a direct reaction to the historical context of Brazil
in the 1970s. At this time, Brazil was a third world country in the original meaning of
the term, meaning that they were not directly aligned with either the United States or
the Soviet Union during the Cold War. From 1964 to 1985, Brazil was under a military
dictatorship that saw gradual democratization, eventually leading to a new democratic
constitution and government in 1988.

      Working as an educator during those times of change, Freire saw education as a
means to overcome all types of oppression: political, economic, and intellectual. The
goal of his pedagogies were the intellectual liberation of both the oppressed from the
colonialist and capitalist social structures. He hoped education would change the
people's mentalities and processes so that a truly democratic society could emerge. Freire
warned that an uneducated society would be susceptible to misinformation, and that
democracy would be fragile if the population made decisions based on emotional
thinking rather than critical thinking.

      To Freire, education should empower the people to:

        · Discuss the real problems of their time and come up with solutions.

        · To empower students to reevaluate constantly using scientific and systematic
            methods.

        · To view themselves as part of and in conversation with their society.

        · To assume a critical attitude towards the world and in doing so be prepared
            to change it.

To underscore the differences between his model of education, which sees students as
partners in the classroom and emphasizes the knowledge each student brings to the
table, Freire derisively used the phrase "the banking model of education" to describe
past practices. In the banking model of education, students are treated as empty vessels,
needing to be filled with information. Freire believed this mindset reinforced racist
colonial attitudes. In The Pedagogy of the Oppressed, he wrote about an alternative,
which was to respect student knowledge, to include their voice in the curriculum, and to
empower them. Freire's pedagogy is a criticism and reaction to colonialism where only
the dominant culture's ideas, literature, and ways of understanding are valued. Critical
pedagogies roots are, then, an act of decolonial resistance to colonialism and oppression

STEM and P-TECH in New York
Society Centered Curriculum for Workforce Training and Modernization

Another way to think about society centered curriculum is to forecast future needs of
the community and to promote additional emphasis to those topics throughout the
curriculum. Integration of STEM throughout the curriculum is not a new push. In
1957, as a result of the Soviet Union launching the world's first artificial satellite, the

                           In 2022, Congress passed the CHIPS and Science Act, an incentive program to bring

                           fabrication facility.

                                 Even before Micron's announcement, New York State had an established P-TECH
                           program (Pathways in Technology Early College High School). The structure of P-

                           manufacturing or cyber security. After Micron's announcement to build one of the
                           largest fabrication facilities in the United States, New York State announced an
                           additional $31.5 Million to create advanced manufacturing classrooms and create
                           partnerships between K-12 Districts, Community Colleges, and the state's Technical
                           Colleges.

                                 P-TECH programs try to put students in authentic challenges in a very career
                           focused way. Students may be collaborating with industry professionals, researching
                           current issues, and applying problem solving to real situations. Students in these
                           programs still have to fulfill the same general education requirements as their peers but
                           may adapt the curriculum to focus more on the critical thinking, teamwork, and
                           communication skills needed in their chosen sector.

                                 Advocates of P-Tech and STEM education programs highlight the potential for
                           students to walk into high growth and high demand jobs and satisfy a current crisis
                           where technical and advanced manufacturing jobs may go unfilled because there aren't
                           enough qualified applicants. Critics may worry that students are specializing in careers
                           too early and that if other areas of education are neglected, that graduates of programs
                           like the P-TECH programs might not have the broad education needed to switch careers
                           later in life or be missing out on the broad exposure to a wide variety of topics.

                                 The knowledge centered approach is deeply rooted in traditional educational
                           philosophies. The focus is on skills and facts from academic subjects. Although there
                           may be some interdisciplinary work, the majority of the time is spent working with
                           teachers who are themselves specialists in one area or another. Proponents of the

knowledge-centered curriculum believe that a foundation in math, science, literature,
and history is the best preparation for life because the broad skill set will allow the
educated person to adapt to multiple environments. While the academic curriculum
isn't opposed to career training, proponents of the knowledge-centered curriculum
prefer that specific career training comes after high school, and students are not
identified and tracked into groups who will go to college and those who will go directly
into the workforce. This is because the advocates for the knowledge-centered curriculum
believe that broad exposure to academic disciplines is the goal. The argument is that a
well-educated and well-rounded person is adaptable and prepared for the future.

Textbooks as curriculum

One example of the knowledge-centered curriculum is the textbook. Modern textbooks
consist of a multitude of learning materials, multimedia, question banks, supplementary
resources, and teachers guides. A giant industry, three or four leading companies produce
the majority of textbooks in the United States. Many of the curricular battles play out in
what is included in the textbook. There has been a drive to make sure more diverse voices
are present in all textbooks, to try to make sure students are exposed to a wide variety of
cultures. This push for inclusion has also prompted a backlash from parent groups and
lawmakers who feel that a progressive agenda is being pushed on students.

      While there are legitimate fears of over standardization and teachers being forced
to use scripted or canned curriculum, textbooks have been an ubiquitous part of most
American schools. Textbooks have strengths. They are organized and supply a structure
and sequence for complex subject matters. Teacher certifications can be very broad, and
instructors can find themselves teaching several subjects and will likely not have the time
to assemble resources of the appropriate difficulty and scope for their students.

      Critical teachers must be aware of the strengths and limitations of textbooks. Part
of building a critical consciousness is being aware that textbooks may contain biased
coverage of certain topics, may not have problem-solving or higher-level activities for
students, and may limit students' exposure to a wide variety of resources because the
textbook becomes the single source of information. Expert teachers make informed
choices with their text, including when to use it, when to supplement with outside
resources, and how to structure class with or without it.

                                                       Mortimer Adler is author of the Paideia Proposal (1982) in which he laid out the
                                                       need for a classical education focused on the perennial or everlasting ideas from the
                                                       greatest thinkers and philosophers. Adler's approach calls for everyone to study the
                                                       great thinkers like Plato, Aristotle, and Thomas Aquinas.

                                           Standardization of the American High Schools
                                           In 1892, a group of American educators were brought together to make
                                                                                    CURRICULUM AND THE PURPOSE OF EDUCATION 57

recommendations on the future of high school education. Drawing heavily from colleges
and universities, and led by the president of Harvard University, the Committee of Ten
made recommendations to standardize the high school curriculum. The central part of
the recommendation was to create a core curriculum that would prepare students for
higher education and the workforce.

      The committee's recommendations centered on a core curriculum comprising of
literature, classical languages, mathematics, science, and history. The recommendations
of the committee of ten create a structure for high school that still might feel familiar
to students. English, history, math and science. Math should be taught in a sequence
of algebra, geometry, and trigonometry. Science should be taught every year with a
year each on practical geography, biology, chemistry, and physics in that order. A major
difference between the curriculum of the early 1900s and today would be the early
curriculum's emphasis on classical languages such as Greek and Latin. A high schooler
would have taken both Greek and Latin, as well as two modern languages, usually French
and German.

      The Committee of Ten's work laid the foundation for the structuring of high
school in the United States, setting the precedent for core subjects. While there has been
extensive reforms to education over the years, the initial structure recommended by the
Committee of Ten is still visible.

      The legacy of the committee lives on in a few different ways. The high school
schedule still bears a close resemblance to the committee's recommendations, but
perhaps the more important and enduring legacy is the idea that every student should
take this college preparatory curriculum. An ongoing debate since the release of the
Committee of Ten's initial report has been the need to balance between standardized
curriculums and the need for flexibility and student-centered approaches in modern
education.

Advanced Placement (AP) Tests

Each year, more than a million students challenge demanding Advanced Placement tests
in high school hoping to gain college credit for taking an advanced high school course.
Run by the organization The College Board, the same organization that runs the SATs,
Advanced Placement tests have become a benchmark by which students and schools are
judged. These high stakes exams are marketed towards high schoolers and their parents
as a way to show rigor in their high school education and a way to stand out in the college
admission process.

      To be able to teach an AP Course at a high school, the school must apply to the
College Board, submit a detailed curriculum outlining alignment to the AP test, and
must choose a textbook that has been approved by the College Board. AP Courses
are available in math, science, history, english, world languages, and a newer capstone
program in research methodology.

      Students in AP Courses are challenged with a broad curriculum that includes all
the topics typically taught in a college introductory course. Critics of the AP Exams have
58 RESTORYING EDUCATION

                                           said that AP courses focus too much on a wide breadth of materials, but lack the time to
                                           do a deep and thorough analysis of individual topics.

                                                 The number of AP courses taught and how the students score on them feature
                                           prominently in how American high schools are compared to each other in ratings such
                                           as the US News ratings of High Schools. School administrators attach letters in their
                                           student college applications stating how many advanced courses are available at their
                                           institutions. 35% of high school students who graduated in 2022 took at least 1 AP
                                           course, and college credit for high school courses has continued to grow as a trend and
                                           expectation in the American High School experience.

                             The International Baccalaureate (IB) Diploma Program

                             The International Baccalaureate Organization is a non-profit educational organization
                             based out of Switzerland. Since the 1960s, the IB Diploma program has been utilized
                             in international schools catered to the families of multinational corporations, military
                             families and mobile groups. In the United States, IB diploma programs are often used as
                             an accelerated learning opportunity for exceptional students.

The major domains of the IB
Program model.

                             The IB Program consists of coursework in 6 main areas: Language, Second Language,
                             Individuals and Societies, Mathematics or Computer Science, Experimental Sciences,
                             and The Arts. In addition to the coursework, all students take a required Theory of
                                                                                    CURRICULUM AND THE PURPOSE OF EDUCATION 59

Knowledge Course, have to do experiential learning through their Creativity Action
Service requirement, and do an independent research project or extended essay of 4,000
words.

      The purpose of the IB diploma is to have an internationally recognized
qualification that could be recognized all over the world, to have an international
intellectual framework, to educate the whole person, and to develop inquiry and
thinking skills. The IB diploma is recognized and well regarded, with similar prestige for
graduates as those who score highly on Advanced Placement or AP tests through the
College Board. A major difference between the IB programs and Advanced Placement
programs is that the AP Tests are single high stakes tests, while in the IB program testing
is integrated throughout the school year, with external graders used to rate students and
the schools.

      For a high school to participate in the IB Diploma program, administrators and
teachers must be certified by the IB Organization, attend additional professional
development, and continual education.

      Advocates for the use of IB program and its high standards praise the international
focus, rigor, and emphasis on critical thinking and research. Critics bring concerns about
the demanding nature of the IB curriculum and stress on students.

TEACHER AGENCY IN CURRICULUM

In education, the concept of curriculum is an important thing for the future teacher
to consider. Educators must constantly be examining and reflecting on their curricular
goals and analyzing their teaching tools and methods to make sure that all parts of the
students' experience, both the explicit plans and the hidden lessons conveyed match their
purpose of education.

      Remember the warning as we introduced the learner centered, society-centered,
and knowledge-centered classification. While classification systems are convenient, the
truth is that most educators will incorporate a spectrum of approaches, and the examples
given in the chapter may represent the extreme implementation of these philosophies.
The main takeaways may be the ideals that each approach embodies from individual
empowerment and societal reconstruction to comprehensive knowledge and exchange.
There are ways to give learners voice and control in their education that are not
Montessori education or implementing full Project Based Learning.

      Analyzing the American education system, at first glance it has many of the criteria
of a knowledge centered curriculum, with an articulated curriculum of facts,
competencies, and skills that students should be able to demonstrate their mastery of in
defined subject areas. However, there is space in this curriculum for instructors to use
their discretion and expertise.

      As educators, it is those instructional choices that wield substantial power in
shaping the student experience and our schools. It is essential to build a critical
consciousness, continually evaluating practices and questioning the impact of those
choices. By embracing this agency, educators can blend curricular and instructional
philosophies and find their personal approach to meeting diverse student needs, to giving
60 RESTORYING EDUCATION

                                           students voice and choice in the curriculum, and making sure that today's students are
                                           tomorrow's citizens and neighbors.

                                                 Being able to articulate one's purpose of education is an important first step in the
                                           process of becoming a critical educator. Once your goals are well defined, the next step
                                           is the critical awareness to make sure that the instructional methods and content match
                                           the stated purpose. As agents of change, educators have the opportunity to influence and
                                           shape curricular choices that shape our students, schools, and societies.

                                                       What is your teaching philosophy? What do you feel your role should be as a teacher
                                                       in our educational system? Teacher candidates are often asked to explain their
                                                       philosophy of education as part of the application and interview process.
                                                       Your teaching philosophy should be 2-3 pages in length and written in first person
                                                       and in present tense. You will want to include examples and descriptions so your

                                                        · Begin by making a list of what you feel education should do--what is the
                                                            purpose of education or what are the goals of education? Are there specific
                                                            educational theories that you believe in strongly?

                                                        · Make another list of teaching methods you feel best help you to reach this
                                                            purpose. How do you interact with students? What does your classroom look
                                                            and feel like? What kind of assignments do you believe are best? How do you
                                                            support your students? How do you assess learning has taken place? What kind
                                                            of strategies do you use to teach your specific discipline?

                                                        · Jot down two to three specific examples of your teaching methods and describe
                                                            how you apply these in the classroom. What does this specifically look like?

                                                        · Also, write a justification of how you feel that your particular teaching methods
                                                            help your students to reach your chosen goals of education. Why do you feel
                                                            these are the best strategies for reaching the ideal education?

                                                       Once you have these portions written, go through these and select the teaching
                                                       methods and the examples of these that you feel most fully convey your style of

COLONIAL EDUCATION

In its inception, the development of public education was an extension of European
colonialism in the Americas with the forced displacement and erasure of the Indigenous
nations, cultures, and languages. British colonialism shaped the direction of public
education in Colonial America where the Puritan, or Calvinist, theological worldview of
the early British settler-colonizers significantly shaped education. Much like the political
makeup of each colony, especially in New England, the purpose of education centered
on religion.

      In colonial New England, the first public and private schools served mostly boys
from merchant and other upper class backgrounds. In 1642, the Massachusetts Bay
Colony made education compulsory (i.e., required). These first Latin grammar schools
were formed to serve boys born into wealthier social classes in their preparation for
university, which were the elite Ivy League institutions that had recently been founded
in the new colonies. By applying Labaree's (1997b) goals of education, we can clearly
ground education at this time as a private good only available to the landed gentry
emerging as the ruling class in the American colonies. By limiting access to education
to men of European descent born in social positions of power, colonial education was
inherently undemocratic and sought to limit educational opportunities for women,
sustenance farmers, tenant farmers, indentured servants, slaves, and Indigenous peoples
for the purposes of oppression and the exploitation of their physical, creative, and
emotional labor, i.e, for the purposes of hegemony.

      While the elite social classes created educational structures to limit access to
education, the Puritan settlers who founded the Massachusetts Bay Colony did make
literacy a priority. More specifically, they made reading a compulsory part of the head
of household duties to ensure all children in the household were able to read the Bible
and other religious documents (Janak, 2019). Basic literacy skills, then, "opened" up
education beyond the landed elites; however, the purpose was solely on being able to
read the bible and not for either participating in democracy or for social mobility. Most
education at this time was public; however, as Janak points out, while education was

                         that could not afford formal schooling, basic literacy education involving reading and
                         writing was either done informally in the home or at church.

                               Most literacy education in the colonial era was dedicated to preparing people for
                         reading the King James version of the bible, a version of the bible favored by Protestant
                         branches of Christianity. Primers like the New England Primer focused primarily on
                         basic phonics of letter-sound relationships, consonant blends, digraphs, and rote

                               After the American Revolution and subsequent War of 1812, the project of
                         developing and maintaining a new nation state began in earnest. There was keen interest
                         in developing a means of public education for a new nation emerging from newly
                         garnered independence from the British Empire. However, despite this new
                         independence, most of the ideas for public education stemmed from the English system
                         of education (Janak, 2019). The Enlightenment and Reformation periods heavily
                         influenced the English system of schooling, and, likewise, the burgeoning public school
                         system in the early period of the United States. Moreover, since the Enlightenment
                         philosophers took their primary inspiration from the Occidental traditions born from
                         ancient Greece: chiefly Platonic idealism and Aristotle's realism and empiricism. These
                         traditions formed the basis of liberal education in European universities and the elite
                         colleges and universities founded within the colonial period in the Americas.

pensions to attend universities. Despite his clear disdain for the working-class citizenry,
Jefferson's idealism did lead to the establishment of public universities like the University
of Virginia and the State University of New York system (Janak, 2019). This is also the
beginning emergence of two alternative goals of public education (Labaree, 1997b):
democratic equality and social mobility, albeit severely limited in terms of equitable
access for all. This push for a more robust public system of education also led to the need
for a more formally trained cadre of teachers, who had been primarily parents and other
familial caregivers in the colonial period leading up to this federal era.

churches established in these various communities. Teachers, then, were recruited from
groups who held significantly less social and political power who would be willing to
take "modest", or low salaries. These new cadres of teachers were mostly unmarried
women from working class backgrounds. Even in public education's infancy, the
teaching profession was exploitative and feminized in order to find a workforce willing
to teach for low wages and could not exercise agency in making curricular decisions that
would challenge or subvert the local authorities' power. This is not to say that common
schools and the development of more standardized normal schools designed to train
public school teachers were totally undemocratic; these schools did arise from

figures 4.3 and 4.4) reveal terse commentary on actual pedagogy, but, rather, focused
more on gender, religious affiliation, and traits like physical attractiveness. What, then,
were the educational goals for teacher training at this time? It does not appear to be
highly focused on pedagogical theory, which had not been really developed at this time,
but more on training teachers who could effectively maintain control and manage
children. In terms of the hidden curriculum, public schools, much like today,
functioned as a means of social reproduction for unskilled or skilled labor needed in each
community. Normal schools, however, were a mechanism for social class mobility for
youth-mostly young women-from the working class to access higher education beyond
an eighth grade liberal arts education. Affluent youth, at this time, had the material
resources for them to attend private, preparatory schools, which allowed access to the
elite colleges and universities with the purposes of training the next generation of
doctors, lawyers, or other professions needed for maintenance and allocation of social
and political power for elite social classes.

                                                 In addition to the formation of normal schools to train teachers for the expanding
                                           public elementary schools, the Morrill Acts of 1862 and 1890 initiated federal policies
                                           for states to create public, land-grant universities. In response to the Industrial
                                           Revolution, there was a growing need for more skilled labor in terms of engineering and
                                           energy extraction (e.g., rail and transportation, mining, oil drilling, etc.). Public land-
                                           grant universities served as points of service for educating a technically skilled workforce
                                           required for these growing industries. Clearly, the public goal of developing the low
                                           or no cost colleges, universities, and normal schools was shifting the early federal era's
                                           goal of educating the citizenry for democratic participation to a more utilitarian social
                                           efficiency goal. Of particular note, as a part of Reconstruction Era following the Civil
                                           War, Historical Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) were born as land-grant

universities to serve the African American population recently emancipated from the
horrors of chattel slavery. Federal policies, however, never equitably funded HBCUs in
comparison to the state land-grant universities, most of which were state and local Jim
Crow laws racially segregated and barred children of color from matriculation. Even
when the goals of public education began to expand to be more inclusive in the public
and private goods, there have been hegemonic goals to limit working and under class
access to social and political power while constructing a stratified racial caste system.

WESTERN EXPANSIONISM AND EDUCATION

In addition to using federal policy toward enclosing public lands as sites for land-grant
colleges and universities, these policies also served as mechanisms to displace First
Nations peoples from their ancestral homelands. The Morrill Acts served as a less
genocidal continuation of federal policies directed toward the Indigenous peoples
instigated by the Indian Removal Act of 1830. The Indian Removal Act authorized
the U.S. military to forcibly displace the Chickasaw, Choctaw, Seminole, Cherokee, and
Creek nations from their homelands in the Southeastern U.S. The ideology of Manifest
Destiny and the policies of displacement like the Homestead and Morrill Acts provided
the blueprint for a new wave of settler colonialism embedded in western expansionism
that sought to displace Indigenous people and enclose these lands either as public sites
for conservation and education or as privately owned land to be parceled out and sold by
land speculators. These policies clearly intend to legitimize the systematic erasure of First
Nations peoples.

      As U.S. settler-colonialism expanded west, there was a significant need for schools
to give children of settlers a place to learn basic literacy and numeracy skills much like
in the common schools in the North and Southeast. This also required a workforce
of teachers to serve in these communities and schools out west. Unmarried women
were recruited as teachers to teach in one-room schoolhouses as the political borders of
the United States continued westward toward California. Women at this time did not
have rights of suffrage or the right to own property. Therefore, female teachers found
themselves in continuously tenuous positions with limited authority or decision making
powers regarding curriculum and methods of teaching. Moreover, female teachers had
to give up teaching if they were to marry. Just like the common schools, political power
for making educational decisions was given to local community leaders-wealthy men
and clergy. Even in its beginnings, teacher agency in making curricular decisions was
severely limited. With the political power of educational decision making consolidated
to ruling and professional managerial classes, policy and goals for educating the masses
were easily maintained and controlled to protect the political and social power of the
elite. However, this would change somewhat as women began to organize and resist their
own oppression at the turn of the 19th and 20th centuries. Female teachers were at the
forefront of the women's suffrage movement as well as the labor movement to unionize
teachers. Teacher agency and professional autonomy is still a primary focus of teacher
activism and will be discussed in a later chapter. Empowerment and emancipation from
hegemonic systems is an ongoing process. We, as educators, owe a tremendous debt to

                                           these brave educators who strived to educate their students at the same time fighting

                          systematically displaced from the homelands became tenuous. The practice of isolating
                          and concentrating Indigenous peoples away from the growing settlements was
                          unsustainable as the privatization or public enclosure of land would make the growing
                          western territories akin to a pseudo-apartheid state, which would, much like modern-day
                          apartheid states, require a significant amount of military force to continuously occupy
                          and oversee the submission and complacency of the displaced First Nations peoples.
                          Therefore, another form of pacification was needed-an educational system designed to
                          assimilate the Indigenous population into the political economy of the U.S.

                                One of the earliest forms of pacification through education was the Spanish
                          mission system, which was the Spanish colonial model. Spanish colonizers set up
                          missions as a way to force conversion to Catholicism and then exploit Indigenous labor
                          to extract resources from the Americas to be brought back to Spain. Mission schools
                          were set up by Catholic religious orders to indoctrinate and convert the Indigenous
                          peoples of South, Central, and Southwestern regions of North America. Protestant
                          mission schools were also established in the British colonies like the Massachusetts Bay
                          Colony who demanded First Nations peoples assimilate into the Puritan cultures and
                          Protestantism of the European settler-colonizers (Szaz, 1999). In the 19th century, the
                          mission school system morphed into Native American residential and boarding schools
                          as the U.S. military stepped in as the primary overseer for educating children from the
                          plethora of First Nations people now being occupied by the U.S. military in enclosed
                          reservations.

                                Richard Henry Pratt, a lieutenant in the U.S. Army, established the Carlisle Indian
                          Industrial School in Carlisle, Pennsylvania in 1879. The explicit goal of the Carlisle
                          Indian School was to "civilize" and assimilate Indigenous children so that they would
                          have no desire to return back to their nations and reservations. Standing Bear, a student
                          of the Carlisle residential school and future Oglala Lakota chief, recalled that, at Carlisle,
                          he "went to school to copy, to imitate; not to exchange languages and ideas, and not
                          to develop the best traits that had come out of uncountable experiences of hundreds
                          and thousands of years living upon this continent" (p. 237). Language instruction was
                          one-way at these residential schools. In fact, teachers severely punished students by
                          speaking their native languages or practicing integral parts of their culture like First

balanced life" (White, 2015, p. 167). It is not surprising that children who come from
communities with a different orientation toward the world and pedagogy would suffer.
It was not until the late 1960s and 1970s when Indigenous leaders, teachers, and activists
began a committed campaign for self-determination for First Nations communities to
change education for their children.

      Cordova (2007) explains that for First Nations children the family is not only the
"nuclear" family defined by Eurocentric standards, but all members of the community:

        The "community" includes not only the family but the surrounding
        environment. One learns to be aware of one's actions and their consequences
        toward other people but toward the "ground" one inhabits. There is an
        assumption about what it is to be human that underlies all of this training of how
        to be human (p. 81).

The embodied alienating experience Indigenous children feel when they enter what
Cordova describes as a "parallel universe" where "the trees, the mountains, the air-the
physical place-may be the same; the philosophical is not. In order to counter these acute
and harmful effects on Indigenous children, Indigenous parents, teachers and activists
designed survival schools to counteract these symptoms of extreme disorientation. One
survival school is the Akwesasne Freedom School which was established in 1979 on a
reservation in New York State. Mohawk is the primary language of instruction and all
members of the community volunteer in the maintenance of the school. The primary
goals are to:

produce and maintain fluent Mohawk speakers; instill responsibility,
independence, and a positive self-concept; foster respect for Elders and the
knowledge they possess; develop pride in and understanding and practice of
Haudenosaunee customs and values; ensure the continuation of

                         p. 97-98).

                         There is a sense of hope now that a system of schooling designed to colonize, displace,
                         and erase the myriad cultures and languages born from the world of the Americas has
                         begun to be dismantled in a concentrated effort towards decolonization. Moreover,
                         modern-day public schools and teachers are beginning to orient themselves toward the
                         collective, social constructivist and community-centered pedagogical paradigm with a
                         focus on experiential, project and problem based curricula, which resemble some aspects
                         of the Indigenous pedagogies that have endured for thousands of years.

                         THE DEVELOPMENT OF MODERN AMERICAN
                         PUBLIC SCHOOLS

                         As the 19th century waned, the Protestant work ethic instilled from Puritanism had
                         been internalized in the cultural and political zeitgeist in the Americas for over two and
                         a half centuries. This work ethic indoctrinated individuals to internalize a job-oriented
                         existential worldview, e.g., you are what your job is. Moreover, there were no compulsory
                         education or child labor laws preventing the exploitation of child workers. At this time,
                         the concept of "childhood" was primarily an affordance for affluent children.
                         Adolescence was not even a socially defined sociological or psychological concept.
                         Children and adolescents from working and underclass backgrounds were seen as "small
                         adults" who could take up the risks of more dangerous unskilled labor tasks in factories
                         or mills. Public schools during this time primarily focused on developing children's basic
                         literacies and numeracies enough for them to effectively join the workforce usually at
                         the end of 8th grade. The original goal of public education for democratic equality
                         began to subside to an orientation for social efficiency. The exploitation of child labor

would continue until labor and social activists had enough gravitas to organize and resist
the enormous inequities brought on by the industrialization of the Gilded Age-which
became the Progressive Era in the early 20th century.

      The birth of the secondary schools stemmed from the trends and policies that
began to develop public universities across the United States. As a result, the differing
goals of public education begin to compete with one another. Moneyed interests like
the Carnegie Foundation also began in earnest to direct policy on public education
toward social efficiency (Labaree, 1997a) which tends to favor skills-based tracking of
students usually based off of standardized reading and math assessments. The Carnegie
Foundation lobbied state and federal agencies for the development of norm-referenced
assessments, like the SAT, to filter more "attractive" candidates for entrance into the
growing public college and universities. Interestingly, non-profit foundations like the

THE NATIONAL DEFENSE EDUCATION ACT AND
ITS IMPLICATIONS ON PURPOSES OF SCHOOLING

At the beginning of the Cold War when the Soviet Union launched the satellite Sputnik
in October of 1957, the United States felt compelled to act. The National Defense
Education Act (NDEA) was signed into law by President Eisnehower the following year.
The overall goal of the NDEA was to solve the massive shortage of mathematicians in
the United States. The shortage of workers in the science, technology, and math fields
highly animated the United States' effort to compete with the Soviet Union in the space
and arms race. In addition to funding science and math, the NDEA created funding
for schools to invest in foreign languages other than Latin and Greek, which were prior
to the NDEA a seminal part of the Liberal Arts curriculum of secondary schools and
colleges. The NDEA would shift the public goals of education toward social efficiency
goals at the expense of the other alternative goals of education like democratic equality
and social mobility. The consequences of the policies undergirding the NDEA would
further student tracking where schools placed students into stratified tracks according
to abilities: remedial/vocational tracks, average tracks, and gifted and talented/honors
tracks. The stratification of students based on standardized testing would go on to have
enormous ramifications in education still being felt today.

ELEMENTARY AND SECONDARY EDUCATION ACT

Brown v. Board of Education is a focal point in other chapters in this book, which

diverse geographies in   communities. With this legislation, this is one of the first explicit policies dedicated
                         toward a goal of social mobility. Up until this time, most federal and state educational
                         policies oriented toward more social efficiency and democratic equality goals. Directed
                         funds under Title I were closely regulated to support programs for children in
                         communities with high poverty as well as children with special needs that could not be
                         properly supported by local and state funding. Title I continues as it continues to be
                         reauthorized under each subsequent administration. However, as soon as this legislation
                         was enacted, efforts to deregulate the mandates on who and what the funds must be
                         spent began as American economic policy shifted from a well-regulated free-market with
                         federal oversight toward neoliberal economic policies, which emphasized unregulated
                         markets and privatization of public institutions like public schools.

                               Like Title I, Titles II-VI focused on specific infrastructural needs schools require
                         in order to develop and maintain high quality education. Title II earmarked federal
                         money for libraries, textbooks, and other media to support instruction. The remaining
                         grants focused funding on educational centers, research and training, as well as funding
                         to support Departments of Education in each state. In 1966, Title VI was amended
                         and became Title VII, which designated specific funding for children with special needs.
                         The following year, the Federal government amended Title VII to include funding to
                         bilingual education programs and Title VII became Title VIII.

                               In 1972 as a part of ESEA amendments, Title IX became a law. Title IX prohibits
                         discrimination based on sex in any school or educational program including school-
                         sponsored sports. Like Brown v. Education, this law has enormous import not only in
                         educational institutions, but larger cultural institutions like amateur and professional
                         sports. This act gave every young girl opportunities to participate in school-related
                         sports. Girls and young women were no longer relegated to spectators. We can still see
                         the effects of Title IX. The exponential growth of women's college and professional
                         athletics would not have been possible had it not been for Title IX. Title IX clearly
                         outlines the continuing progress of actualizing democratic equality.

                               Despite desegregation in the late 1950s, public schools continued to be racially
                         and economically segregated due to white flight to suburbs that were systematically
                         redlined to segregate neighborhoods. Racial and economic segregation is a problem
                         that continues to hinder goals for democratic equality. In order to combat the white

of new elementary, middle, and high schools.

      Urban schools still face enormous challenges in finding revenue to maintain their
buildings which have been in a state of continual disrepair since the 1970s. Moreover,
since the neoliberal turn toward privatization of public schools, urban schools have to
face additional challenges in obtaining revenue as charter schools have become more
common in urban areas. Charter schools receive public funding at the expense of public
schools; however, charter schools are significantly less regulated in terms of curriculum
and hiring teachers. Gentrification is another challenge for schools and teachers. The
process of gentrification displaces working and low-income families out of their
neighborhoods because they can no longer afford to live in these neighborhoods. Despite
these enormous challenges, urban schools along with a caring cadre of professional and

                            urban areas support free, public wi-fi. Moreover, urban schools are nestled within
                            vibrant centers of art and culture like museums and performing arts centers.

                            SUBURBAN EDUCATION

                            Suburban schools are a relatively new phenomenon in the history of American
                            education. The development and maintenance of suburbs require a significant amount
                            of resources like roads, water, sewer, energy. The resources needed to maintain and
                            sustain suburban areas vastly and unsustainably exceed the resources needed to maintain
                            either rural or urban areas. Moreover, since single-family housing is the dominant feature
                            of suburbs, there is not a sufficient population and tax-base to support continual
                            maintenance and development of suburban areas. Tax revenue continues to squeeze
                            suburban communities as different departments like police, fire, and schools compete
                            for decreasing funds due to continuous tax cuts and relief for the wealthy and private
                            corporations since the 1980s. It is clear suburban communities need robust city planning
                            and management in order to sustain these areas socially, economically, and ecologically.

                                  Public schools in suburban areas can draw on the affordances available to rural
                            and urban communities. Schools can be hubs for community organization and support
                            like in rural schools. Suburban schools also benefit from having more modernized
                            infrastructural development like buildings and digital communication technology.
                            Suburban schools also have easier access to cultural and performing arts centers.
                            Suburban schools need professional and caring teachers willing to be active members in
                            these communities to help solve the sustainability issues suburban communities face.

                            CONCLUSIONS AND MAPPING THE FUTURE OF
                            PUBLIC EDUCATION

                            Equitable public education is an ongoing process. As educators, we cannot rest until
                            all young people regardless of race, ethnicity, economic class, language, and ability have
                            access to high-quality education. The promise of public education needs to foreground
                            goals of democratic equality since democracy does not compete nor negate social
                            efficiency or social mobility goals. More importantly, democratic equality attempts to
                            lessen the harm inflicted by hegemonic goals that force assimilation or erasure. We
                            should maintain a critical stance to their own pedagogical practices and be vigilant at
                            identifying the hidden curriculum involved in our unit and lesson development. We
                            should always be asking ourselves two main questions whenever we design any activity,
                            lesson, or unit: Is this emancipatory for the students, community and myself as an
                            educator? Or is this oppressive for the students, community, or myself as an educator?

       Post-Reading Activities and Consolidating Understanding:

       1. Choose the elementary, middle, or high school you attended. Do historical
            research on your school. When did it get built? What were the historical
            rationale for building the school? What types of funding did your school
            receive? Why? In what ways does your community commit to sustaining the
            school for future children?

       2. Attend your local school board meeting. What types of decisions does the board
            make in terms of funding, hiring and retaining faculty and staff, and
            curriculum?

GLOSSARY

Assimilation: A sociological concept where people from different ethnic backgrounds
adopt traits of the dominant cultural group, e.g., adopting the dominant language,
dialect, religion, etc.

Banking Model: A term coined educational theorist Paulo Theory that refers to an
educational system that positions students as passive receptacle for teachers to deposit
knowledge to be stored for a summative assessment. In this model, students do not have
any agency and critical thinking is not valued, but, rather, there is a strong emphasis on
rote memorization. Friere offers an example of testing students on what is the capital of
France, but there is no exploration on what the concept of what a capital entails in terms
of political or economic power.

Block Grant: A federal grant from a larger governmental organization to more local
governmental agencies where there is limited governmental oversight in how the aid gets
spent. Before the 1970s, schools received federal aid to develop school libraries with up-
to-date books. However, during President Nixon's tenure the Department of Education
designated these funds into block grants. As a result, state and local governments
diverted aid to libraries to other projects leaving most libraries with out-dated texts and
media.

Brain Drain: A type of capital flight or migration of highly trained individuals to
another region. This creates a region that does not have enough highly trained
individuals to meet the needs of a community. For example, rural areas have a difficult
time retaining medical professionals to provide service to the members of the
community.

Charter School: A school that receives government funding but can operate with much
autonomy from a local school district. Charter schools have autonomy in hiring teachers,
who may not need professional licensure, and curriculum.

                                           Common School: A 19th century public school, typically grades 1 through 8 that
                                           focuses on basic literacy and math skills, e.g., reading, writing, and arithmetic.

                                           Erasure: A systematic removal of a group of people or aspects of a culture to make it
                                           seem the people or culture never existed or exists currently. One example of cultural
                                           erasure is most depictions of Indigenous peoples have been romanticized historical
                                           narratives, while current narratives ignore Indigenous peoples or act as if they no longer
                                           exist in the present.

                                           Gentrification: A socioeconomic process of changing the character of a neighborhood
                                           by attracting more affluent residents to the area. The process of gentrification raises the
                                           cost of housing, which forces working-class residents with less economic resources to
                                           relocate. Many of these residents have been a part of this community for generations.

                                           Hegemony: The systematic maintenance of oppression of a group or groups of people
                                           over another for the purposes of exerting dominance-ideologically, socially, politically,
                                           or economically.

                                           Land-Grant Colleges and Universities: Federal legislation designating public land for
                                           the specific purposes of building public colleges and universities.

                                           Magnet School: A public school that receives direct federal funding to support a school
                                           with specialized curriculum that can attract students from diverse geographies in order
                                           to have a diverse student population in terms of racial, ethnic, and socioeconomic status.
                                           The primary purpose is to support schools dedicated to desegregation.

                                           Meritocracy: A system that rewards advancement based on individual achievement or
                                           ability rather than rewarding advancement based on political or economic connections
                                           of family and friends.

                                           Neoliberal(ism): A political and economic ideology that advocates for deregulation of
                                           the free market. It advocates for privatization of the public commons, like schools or
                                           other public infrastructures, because it assumes that privatization is more economically
                                           efficient than nationally or locally run public entities.

                                           Normal Schools: Preparatory secondary, or "high" schools to train young adults as
                                           teachers in public school in the 19th and early 20th centuries.

                                           Norm-Referenced Assessment: A standardized test comparing individual students
                                           with other students of the same age or grade.

                                           Occidental: Relating to western or European peoples and cultures.

                                           Political Economy: A term from political science and economics that focuses on
                                           studying the interactions of market, or national, economies and their intersections with
                                           political systems and government.

                                           Parochial School: A private, religious-based (usually Catholic) school for caregivers
                                        RESTORYING THE HISTORY, POLICIES, AND PLACES OF PUBLIC EDUCATION 85

who preferred an alternative educational path to public schools. Many private, Catholic
schools formed as a counter to public schools' implicit Protestant-oriented curriculum,
e..g, the New England Primer with its overt connections to teaching children how to
read and recognize the rhetorical patterns in the King James Bible.

Preparatory Schools: Private, tuition-based boarding schools designed to prepare
affluent youth for higher education in elite, private universities.

Progressive Education: A pedagogical theory that emphasizes that the best way to learn
is by doing. Progressive educators focus on having students do hands-on projects that
mimic real-world applications of content.

Survival Schools: Developed by Indigenous activists from the American Indian
Movement in the 1970s as an alternative to public schools and the federal Bureau of
Indian Affairs residential schools. These schools formed to help Indigenous children
take pride in their cultural heritage, learn their languages, and survive within dominant
cultures and ideologies that are disorienting to Indigenous worldviews.

Tracking: A system of using standardized tests as means for sorting students according
to low, middle, and high ability groups-usually reading and math assessments. Once
students get placed into one of these ability tracks in elementary school it becomes
increasingly more difficult for students to move out of these tracks in middle or high
school.

What Do We Know: Assessment of
Teaching and Learning

Loren Jones; Shannon Kane; Sarah Morris; and
Margaret Peterson

       Before We Read
       Before we read, reflect on how assessments have impacted your learning. What
       aspects of assessments did you find helpful? Challenging? What qualities do you
       think make an assessment effective? Take a few minutes to skim the chapter
       headings and subheadings and consider what you already know about assessment.
       What are the different types and purposes of assessment? How can assessments be
       used to inform and improve teaching and learning? What are some ethical
       considerations when designing and implementing assessments? Finally, consider the
       different stakeholders involved in assessment (teachers, students, parents,
       administrators, district leaders). What are their perspectives on assessment? By
       engaging with these questions before diving into the chapter, you will activate your
       prior knowledge and be better prepared to understand the complex concepts related
       to assessment.
       Critical Questions For Consideration
       As you read, consider these essential questions: What are some ethical
       considerations when designing and implementing assessments? How can educators
       work to limit assessment bias? And consider the different stakeholders involved in
       assessment (teachers, students, parents, administrators). What are their perspectives
       on assessment?

DEFINING ASSESSMENT AND ITS CHALLENGES

Assessments in public schools have long been a topic of discussion and debate, with
stakeholders ranging from policymakers to educators, parents, and students expressing
88 RESTORYING EDUCATION

                                           various opinions and concerns. Recently, the media has played a significant role in
                                           shaping public discourse around assessments and their impact on the education system.
                                           For example, consider the Edweek headline, "Two Decades of Progress, Nearly Gone:
                                           National Math, Reading Scores Hit Historic Lows" (Edweek, October 24, 2022), or
                                           NPR's headline U.S. reading and math scores drop to lowest level in decades. These
                                           headlines, though, portray a distorted public perception of teaching and learning in
                                           today's classrooms. One might read this headline and believe our school systems,
                                           administrators, and teachers are "not good enough," but the truth is much more
                                           complicated. Rather than capturing the day-to-day functioning of the classroom, high-
                                           stakes assessments are generally imposed upon teachers rather than created by them.
                                           As such, the assessments and headlines don't accurately capture the progress and
                                           performance of our students. When reading headlines related to schools and
                                           assessments, it is essential to be critical consumers of media messages.

                                                 Consider that the headline examples above, and many others, label schools as
                                           "failing" based on a single metric-a standardized test score. However, the focus is just
                                           on specific numbers and not a nuanced understanding of factors that influence these
                                           numbers, such as socioeconomic background, limited English proficiency, or special
                                           needs students. These complexities are rarely addressed and considered. Also, remember
                                           that standardized tests are snapshots in time, not measures of long-term progress. A
                                           school might slightly dip in scores one year but steadily improve overall. The media
                                           rarely considers these trends or highlights schools that are making significant gains year
                                           after year. Additionally, changes in test scores can have multiple explanations. Media
                                           portrayals often paint a simplistic picture of progress or decline. A score dip could be due
                                           to a temporary disruption or a shift in curriculum focus, not necessarily a failing school
                                           system.

                                                 Media outlets might also select data points that fit a pre-existing narrative. For
                                           instance, they might focus on a single grade level's decline or highlight achievement gaps
                                           without acknowledging progress in other areas. An unfair and inaccurate picture of
                                           performance is given by cherry-picking data and excluding information that discredits
                                           the narrative being told. Finally, as also discussed in chapter one, media portrayals often
                                           pit schools against each other or blame teachers. These actions can create a hostile
                                           environment and distract from the real work of improving education. Focusing on
                                           collaboration and solutions, rather than negativity and finger-pointing, would be far
                                           more productive.

                                                 Assessment data should be an important tool for educators, but it can and often is
                                           misinterpreted by the media. The inaccurate or misinterpreted use of data by the media
                                           has historically led to a distorted public perception of the teaching and learning going
                                           on in classrooms. Typically, what's highlighted in the news is external to the day-to-
                                           day functioning of a school or classroom. It is generally imposed upon teachers rather
                                           than created by them. The assessments discussed by mainstream media are not used to
                                           inform/shape classroom instruction. Instead, the type of data focused on by the media
                                           and splashed across headlines is often tied to the academic status of schools and districts,
                                           regardless of accuracy. We'll discuss some kinds of assessments and their uses in the
                                           following sections.
                                                         WHAT DO WE KNOW: ASSESSMENT OF TEACHING AND LEARNING 89

NORM-REFERENCED VERSUS
CRITERION-REFERENCED ASSESSMENTS

Teachers and educational researchers use various assessment tools to gauge student
learning and inform instructional decisions. However, these tools differ in their
fundamental purpose and how they interpret performance. Two of the main approaches
are norm-referenced assessments and criterion-referenced assessments.

                              Norm-Referenced Assessments:

        · Focus: Compare a student's score to the performance of a specific group
            (norm group).

        · Interpretation: Scores indicate percentile ranks or standardized scores (e.g., z-
            scores), revealing how students stand relative to their peers.

        · Examples: DIEBLS, ITBS SAT, ACT, State Achievement Tests
        · Strengths: Useful for ranking students, identifying gifted students, and

            making placement decisions.
        · Weaknesses: Do not directly measure mastery of specific learning objectives,

            are susceptible to test bias and anxiety, and have limited information about
            individual strengths and weaknesses. For some norm-referenced assessments,
            teachers do not receive scores until the summer or early fall the following year
            which means the data cannot be used to inform instruction. Additionally,
            the gap between the assessment and receiving scores fails to account for
            student progression or regression that may have occurred.

                            Criterion-Referenced Assessments:

        · Focus: Compare a student's score to a predetermined standard or criterion
            (learning objective).

        · Interpretation: Scores indicate mastery or non-mastery of specific skills or
            knowledge domains.

        · Examples: Rubrics, performance assessments, portfolios, exit tickets, and
            quizzes/tests aligned to learning objectives.

        · Strengths: Provide direct information about individual learning progress,
            guide instructional planning, inform targeted interventions, and promote
            mastery learning.

        · Weaknesses: Less useful for comparing students to peers, requires careful
            development of clear criteria, and may be subjective.

                         Choosing the Right Tool

                         Selecting the `right' approach depends on the assessment's specific goals and intended
                         purpose(s). Norm-referenced assessments offer valuable insights for large-scale
                         comparisons and rankings, while criterion-referenced assessments provide targeted
                         feedback for personalized learning. Issues typically arise not from the assessment type
                         but from the misuse or misrepresentation of the information gathered. When used
                         correctly, both types of assessments can provide different pictures of student
                         performance that support instructional planning.

                         FORMATIVE AND SUMMATIVE ASSESSMENTS

                         Working to create learning environments that foster growth and understanding is a
                         primary goal of all educators. Assessments can provide valuable insights into student
                         learning and support creating a robust learning environment. However, successfully
                         navigating the world of assessments means understanding key concepts, such as
                         formative and summative, and how each plays a distinct role in effective teaching.

                               Formative assessments are informal, ongoing checks for understanding. The
                         main goal of formative assessments is to identify areas of strength and weakness in
                         students' grasp of the material. This allows you to adapt your teaching strategies quickly,
                         providing targeted support and differentiated instruction to address individual needs.
                         Examples include exit tickets, quick quizzes, observations, and peer feedback. The key
                         is providing timely and specific feedback that helps students progress. By providing
                         constructive and timely feedback, we can adjust our teaching strategies to address
                         individual needs and ensure everyone stays on track. Summative assessments measure
                         student learning at the culmination of a unit, grade/course. They aim to measure
                         student achievement against predetermined learning objectives and standards. Examples
                         include exams, projects, presentations, or standardized tests. While summative
                         assessments can provide valuable data on overall learning outcomes, they often occur
                         after the learning has already happened, limiting the opportunity to influence the
                         learning process directly.

                               The key to success lies in integrating both forms of assessment. Formative
                         assessments inform your teaching, allowing you to individualize instruction,
                         differentiate learning activities, and provide targeted support. This targeted support
                         ultimately leads to improved performance on summative assessments, providing a
                         comprehensive picture of student learning at the end of the learning cycle. Here are some
                         practical takeaways related to formative and summative assessment:

                           · Embed formative assessments regularly: Use various strategies to gather
                               ongoing information about student learning.

                           · Focus on feedback: Provide clear, actionable feedback to help students better
                               understand both their strengths and areas for improvement.

                           · Use formative data to inform instruction: Adapt your teaching based on
                                              WHAT DO WE KNOW: ASSESSMENT OF TEACHING AND LEARNING 91

   student needs identified through formative assessments.
· Balance formative and summative assessments: Utilize both to create a

   holistic picture of student learning and growth.

Assessments should not simply be about collecting data or assigning grades; they are
about using data to inform and improve the learning process for every student. By
strategically employing formative and summative assessments, you can create a dynamic
learning environment where feedback, support, and growth go hand in hand.

                                   Key Differences: Formative vs Summative Assessments

CONNECTING ASSESSMENT AND INSTRUCTION

Ideally, assessment and instruction should not be considered separately but instead
viewed as two interconnected concepts that support student learning. Though
assessment typically conjures images of tests and grades, it should instead be thought
of as the ability to inform and guide instruction that supports student learning and
mastery. Unlike summative assessments that gauge final achievement, formative
assessments provide continuous feedback. Through observations, discussions, quizzes,
and self-reflections, formative assessments provide teachers with insights into students'
strengths, weaknesses, and misconceptions. Ideally, this data informs instructional
decisions, allowing teachers to:

        · Differentiate instruction by providing targeted support for struggling
            students and challenging activities for advanced learners.

        · Modify lesson plans to incorporate different teaching strategies, catering to
            diverse learning styles and preferences.

        · Identify and clarify misunderstandings before they solidify, preventing
            knowledge gaps from widening.

        · Encourage students to reflect on their learning.

Effective assessment goes beyond simply collecting data; it's about providing meaningful
92 RESTORYING EDUCATION

                                           feedback. Meaningful feedback needs to be timely, specific, and actionable. Feedback
                                           can:

                                             · Focus on particular strengths, weaknesses, and areas for improvement rather than
                                                 simply assigning grades.

                                             · Provide concrete suggestions for students to apply in their learning.

                                             · Be specific to individual student needs.

                                           When students are actively involved in the assessment process, they can take greater
                                           ownership in their learning. This can be achieved through:

                                             · Empowering students to reflect on their learning progress and set personal goals.

                                             · Creating space for students to give and receive peer feedback fosters critical
                                                 thinking and communication skills.

                                             · They are utilizing collaborative assessments where students work together.

                                           The connection between assessment and instruction should not be a one-time event but
                                           a continuous cycle. Teachers use assessment data to inform instruction and refine their
                                           assessment practices. This iterative process ensures that assessments remain aligned with
                                           learning objectives and provide meaningful feedback for both teachers and students.
                                           Assessment and instruction should not be considered independent entities but two
                                           sides of the same coin. Teachers create an effective learning environment that informs
                                           instruction and refines assessment by leveraging formative assessment, providing
                                           effective feedback, and fostering student involvement.

                                ASSESSMENT DRIVEN INSTRUCTION

                                           In order for assessments to act as a guide for planning and teaching, teachers must
                                           first be clear about, and then plan for, what students will actually learn in a lesson
                                           or unit. Then, teachers must be clear about what assessment of that learning actually
                                           measures. Assessments begin with planning for teaching and learning, meaning that
                                           during planning, a clear "criterion for success" needs to be specifically named. Knowing
                                           the criterion for success means that a teacher can envision what mastery of a particular
                                           skill looks like and ways mastery can be illustrated by a learner. Too often planning falls
                                           short of naming specifically enough how a learner can illustrate mastery of a concept,
                                           and sometimes that leads to assessments that do not do a good job of measuring the
                                           actual learning sought. For example, a lesson objective states that at the end of the lesson,
                                           a student should be able to skip count by 3's to 99. Then within the lesson students
                                           practice skip counting orally from 3-99. The assessment for that lesson should match
                                           the learning sought, so if students are asked to fill in the multiples of 3 on a chart,
                                           this isn't an exact match for the learning in the lesson. A written assessment of the
                                           skill of skip counting adds in assessment of number formation, or the ability to place
                                           the numbers in a chart. This keeps this assessment from providing a good snapshot

output) rather than teaching (the input). For teachers, this means that before planning
begins, they must "think a great deal, first, about the specific learnings sought, and the
evidence of such learnings" (Bowen, 2017). The evidence of learning is the basis for
thinking about how a teacher can assess student learning to provide meaningful
information. This shift to foregrounding learning also means that we plan for learning
"before thinking about what we, as the teacher, will do or provide in teaching and
learning activities" (Bowen, 2017). So, for teachers in the field, this means there is a need
to become more specific about what real evidence of learning looks like; what is actually
being assessed, in order to create classrooms that are assessment driven and where
student learning can be seen.

OVERVIEW OF ASSESSMENT - COMMON
ASSESSMENTS IN CLASSROOMS

Considering the importance of assessment and the many ways it is used to both guide
and gauge progress in teaching and learning, we'll turn now to common classroom
assessments and to the types of learning they are designed to assess. We've divided
these assessments into two categories here. The first category encompasses assessment of
knowledge and skills related to content; the second category encompasses assessments of
learner attitudes, beliefs and self awareness of how they relate to a content or topic.

      Valid and reliable assessments are essential for accurately evaluating students'
knowledge, skills, and abilities in education. They inform teachers about students'
strengths and weaknesses, guide instructional planning, and facilitate evidence-based
decision-making. Valid and reliable assessments also play a crucial role in research,
ensuring that the data collected is credible and can be used to draw meaningful
conclusions and advance knowledge in various fields. By upholding high standards of
validity and reliability, practitioners can enhance the credibility, utility, and effectiveness
of assessment tools in their classrooms.

SOME COMMON ASSESSMENTS

In this section, you will learn about some assessment tools that are commonly used in
K-12 classrooms. Some of these are assessments you may even have completed yourself
as a student. Some are used nationally across many K-12 districts, such as DIBELS and
WIDA Access testing, and some are specific to states, and are used, as required by federal
laws, as large scale assessments to try to measure and track educational achievement in
specific subject areas, such as reading or math.
96 RESTORYING EDUCATION

                         DIBELS

                         First developed by researchers at the University of Oregon in the 1970's, DIBELS
                         assessments were initially designed to help show beginning phonemic awareness in
                         kindergarten through 3rd grade. Additional subtests developed over decades now focus
                         on assessing many foundational skills for reading in kindergarten through 8th grade
                         students. In one test students are asked to identify the sounds heard at the beginning of
                         common words; to sound out and decode nonsense words, but all DIBELS assessments
                         are designed to "detect risk," meaning to monitor the ongoing progress of readers and
                         identify gaps in foundational literacy skills. DIBELS have been redesigned to assess all
                         of the foundational skills needed for reading development, identified by the National
                         Reading Panel in 2000 (Learning Point, 2004). DIBELS seeks to assess students' ongoing
                         proficiency with the foundational skills of phonemic awareness, phonics. fluency,
                         vocabulary development and comprehension.

                               Though this assessment is still used widely, it's important to note that there have
                         been many critiques of DIBELs over the years including the fact that the tests are
                         designed to assess extremely specific skills readers use, but that exist within complicated
                         processes for learning to read. For example one of DIBELS assessments asks students
                         to decode made up syllables, which critics say may remove contexts of language, and
                         motivation for a reader, adding to miscues and over identification of reading delays or
                         need for remediation.

                                                               WIDA Access Testing

                         WIDA stands for World-class Instructional Design and Assessment, and comes from
                         researchers at the University of Wisconsin, Madison and their ACCESS test is widely
                         used in the US to assess English language proficiency levels for students identified as
                         English Language Learners (ELL). The assessment is used to help to discern several key
                         pieces of language learning, including listening, speaking, reading and writing. Scores are
                         used to help identify the kinds of instruction that an ELL will need to increase their
                         English proficiency across all of the language domains.

                               ACCESS testing is designed to show the progress a student has made and is given
                         at the beginning of a school year and near the end of a school year to help provide
                         important information about how, and in what language domain, a student is
                         progressing well, or not.

                               ACCESS scores, which range from 1 or "entering" and 6 or "reaching," are used
                         to determine when and if a student can "exit" services mandated as English for Speakers
                         of Other Languages (ESOL). Though several states use a lower score to allow students
                         to stop receiving ESOL services. The designation as an English Language Learner, most
                         often decided by scores on a WIDA Access test, means that a student is legally entitled
                         to receive ESOL services and can not be denied those services until they are able to
                         show they have gained the necessary skills for proficiency in English. Though, it should
                         be noted that several states use a lower score to allow students to stop receiving ESOL
                         services.

                                  Advanced Placement Testing

Developed at the end of World War II, the goal of both the AP test and the introduction
of college level coursework to high school classrooms was part of an effort to better and
more quickly prepare students for college and career. In 1955 the College Board took
over the administration of AP courses, and the AP tests themselves. From the original
11 topics; Mathematics, Physics, Chemistry, Biology, English Composition, Literature,
French, German, Spanish, and Latin, the College Board now offers AP tests in 34 subject
areas.

      Many colleges and universities recognize and will award college credit for scores
above a 3 or 4 on AP tests for commensurate coursework. These credits may not count
for degree completion in some cases and at several elite colleges, scores don't count at
all. For example, Brown University, Dartmouth, Williams, and Cal Tech do not award
credit for any AP test. As a result some high schools have begun to phase out, or have
completely abandoned AP coursework. For example, in 2018, eight prestigious high
schools including Georgetown Day, Holton-Arms, Landon, Maret, National Cathedral,
Potomac, St. Albans and Sidwell Friends, announced they would completely phase out
AP courses by 2022. Criticism of the Advanced Placement program has long centered
around controversy that the tests are racially biased and that the coursework does not
allow students and teachers to go in-depth into topics in ways a college course might.

                Standardized Tests - A Lay of the Land - Looking Forward

All states in the United States that receive federal funds for education, which includes
all states as well as the DODEA and Bureau for Indian Education and the District of
Columbia, are required to gauge student achievement through the use of standardized
tests of student learning. These tests are standardized in that they use a similar set of
questions, and tests agreed upon skills. These tests are, to varying degrees, aligned with
state curricula, to assess students at several points during elementary school and in
multiple subjects during secondary public education.

      There have been many efforts over the years to work to make education more a
part of the federal standardized system and laws such as the ESEA, or Elementary and
Secondary Education Act, have provided systems of rewards, and or penalties for states
to support federal requirements. For a period of time beginning in 2010, the United
States Department of Education worked to create a national set of standards called
College and Career Readiness Standards, that also required a standardized test called by
its acronym PARCC, or the Partnership for Assessment of Readiness for College and
Careers. States could opt into the consortium and at its most popular, 22 states had
signed on to use this common assessment and its constituent curriculum.

      PARCC is now in use in only the District of Columbia, The Bureau of Indian
Education and in DODEA, and there does not seem to be political will to build more
standardization across states for assessments. A quick look at what standardized tests
each state is using to gauge student achievement shows that many states have created
their own state made and state administered tests including the Colorado Measures of
Academic Success (CMACS) and the Florida Assessment for Student Thinking (FAST).
98 RESTORYING EDUCATION

                                           But many states, including California, Connecticut and Nevada have again signed on
                                           to a consortium of states using the Smarter Balanced Test which aligns with the older
                                           College and Career Readiness Standards and was developed with input from both
                                           teachers and higher education on test questions and content.

                                                 Standardized tests, while meant to show student learning, have been used in many
                                           states as a way of trying to assess teaching, with some states connecting teacher
                                           evaluations and pay to student outcomes on standardized tests. These models are flawed
                                           in multiple ways, as standardized test scores are positively correlated to family levels
                                           of education and socioeconomic status. Again assessments and tests, even large scale
                                           standardized tests are, at best, a snapshot of student learning and can tell us very little
                                           about instruction, or future achievement of students.

                                CONCLUSION

                                           As we have discussed in earlier sections, tests and test scores often hold outsized influence
                                           on the lives of humans inside of classrooms. Teachers may be paid or promoted based
                                           on students' standardized test scores. Students may be retained at a specific grade level,
                                           or not gain admission to a college based on a test score. And though we know that tests
                                           used to gauge student learning often don't provide definitive information on student
                                           knowledge or learning, and that scores are often skewed based on race, socioeconomic
                                           status and on family educational attainment, teachers must become critical consumers
                                           of tests and assessments. Meaning that it is important to question test questions, to
                                           research who is profiting from tests and testing materials, and to be skeptical of results
                                           that disadvantage students. Still assessing is one of the most important skills any teacher
                                           can develop. Guided by questioning, as ongoing assessments of learning, quizzes,
                                           observations, and meaningful and qualitative evaluation of student work are all very
                                           important data needed to guide both teaching and learning, to identify risks to student
                                           learning and to help to remediate and enrich student learning.

MEET A SCHOLAR

Dr. Sonia Nieto (1943- ) a leading scholar in multicultural education and advocate
for educational equity, has played a crucial role in shaping critical conversations
around educational assessments. Her work has helped draw attention to and
highlight standardized tests' limitations and potential biases related to students from
diverse backgrounds. While not directly involved in developing assessments, her
work has profoundly influenced how educators approach and interpret these tools,
emphasizing the importance of equity and fairness in assessments and advocating for
approaches that accurately reflect individual strengths and needs.
The `one-size-fits-all' approach to traditional assessments creates the potential to
perpetuate educational inequities by disadvantaging students from marginalized
backgrounds due to inherent biases. These biases can stem from cultural
assumptions embedded in the language, content, and scoring criteria, leading to
inaccurate representations of students' authentic abilities. Similar to instructional
strategies, assessment methods should consider students' diverse learning styles and
cultural backgrounds and allow students to demonstrate their understanding in
meaningful ways. This overall approach to teaching and learning emphasizes the
importance of:
· Utilizing authentic materials: Assessments should reflect students' cultural

    backgrounds and lived experiences, making them more relatable and engaging.
· Incorporating multiple assessment methods: Employing varying assessment

    tools, including performance-based tasks, portfolios, and self-reflection, to
    provide a well-rounded perspective beyond test scores of student learning.

                                                            how can we mitigate them?

                                                       2. How can we effectively assess the complex skills and dispositions valued in 21st-
                                                            century learning?

                                                       3. How can we create assessment systems that are culturally responsive and address
                                                            the diverse needs of all learners?

                                                       4. How can we involve students in the assessment process to promote self-
                                                            reflection, ownership of learning, and a growth mindset?

                                REFLECTION, METACOGNITION, AND
                                ALTERNATIVE ASSESSMENTS

                                           One concern with assessment in many school forms is authenticity. As we have discussed
                                           in this chapter, assessment can serve many purposes: it can be used to classify and
                                           divide students into groups; it can be used to drive instruction; it can be used to shape
                                           curriculum; it can be used to generate revenue for textbook and educational resource
                                           companies. Assessment can be standardized and aligned with state or national
                                           curriculum.

                                                 But our students aren't all the same. They learn differently. What are we doing to
                                           assess those differences? And what are multiple ways students can SHOW their learning?
                                           In what ways can we use assessment to provide learners with more information about
                                           how they learn, so they can make choices and have agency in their learning?

                                                 Some scholars and teachers focus on metacognition and self-assessment as ways
                                           for students to be in charge of their own learning. Metacognition is, on a basic level,
                                           "thinking about thinking," or learning to understand one's own thought processes
                                           (Flavell, 1979). More specifically, metacognition requires learners to reflect and self-
                                           regulate in order to understand what they have learned and how they have learned it
                                           (Darling-Hammond, Austin, Cheung, and Martin, 2003). Reflection, as John Dewey
                                           claimed in 1933, is what generates learning, more so than experience alone.
                                           Metacognition and reflection can bring awareness and intentionality to learning and
                                           assessment of learning. As Taczak and Robertson (2017) argue, "when cognition and
                                           metacognition are accessed together through reflection, students are able to assess
                                           themselves," and this assists transfer of skills and knowledge to other settings and fields
                                           (p. 212).

                                                 Metacognitive assessments, then, allow learners to review their work, reflect on
                                           their progress toward goals, and predict their learning outcomes based on their
                                                       WHAT DO WE KNOW: ASSESSMENT OF TEACHING AND LEARNING 101

performance and understanding. They also allow learners to self-regulate by setting goals
and plans for future learning. Portfolios are one example of metacognitive assessment,
one that is holistic, student-centered, and developed over time. In this section, we will
discuss a few types of alternative assessments, ones that include students' own thinking,
self-assessment, and reflection.

ALTERNATIVE ASSESSMENTS

Portfolios. Often used in writing classrooms, portfolios are purposeful collections of
work that students curate along with reflection and analysis of their progress. Often
portfolios are designed in collaboration between and among students and teachers, can
be individualized for each learner, and show student growth and development toward
learning goals over time. In the writing classroom, portfolios emphasize revision and
the writing process over the final product. Students must review, categorize, analyze,
organize, and plan how to show a reader not only what they learned, but how they
learned it (Reynolds and Davis, 2014). In some situations, students are asked to
document revisions, and most writing portfolios incorporate some element of reflective
writing in order to describe, narrate,and explain the texts within the portfolio,
considering a student's work as evidence of their growth (Yancey, 1998).

      Accompanied by other means of assessment, such as those recommended by the
National Council of Teachers of English (1993), including "narrative evaluations,
written comments, dialogue journals, and conferences" portfolios can be individualized
to each learner and involve the student as a participant in their own learning and
assessment, thereby assisting in developing agency. Alongside portfolios as assessment,
some teachers work with their students to design assignments and develop guidelines
for assessment to counter typical classroom power structures (Reif, 1992). Doing so
challenges the notion that teachers control the criteria for defining "good" work.

      Student Designed Rubrics. We have discussed rubrics (and critiques of them)
earlier in this chapter. Now, let's consider rubrics in which students have a say in design,
evaluative criteria, and values. Grounded in constructivist principles, the act of designing
a rubric as a class dwells in process space (rather than product focus) and relies on
students effectively analyzing conventions of the genres they read and are expected to
write, and then translating into their own words those conventions, aiding in transfer to
their own writing. In assisting in identifying and defining assessment criteria, students
are given agency and participate in co-constructed understandings that are made more
powerful within the discourse community.

      When combined with other strategies for writing, reflection, and revision within
a discourse community, and used formatively over time, not only do student designed
rubrics assist in reflection, self-assessment, and deep reading, they promote transfer. In
the foundational text "Writing as a Mode of Learning," Janet Emig (1977) suggests that
writing seeks "self-feedback," in that the process of writing, when students learn to write
in a "familiar and available medium," they are better able to give themselves feedback
(p. 125). The process of designing a rubric together can make visible the kind of "self-
feedback" unique to writing and bring it into a collective sense of response, creating a
102 RESTORYING EDUCATION

                                           shared understanding of process, genre convention, and mode. In addition, the rubric
                                           becomes its own genre, that students can more easily access as readers in other contexts.

                                                 Put together, different forms of alternative assessments resist what Peter Elbow
                                           (1993) calls "forms of judgment" in classrooms, or practices that seek to rank, rather than
                                           truly evaluate and value the work that students do.

                                ANTI-RACIST ASSESSMENT PRACTICES

                                           In recent years, and in the wake of highly visible and racially motivated violence against
                                           people of color, school systems and higher education institutions have begun engaging
                                           in open discussion about how pedagogical practices feed systemic racism. While this is a
                                           developing conversation, there are some currently agreed-upon principles and practices
                                           recommended to help teachers ground assessment in anti-racist practice. In this section,
                                           we will introduce a few of those practices, with the expectation that readers will use these
                                           ideas as a springboard for further investigation.

                                                 First, and perhaps most importantly, researchers suggest that teachers begin to
                                           implement anti-racist pedagogy by becoming critically reflective themselves. This means
                                           interrogating one's own biases, developing an awareness of students' individualities and
                                           backgrounds, and adjusting curriculum to convey diverse perspectives and meet learning
                                           needs. Assessments are one aspect of the curriculum that will need to be adjusted.

                                                 As we have discussed, often, grades measure behaviors and compliance instead of
                                           actual learning. In redesigning assessments to foster anti-racist principles, we can make
                                           a few adjustments to instruction that make a difference in transparency, learning, and
                                           student agency.

                                                 Teach what you're trying to measure. First, we can align our assessments with course
                                           goals and objectives, so that we teach what we are trying to test. For example, if we're
                                           asking students to write to show understanding of content in a social studies course, but
                                           we grade grammar and mechanics heavily without teaching grammar and mechanics, a
                                           student may have a clear understanding of the content but be penalized for errors in the
                                           technical aspects of writing.

                                                 Give students practice and choice. Second, when we have taught something, we can
                                           facilitate transfer and ensure student learning by giving them direct, relevant practice and
                                           feedback on that practice. Allowing choice about how to show mastery is critical here,
                                           too, as it increases student investment in the learning. For example, if we want students
                                           to be able to write thesis statements, we must follow direct instruction in identifying
                                           and writing thesis statements with independent practice in the student's own draft, on
                                           a topic of their choice. To further show mastery, students might select their own "best"
                                           thesis to share from several papers at the end of the assessment period.

                                                 Allow for revision and reflection. Third, when assessments have a reflective
                                           component, students can identify and discuss how well they have mastered learning
                                           goals, with their own work as a kind of evidence. Given the opportunity to show not
                                           just what they know, but how they know they know it, students can better identify,
                                           define, and make an argument for their own learning. Likewise, the opportunity to revise

assignments allows students to strategically apply new ideas and learning over time,
which emphasizes learning as a process rather than assessment as a product.

      Two specific approaches to antiracist assessment are ungrading and contract
grading.

      Ungrading is a feedback centered approach that counters the traditional grading
system, which tends to rank, sort, and categorize students and their work. While there
are many different approaches to ungrading, most include self-assessment, collaboration,
reflection, and revision and are used across the curriculum in a variety of ways to foster
justice and equity in an unjust system (Blum, 2020). Contract grading requires students
to deeply self-assess using agreed-upon measures for mastery and allows students to
choose projects and assignments that best meet their own learning needs and goals
within the context of a course. Some educators, like Asao Inoue (2015, 2019), argue
that labor based grading contracts are a tangible way to resist institutional racism by
upending embedded power structures.

     APPLICATION

       Case Study:
       Multilingual learners across the nation (42 states are part of the WIDA consortium)
       complete the WIDA ACCESS assessment annually to monitor their growth in
       English across the four domains - speaking, writing, reading, listening. The images
       below capture two ACCESS Online Sample Items from Grades 4-5 in the domain
       of Reading for a selection titled "Let's Go Shopping."

       1. Review the two assessment prompts - the questions, answer selections, and
            corresponding images.

       2. Based on the information presented in this chapter, would you identify this as
            an effective assessment?

           1. What is being assessed here? Does that align with the purpose of the
                assessment?

       3. What can a teacher learn from the results of this assessment?
       4. What might be some consequences of this assessment, both short term and long

            term?

POST-READING ACTIVITIES ON ASSESSMENT:

        · Design Your Ideal Assessment: Reflect briefly on the chapter's key points on
            assessment methods and their strengths and weaknesses. Think of a learning
            scenario where you need to assess someone's understanding of a topic and
            create your own assessment method for this scenario. Consider sharing your
            designed assessment to a partner. Be sure to consider factors like:

        · What learning objectives are you assessing?
104 RESTORYING EDUCATION

                                             · What type of knowledge or skills do you want to measure?

                                             · What format would be engaging and effective (e.g., project, presentation, game)?

                                             · How would you ensure the assessment is fair and unbiased?
                                             · Learning Reflection: Think back to a recent learning experience (e.g., a class,

                                                 workshop, online course) and reflect on the assessment methods used in that
                                                 experience. Did they effectively measure your learning? What were the strengths
                                                 and weaknesses of the assessments? How could they have been improved?
                                                 Consider how the different assessment methods discussed in the chapter could be
                                                 applied to your chosen learning experience. Which methods would be most
                                                 appropriate and beneficial and why?
                                             · Assessment in the Real World: Think about a field or activity you are interested in,
                                                 such as sports, music, or business. Identify and consider the different types of
                                                 assessments used in your chosen context. For example, in sports, there might be
                                                 performance evaluations, skill tests, and game statistics. Write a short reflection on
                                                 the following questions: How do these assessments contribute to the overall goals
                                                 of the activity or field? What are the potential benefits and drawbacks of these
                                                 assessments? Are there alternative assessment methods that could be considered?

                                           Criterion-Related Validity: This is the extent to which an assessment is related to a
                                           purported outcome. For example, SAT and ACT exams claim validity because the scores
                                           correlate, or predict, college GPA.

                                           Construct Validity: How accurately a test measures a concept that the test designed to
                                           measure. Capacity measures like the Cattell Culture Fair Intelligence Test claim to have
                                           a construct validity in that the test creators claim the test measures cognitive abilities free
                                           from co-variants like sociocultural or environmental factors.

"Modified Cultural Pluralism" do not propose any significant approach to valuing
linguistic diversity at the structural level.

                                  Insular Cultural Pluralism

Insular Cultural Pluralism consists of various linguistic communities co-existing with
each other, but they are separated by physical areas where each ethnic linguistic group
resides. They are at the periphery of mainstream English speech communities. These
speech communities only crossover for legal matters or for work. When younger
generations learn English, they may integrate for periods of their day, but then return to
their own speech community with families and elders, who are first-generation
immigrants and remain in areas where their language is spoken, and their cultural
products and practices are allowed publicly. Examples of these communities in New
York, are found in upper Manhattan for immigrants from the Dominican Republic,

linguistic diversity is seen by the dominant culture as a problem. Norms are established
according to the dominant group and others are judged inferior. Students from non-
dominant cultural backgrounds must attend remedial educational programs to
overcome deficits. The alternative proposes that if teachers and schools commit to a
quest for accessing quality education for all, then differences may become simply viewed
as differences, and not as deficits. If all educational leaders capitalize upon uniqueness in
language and cultural backgrounds to teach students more effectively, the result would
be genuinely accepting diversity as a new standard for creating a multilingual national
unity. Teachers may see themselves guided by three orientations in relation to linguistic
diversity in their school settings. First, when the non-dominant language (heritage or
immigrant language) is seen as a problem, then assimilation to English and
Americanization is favored. Second, when the individual's native language is seen as a
right, then bilingual programs are implemented, heritage and immigrant languages are
maintained as well as the acquisition of the majority language. Third, when language is
seen as a resource, then all school language programs seek to maintain heritage languages
and promote second languages to the rest, dominant monolingual students, by the
implementation of dual language programs throughout elementary and secondary
(K-12) education for all students.

                Language Ideology and Perceptions of Bilingual Education.

There are many factors involved in the formation of ideologies regarding bilingual
education. First, appraisal of the bilingual classroom is often formed through its
opposition with the monolingual classroom, which is perceived by students as their final
goal, the ideal. The bilingual classroom becomes a step, a transition, and a remediation
necessary to accomplish the goal of adaptation into the English language and society.
Therefore the "bilingual" classroom is not about bilingualism, but a transition into
monolingualism. Another perspective is that bilingual classes are viewed as inferior
compared to the regular classes because of the people who comprise them; a the vast
majority may perceive these students as uneducated immigrants belonging to lower
socioeconomic classes. Moreover, students in these classes are placed homogeneously,
erasing the differences between those who have been born in the U.S and lived within
two languages all their lives and the others who are currently experiencing the
immigration and acculturation processes. As a result, instructors do not give enough
importance to the variety of performance levels within the students and, adding to
the problem, in a lot of cases the teachers' inexperience and mediocre knowledge of
these students' backgrounds lead them to categorize these students as deficient and
problematic learners.

                                BRIEF HISTORY OF BILINGUAL EDUCATION IN THE
                                UNITED STATES

                                           The U.S. has always been diverse linguistically. However, ideologies and beliefs behind
                                           this language contact have been shaped according to historical and political periods.
                                           Baker and Jones (1998) divided the historical moments of linguistic ideologies in the
                                           U.S. into three main periods: the independence period, the restrictive period. and the
                                           opportunity period. The independence period supported multilingualism and bilingual
                                           education towards dual maintenance. English was the dominant language in leadership,
                                           but other colonial languages were embraced. The same was not the case, however, for
                                           the indigenous languages of Native Americans, which the institutions of power sought
                                           to erase as part of an ethnic cleansing campaign of assimilation or removal. In The 18th
                                           and first half of the 19th century a permissive period of multiple languages followed;
                                           linguistic diversity was generally accepted and encouraged through religious practices,
                                           some emerging mass media (print), and within private and public educational settings.

                                                 Towards the second half of the 19th century in response to mass immigration
                                           into the United States, there was a sharp cultural turn towards ethnocentrism and
                                           English hegemony. This turn led to the restrictive period, which continued during the
                                           first half of the 20th century due to the great influx of new immigrants. These speech
                                           communities inundated the schools with multiple linguistic backgrounds and there
                                           was a national call for integration among the new arrivals. Integration and assimilation
                                           around the English language was presented as a symbol of loyalty to the receiving
                                           country. After the first world war, there was an anti-German sentiment, and English
                                           monolingualism became the response to this apparently Germanic threat. Linguistic
                                           intolerance strengthened and schools became the places where diverse people assimilated
                                                                                            LINGUISTIC DIVERSITY IN U.S. EDUCATION 113

and integrated to the dominant speech community. The interest to learn foreign
languages diminished considerably. Some institutional policies reinforced this need for
integration. In 1919, the education system adopted a resolution that recommended
all schools, private and public, to make English the language of instruction (Baker &
Jones, 1998). Schools began to make English the dominant language of instruction
for all content areas in the years that followed. By 1923, thirty-four states decreed that
English must be the language of instruction in all schools. This first half of the 20th
century, emphasized compulsory attendance to public schools. Financial government
assistance to private or parochial schools, which may have had some bilingual programs,
was eliminated completely. Despite these policy changes, there were conflicting messages
top- down regarding linguistic tolerance. This same year, the Supreme Court declared
unconstitutional a law in Nebraska that prohibited foreign language teaching to
elementary school children and declared that learning and acquiring knowledge in a
foreign language would not affect the health, moral development, or comprehension
of the learner. Nevertheless, the Supreme Court did not extend its ruling to support
bilingual education or the use of bilingualism for communication in the public-school
context. Colonial European languages were not perceived as "ethnic immigrant
languages", but as "foreign languages." These languages were incorporated into the
curriculum as another school subject. Schools and curriculum did not attach any
ethnocultural value of these languages to the history of the U.S., and the Indigenous
ethnolinguistic speech communities were perceived as unconnected/external to the
dominant mainstream culture wherein First Nations, or Indigenous, peoples were not
considered as truly American citizens. During the second world war, Jewish and Italian
immigrants were integrated into the English dominant school system. Additionally,
these two immigrant groups were granted a special permit allowing the use of their native
languages for content instruction as a transitional model as the students assimilated
into the English-centered curriculum; however these transitional models did not foster
bilingualism and biliteracy. Students' success was measured by how rapidly they
embraced the English language and the new U.S. cultural practices.

      The second half of the 20th century shifted to an opportunity period in terms of
including multiple languages in the school curriculum. After 1957, when the Russians
sent their first spaceship outside of the planet, the U.S. political leaders began to question
the country's capacity to compete in an international market and technology. A debate
that questioned quality of education, scientific creativity, and recognition that other
languages must be learned quickly followed. As mentioned in an earlier chapter the
federal government mobilized funding for the National Defense Education Act of 1958.
As a result, U.S. national defense agencies promoted foreign language teaching, and
multiple pedagogical strategies to teach other languages rapidly became popular, mostly
during the Cold War period. This mostly highlighted the need for other languages in
terms of national security, but not much for the overall population.

      This restrictive period continued until the 1960s and became an important topic
thereof for the state policies in the United States. During the 1960s, the issue of bilingual
education was brought up for re-evaluation by the human rights movement, as a signal
towards ethnic tolerance and a possibility for social integration. The arrival of a large

English.
                                    It is important to highlight that scholarly research on the benefits of bilingualism
                              was not advanced during this period and people just supported their opinions on the
                              ideology of bilingualism as a phenomenon, which resulted in confusion and a significant
                              delay in content knowledge of basic schooling for immigrant children. As academic
                              studies started to demonstrate the cognitive benefits of bilingualism, initiatives in
                              pedagogical approaches began to be discussed. Teachers and communities debated: the
                              amount of each language for instruction, the efficacy of pull out versus push in
                              programs, the allocation of resources available, and the need for professional
                              development for teachers that were mostly monolingual. New York schools needed
                              bilingual teachers and programs that sought to recruit Puerto Rican bilingual teachers
                              were implemented . There was a wave of Puerto Rican professionals moving to New
                              York City to fulfill this need of human resources in New York City Public Schools.
                              Other professional immigrants from Latin America took advantage of this opportunity
                              and most of the ESL or Bilingual support was done by adult immigrants from Spanish
                              speaking countries. Nevertheless, this was not guaranteeing a change to a pluralistic view
                              of multilingualism and heritage language maintenance.

                                    On the contrary, the Reagan administration was hostile towards bilingual
                              education arguing that such programs which allowed for heritage language maintenance
                              and use of the heritage language for instruction did not foster integration and

assimilation into the English dominant labor market in the U.S. By 1985, financial
support to bilingual educational programs switched to ESL monolingual instruction
programs. The issue was mostly a political debate that did not allow teachers to assess
and propose effective ways to teach content using the native languages of the immigrant
children. In the meantime, there was a surge of linguists and other scholars in the
social sciences investigating the cognitive effects of bilingualism and the benefits of using
a strong language to access the other language system in order to develop biliteracy.
All of theory and research was too new for politicians of the time to understand;
therefore,language policies were based on flawed misinformed ideas based on ideologies
and not scientific studies. Therefore, the federal government passed the responsibility
about the decisions on bilingual education to local state politicians. Finally, after several
academic studies began to demonstrate the benefits of bilingual development, a shift
in ideologies towards valuing cultural plurilingualism has recently begun in earnest.
Nevertheless, there has been difficulty into coming to consensus on best practices in
teaching value and maintaining and celebrating multilingualism in the U.S. as well as to
teach children from multilingual and multicultural backgrounds.

BILINGUAL EDUCATION AFTER 1980

Brisk (1998) presents one of the earliest extensive works on bilingual education (1998).
Her work describes the existing models in English as a second language and bilingual
instruction according to learning objectives, type of students served, languages in which
literacy is developed, and language of subject matter instruction. Brisk adds that
bilingual models are divided between those that strive for fluency in the second language,
English, and those that have as a major goal fluency in two languages. When comparing
the two models, the English as a second language/ bilingual structured immersion
programs are perceived as subtractive because the development of the second language is
done at the expense of the native language. The subtractive model's success is measured
by how quickly the students exit the program. On the other hand, bilingual programs
that support fluency in two languages are additive since they foster development of both,
the second and native languages. Additive models focus on dual language development
as well as academic preparation. Brisk's analysis of the factors affecting bilingual
programs describes contradictory results: students succeed in programs that start in the
second language when the students are members of language majority, have a strong basis
in their native language and positive language attitudes, hear and see language constantly
used in their environment, and eventually take language courses in school. Programs
fail when students belong to language minorities with weak literacy background in
their native language, limited use of the language in the larger environment, and poor
attitudes toward their own language. According to the author, the concern is not a
choice of language, but the characteristics of the population served.

      Also, in early research on bilingual instruction, Torres (1990) differentiates
between the pluralistic and the acculturation models of bilingual education programs:
cultural pluralist approaches measure the success of bilingual education programs by
the extent to which they help maintain and cultivate native languages and cultures;
116 RESTORYING EDUCATION

                                           supporters of cultural pluralism advocate maintenance of bilingual programs that treat
                                           both languages equally so that content subjects are taught in both languages. One of
                                           the aims of bilingual education should be to demonstrate that heritage languages are
                                           valid instruments of communication, and literacy development, the same as English.
                                           Children in pluralistic language models develop more positive attitudes about their
                                           cultural heritage, their parents, and their first/home language. In opposition, there are
                                           the acculturation models which slowly limit the use of native languages and cultures.
                                           Torres argues that these subtractive bilingual education models serve to make
                                           acculturations smoother supporting English monolingualism as a norm.

                                         MEET THE THEORIST

                                                       Ana Celia Zentella was born in the South Bronx, New York City to a Puerto Rican
                                                       mother and a Mexican father. Growing up in the 1950s, she was exposed not only to
                                                       multiple languages but also to multiple varieties of Spanish in New York. She
                                                       attended Hunter College, CUNY in the Bronx as an undergraduate, obtaining a
                                                       B.A. degree in Spanish. She went on to complete a M.A. in Romance Languages and
                                                       Literatures at Pennsylvania State University, and obtained a PhD in Educational
                                                       Linguistics in 1981 at the University of Pennsylvania, with a dissertation titled
                                                       "Hablamos los dos. We speak both": Growing up bilingual in el barrio. Dr. Zentella
                                                       is a linguist well-known for her "anthro-political" approach to linguistic research
                                                       and her expertise on multilingualism, linguistic diversity, and language intolerance,
                                                       especially in relation to diverse U.S. Latino languages and communities on the East
                                                       and West coasts. An early member of the Department of Black and Puerto Rican

       Studies at Hunter College, she is now Professor Emerita of Ethnic Studies at the
       University of California, San Diego. Her 1997 book Growing up Bilingual: Puerto
       Rican children in New York was honored by the British Association for Applied
       Linguistics and the Association of Latina and Latino Anthropologists of the
       American Anthropology Association. Zentella's research adopts a political
       perspective on linguistic anthropology that places language in its social context and
       acknowledges that no language exists without being subjected to power. Much of
       her research focuses on U.S. varieties of Spanish, English, and Spanglish, practices of
       language socialization in familias latinas, and the societal impact of "English-only"
       laws. In 2023 she was inducted into the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.

The decade of the 90s was fruitful for scholars in the field of bilingualism, and among
them Zentella (1990) presented another perspective to the issue of bilingual education
vs. monolingual methodology of submersion. This scholar states that the submersion
methodology functions well when it is part of an educational experience to expand the
linguistic and cultural repertoire of the students of the majority group, but submersion
does not work properly when it intends to eliminate the language and culture of the
minority group. Another problem acknowledged by Zentella is the role of immigrant
parents for language input. It was common, at the end of the 20th century, to hear
teachers encouraging parents to speak more English to their children without
understanding that it would be of more value if parents spoke the language that they
know best. Providing heritage language experience to the child helps them to develop
linguistic skills, such as language registers and variations, including the construction of
logical arguments. However, this linguistic contribution by parents is not stimulated
since in most cases the parents' speech is judged as inferior to the academic standard
languages used at schools, therefore not productive for the development of language
acquisition.

      As teachers' professional development became more linguistically inclusive turning
into the new millennium, and assimilation ideologies become slowly replaced by
pluralistic views about diversity, schools begun to transform into "affirming classrooms"
leading to "affirming societies" in which racism, sexism, social class discrimination, and
other biases are no longer acceptable (Nieto, cited in Reagan, 2009). Therefore, previous
ideologies underlying many school policies and practices that were based on flawed
ideas about intelligence and difference were questioned; curriculums and pedagogical
strategies, today, must consider differentiation, multilingualism and multiculturalism in
all content areas, and teachers are encouraged to learn about the cultures and languages
of their pupils. In addition, if schools support the use of heritage languages, the linguistic
loyalty sentiment by parents who would like their children to maintain cultural ties
to their origins, adds to the support needed by their children to become and maintain
a balanced bilingualism while encouraging their monolingual peers to learn other
languages and cultures.

      Acquiring languages is not the same for all learners, it depends on many factors
from individual aptitudes to contextual situations that may act as emotional filters,
which may affect motivation in both directions, negative and positive. Brisk (1998)
explains there are multiple situational and individual factors that affect students' school
performance. Situational factors, including linguistic, cultural, economic, political, and

                                           and positive motivation achievement. Learners' backgrounds such as language spoken
                                           at home, cultural practices, and parents' level of education influence how bilingual
                                           students' performance in school. Families' perceptions of their children's linguistic needs
                                           may oscillate between the perception that bilingual programs may slow down their
                                           children's immersion into the community's dominant culture, hence they do not see
                                           these programs as beneficial to provide the transitional time. Typically, these are families
                                           who already reside within the U.S and would prefer immersion programs that prompt
                                           their children to function rapidly among the mainstream culture for their own success,
                                           at the expense of losing their home language. Families that seek full immersion into the
                                           dominant culture, often see their immigration experience to the U.S. as an opportunity
                                           to leave behind any suffering of the past. On the other hand, there are families that view
                                           the bilingual education received by their children as the only path for their children to
                                           fluent literacies in their heritage language.These fluent literacy practices help children to
                                           write and read in their parents' native language and provide opportunities for parents
                                           to help with their homework in addition to encouraging maintenance of the heritage
                                           language while immersion in English. These families often consider a possible return
                                           to their homeland and prefer to maintain strong ties to their culture including their
                                           children born in the U.S.

                                LANGUAGE ATTITUDES

                                           Language attitudes are motivated by several instrumental and integrative dimensions.
                                           According to Colin Baker (1995) there is the instrumental motivation, which reflects
                                           pragmatic, utilitarian motives. Language becomes the catalyst characterized by the desire
                                           to gain social recognition or economic advantages. It is self-oriented, individualistic,
                                           and would seem to have a conceptual overlap with the need for achievement. On the
                                           other hand, integrative motivation is mostly social and interpersonal in orientation
                                           including the need for affiliation, and a desire to be a representative member of a speech
                                           community. Teachers ought to investigate their students' motivations towards heritage
                                           language maintenance or rejection. This often becomes overt after middle school years
                                           when there is a concrete academic offer to study LOTE (Languages Other than English)
                                           languages, and heritage speakers find themselves questioning their proficiency in the
                                                                                            LINGUISTIC DIVERSITY IN U.S. EDUCATION 119

home language and their desire for improvement or abandonment. It is important to
consider when investigating the participants' language proficiency or desire to improve
it, their attitude or motivation to learn a new language or maintain their home language
is independent of their linguistic aptitude (capacity to easily acquire language). Aptitude
relates to the level of difficulty, the ability, that a person has towards learning a new
language and becoming a bilingual proficient speaker. This varies among people with
diverse learning experiences.

      Participants' instrumental and integrative orientations may develop positively or
negatively. For example, some statements that reveal instrumental positive are:

        I want to preserve my heritage language. Knowing Spanish is necessary (good) to
        find a job later, specifically teaching it or in bilingual school environments.
      On the opposite side, the statements that reveal an instrumental negative attitude
are:

        Heritage languages are not necessary to survive in the U.S., Our parents needed to
        learn English to help us with schoolwork and social adaptation. Preserving Spanish
        at home led to confusion in learning and developing English proficiency.
      The integrative positive statements are:

        Knowing Spanish is necessary (good) to relate to my family; Schools must help to
        preserve heritage languages and not penalize its use; Parents must demand the use
        of heritage language at home.
      Integrative negative statements are:

        A common language, in this case English, is more useful for everyone to learn at
        school. Having multiple languages in a classroom is chaotic and difficult to deliver
        content knowledge, it requires more financial resources.
      There are five determinants on the development of language attitudes that are basic
for the required observation when encountering heritage speakers in the classrooms.
First, age; the various types of language input and experiences, positive or negative, the
student has received up to their age while growing up. Second,the child's caretaker while
growing up in a multilingual or bilingual setting, who is or was responsible for the
child's upbringing, and the kinds of language input received by their mother, father,
or other relatives. In addition, there is also the consideration of caretakers' educational
levels and their own proficiencies in other languages or dialects spoken. Third, schooling
and educational experiences; what kind of formal or multilingual/bilingual integrated
curriculum, and extracurricular activities have been part of the students' experiences
that may produce favorable attitudes, or may change their language attitudes; therefore,
increasing or decreasing proficiencies in home languages. For example, parents' choices
of schools and programs available to them within their communities of residence.
Fourth, ability; if the learner presents confident ability towards learning languages and
literacy development, there is higher achievement proficiency and ability in a language as
a result of a more favorable attitude. Often this ability depends on other determinants
that influence the linguistic attitude towards multilingualism or bilingualism. Lastly,

                           community is often experienced with lack of linguistic exposure in one of the languages.
                           Thus, this change results in learners' loss in expressive language (speech, gestures, or
                           writing) or simplification of language skills. In other words, losing command of a variety
                           of grammatical forms and/or vocabulary in their linguistic repertoire.

MEET THE THEORIST

Joshua A. Fishman (Yiddish name Shikl) was born on July 18, 1926, and raised in
Philadelphia. He died on March 1, 2015. He was an American linguist who
specialized in the sociology of language, language planning, bilingual education,
language and ethnicity. He attended public schools while also studying Yiddish at
elementary and secondary levels. He studied Yiddish in Workmen's Circle Schools,
which emphasized mastery of the Yiddish language along with a focus on literature,
history, and social issues. He attended the University of Pennsylvania, majoring in
history and psychology. Dr. Fishman completed his Ph.D. in social psychology at
Columbia University in 1953 with a dissertation entitled Negative Stereotypes
Concerning Americans among American-born Children Receiving Various Types
of Minority-group Education. From 1955 to 1958, he taught the sociology of
language at the City College of New York while he was also directing research at the
College Entrance Examination Board. In 1958, he was appointed an associate
professor of human relations and psychology at University of Pennsylvania. He
subsequently accepted a post as professor of psychology and sociology at Yeshiva
University in New York, where he would also serve as dean of the Ferkauf Graduate
School of Social Sciences and Humanities as well as academic vice president. In
1966, he was made Distinguished University Research Professor of Social Sciences.
In 1988, he became professor emeritus and became affiliated with a number of other
institutions. Fishman wrote over 1000 articles and monographs on multilingualism,
bilingual education and minority education, the sociology and history of the
Yiddish language, language planning, reversing language shift, language revival,
language and nationalism, language and religion, and language and ethnicity.

                                           According to Fishman (1997),language shift occurs when exposure and prestige is
                                           associated with the dominant language, in case of the U.S. context would be English.
                                           However, reverse shift may occur when there is an immersion in the immigrant speech
                                           community, either in the U.S. due to immigrant communities from the same linguistic

                                           to the original speech communities outside of the U.S. to their parents' country of
                                           origin. An individual may become orally proficient in both languages due to exposure,
                                           yet oral proficiency does not transfer easily to literacy. Command of biliteracy depends
                                           on educational programs available, support for heritage language maintenance in dual

                                           preserving their heritage language. There are caretakers that insist in the active use of
                                           their home language in the private domains, whereas there are others that prefer that

                                           to a societal linguistic insecurity among monolingual speakers in the U.S. where more
                                           "nativist" governmental policies may be used to highlight the dominance of English,

differently depending on the child's first contact with the societal language and attitudes
held by the community. The students' attitude toward the heritage language and their
academic success is deeply related to their perception of the socioeconomic class to which
they belong. In addition to academic and linguistic success, attitudes affect the chances
for social integration.

      "In the United States assimilation is seen as a precondition for social, political, and
economic participation. Although most immigrant groups aspire to social and economic
incorporation, they do not all have the same options. Some succeed in assimilation

                                           (Brisk, 1998, p. 51).

                                                 Integration into the dominant English mainstream communities depends on the
                                           ethnic and linguistic diversity encountered in the places the learners reside. There are
                                           some parents who purposely moved away from predominantly immigrant and
                                           multilinguistic neighborhoods to provide a "better" American environment and
                                           education for their children. Nevertheless, some of these families do not neglect the
                                           importance of their heritage language as an identity value and use it in the home setting;
                                           These families divide the private experience from the public one as a strategy to motivate
                                           their children to preserve their native culture and language. However, it may occur that
                                           children of diverse ethnic and linguistic backgrounds find themselves competing with

                                           reunions. Intertwined private and social communal practices aid families to overcome
                                           discrimination from mainstream environments that might discourage their kids from
                                           continuing into higher education. Brisk analyzes how social factors affect the
                                           interactions between schools and students and ultimately students' performance.

                                                 "Unfortunately, most bilingual individuals suffer social prejudices that thwart their
                                           aspirations. Societal pressures force immigrants to make difficult choices between home

                                           assisting in the constructive and creative development of linguistically diverse identities.
                                           Therefore, the relationship and understanding that educators establish with
                                           multilingual learners and young immigrants is extremely important. Linguistically
                                           diverse students arrive to the U.S educational system with a distinctive cultural
                                           background. These learners need to achieve literacy fluency in the community language,
                                           English, and use their native/heritage language proficiencies to advance, to encode (read)
                                           and encode (write) text in order to not fall behind in various contents in elementary
                                           and secondary classrooms. Teachers ought to become more sensitive to cultural
                                           manifestations and identity construction while allowing bilingual acquisition to evolve
                                           naturally and strengthening mental connections in their learning process. Zentella
                                           (1990) added that in early times of bilingual advocacy, schoolteachers played an

programs as well as special ENL instructional programs. The secondary and post-
secondary institutions have also been affected by this population shift in linguistically
diverse students. This has encouraged educators to re-design teaching strategies that are
inclusive to linguistic diversity, encouraging new teachers to learn other languages
themselves or use technology available to be able to help their students. Linguistic diverse
classrooms nowadays, include a main classroom teacher assisted by a certified ENL or
Bilingual teacher. Schools differ in their approaches due to demographics of immigrant
populations and the human resources available. Another challenge is counting on
textbook publishers to develop bilingual/multilingual materials. School linguistic
practices are also influenced by the language used at homes. If heritage languages use is
strong outside the school, educational policies cannot ignore such a reality and must
include language programs that address the sociolinguistic dynamic of the community.
Brisk (1998) adds the "status of languages and their speakers, status of dialects and
subgroups within ethnic groups, socioeconomic level, race, gender, and reasons for being
in the United States shape attitudes and expectations of teachers toward bilingual
students" (p. 49). Language educational policies must consider the preparation of
teachers to understand such reality of language minority students.

      The difficulty to maintain bilingualism across generations is well assumed, even
when societal bilingualism is stable. Many scholars and students are pessimistic about the
maintenance of heritage languages in an environment surrounded by societal pressures
and misconceptions of the benefits of bilingualism, or multilingualism, in our society.
The classroom by itself is limited in accomplishing this goal; therefore, it is important
for educators to listen to what parents believe and how they see their children's future in
the country where they had immigrated as well as their own children's well-being. Silva-
Corvalán (1997) describes important findings of her research about the Spanish spoken
in Los Angeles and its sociolinguistic aspects. She observes the situation of Spanish
maintenance or shift to English. For example, there are more publications in Spanish,
more TV programs for Spanish speaking audiences, numerous companies publicize
in Spanish and a great deal of institutions and organizations provide special services
in Spanish. Within the family domain, older children are most likely to preserve the
home language; however younger children experience language contact earlier in life
and due to the less strict strategies by parents to encourage language maintenance, the
younger children prefer English over Spanish during their language development. Silva-
Corvalán confirms these patterns based on her studies. Generally, the linguistic attitudes
by Hispanics to preserve their home language and culture is positive, but their positive
attitude becomes conflicted with a lack of concrete compromise to do something for the
Spanish language and the ancestral culture. On the other hand, recent immigrants have
126 RESTORYING EDUCATION

                                           stimulated the frequent use of Spanish in the work environment. These cases motivate

                            or because of linguistic loyalty in their households and immigrant communities. The
                            experiences that these two types of students have in schools add to the pedagogical
                            research on ideologies regarding bilingual education. One study (Montrul, 2013) implies
                            bilingual educational programs are not about maintaining bilingualism, but, rather, a
                            transition to monolingualism, which sacrifices heritage languages. Moreover, students
                            belonging to these bilingual classes are not only part of the disadvantaged social class,
                            they are perceived as citizens which necessitates their assimilation into the mainstream
                            society. However, this becomes troubling because, within the norm and academic
                            development in the school system, the problem remains with the students and not in the
                            implementation of the bilingual program.

                                  Another interpretation of what occurs inside the bilingual classroom is erasure.
                            Students in bilingual classes are placed homogeneously, erasing the differences between
                            those who have been born in the U.S. and lived within two languages all their lives
                            and the others who have experienced the immigration and acculturation processes upon
                            immigration arrival. In addition, places of origin, as an important factor of uniqueness,
                            are erased to form one distinct cultural group among most of the school population,
                            homogenous within themselves. As a result, instructors do not give enough importance
                            to the variety of languages, dialects, and proficiency levels within this student
                            population. Adding to the problem, often teachers' inexperience or perfunctory
                            knowledge of these students' backgrounds lead to the deficit approach which categorizes
                            these students as deficient and problematic learners. The diversity within the students in
                            these bilingual classrooms is lost to hidden curriculum to assimilate these students into a
                            dominant homogeneous society. ELLS and EBs are not homogenous at all. They differ
                            by the manner their languages were acquired. There are three main types of bilinguals
                            according to input exposure (Romain, 1995): the coordinate bilingual who learned the

their parents' native language, they develop a new variety of this heritage language in
the United States, which differs from the monolingual dialects from their countries of
origin. This new multilingual variation in the U.S. is formed by language and dialect
contact in the new country (Escobar-Potowski, 2015). In youth, it becomes an
interesting code-switching output, with its own grammar, not in violation of the
syntactic rules of the languages involved. Language code-switching becomes a unique
marker of identity for these speakers in mainstream societies.

REFLECTIVE TALKING POINT

Children that use minority/heritage language at home, experience their first
encounter with the majority language at school. For heritage languages to be
maintained and balanced bilingualism encouraged, it needs an opportunity to be
fostered at the home environment and support from the school setting and
communities at large.

                                           Domains are understood as the environments where individuals receive language input
                                           and interact within speech communities. Wide domains include home first. In this
                                           domain it is necessary to analyze relationships and family roles among mother, father,
                                           siblings, and other relatives in the household. Birth position in the family is important
                                           since the older child usually receives more heritage language input, and the younger
                                           children are exposed to the mainstream language as the older ones attend public

                                           with the institutional language. If the community has a large population of immigrants
                                           from the same linguistic background, then the heritage and the dominant language
                                           compete, fostering bilingualism. On the contrary, if the community is anglophonic and
                                           there is less language diversity, the child most likely will transition. There are other

                                           heritage language becomes part of the private domain and English takes the public
                                           domain.

                                                 In recent research on rural upstate New York communities of Hispanic agricultural
                                           immigrants (Montoya, 2015, Montoya & Leung, 2016, & Living Bilingual Blog, 2024
                                           ). This research observed an interesting phenomenon of heritage language maintenance
                                           within communities where Hispanic immigrants live in clusters surrounded by
                                           anglophonic monolingual communities. This occurs due to the need to maintain ethnic
                                           identities where these identities survive from mutual support from each other and
                                           affirmative pride in their country of origin, which strengthens their community
                                           network. In these communities, inserted in rural NY, groups of people from the same
                                           origins are found, sharing public communal religious practices, cultural entertainment
                                           brought by them to the wide anglophonic community during Mexican holidays (public
                                           dances and food selling at public markets). This phenomenon, if embraced by the
                                           mainstream English speakers, integrates heritage speakers' dual identities. For more

positive outcomes, it is usually the role of teachers in these rural areas who have been
observed providing care and support.

      There are cultural symbolic markers that serve to foster dual language
development. The music industry and social media is foremost the piece in fostering
heritage language maintenance as it provides a unique skill to the children growing
up with two languages that differentiates them from other young members of their
mainstream communities, serving as identity markers that teenagers use to feed their
networks of bilingual/code switchers friends. Along with the influences that these
domains may have in a heritage child, there are the motives for retention: first, "root"
identity passed by immigrant parents who are loyal and proud of their ethnicities;
second, need for association with networks of friends that are multicultural/
multilingual, and lastly, recognition of the heritage language as an important skill to
later secure a unique position in the job market. Language retention is observed to
happen when there is fluid communication with extended family members and others
in the community who are new immigrants into the U.S. Zentella (1997)revealed from
her studies of the Puerto Rican community in New York, that those who favor the
retention of Spanish are children who have both parents belonging to the group of first-
generation adult immigrants. Nevertheless, there are other factors that relate to parents'
support of their children's bilingualism; for example, if there is an assumption that
if their ethnicity and language is retained, their children's social advancement may be
penalized.. This preoccupation is factored by parents' level of education and their own
and other family members' experiences of discrimination. Any kind of unpleasant or
unjust situations that parents may have experienced by their lacking English fluency, will
possibly perpetuate their own negative attitudes about immigration and bilingualism,
which affects their assimilation into the U.S society, linguistically and culturally.

     REFLECTIVE TALKING POINT

       Families are so different from another in composition, cultural beliefs and practices,
       routines, levels of education, and access to products and services, and documented
       immigrant status in the U.S. All these factors may determine their capacity to assist
       their children to improve and take opportunities.

       1. How can teachers support families to help their children succeed considering
            the diversity within them? Provide concrete examples.

MODELS OF EDUCATION FOR ENGLISH LANGUAGE

Sonia Nieto (2017) defines multicultural education as a five-stage process (The five
levels of multicultural education.) It departs at the monoculture level when one is only
familiar with an immediate cultural input similar to self; then difference is noticed and
130 RESTORYING EDUCATION

                                           tolerance is civilly required by institutions such as schools so humans may cohabitate
                                           with one another. Not until authentic and honest interaction occurs, one comes to
                                           experience acceptance of the Other; respect ought to follow by learning about the others'

                                                 The ideologies underlying many school policies and practices are based on flawed
                                           ideas about intelligence and difference. If we want to change the situation, it means
                                           changing the curriculum and pedagogy in individual classrooms, as well as the school's
                                           practices and the ideologies undergirding them. That is, we need to create not only
                                           affirming classrooms, but also an affirming society in which racism, sexism, social class
                                           discrimination, and other biases are no longer acceptable." ~ Sonia Nieto (cited in

                                                 Through our U.S. educational history, immigrant children, or U.S born children
                                           of immigrants have been labeled many terms: "Non-English Speakers", "Minority

                                           Language Learners (ELLs)" and Emergent Bilinguals (EB). Definitions and
                                           understanding of this type of population have evolved to consider these students'
                                           learning more positive. Although teachers still struggle today to see them as
                                           comprehensive case studies with specific stories and needs. Pedagogical strategies
                                           transform as the increase in immigration demographics demand schools and
                                           communities to address this student population and the teaching/learning
                                           requirements. There have been two main curricular paths schools take to teach English
                                           to these second-generation speakers of other languages. The first and most popular
                                           in the U.S consists of transitional models where the goal for the learner is to become
                                           proficient in English; the second model targets dual-language learning and development
                                           of bilingualism. The latter is only implemented in areas where there are enough speakers
                                           of one language to balance classroom enrollment with half English monolinguals and
                                           the other half with a common immigrant language, which targets the entire school
                                           population to become bilingual. Tables 1 and 2 below summarize the models within

for teaching speakers of other languages. Literacy pedagogy has transformed as a new
generation of students enter classrooms with different perspectives about reading and
writing. For instructors that have experienced technological changes early in their
careers, but were educated with outdated pedagogical theory, it becomes challenging to
engage the "app generation" (Gardner and Davis, 2014) with traditional approaches to
teaching grammar and written composition. Teaching the heritage language speakers,
today, requires adapting and merging their multifaceted diversity, their experienced
technological skills, language proficiencies, and funds of knowledge (Gonzalez, Moll, &
Amanti, 2005) students bring into the classroom. These new approaches to teaching
literacy within bilingualism must be attentive to the students' interest in shifting their
use of an oral-private language into a written-public one. For this purpose, the
development of a sociolinguistic teaching methodology, where teachers prompt students
to explore aspects of their own identities through oral narratives and written
autobiographies in the classroom (Potowski, 2005). This becomes essential for analyzing
132 RESTORYING EDUCATION

                                           retrospectively and reflecting about their students' linguistic and cultural diversity, while
                                           acquiring academic literacy proficiency in their heritage language . However, this alone
                                           does not address the way that "digital natives" learn. The work of multiliteracies
                                           pedagogy (Cope and Kalantzis, 2009) reveals that it is not only about the textbook or
                                           the sociolinguistic approach to instruction, but also the development in understanding
                                           there is a multi-literate world [that digital native ]students more proficient in new media
                                           navigate with ease where the instructor is less proficient. This often detaches teachers'
                                           more traditional, or print centered, understanding of literacy development. A teaching
                                           proposal to address linguistic diversity departs from the private reflection, personal
                                           stories that may inspire conscious re-construction of students' bilingual - bicultural
                                           identity. Digitizing oral and written autobiographical discourses through devices beyond
                                           the pencil and paper and allowing students to code-switch, or translanguage, between
                                           their languages in digital communication as it is naturally reproduced by their bilingual
                                           proficiency, would give these students a voice in a web-connected world. One example of
                                           this process is in the Living Bilingual blog, where SUNY-Oneonta students share their
                                           stories of growing up bilingual and bicultural. Using these digital spaces to promote
                                           multilingualism will help develop global citizenship and give visibility to speech
                                           communities that have been invisible due to the influence of ideologies of the dominant
                                           culture and language (Montoya 2009). New educators' research has suggested that if
                                           heritage speakers ought to maintain their home languages and make use of it in public
                                           domains, it may provide students with key elements to be active members in the
                                           advancement of their communities. This analysis posits how human migration affects
                                           the use of language among communities and observes how the maintenance of heritage
                                           languages is used in social networks for survival, adaptation, and conservation of an
                                           ethnic identity. (Milroy, 1980; Mines & Massey, 1985; Grim-Feinberg, 2007; Paris
                                           Pombo, 2006).

                                                 In addition, Beaudrie and Fairclough (2012) analyzed new trends in maintenance
                                           of Spanish as a heritage language, its complexities, and the role that educational programs
                                           have in supporting positive attitudes toward bilingualism in the U.S. For example,
                                           Rivera-Mills (2012) presented multiple studies that have demonstrated the shift into
                                           English for the Hispanic community has differed slightly from previous immigrant
                                           groups. However, the case of maintenance of Spanish as a heritage language in rural
                                           areas presents a more complex phenomenon. This is seen in the lack of public places
                                           where the language is used, the costly access to Spanish mass media and the slower arrival
                                           of new immigrants - making the case that maintenance of Spanish as a heritage language
                                           is more challenging. The growing Hispanic population nationally, their attachment to
                                           language as an important identity factor and the children's roles as linguistic and cultural
                                           brokers for their Hispanic parents have all served as integrative motivators for second and
                                           third generations of Hispanics to recover and/or maintain Spanish as a heritage language.
                                           Other scholars like Dresser (2013) advocate for best practices where the integration
                                           of social-emotional learning (SEL) and academic learning is determinant to achieve
                                           important social tasks. As a result, this integration would promote self-confidence, and
                                           assists students in their understanding between goal setting, self-efficacy, and success.

communities, dominant, not dominant, minority, majority, first, second, new, heritage
and these may thrive together to achieve social justice that includes linguistic diversity.
The New York State Education Department (NYSED, 2024) has expressed the concrete
need for bilingual teachers in various regions of the state:

      We, educators, understand that it is not only about being bilingual and a teacher,
but also to be able to comprehend the complex realities of immigrant families and their
journey to the "American Dream" ...their immigrant or/and U.S. born children.

     CONSOLIDATING ACTIVITY

       Reflective Talking Point:
       1. How a differentiated approach to teach heritage speakers, their home language

            academically, may be implemented? What do you understand by a
            "sociolinguistic pedagogical approach"?
       People's awareness of different cultures and languages bring great potential for more
       pluralistic ideologies about linguistic diversity.
       1. Explain how you as an individual, and as a future teacher, aid in the
            transformation of ideologies towards linguistic pluralism?

GLOSSARY

Digital Natives: A reference to people who were born into the age of the Internet and
were immersed in digital technologies and new media at a young age.

Sociolinguistics: The study of how language and discourse is influenced by social and
cultural factors.

Code-Switching: The ability to alternate between two or more languages or even
dialects in a spoken conversation.

Language ideology: values and belief systems regarding language in general, use of
specific languages and its varieties, including community practices. Language ideologies
are interconnected with social phenomena which become reflected in educational
settings affecting the teaching and learning of heritage or immigrant langauges.

Speech community: also may be referenced as "language community" formed by those
people who use a given language within a specific cohesive geographical area. One
language integrates all community members by playing an important role in their
interaction and having shared values and meanings that are part of that language and its
culture.

Ethnocentrism: to define this term, first depart from the wide definition of "Ethnic
134 RESTORYING EDUCATION

                                           Identity" which refers to a shared history, descent, belief systems, practices, language
                                           and religion, all associated with a cultural group. In the United States history there
                                           was a period where immigrants were encouraged to assimilate to the ethnic identity
                                           understood as being "American", this notion at the center for unification and exclusion
                                           of any other who manifested a difference in beliefs, values, history or language use.

                                           Plurilingualism: an environment where multiple languages may coexist without socio-
                                           political conflict and valuing linguistic diversity.

                                           English as a Second Language: a term used to classify students who are learning
                                           English, who have arrived in schools after having developed their first language for oral
                                           communication and, depending on age of arrival to the new country, these students may
                                           already be literate in their first language with some years of formal schooling.

                                           Transitional bilingual programs: these make reference to school programs, that
                                           although use other languages to teach English language Learners (ELLs), its ultimate
                                           goal is not to maintain bilingualism, but to transition into English.

                                           Growing up Bilingual: situation when a child is born in the United States of
                                           immigrant parents who decide to maintain their native language use with their children,
                                           facilitating cultural and communal practices. Zentella in her book "Growing up
                                           Bilingual" describes this family language loyal decision as a political act of resistance to
                                           the United States hegemony.

                                           Expressive language: also understood in this work as "linguistic expression", which
                                           is most typically associated with pragmatics in the speech acts. These are attempts by
                                           language users to perform specific actions, such as making statements, asking questions,
                                           making promises, expressing gratitude, requesting and apologizing. The expressiveness
                                           may be manifested through gestures specific to the speech community's culture, sound
                                           intonation, physical proximity...etc.

                                           Heritage language learner: refers to a student who speaks a home language, other than
                                           English. This person was born in the United States or arrived during early childhood
                                           prior to developing literacy in the language of their parents.

                                           Sociolinguistic pedagogical approach: this approach makes reference to an ongoing
                                           pedagogy explored after the 1980s, where their home language proficiency is used to
                                           learn the new language, and their social realities are taken in consideration as content to
                                           develop literacy.

                                           Immigrant child learner: A younger student who immigrated to the United States
                                           after having completed some years of formal schooling in their native country. The
                                           child had already begun to develop communicative proficiency and literacy in their
                                           first langauge and recognized, consciously, the change of school setting, often suffering
                                           an initial linguistic and cultural shock that demanded adaptation and learning of new
                                           practices.
                                                                                            LINGUISTIC DIVERSITY IN U.S. EDUCATION 135

Erasure: A systematic removal of a group of people or aspects of a culture to make
it seem the people or culture never existed or exists currently. One example of cultural
erasure is most depictions of Indigenous peoples have been romanticized historical
narratives, while current narratives ignore Indigenous peoples or act as if they no longer
exist in the present.

Functional grammars: refers to Michael Halliday's view that language is "a network
of systems, or interrelated sets of options for making meaning". Linguistic utterances
are shaped, based on the goals and knowledge of natural/native language users. Each
language having their own syntactic, pragmatic, and semantic functions attached to
cultural practices shaping the interaction among specific speech communities.

   FROM SLAVERY TO THE SCHOOL TO PRISON PIPELINE: A CALL FOR RESTOR ATIVE JUSTICE 139

As you read, consider these essential questions:

· How have centuries of systemic oppression, from the era of slavery to modern-
    day institutionalized discrimination, shaped the trajectory of education for
    marginalized communities in the United States?

· What measures can be taken to address the pervasive issue of the school-to-
    prison pipeline and what steps can be taken to implement restorative justice to
    dismantle this cycle of injustice?

How does the exception clause of the 13th Amendment, which abolishes slavery
`except as a punishment for crime,' intersect with modern incarceration practices,
and what are the social, economic, and racial implications of this intersection?

the Southern states, providing education to thousands of formerly enslaved individuals.
While specific statistics vary by source and region, historical records indicate that by the
end of its operations, the bureau had established hundreds of schools and employed
thousands of teachers, both black and white, to educate freedmen and their children. For
example, according to a report by the Bureau of Refugees, Freedmen, and Abandoned
Lands (1872) by 1870, the Freedmen's Bureau had established over 4,000 schools,
educating approximately 250,000 students across the Southern states. These schools
provided basic education, vocational training, and other essential skills necessary for

                                                       A still higher order of this native teaching is seen in the colored schools at

people of the city. . . All the above cases illustrate the remark that this educational
movement among the freedmen has in it a self-sustaining element. I took special
pains to ascertain the facts on this particular point, and have to report that there are
schools of this kind in some stage of advancement (taught and supported wholly by
the people themselves) in all the large places I visited--often numbers of them, and
they are also making their appearance through the interior of the entire country.
The superintendent of South Carolina assured me that there was not a place of any
size in the whole of that State where such a school was not attempted. I have much
testimony, both oral and written, from others well informed, that the same is true of
other States. There can scarcely be a doubt, and I venture the estimate, that at least
500 schools of this description are already in operation throughout the south. If,
therefore, all these be added, and including soldiers and individuals at study, we shall
have at least 125,000 as the entire educational census of these lately emancipated
people.

This is a wonderful state of affairs. We have just emerged from a terrific war; peace is
not yet declared. There is scarcely the beginning of reorganized society at the south;
and yet here are a people long imbruted by slavery, and the most despised of any on
earth, whose chains are no sooner broken than they spring to their feet and start up
an exceeding great army, clothing themselves with intelligence. What other people
on earth have ever shown, while in their ignorance, such a passion for education?

The Great Depression, which began in 1929 and persisted throughout the 1930s, was
one of the most significant crises in the history of the United States. The Great
Depression had a profound impact on all aspects of American society, including
education. During the Great Depression, black people experienced disproportionately
elevated levels of unemployment compared to the general population. While official
government statistics on unemployment rates specific to African Americans during the

accounts and studies provide insights into the extent of unemployment among African

                           (Wilson, 2009).

                                 There were many racial disparities in the criminal justice system in the 1930's.
                           According to the Bureau of Justice Statistics, by 1939, the incarceration rate reached 137
                           people incarcerated per 100,000. This incarceration level was not obtained in the United
                           States for the next 41 years (US Department of Justice Bureau of Justice Statistics, n.d.).
                           In 1930, the white-black disparity in incarceration rates was 4.1 times higher for blacks
                           than whites (Wagner, October 7, 2001).

                                 The discriminatory practice of redlining emerged during the Great Depression,
                           leading to several negative consequences. Redlining is a practice where the Homeowners'
                           Loan Corporation (HOLC) assigned A-D security ratings to neighborhoods across the
                           United States between 1935 and 1940. HOLC maps have had lingering adverse effects
                           on modern outcomes such as credit scores, family structure, home values, household
                           income, neighborhood segregation, and incarceration (Aaronson et al. 2020). Redlining
                           also impacted other important neighborhood features, like education and a healthy
                           environment. Businesses were less inclined to do business in redlined areas because they
                           were deemed hazardous, meaning residents often had to travel outside their
                           communities for things like groceries (Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, 2022).

                                 When HOLC was created in 1935 and worked with the Federal Housing
                           Administration (FHA) to ensure loans under New Deal legislation. The HOLC would
                           deem black communities a hazard leading to denial of home loans, and housing
                           covenants excluded black people from buying homes in their neighborhoods. Lukes and
                           Cleveland (2024) examined school funding disparities that have occurred and reached
                           the conclusion that schools and districts located today in historically redlined D
                           neighborhoods have less per-pupil revenues, larger shares of Black and non-White
                           student populations, and worse average test scores relative to those located in A, B, and
                           C neighborhoods. These findings suggest that policymakers need to consider the
                           historical implications of redlining and past neighborhood inequality on neighborhoods
                           today when designing modern interventions focused on improving the life outcomes of
                           students of color and students from low-socioeconomic backgrounds.

                                 Grant (1993) presented educational statistics to highlight the number of students
                           aged 5-20 from 1850-1955 who were enrolled in schools. The statistics show that over
                           time the number of black students enrolled in schools increased dramatically in the
                           period 1850-1955. Due to the Supreme Court decision in Plessy v. Ferguson in 1896,
                           schools were legally segregated in "separate but equal" conditions.

SPOTLIGHT ON ALBANY'S HISTORIC PROBLEM

WITH REDLINING AND ITS IMPACT ON SCHOOLS

In 1938, Albany, New York the HOLC map was created. During this time,here was an
influx of black Americans moving north to get more opportunities during the Great
Migration. The map designated four sections of the city as rated-D zones. These zones
were occupied by Black communtities, with some foreign-born immigrants also residing
in the area. Jasmine Higgins' ancestors moved to Albany during the Great Migration
from the South while the Black population doubling every year from 1950 to 1980
(Mikati & Medina, June 6, 2021). According to Mikati and Medina, while one-third of
Albany identifies as Black, they are mostly condensed into three neighborhoods located
in the heart of Albany; Arbor Hill, West Hill, and South End had been redlined in
1938. Albany's racial inequities closely reflect the 1938 map. Only 20% of Black residents
from Albany are homeowners with an overall poverty rate is 22% compared to
10.5%nationally. According to Silberstein (December 27, 2019), students of color,
immigrant students, and those from single-parent households have historically
concentrated in underfunded, declining neighborhoods, resulting in fewer
opportunities for many socioeconomic factors like good schools. Silberstein noted that
according to researchers at Brandeis University, Arbor Hill ranks amongst the lowest
opportunity areas for children. Using 2015 census data from neighborhoods around the
country and compared the level of opportunities such as graduation rates, percentage of
immigrant and single-parent households, income, and the availability of stable housing
and green spaces to produce a "Child Opportunity Index." These areas were rated from
1 to 100, with the highest numbers for places with the most opportunity. Arbor Hill
ranked an opportunity score of 1 in the study.

      Looking at present-day Albany, an observer can see the lasting impact of redlining
in today's schools. Albany school discipline records paint an alarming portrait of the
racial divide in school suspensions. According to the Center for Civil Rights Remedies
(2015), Albany suspended 44% of Black male secondary students with disabilities at least
once in 2011-12. All Black male secondary students face a high suspension risk of 40%.

      The nationwide systemic impact of redlining on schools has left enduring
disparities in educational opportunities and outcomes (Massey & Denton, 1993).
Redlining, a discriminatory practice in the mid-20th century, systematically denied
services, including quality education, to neighborhoods based on their racial or ethnic
composition (Rothstein, 2017). During the Great Depression, Franklin D. Roosevelt
proposed the New Deal which was a series of new programs that were proposed to
provide relief, recovery, and reform to both the government and the American people.
One program that was initiated under the New Deal was the National Industry
Recovery Act, which allowed Roosevelt to sign executive orders that would set up
industrial cartels that made it illegal to hire people below a minimum wage, which led
to approximately 500,000 black people losing their jobs. The New Deal policies made it
more difficult to hire new workers, making home ownership out of reach for many Black
Americans (Powell, 2003).

      According to Brandt (2020) the structure of home mortgages varies from the

                                           mortgages we see today. In the 1930's it was customary to require 50% of the home's
                                           cost as a down payment and forced the homeowner to pay off the remaining balance in
                                           monthly installments for a term of 5 to 10 years. To address the fact that approximately
                                           1000 people per day were defaulting on their mortgages the New Deal set up the HOLC
                                           and FHA to federally insure mortgages. While this action did invigorate home
                                           ownership, the program was set up in an era that did not recognize the civil rights for
                                           black people, so the efforts for relief excluded many black people from home ownership
                                           (Brandt, 2020).

                                                 One of the most significant effects of redlining was the increase of racial segregation
                                           in schools (Orfield & Lee, 2007). Schools in redlined neighborhoods attended by
                                           marginalized populations often face chronic underfunding. Lukes and Cleaveland
                                           (2024) studied the link between HOLC maps and current school funding and found
                                           that schools mapped to HOLC D grade areas have the highest shares of students
                                           qualifying for free and reduced-price lunch, making them eligible for Title I funding,
                                           and have worse school-level average math and reading scores than their more highly
                                           rated A, B, and C peers, nationally and regionally. This disparity in funding perpetuated
                                           unequal access to quality education, perpetuating cycles of disadvantage and inequality
                                           (Renzulli & Evans, 2005).

                                                 The legacy of redlining continues to impact educational opportunities for
                                           marginalized communities (Frankenberg & Lee, 2002). Generations of students from
                                           redlined neighborhoods have experienced barriers to academic achievement and
                                           socioeconomic mobility (Reardon & Owens, 2014). Limited access to quality education
                                           restricts opportunities for higher education and economic advancement, perpetuating
                                           intergenerational cycles of poverty (Hill, 2018).

                                                 Efforts to address the systemic impact of redlining on schools necessitate
                                           comprehensive strategies aimed at promoting equity and addressing historical injustices
                                           (Welner & Carter, 2013). Targeted investments in under-resourced schools, along with
                                           policies aimed at addressing segregation and inequality in housing and communities, are
                                           essential to promoting educational equity and opportunity for all students (Noguera,
                                           2003).

                             IMPACT ON SCHOOLS

                             President Richard Nixon's war on crime, which emerged in the late 1960s, had far-
                             reaching consequences for the United States education system. Nixon's war on crime
                             was officially announced in 1969 and was a significant shift in federal policy towards
                             criminal justice. The war on crime was driven by concerns about rising crime rates and
                             social unrest present in the late 1960's in the United States, the initiative aimed to
                             increase law enforcement capabilities, enhance punitive measures, and prioritize the fight
                             against crime as a national priority (President's Commission on Law Enforcement and
            FROM SLAVERY TO THE SCHOOL TO PRISON PIPELINE: A CALL FOR RESTOR ATIVE JUSTICE 149

Administration of Justice, 1967). According to Alexander (2010), the war on crime laid
the groundwork for the militarization of school discipline. Federal funds were allocated
to hire school resource officers to maintain order within schools. The presence of law
enforcement in schools introduced a punitive element that shifted the focus from
education to control, contributing to an environment where minor disciplinary
infractions were often treated as criminal offenses.

      Zero-tolerance policies emerged in schools when the war on crime was instituted.
Students, especially those who come from marginalized communities, became part of
a cycle where school disciplinary actions became a precursor for involvement in the
criminal justice system (Nellis, 2011). This criminalization of students under Nixon's
policies led to a sharp increase in expulsions instead of addressing the root causes of
the students' misbehavior through supportive school environments. This approach
perpetuated the school-to-prison pipeline, funneling young individuals from schools
into the criminal justice system (Sughrue, 2013).

RONALD REAGAN'S WAR ON DRUGS AND ITS
IMPACT ON THE SCHOOL-TO-PRISON PIPELINE

Reagan's war on drugs in the 1980's played a significant role in fueling the school-to-
prison pipeline, creating a cycle of youth incarceration that disproportionately affected
marginalized communities. The establishment of mandatory minimum sentences,
increased school resource officers in schools, and the racial disparities inherent in the
policies led to many negative consequences. Alexander (2010) discussed the Anti-Drug
Abuse Act of 1986, which established mandatory minimum sentences for drug offenses.
These punitive measures disproportionately affected marginalized communities, leading
to an increase in the incarceration of nonviolent offenders. The implementation of
mandatory minimums exacerbated the school-to-prison pipeline by removing youths
from the school system and funneling them into the criminal justice system. Reagan's
war on drugs also prompted the expansion of school resource officers in schools which
led to a more oppressive school environment. Under zero-tolerance policies even routine
disciplinary issues that once were handled within the school transformed into police
involvement, funneling students into the juvenile justice system, and setting them on a
path towards incarceration (Nellis, 2016).

      There has been a growing number of suspensions since 1973 in the United States.
In 1973, the overall U.S. suspension rate was 4%. By the 2009-10 school year,
suspensions had increased to 7%, with particularly sharp increases from the mid-1980s
through the 1990s. (Leung-Gagne, McComb, Scott, C., and Losen, September, 2022).
Zero tolerance policies that were in place impacted black students disproportionally
higher than their white counterparts.

                                      The 1994 Crime Bill

The 1994 Crime Bill inadvertently accelerated the school-to-prison pipeline by
150 RESTORYING EDUCATION

                                           increasing punitive disciplinary measures in schools. The Clinton Administration
                                           instituted a three-strikes policy, which mandated life sentences for individuals convicted
                                           of a violent felony after two or more prior convictions, promoted and expanded zero-
                                           tolerance policies, and increased police presence in schools. Keeping with patterns of
                                           school suspensions in previous time periods, The Crime Bill disproportionately
                                           impacted marginalized communities, contributing to the overrepresentation of
                                           minorities in the criminal justice system. Growing rates of incarceration impacted
                                           neighborhoods, causing many social-emotional concerns (Alexander, 2020).

                                 There were many actions taken to achieve the harsh standards that were enacted
                           into law under NCLB. The legislation emphasized standardized testing and tied school
                           funding to the performance of student test scores from grades 3-8. Opponents of NCLB
                           felt that the move to standardized testing is that teachers would often narrow the
                           curriculum to teach to the standardized test. Schools that did not meet the Adequate

                           need of improvement. School funding was tied to a school's AYP. Opponents felt that
                           taking funding away from low-performing schools would stigmatize schools and would
                           make meeting the more rigorous standards more difficult.

                                 One of the most controversial elements of NCLB was the movement toward zero-
                           tolerance policies that were punitive in nature. Some of the characteristics of zero-
                           tolerance policies include harsh disciplinary policies, lack of administrative discretion
                           when implementing discipline policies, and it has a negative impact on students (Klehr,
                           2009).

BREAKING THE SCHOOL TO PRISON PIPELINE
WITH RESTORATIVE JUSTICE

Restorative justice is an approach to school discipline that emphasizes repairing harm
through processes that includes all stakeholders in the process. Restorative justice aims
to build community and address the root causes of misconduct through practices like
circles, conferences, and mediation. The ACLU of Washington (December 9, 2009)
advocated for a shift away from zero-tolerance policies in schools established under
Richard Nixon, arguing that such approaches disproportionately harm marginalized
communities. The ACLU pointed out the negative impacts of zero-tolerance policies
on students of color and those with disabilities, leading to higher rates of suspension
and expulsion. It highlights the need for a restorative approach to discipline, focusing
on understanding the root causes of behavior and addressing them constructively. They
called for the implementation of alternative approaches to school discipline such as
restorative justice, which prioritizes dialogue and reconciliation over punishment. The
ACLU emphasized the importance of community engagement in shaping school
policies and encourages a comprehensive approach to student well-being.

      According to Payne and Welch (2013), schools with punitive discipline policies
are prevalent in schools after decades of the school-to-prison pipeline's creation and are
trying to transition to a community-building approach to discipline. During the latter
part of the 20th century, domestic policies took a hardline approach to crime and those
punitive policies spilled beyond the schoolhouse doors. Over time, the zero tolerance
policies under the Nixon, Reagan, and Clinton administrations have led to many harsh
punishments in schools such as suspensions and expulsions. This phenomenon has
pulled students out of the classroom and into the criminal justice system. The goal of
schools is to educate students; pulling students out of the learning environment and into
the criminal justice system makes it impossible to achieve our goal as educators.

     THE FIVE RS OF RESTORATIVE JUSTICE

       There are five Rs that serve as the foundation of restorative justice practices in
       schools; relationships, respect, responsibility, repair, and reintegration (Title,2007).
152 RESTORYING EDUCATION

                                                       Relationships

                                                       Relationships lie at the heart of the restorative justice process. The person who
                                                       caused harm has negatively impacted the lives of members of the school community.
                                                       Without strong relationships, it becomes increasingly more difficult to create
                                                       communities that students want to be a part of. As caring classroom teachers, we
                                                       can attempt to repair these relationships. Once the person who caused harm to the
                                                       classroom community starts to accept responsibility that leads to the beginning of
                                                       the restorative process (Title, 2007).

                                                       Respect

                                                       Every relationship cultivated in the classroom must be nurtured with respect.
                                                       Teachers must set an expectation for exhibiting and modeling respect for their
                                                       students. During a restorative practice intervention, all stakeholders must be
                                                       committed to showing not only respect for others, but also respect for themselves.
                                                       All members of the restorative process must engage in listening to all perspectives,
                                                       reserving judgement. Respect in the restorative process helps to make the process
                                                       less adversarial and more about repairing the relationships that have been damaged
                                                       because of an infraction in the classroom. When the restorative process is well-
                                                       defined as being a more proactive approach, classroom discipline takes on a whole
                                                       different approach that places emphasis on trusting relationships (Title, 2007).

                                                       Responsibility

                                                       For restorative justice to be an effective process, all stakeholders in the process must
                                                       address their own responsibility in an infraction. Honesty is paramount when
                                                       taking responsibility for their actions that cause harm. Even if the harm was
                                                       unintentional, the person who caused the harm needs to take responsibility for their
                                                       actions. Deciding to take responsibility is a personal choice and cannot be imposed
                                                       on someone unwillingly (Title, 2007).

                                                       Repair

                                                       Once the persons involved have accepted responsibility for their destructive behavior
                                                       and they have heard in the restorative process about how others were harmed by
                                                       their action, they are expected to make repairs. Starting the process with the goal of
                                                       repairing the situation allows us to set aside punitive thoughts of revenge and
                                                       punishment. It is essential that all stakeholders in the event be involved in
                                                       identifying the harm and having a voice in how it will be repaired. It is through
                                                       taking responsibility for one's own behavior and attempting to make amends that
                                                       students may regain or strengthen their self-respect and the respect of others (Title,
                                                       2007).

                                                       Reintegration

                                                       To complete the restorative justice process, the stakeholders in the community allow
                                                       the person who caused harm to accept responsibility for their actions and begin to
                                                       reintegrate into to the classroom community. Reintegration encourages including
                                                       all members of the classroom community and the person who caused harm in the
                                                       restorative process. This process is less harmful than isolating or removing the
                                                       student. One of the benefits of this stage of the restorative process is that it
                                                       accentuates the positive things the student brings to the classroom community.
                                                       Unlike the more punitive outcomes of zero-tolerance policies, restorative justice
                                                       places an emphasis on what the student who caused harm has learned through the
                                                       restorative process. By accepting responsibility and agreeing to repair the harm, the

       student who caused harm rebuilds the trust to be reintegrated into the classroom
       community (Title, 2007).

INTEGRATING RESTORATIVE JUSTICE IN
SCHOOLS: A CASE STUDY APPROACH

Considering traditional discipline measures failing our students, especially among
marginalized groups of students, alternative approaches to zero-tolerance policies of the
past have been adopted across the nation. A study of 485 middle schools in California
examined schools over a six-year period and noted the outcome and impacts on schools
and who had integrated restorative justice principles into their disciplinary practices.
The key findings of the study showed that schools that adopted restorative practices
have less school suspensions and expulsions. Additionally, schoolwide school discipline
and school climate improved because of using restorative practices (Darling-Hammond,
2023). Weaver & Swank (2020) also conducted a case study in the southeastern United
States and examined 1000 middle school students, 60% of whom were marginalized
students. The findings revealed that stakeholders representing various groups, including
administration, instructional staff, and students, reported success in implementing a
restorative justice approach to their discipline (Weaver & Swank, 2020).

      Jones (June 16, 2022) highlighted Fremont High School in Oakland, California.
In 2017, Fremont High School faced high discipline rates, low attendance, frequent
fights, and a low graduation rate, with only 1 in 4 graduates qualifying for public college
in California and 1 in 3 dropping out. With a newly rebuilt campus and a dedicated
effort to enhance a positive school climate, Fremont has experienced a 20% increase
in enrollment, contrasting with the districtwide decline. Additionally, the number of
students eligible for college admission has tripled. The transformation is attributed to
a restorative justice program that was initially aimed at dispute resolution but has since
evolved into a comprehensive overhaul of the school's culture (Johnson, June 16, 2022).
Schools like Fremont High School are emblematic of the vision for a more culturally
responsive approach to classroom discipline. The research points to addressing
restorative practices school-wide, and not in a single classroom. Teachers can model
respect and focus on building inclusive environments without fear of punishment.

                                               One of the key advantages of restorative justice in schools is its ability to reduce
                                         repeat offenses in the school community. A study by Hopkins and Keene (2016) found
                                         that restorative justice practices are associated with lower rates of repeat offenses
                                         compared to traditional punitive measures. By addressing the root causes of misbehavior
                                         and promoting self-reflection, restorative justice helps students develop a greater sense of
                                         responsibility in the community.

                                               Restorative justice practices align with the principles of social and emotional
                                         learning, fostering the development of crucial life skills. According to a report by the

                                               Social-emotional learning (SEL) encompasses a set of key principles aimed at
                                         fostering the development of essential skills and competencies necessary for students'

                                         social awareness, relationship skills, and responsible decision-making. These
            FROM SLAVERY TO THE SCHOOL TO PRISON PIPELINE: A CALL FOR RESTOR ATIVE JUSTICE 155

competencies serve as the foundation for promoting students' emotional intelligence,
interpersonal skills, and positive behavior. Self-awareness involves recognizing one's
emotions, strengths, and weaknesses, fostering a sense of identity and confidence. Self-
management encompasses strategies for regulating emotions, setting goals, and
persevering through challenges. Social awareness emphasizes empathy and
understanding of others' perspectives, promoting inclusivity and respect for diversity.
Relationship skills focus on effective communication, collaboration, conflict resolution,
nurturing healthy interpersonal connections. Responsible decision-making involves
considering ethical implications and consequences, making informed choices, and taking
responsibility for one's actions. By integrating SEL principles into educational settings
through explicit instruction, supportive environments, and meaningful opportunities
for practice, educators can empower students to develop essential life skills that
contribute to their overall well-being and success in school and beyond (Collaborative
for Academic, Social, and Emotional Learning, 2017).

      The process of restorative justice empowers students by involving them in the
problem resolution process. Students have a voice in shaping outcomes of an infraction
and are afforded the opportunity to take responsibility for their actions. This
empowerment fosters a sense of autonomy, as it is shown by Riestenberg and Phelps
(2019). This practice attempts to keep students in the classroom rather than writing
a discipline referral or removing students from a classroom. Stressing discourse as a
way of solving problems in the classroom leads to richer relationships between teachers
and their students. Restorative justice practices strengthen the bond between teachers
and students. By promoting open communication and understanding, teachers become
better equipped to address the underlying causes of disruptive behavior. This can lead
to improved teacher-student relationships, as discussed in a study by Thorsborne and
Blood (2013).

                   Barriers to Implementing Restorative Justice in Schools

While restorative justice has gained recognition as a positive alternative to traditional
punitive disciplinary measures, there are multiple barriers to the effective
implementation of restorative justice in schools nationwide. These barriers can hinder its
potential impact on creating a more inclusive and supportive learning environment in
the classroom. Considering the domestic policies that were enacted throughout the 20th
century, many schools use traditional measures because educators lack proper training in
and knowledge of restorative practices (Morrison,2016). Due to the lack of knowledge
about how restorative justice works, implementing it in schools is met with great
resistance. Because restorative practices are a departure from traditional discipline
measures, some administrators meet the implementation of restorative justice with great
trepidation (Gregory, Clawson, Davis & Gerewitz, 2016). Without buy-in from
administrators and faculty resources, implementing restorative practice may be limited.
Limited resources like funding and time to implement restorative practices make it
difficult for schools that service students from lower socioeconomic backgrounds.

                                RESTORATIVE JUSTICE PRACTICES FOR SCHOOLS

                                           When adopting restorative justice practices in schools, there are multiple strategies
                                           educators can employ to diffuse situations before they rise to the level of removing a
                                           student from the classroom through suspension or expulsion. All restorative practices in
                                           schools share a common framing of interactions used to address behaviors in schools;

                                            1. All involved parties discuss the incident in question.
                                            2. The victim and the accused both are given equal opportunity to speak.
                                            3. Teachers act as facilitators, where they ask open-ended questions to promote

                                                 reflection.
                                            4. Questions posed to students often include: What can you do to address this

                                                 situation? How would you feel if the same thing happened to you? How did your
                                                 behavior impact your fellow students?
                                            5. All involved parties decide on a course of action, and all parties work together to

                                                                                         Circles

                                           One of the most popular restorative justice strategies used in schools is the use of circles.
                                           Circles involve the whole class and are designed to help the classroom community set
                                           their own expectations and standards of behavior for the classroom. During the circle
                                           activity, all stakeholders in the classroom participate by sharing their perspectives and
                                           the potential causes for misbehavior. By employing the circles strategy, all stakeholders
                                           in the classroom are afforded the opportunity to assume a sense of ownership over the
                                           rules that shape classroom procedures and rules (University of San Diego Continuing
                                           and Professional Education, n.d.).

                                                 There are many benefits to using restorative circles in schools. Sherman and Strang
                                           (2007) suggested that research shows that schools that use restorative practices like
                                           circles experienced declines in disciplinary issues. Through the structured nature of
                                           restorative circles students hone their social skills and practice effective communication
                                           skills. Restorative circles also require active listening skills to be used by all stakeholders
                                           in the classroom. By actively listening to all stakeholders' perspectives, the class works
            FROM SLAVERY TO THE SCHOOL TO PRISON PIPELINE: A CALL FOR RESTOR ATIVE JUSTICE 157

towards finding the root causes of an infraction. Active listening often leads to increased
levels of empathy towards others and better communication skills (Hopkins, 2016).
Lastly, restorative circles have the potential to reduce bullying in the classroom. This
occurs because when students actively listen to their peers, they start to see the
perspectives of others and that might lead to heightened levels of empathy towards others
in the classroom community (Smith, 2016).

       Learning for Justice, a project of the Southern Poverty Law Center, created a toolkit
       to assist educators in developing restorative justice principles to address classroom
       infractions. According to the toolkit restorative justice practices are inquiry-led and
       either have the goal of social restoration or self-restoration. Whatever the desired
       outcome is, the process is driven by a series of questions to examine classroom
       problems from many perspectives. Open-ended questions such as the following are
       helpful when addressing problems for the purpose of social restoration:

        · Tell me what happened.
        · What was your part in what happened?
        · What were you thinking at the time?
        · How were you feeling at the time?
        · Who else was affected by this?
        · What have been your thoughts since?
        · What are they now?
        · How are you feeling now?
        · What do you need to do to make things right? Repair the harm that was done?

            Get past this and move on?
        · What can we do to support you?
        · What might you do differently when this happens again? (Learning for Justice,

            n.d.).

       Similar open-ended questions are asked when the goal of the restorative circle is self-
       restoration. Questions such as the following are helpful when conducting a
       restorative practice for self-restorative purposes:

        · Tell me what has been happening.
        · What do you think about this situation?
        · How are you feeling about this situation?
        · How is this getting in the way of your learning? Feeling okay about school?

            Being the person, you want to be at school?
        · What do you need to learn/to do to make things better? Make things right?

            Reset and get back on track?
        · What can we do to support you?
        · What might you do differently the next time you find yourself in this situation

                                DISCUSSION QUESTIONS

                                            1. How have historical policies and practices like redlining, segregation, and punitive
                                                 disciplinary measures contributed to the perpetuation of educational inequities
                                                 for marginalized communities? Provide specific examples from the chapter.

                                            2. Evaluate the role of critical race theory (CRT) and culturally responsive pedagogy
                                                 (CRP) in understanding and addressing systemic racism and inequities in the
                                                 education system. How can these frameworks inform approaches to creating more
                                                 equitable learning environments?

                                            3. Discuss the implications of the "school-to-prison pipeline" phenomenon. What
                                                 are the potential long-term consequences for individuals, communities, and
                                                 society as a whole? How can this cycle be effectively disrupted?

                                            4. Analyze the pros and cons of restorative justice practices in educational settings.
                                                 What are the potential benefits and challenges of implementing these approaches?
                                                 How can restorative justice be effectively integrated into schools?

                                            5. Reflect on the role of educators in promoting social justice and educational equity.
                                                 What specific strategies or actions can teachers and administrators take to create
                                                 more inclusive and supportive learning environments for all students, especially
                                                 those from marginalized backgrounds?

                                            6. Examine the intersectionality of race, socioeconomic status, and other factors in
                                                 shaping educational experiences and outcomes. How can an understanding of
                                                 intersectionality inform efforts to address disparities and promote equity in
                                                 education?

                                            7. Discuss the role of community engagement and collaboration in fostering positive
                                                 change in the education system. How can schools, families, and communities
                                                 work together to dismantle systemic barriers and create more equitable
                                                 educational opportunities?

            FROM SLAVERY TO THE SCHOOL TO PRISON PIPELINE: A CALL FOR RESTOR ATIVE JUSTICE 159

GLOSSARY

Achievement Gap: A term used to describe differences in educational outcomes
between students.

Adequate Yearly Progress (AYP): Outlined by state and federal law under No Child
Left Behind, schools that did not meet certain AYP standards would be labeled a school
in need of improvement.

Black Codes: Laws enacted after the Civil War to regulate and restrict the newly freed
Black population.

Culturally Responsive Pedagogy (CRP): An approach to teaching and learning that
acknowledges and embraces students' cultural backgrounds, identities, and experiences

Critical Race Theory (CRT): A framework that examines how race intersects with

Desegregation: The process of ending the segregation of races, especially the separation
of Black and white students in public schools as mandated by the Supreme Court's
Brown v. Board of Education ruling in 1954. The ruling declared segregated schools
unconstitutional and called for their desegregation.

Freedmen's Bureau: Established in 1865 to aid formerly enslaved African Americans
and impoverished whites in the South during the Reconstruction era, playing a crucial
role in providing education to freed slaves.

Great Migration: The movement of over 6 million African Americans from the rural
Southern United States to the urban Northeast, Midwest and West between 1910 and
1970, motivated by factors like escaping Jim Crow laws and seeking better economic
opportunities.

Jim Crow: State and local laws that enforced racial segregation, primarily in the
Southern United States, lasting from the post-Civil War era until around 1968.

Positive Behavioral Interventions and Supports (PBIS): An approach encouraged
by the Every Student Succeeds Act to improve student behavior and overall school
climate.

Redlining: A discriminatory practice where the Homeowners' Loan Corporation
assigned security ratings to neighborhoods, often denying services to areas with

Restorative Justice: An approach to school discipline that emphasizes repairing harm
through processes that include all stakeholders, aiming to build community and address
the root causes of misconduct.

School-to-Prison Pipeline: A phenomenon where school disciplinary actions, such
160 RESTORYING EDUCATION

                                           as suspensions and expulsions, contribute to funneling students, particularly from
                                           marginalized communities, into the criminal justice system.

                                           Segregation: The enforced separation of races, as practiced in the United States between
                                           the late 19th century into the 1960s. This included segregated facilities like schools,
                                           transportation, restrooms and more under policies like Jim Crow laws, requiring Black
                                           people and white people to be separated in most aspects of public life.

                                           Social and Emotional Learning (SEL): A framework that aims to foster the

                                           emotional, and academic success, according to the Collaborative for Academic, Social,
                                           and Emotional Learning (CASEL).

                                           Zero-Tolerance Policies: Harsh disciplinary policies in schools that lack administrative
                                           discretion and often result in automatic severe penalties, such as suspension or
                                           expulsion, for rule violations.

Making Good Trouble: Advocacy and
Activism

Kjersti VanSlyke-Briggs

       Before We Read
       Think about your own high school and local community, perhaps even expand that
       thinking to include your state. What challenges do you see that impact instruction
       from both within the school and from efforts outside the school? How did the
       students and educators respond to those challenges, if at all? Talk with a peer from
       class about the challenges and see if you experienced similar obstacles or controversy
       in your districts.
       Critical Question for Consideration
       As you read, consider this essential question: How can we create empowering
       school environments in the face of pressing national issues and trends such as
       censorship, limiting access to information, and the hardening of schools as a result
       of school violence?

Across the United States there is a push to restrict public schools. This restriction is
prevalent through the gatekeeping of knowledge and the limitations of information
access such as evidenced by efforts to challenge or ban books and by limiting what
teachers can speak about in the classroom or how they speak about specific topics. This
restriction is also a physical restriction as schools employ barriers literally limiting access
to the school as a response to external threats of school violence that occur across the
country such as school shootings.

                                   Jumping forward in time to 1960 is another notable moment regarding student
                             activism. Ruby Bridges was just a six-year-old child when she was thrust into the
                             spotlight of activism in response to Brown v. Board of Education and the Civil Rights
                             Movement. She was one of a small group of students to leave their segregated schools and
                             attend a previously all white school. Her enrollment at the school marked a significant
                             moment in the fight against racial segregation in schools. The now iconic image of her
                             walking the steps to the school escorted by U.S. Marshals represents a turning point in
                             the United States. While she did not set out to lead a movement, her participation fueled
                             further activism and progress. She faced enormous opposition from white supremacists
                             and segregationists in angry mobs protesting her attendance. Ruby displayed immense
                                                                            MAKING GOOD TROUBLE: ADVOCACY AND ACTIVISM 167

resilience and bravery by walking past the crowd and entering the school. Ruby Bridges
serves as a powerful reminder that student activism can be a catalyst for change. Despite
her young age, she showed the world that individuals, regardless of their size or age, can
have a significant impact on social and political issues.

      Another key moment in history for student activists that was also captured by
photo was the May 4th, 1970 Kent State protest that ended tragically in the shooting and
killing of four Kent State students and wounding of nine other students by members
of the Ohio National Guard. The Kent State students were protesting the Vietnam
war when the shooting occurred (although not all the students killed were active
participants). This event sparked student protests nationwide. Students walked out of
hundreds of colleges, universities, and even high schools in support of the Kent State
students in a massive strike across the country. While this protest was not about
educational policy, it did mark a significant event in student activism during this time
period. The Kent State massacre was a pivotal moment in American history, symbolizing
the severe consequences of political unrest and the clash between student activism and
authority. The event underscores the importance of peaceful protest, the protection of
civil liberties, and the need for effective dialogue between protestors and authorities to
prevent such tragedies from occurring again.

      Multiple student protests were documented at Columbia University in the 1960s,
but perhaps one of the most famous is the 1968 take over by students of the

                                           Defense initiatives to support the Vietnam War and student demands for educational
                                           justice. This outrage on campus was largely fueled by reactions to a controversial
                                           university policy. The protests began in April 1968 when a group called the Students for
                                           a Democratic Society (SDS) initiated a demonstration against the university's plans to
                                           construct a gymnasium in Morningside Park, which was seen as an act of gentrification
                                           (when a poor urban area is impacted by wealthier people that both improve the

                                           can no longer afford to live there) that would further marginalize the local community.

                                                 As the protests at Columbia intensified, students occupied several buildings on
                                           campus, including Hamilton Hall, which housed the administration offices. The event
                                           was documented in The Strawberry Statement, a nonfiction book by James Simon
                                           Kunen that documented firsthand his experience during this student takeover. The
                                           occupation lasted several days during which negotiations took place between the student
                                           activists and the administration. The legacy of the Columbia protests can be seen in
                                           the lasting impact they had on university governance, student activism, and the concept
                                           of educational justice. The events served as a catalyst for ongoing discussions about the
                                           role of universities in society, the relationship between academia and activism, and the
                                           importance of student voices in shaping educational institutions.

                                                 Around the same time in 1968, the East Los Angeles student walkouts occurred
                                           where thousands of Mexican American high school students walked out of school in
                                           L.A. to protest the inequity in the public schooling system. The East L.A. walkout,
                                           also known as "The Chicano Blowouts" were a series of protests organized by students
                                           to demand educational equality and an end to systemic discrimination in the public
                                           school system. At the time, the educational experiences of students in East L.A. were
                                           characterized by inequality, racial segregation, and cultural marginalization. Students
                                           faced overcrowded classrooms, outdated textbooks, low expectations by administration,
                                           and a lack of access to college preparatory courses. Additionally, the curriculum often
                                           ignored or misrepresented Mexican American history and culture. These protests were
                                           in part sparked by teacher Sal Castro, a Mexican American history teacher that invited
                                           students to have pride in their culture and question the quality of education they
                                           received. These students first approached administration and when shut down, the larger
                                           movement took off. The impact of the East L.A. walkouts extended beyond the local
                                           community. The protests inspired and influenced other student movements throughout
                                           the country, leading to similar demonstrations and demands for educational equity
                                           among marginalized communities.

                                         WHAT TERM SHOULD I USE?

                                                       The terms "Latinx," "Latine," "Hispanic," "Chicano," and "Chicana" all relate to
                                                       different aspects of ethnic and cultural identity within the context of the United

American origin or descent."Latine" is also a gender-neutral term used as an
alternative to the masculine "Latino" or feminine "Latina" when referring to people
of Latin American cultural or ethnic identity in the United States. The term aims to
be more inclusive and acknowledge the diverse gender identities and expressions
within Latin American communities. It moves away from the traditional gender
binary of the Spanish language's -o/-a endings."Hispanic" refers to people with a
connection to Spanish-speaking countries or cultures, emphasizing the Spanish
language as a common thread. "Chicano" specifically refers to individuals of
Mexican descent, particularly those born or raised in the U.S., and it emerged during
the Civil Rights Movement as a way to assert Mexican American cultural and
political identities. "Chicana" is the feminine counterpart to "Chicano," specifically
representing Mexican American women within the Chicano movement.

It's important to respect individual preferences for self-identification and to
recognize the evolving nature of language and cultural understanding. When in
doubt, it's always best to follow the lead of the individual or community in question
and use the terms they prefer for self-identification. Different individuals may have
different preferences based on their personal experiences, cultural background, and
generational differences.

If you're unsure, it's generally considered respectful to use broader, more inclusive
terms like "Latinx" or "Hispanic" when referring to individuals or communities of
Latin American origin or descent. These terms provide a more encompassing and
gender-neutral approach.

letters to our representatives, or wearing Red for Education on Fridays (a union-led
initiative). In more recent years, this activism often takes the form of rallies at state

publication of white papers (a researched based paper focused on a single issue or
problem), and with a contemporary shift even takes the form of a meme or social media-

backlash across the country. Prepackaged scripted curriculum does not take into
consideration the community of learners in a particular classroom in a particular
environmental context. It does not recognize the variety of learners and presents
materials in a rigid and formulaic approach designed to benefit the private company
profits rather than the creative minds of youth and teachers ready to respond in the
moment. It does not allow for the differentiation (instruction and assessment of students
based on their individual learning needs), that strong educators know they must bring
in order to meet the needs of particular students. When coupled with high stakes
standardized tests, it lends itself to a climate of fear and classrooms divorced from a
lived reality responsive to the immediate events lived by students. As noted by Giroux
and Schmidt (2004), "under such conditions, teachers are excluded from designing
their own lesson plans...worksheets become a substitute for critical teaching and rote
memorization takes the place of in depth thinking" (222). This limited intellectual risk
taking, led to declines in teacher education program enrollment, and shifted attitudes
of preservice teachers by limiting their agency and creativity (Bloom & VanSlyke-Briggs,

                                                       Borders: Pedagogy and the Politics of Cultural Studies. It is this text where they
                                                       assert that in order to be effective critical pedagogy must move beyond the
                                                       classroom.

                                                 As a result of the growing concern for high-stakes testing across the country,
                                           multiple grassroots actions began to emerge. Parents began to "opt out" and remove

                                           eight math and English standardized exams. Parent and educator partnership groups
                                           for activism formed across the country including New York State Allies for Public
                                           Education (NYSAPE) and smaller regional groups including examples such as Oneonta
                                           Area for Public Education (OAPE). More notably though was the development of the
                                           Badass Teachers Association (BATs), which quickly grew to over 52,000 members in
                                           2013.

                                                 BATs was (and still is, although they are less active today) committed to contesting
                                           negative reform initiatives and provided "a counter narrative, based on strong
                                           scholarship as well as experience that warned that reform policies are likely to widen

                                           and others like it, grew so quickly in large part due to the use of social media and
                                           calls to action that were straightforward and included short commitments. While critics
                                           such as Malcolm Gladwell point out that social media platforms are based on "weak
                                           ties," there can be strength in numbers in weak ties within social networks as pointed

                                           spread and the opportunity for someone who would not otherwise engage to now have
                                           an opportunity to connect (VanSlyke-Briggs, 2015). The smart mob, or the collection
                                           of individuals acting in concert for a common goal, develops into a "mobile tribe"
                                           (Rhinegold, 2003, p. 17). BATs created a hierarchy of leadership to manage calls to
                                           action and utilized social media to promote offline actions. They partnered with regional
                                           groups across the country and held letter writing campaigns, rallies, published media
                                           releases to gain even more national attention and capitalized on "the ethical spectacle"
                                           (Duncombe 2007) in which they used popular culture for the purposes of furthering an

                                           to make content shareable and clickable. These calls to action contained a sense of
                                           urgency, purpose, and personal benefit. They knew that they needed to move beyond

      As a result of this grassroots activism, BATs and other related organizations
brought attention to the damaging policies impacting public education. Across the
country, voices responded and change began to slowly develop. There was turn over in
educational leadership at both state and national levels, some states began to retreat from
use of the Common Core State Standards and states like New York rebranded them
and brought teachers in for conversations about changes. Other changes like restricting
the selling of student data to private organizations were curtailed (at least in New York
State) and teacher evaluation systems were reexamined. But as Mark Naison, one of
the founders of BATs states, the battle will never be over, "this will require constant
mobilization, creative organizing, and the multiplication of individual acts of courage
and resistance" (2014 p. 92).

especially literature representing diverse voices. In large part, this trend to restrict access
to literature has developed out of conservative agendas to limit literature in large bundles
as opposed to the typical one book, one school example of challenges that were
previously more common.

      The national trend of challenges or bans on literature in public schools is often
linked to the discussions surrounding Critical Race Theory (CRT). CRT is an
academic framework that examines how race and racism intersect with various social and
institutional structures, such as law, education, and politics. It is typically a concept
reserved for instruction in graduate school work such as in law schools. It seeks to analyze
how historical and systemic racism continues to impact individuals and communities
today. The opposition to CRT and the push to challenge or ban literature in schools are
often intertwined. Some individuals and groups, such as Florida based Moms for
Liberty, argue that CRT promotes divisive ideologies, fosters a negative view of America,
and perpetuates a victimhood narrative. They believe that the teaching of CRT in
schools leads to the demonization of certain racial or ethnic groups and undermines the
principles of equality and unity. Parent led groups like Moms for Liberty, pressure
districts to remove books often without ever even having read them. It is important to
note that CRT is rarely ever employed in a public school setting.

      Bans against literature in schools and libraries have increased nationally since 2021
(Mazzei, Harris, & Alter, 2023). States such as Florida have moved beyond conservative
parent groups to state legislation that limits what can appear in a classroom. Three new
state laws were passed in 2022 in Florida that restrict access to literature and violators can
be charged with a third-degree felony. These laws went into effect in January of 2022 and
caused educators across the state to pull books from shelves. Florida is second only to
Texas as the state with the highest number of banned or challenged books (Meehan and
Friedman, 2023) according to PEN America, an organization that advocates for freedom

                                                 One book banning that received national attention occurred in 2022 in Tennessee.

                                           memoir by Art Spiegelman about the Holocaust from the eighth-grade curriculum.
                                           Community residents and students protested the removal of the book and even called
                                           upon the author to speak to the defense of the text. In the minutes from the school board
                                           meeting, board members acknowledge that they had not even read the book. Ostensibly,
                                           the banning was due to a scene in which the mother commits suicide and language use
                                           such as in one instance where the word "bitch" is used. In response, books stores and
                                           individuals from around the country donated copies of the book to those who wanted
                                           them.

                                                 In an interesting reaction to nationwide bans, Illinois has become the first state
                                           anti-book banning legislation by tying library funding to access of materials. In June of
                                           2023, the governor of Illinois signed legislation that protects public schools and libraries.
                                           The law withholds library funding from institutions that do not adopt the American
                                           Library Association Bill of Rights or a similar self-designed policy that protects materials
                                           in the collection. It also seeks to protect institutions in their efforts to add additional
                                           materials to the collection by prohibiting external influences. This is an important step
                                           in attempting to protect public institutions from private manipulation. This is especially
                                           important given data presented by the American Library Association for 2022. In 2022,
                                           the ALA recorded the highest number of book bans since it began collecting annual data
                                           twenty years prior. The number of challenged and banned book titles was nearly double
                                           that of 2021 (American Library Association, 2022).

                                                 Students need access to diverse literature. They need to see themselves represented
                                           in text and they need to be exposed to complicated moments in history in order to learn
                                           how to better their future worlds. As Maxine Greene (1988) notes, students "need to
                                           be empowered to reflect on and talk about what happened in its varying connections
                                           with other events in the present as well as in the past. And they may be brought to find

rejects any negative views and sanitizes our history. It shuts down any contradictory
voices and by limiting the authors that students can interact with, this legislation denies
what Bakhtin (1981) calls "dialogism" or "heteroglossia" in which a literary text can be
seen as a space where multiple voices and perspectives can be heard and interact. Students
need to hear these multiple voices. As noted by Greene (1988), "when people cannot
name alternatives, imagine a better state of things, share with others a project of change,
they are likely to remain anchored or submerged, even as they proudly assert their
autonomy" ( p. 9). Students need to see our past for what it was in order to imagine
better futures. We need to refrain from silencing those voices that speak to the realities of
our past; because by continuing to do so, we only continue to marginalize and oppress.
Educators must advocate for an education that encourages students to think critically,
reflect on their experiences, and develop a sense of agency to challenge social inequalities.
176 RESTORYING EDUCATION

                                         MEET THE THEORIST

                                                       Mikhail Bakhtin (1895-1975) was a Russian scholar and literary critic. His work
                                                       informed much of the later work of theorists across many fields including education.
                                                       He is best known for his work The Dialogic Imagination which was comprised of
                                                       four essays. It is in this seminal text where he introduced the term heteroglossia.

                                                 In response to Florida's wave of oppressive legislation, teen activists organized.
                                           Walkout 2 Learn (https://www.walkout2learn.org/ ) developed a day of action utilizing
                                           several key lessons learned from previous activist movements. They kept the agenda
                                           simple and direct, but also layered. It asked students to walk out at a specific time on a
                                           specific day, it asked them to pledge to vote to defend student rights, and listen to a short
                                           banned history lesson from a peer. In order to prepare for the day, the organization asked
                                           for student leaders to volunteer to be trained and deliver the short lectures. As a follow
                                           up, students were also invited to enroll in a virtual college level African American history
                                           course that would award them a certificate at completion. Students across the state of
                                           Florida (from more than 300 schools) signed up to participate in the action.

                                                 Another example that has gained traction across several states in the nation is efforts
                                           to deny students from learning any information regarding LGBTQ peoples. Once again,
                                           Florida emerged as a frontrunner in this effort to censor discussion on gender and
                                           sexuality. In 2022, Florida passed the controversial "Parental Rights in Education" bill
                                           known popularly as the "Don't Say Gay" bill. This law limited the ability for school
                                                                            MAKING GOOD TROUBLE: ADVOCACY AND ACTIVISM 177

educators to discuss sexual orientation and gender identity. Prior to grade three it is
completely prohibited and post grade three discussion must be "age-appropriate or
developmentally appropriate for students in accordance with state standards." The
vague language utilized here crafts situations in which educators can be challenged at
any point due to concerns about who determines what is "age appropriate." Violations
could mean suspensions for teachers or even a revoked teaching license. In efforts to
inform teachers of their right and the risks aligned with this law, the National Education
Association (NEA), which is a teacher labor union, released the "Know Your Rights: A
Back to School Guide" guide for teacher members https://www.nea.org/nea-today/all-
news-articles/know-your-rights-back-school-guide.

      Following on the heels of Florida's example, by April of 2022 more than a dozen
additional states proposed "Don't Say Gay" legislation including Alabama, Ohio,
Louisiana and Texas. While there is a variety to the approaches by each state, the basic
premise is the limitation or prohibition of schools from teaching or discussing topics
of gender identity or sexual orientation. This goes beyond direct classroom instruction
and could even include for instance a banning of GSA (Gay Straight Alliance) clubs
or other student clubs that are purposely designed to be inclusive for LBTQ students.
These efforts to curtail conversation are rooted in exclusionary ideologies and it silences
students. As Girox (1992) notes, "equally important is the need to provide safe spaces for
students to critically engage teachers, other students, as well as the limits of their own
positions as border-crossers who do not have to put their identity on trial each time they
address social and political issues" (p. 33). Legislation such as "Don't Say Gay" do the
exact opposite of what Giroux suggests. It fosters a hostile environment where students
do not feel safe or comfortable sharing details about themselves or their families. It will
foster an environment that will breed hate and intolerance.

      Perhaps the youngest example of student activism occurred as a response to this
national trend to silence discussion of gender identity and sexuality in schools.
Generation Alpha students, students born after 2010, responded in an action known as
the IPS walkout. These young 4th and 5th grade students walked out of school in protest
in March of 2023 to bring attention to Indiana's version of this bill and was organized by
three 5th grade students. While only 100 young students joined this particular walkout,
it did gain national attention and paralleled other school walkouts across the country
(including Florida) where thousands of students walked out to bring attention to the
issue.

HARDENING OUR SCHOOLS AND OUR CHILDREN
RESPONDING TO GUN VIOLENCE

Gun violence in schools in the United States has become such a common occurrence
that a shooting no longer holds the same shock value when reported by the media. While
previous shootings had occurred in schools, perhaps the one which people most think of
when reflecting back to one of the first is the Columbine shooting in 1999. And while
gun violence as a mass shooting event in schools only accounts for a small portion of
178 RESTORYING EDUCATION

                                           overall firearm deaths that occur a year, it is one of the most senseless and tragic. In the
                                           years since Columbine, the rate of these incidences has increased dramatically.

                                                 School shootings are what author Keel (2021) identifies as a "wicked problem" and
                                           one that is multidimensional and complex. "Wicked problem" is a concept coined by
                                           planning theorists Horst Rittel and Melvin Webber in the 1970s. This concept refers
                                           to complex social or policy issues that are difficult to define, have multiple interrelated
                                           causes and consequences, involve numerous stakeholders with diverse perspectives, and
                                           lack clear solutions. In order to attempt solving one aspect of the problem, one must
                                           consider other interrelated aspects that cannot be separated from the issue. With school
                                           shootings, one cannot just examine the incident and the particular shooter, but must
                                           consider other aspects such as mental health services, access to firearms, a culture that
                                           celebrates violence, and other social impacts. There is no straightforward solution to
                                           the issue. The causes and motivations behind such acts vary, making it challenging
                                           to predict and prevent them with absolute certainty. Furthermore, the effectiveness of
                                           different interventions and policies is often debatable, contributing to the uncertainty
                                           surrounding this issue.

                                                 Americans are all too familiar with these names: Sandy Hook, Parkland, Uvalde,
                                           Oxford. It is difficult to even add current statistics as the number grows outdated so
                                           quickly. For an updated total on this unique American epidemic, refer to a database
                                           that is consistently updated such as the K-12 School Shooting Database
                                           (https://k12ssdb.org/) maintained by The Violence Project, a nonprofit and
                                           nonpartisan research center, or consider the Center for Homeland Defense and Security
                                           (CHDS) School Shooting Safety Compendium (https://www.chds.us/sssc/) which
                                           tracks multiple sources including not just statistics, but also recent publications for the
                                           purposes of assisting officials and researchers. According to the Education Week School
                                           Shooting Tracker (https://www.edweek.org/leadership/school-shootings-this-year-
                                           how-many-and-where/2023/01) as of June 15th, 2023 there have been 23 school
                                           shootings with injuries and/or death. The Violence Project, which has a wider
                                           description of what counts as a school shooting incident, cites 184 incidents in 2023
                                           (and this is only from January to June, so the second half of the school year). The k-12
                                           School Shooting database indicates that as of May 2024 there were 344 shootings so far
                                           in the year. This database "documents when a gun is fired, brandished, or bullet hits
                                           school property" (p. 1).

                                                 The issue of school violence is wrapped up alongside cultural challenges such as
                                           attitudes about guns, toxic masculinity, ostracism, and mental health. These interwoven
                                           aspects also connect to other linked concerns such as online intimidation and social
                                           antagonism (e.g. cyberbullying). As a result of this violence nationwide, schools and
                                           policy makers responded by "hardening" our schools. This hardening refers to changes
                                           such as limiting access to the school, gates, closed foyers with double lock doors, buzzing
                                           in systems, metal detectors, shatterproof glass windows and doors or "bulletproof" glass,
                                           and other physical barriers to limit the ability to enter a school. It may also include
                                           procedures such as requiring visitors to sign in or show an identification such as scanning
                                           a state issued license to enter or requiring that visitors be walked to the destination
                                           location. In many cases it has led to the addition of security cameras and the presence
                                                                            MAKING GOOD TROUBLE: ADVOCACY AND ACTIVISM 179

of additional school resources officers during the school day. This hardening has led to a
capitalization of school violence and a multi-billion dollar industry aimed at protecting
schools and making money from tragedy, what author Matthews (2019) calls macabre
money (p. 89). This includes everything from bullet resistant partitions for classrooms,
to prevention training experts hired to set up school response drills for lockdown and
active shooter drills.

      Other program responses include less costly or even free resources such as those
provided by Sandy Hook Promise, a national nonprofit organization that emerged as
a response after the 2012 Newtown, Connecticut shooting in an elementary school.
Sandy Hook Promise has multiple programs including their Start with Hello program
to minimize social isolation, cultivate empathy in schools, and create a more inclusive
culture. They also have the Say Something anonymous reporting system, and a Know
the Signs prevention program to educate students and adults. These programs aim to be
proactive rather than reactive and all begin with students as empowered.

                                           Psychologists (NASP) and the National Education Association (NEA) have released
                                           statements about the personal trauma for students experiencing drills and have released
                                           guidance in a joint white paper on how to minimize any potential emotional or mental
                                           impact. This guidance includes always announcing a drill both to students and notifying
                                           families, having faculty and staff on alert to recognize traumatic stress reactions, and
                                           allowing students to opt out.

                                                 There is a familiar cadence to school shootings. After a shooting, the media cycle
                                           begins. News coverage is dedicated to the incident, public interest grows, perhaps some
                                           activism is sparked, the media attention wanes and with it, the momentum to enact
                                           change. Occasionally, there is a wave of additional violence that feeds from the initial
                                           occurrence that will lengthen the cycle but eventually national attention fades. With

                                                 After the 2018 Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School shooting in Parkland,
                                           Florida, students responded almost immediately by organizing. This group of dedicated
                                           students organized the March for our Lives (https://marchforourlives.com/) protest
                                           that has since grown into a movement. Teaming up with Everytown for Gun Safety
                                           this student-led group marched on Washington, D.C. in 2018 calling for gun control
                                           legislation. This group was joined by other more local gatherings across the United
                                           States in support (estimates around 800). The long-lasting organization that emerged
                                           after this initial wave of action is still active today as a student-led political action group
                                           that advocates for gun legislation. They held a second march in Washington, D.C. in
                                           2022, have held countless meetings with legislators, and have crafted some creative visual
                                           responses in protest such as installing 150+ body bags on the National Mall reading out
                                           the now familiar slogan, "thoughts and prayers," a common platitude said by many post
                                           mass shooting. In addition to direct protest and political action such as meetings with
                                           legislators, this group has crafted a policy agenda to shape action.

                                                 After the 2023 Covenant Elementary School shooting in Tennessee, thousands
                                           of students took to action across the state. While some of the students walked out of
                                           classes in smaller local protests, Everytown for Gun Safety also helped coordinate action
                                           through Students Demand Action (https://studentsdemandaction.org/). In addition
                                           to the protest at the Tennessee State Capital, there were "sibling" protests at locations
                                           across the United States which prompted some legislators to get involved and speak out
                                           (which resulted in a vote for expulsion that was later overturned with a reinstatement).

                                                 Despite vocal calls for action, the United States has made little ground nationally
                                           to curtail gun violence in schools. This is a uniquely American problem. In contrast, in
                                           the UK for instance, there has only ever been one mass school shooting. Thisoccurred in
                                           1996 in Dunblane, Scotland where an adult shooter killed 16 children and one teacher
                                           before killing himself. The government took immediate action as a result of this rampage
                                           shooting through a series of two firearms acts.

                                                 In addition to calls for action regarding gun restrictions, others have called for
                                           a return to a community school approach in which schools are responsive to local
                                           neighborhood needs rather than restrict access to school via a hardening. This way,

schools work together with the community stakeholders establishing additional
resources such as feeding programs, health services, mental health services, literacy
programs for adults and other response based programming. This can include early
intervention, restorative justice efforts, building empathy, and even outreach services.

                                      Having Difficult Conversations

       You may find yourself in a position where you need to have a difficult conversation
       with students in your classroom. Perhaps an incident of violence has occurred in
       your community or students are responding to larger national political issues, no
       matter the case, students often seek safe spaces to have conversations with trusted
       adults. Some tips to consider include: setting a respectful tone in the classroom
       daily to facilitate the opening for these conversations, listening with compassion to
       our students and allowing time for them to express themselves, acknowledge the
       stress, or concern that students display and do not be dismissive of their emotions,
       counter possible feelings of isolation by helping them see how they are situated in a
       community that is supportive (sometimes this means helping them redefine what we
       mean by community), validate useful contributions to the conversation,
       acknowledge a range of perspectives but keep emphasis on facts, and most
       important, create path forward with students. Not all students will react to
       situations the same and we need to note that there is not always one course of
       action.

       Cornell University titled, "Guidelines for Acknowledging and/or Discussing
       Incidents of Public Violence, Racial Tension, and Extreme Expression" at

TEACHER UNIONS: A LONG HISTORY OF
ADVOCACY AND ACTIVISM

Teacher unions have played a significant role in shaping education policies and
protecting teachers in the United States. The two major teacher unions in the country
are the National Education Association (NEA) and the American Federation of
Teachers (AFT). In addition to these larger umbrella organizations, each school district
that participates with a union will have a local union chapter.

      The NEA originally began in 1857 as the National Teachers Association (NTA),
but in 1870 it merged with the National Association of School Superintendents and
the American Normal School Association to form the National Education Association.
Initially, the NTA focused on professional development, curriculum standardization,
and teacher training. It also advocated for public education and the establishment of

by unions.
                               The AFT was founded in Chicago with just eight members in 1916. One of the
                         AFT's early successes was its involvement in the Chicago Teachers' Federation strike in
                         1919, which led to improved salaries and working conditions for teachers. In the 1960s
                         and 1970s, the AFT gained prominence under the leadership of Albert Shanker. Shanker
                         advocated for teacher rights, collective bargaining, and increased teacher involvement
                         in decision-making processes. Even today, the name Shanker is recognized as a force in
                         education. Through the Albert Shanker grant program, New York State teachers may
                         get assistance in paying for National Board for Professional Teaching Standards
                         (NBPTS) certification - an excellent way for teachers to be recognized for excellence in
                         the field and, for many, a way to increase their salary (to learn more about this program
                         visit https://www.nysed.gov/postsecondary-services/albert-shanker-grant-program).
                         The AFT has been actively involved in political advocacy, endorsing political candidates
                         and promoting education policies that align with its members' interests. The AFT also
                         commits itself as a champion of educational equity by fighting for increased funding for
                         disadvantaged schools and advocating for the rights of special education students.
                         Currently, membership as reported by the AFT is around 1.7 million members.

                               While the NEA and AFT have different historical origins and organizational
                         structures, both unions have worked towards similar goals, such as improving teacher
                         working conditions, advocating for educational reforms, and ensuring quality education
                         for all students. They have had a significant influence on education policies at the
                         national, state, and local levels, and continue to be influential voices in education debates
                         and discussions.

                               In 2018, unions faced a Supreme Court decision that changed interactions between
                         employees and the unions making membership optional. The Janus v. AFSCME
                         (American Federation of State, County, and Municipal Employees) ruling determined
                         that union dues must now be optional. Previously, union membership dues were
                         collected of all employees in union schools as a way to fund collective bargaining
                         activities given the understanding that all employees would benefit from the success of
                         collective bargaining and stronger contracts.

                               Teaching unions fight for much more than just fair contracts and good working
                         conditions. They also take on advocacy roles on issues that impact the life of educators.
                         Recent advocacy efforts include protecting the rights for intellectual freedom in the
                         classroom and protecting teachers in the face of censorship and literature bans. The AFT
                         and the NEA have been vocal in opposing anti-diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI)
                         bills, which seek to restrict or prohibit teaching. In addition to releasing statements
                         about the need to protect teachers and quality education for all, the organizations have
                         also mobilized members to seek change. One tool for doing this is through simple uses

states (Florida, Kansas, North Carolina, and Wisconsin) have essentially eliminated

learn more about what states have tenure policies and the length of time before granting
tenure visit https://teachertenure.procon.org/length-of-time-before-tenure-kicks-in-
state-by-state/).

      When new teachers are hired in a district they should consider the benefits of
joining the union as well as how they can get involved. The first step is to become a
member of the union. Teachers can sign up for membership by contacting the local or
state chapter of the AFT or NEA. Membership typically involves paying dues, which
contribute to the union's activities and support services for teachers. This will usually
be an option during the hiring process, but it should be noted that teachers can join
at any time. Once a member, teachers can regularly attend union meetings as a great
way to stay informed about union activities, discussions, and decisions. It also provides
an opportunity to network with fellow educators and contribute to the union's work.
Many unions have building representatives who act as liaisons between the union and
teachers in individual schools or districts. Teachers can volunteer to become building
representatives and help to communicate union information, collect feedback from
colleagues, and address concerns within their school community. Unions also often have
committees and workgroups focused on specific issues, such as curriculum development,
negotiations, professional development, or diversity committees. Teachers can volunteer
to join these committees and contribute their expertise and perspectives to the union's
initiatives.

      Unions engage in political advocacy to influence education policies and support
legislation that aligns with their goals. Teachers can participate in lobbying efforts,
campaigns, or voter registration drives organized by the union to make their voices heard
on critical issues affecting education. After participating as a member, teachers may
also consider contributing to the union by serving in a leadership position. Running

                             DISCUSSION QUESTIONS

                              1. How have restrictions on public schools, both physically and intellectually,
                                   impacted the educational environment in the United States?

                              2. How does activism serve as a response to injustices, restrictions, and problematic
                                   educational policies in schools? In what ways can activism bring about change?

                              3. What role can educators play in creating empowering school environments amidst
                                   national issues and trends such as censorship, limited information access, and the
                                   hardening of schools? How can teachers support students in becoming engaged
                                   and invested in their educational experiences?

                              4. How does the idea of "hardening" schools as a response to school violence
                                   intersect with broader social issues such as systemic inequalities, power dynamics,
                                   and marginalization? What potential implications and unintended consequences
                                   might arise from this approach?

                              5. Imagine yourself as an educator faced with challenges related to censorship,
                                   restricted access to information, or standardized curriculum. What actions would

       Your Task: After reading about teacher and student activism as a response to
       educational policies and trends, explore what current issues have an impact on the
       classroom (either nationally or in your state). As you explore issues consider the
       following:

            was feeling ill the day of the exam. The teacher added enough points to pass the
            student on the test.
        · A teacher has their own daughter in her class. Another faculty has identified this
            as a conflict of interest.
        · A student has told the teacher that they don't have a ride home and it is raining.
            The teacher sees the student walking and stops to pick them up and give them a
            ride home.
        · During a recent snow day, the school administration decided that teachers
            should instruct digitally using their Google Classroom rather than having just a
            day off. The science teacher decided that this would be too difficult for his
            students so he just posted an announcement that they should enjoy the day and
            they would catch up when they were back in class.

                              When discussing codes of conduct and values for a profession like teaching, the
                              terms "ethics" and "morals" sometimes get used interchangeably. However, there are
                              subtle differences. Morals typically refer to personal beliefs, teachings, or opinions
                              on what is right and wrong behavior for an individual. They can be informed by
                              upbringing, society, religion, or even culture. Ethics also deal with principles for
                              proper conduct, but focus more narrowly on expectations for a collective

THE EMERGENCE OF CODES OF ETHICS FOR
EDUCATORS

Elements of ethics codes for teachers have existed in some form for over a hundred

years although they did not always align with today's values around equal treatment.

In the 1800s through early 1900s, there were extensive restrictions targeting female

teachers for anything perceived as less-than-virtuous private behavior. Women often

had to agree to not participate in drinking, smoking, gambling or dancing. Even more

egregious social policing were bans and punishments for female teachers who chose to

marry or get pregnant. In some cases, these rules even extended to extremely specifics

rules on behavior. One example from 1872 noted that teachers in an Illinois one-room

schoolhouse in Knox County should "spend the remaining time reading the Bible or

other good book" after spending ten hours in school; additionally, the teacher coded

strictly enforced a policy where "women teachers who marry or engage in unseemly

conduct will be dismissed" (Marquardt Blystone, 2014). These rules were expanded and

updated in 1915 and reflected no progress in understanding educators as competent

adults with full lives outside the classroom. In fact, the updated rules were even more

restrictive, noting teachers needed to be "home between the hours of 8 pm and 6 am

unless attending a school function."

The origins of such prohibitions were in upholding what was seen at the time as

necessary moral authority to instruct students; however, there is a deep double standard

embedded in these rules for women. It essentially crafted, "a two-tiered system of

employment in education, one in which women did the bulk of the teaching under the

supervision of an increasingly authoritative cadre of male administrators" (Smith, 2022).

This is what Tyack referred to as the "pedagogical harem" (1974). The rules were less

about setting a standard for ethical behavior as they were about controlling women's

bodies and dictating what was perceived as "moral" in that community. This language

itself subtly advances latent judgments on women's morality rooted in patriarchal,

repressed views of female sexuality or duties.

Over time, the teacher ethics landscape has continued to develop and shifted focus

away from enforcing traditional morals and disproportionately impacting women,

towards upholding the dignity of all persons. This complex history illuminates both

how far equitable treatment of teachers as professionals has developed, as well as how

recently ethical codes emerged in educational expectations that have aligned with more

contemporary ideals. States must continually question normative assumptions and the

ever-changing landscape of education as they determine codes of ethics and implement

those codes. For instance, with the advent of artificial intelligence tools should the

implementation of these codes be considered as teachers utilize those tools to enhance or

expedite their own work?

Understanding the development of codes of ethics between the late 1800s and

today will assist future educators as they develop their own teaching selves and integrate

a strong commitment to ethical practices in their career. While earlier iterations of these  NEA

codes amounted to little more than a set of rules to abide by, they eventually fell out

of fashion as educational landscapes moved beyond one-room schoolhouses and small

                           this time. In 1899, the NEA adopted its first Code of Ethics, outlining principles and
                           standards for teachers' professional behavior. Since that time, the NEA code has evolved,
                           and the current code was adopted in 1975 by the NEA Representative Assembly.

                                              These codes are built around two principles: Commitment to the Student

                                                              and Commitment to the Profession

                           It is important to examine ethical codes of behavior as separate from one's values or
                           personal judgments (Strike & Soltis, 2009). While moral judgements or values may
                           inform our day to day interactions, the ethical codes set by the NEA and the individual
                           states are about legal practices and set a standard for educators to follow in their
                           interactions professionally.

                                 Current ethical codes reflect a shift in how the role of a teacher is constructed in
                           society. During the 1960s and the 1970s teachers were viewed as a "neutral chairman"
                           and then this shifted in the 1980s where the educator's values were viewed as a figure
                           to align with for students (Bergem, 1990, p. 1). This view of educators' roles has shifted
                           once again in the 2000s and most recently to emphasize each parent's value system as
                           most important and the teacher as subordinate.

                           GENDERED EXPECTATIONS AND AN ETHIC OF
                           CARE

                           While some ethical behaviors in the classroom are easy to identify (teachers should not
                           strike their students) others are what Krishnamoorthy and Tolbert describe as "mucky"
                           (2022) and less clearly defined. At times, for instance an educator's ethical commitment
                           to intellectual investigation may introduce texts that are not embraced by close-minded
                           parents. Is this an ethical violation due to the mismatch between familial norms and the
                           diversity, equity and inclusion work educators know is important? To complicate this
                           more, another societal expectation is for teachers to be role models for students. Does
                           this mean to extend to all parts of the educator's life. For example, should teachers not be
                           seen in establishments that sell alcohol after school while on their own time?

      There are not always clear choices to be made and as Krishnamoorthy and Tolbert         Praxis
point out, educator expectations need to "shift away from colonial and masculinist            The process of applying

explore their role in shaping student discourse and introduce novel ideas that they may
not have previously explored.

      Another ethical practice in schools to consider is the "ethic of care." As suggested
by Colnerud (2006), one discussion emerging during these shifts from early rules setting
as ethics and later guiding principles is the "relationship between an ethic of care and
ethics based on principles of justice" and the ways "in which benefits and burdens are
distributed" (p. 368). Schools are often considered the location where students grow into
caring adults and learn not just the content concepts introduced to them, but also ways
of being in the world and how to interact with each other. Teachers find that they must,
"balance justice and care in their ethical choices and one could say that they are forced to
organise care and distribute it justly. Conversely, they must ensure that justice is meted
out caringly" (Colnerud, 2006, p. 369).

                                         MEET THE THEORIST

                                                       Nel Nodding (1929-2022) was an American educator, scholar, and feminist
                                                       theorist. She is best known for her work on the ethic of care. She continued to refine
                                                       her theories late in life and was reflective of her practice. Her text Caring: A
                                                       Relational Approach to Ethics and Moral Education was originally published in 1984
                                                       but was reprinted with updates in 2013.

                                           Researcher, Nel Noddings instructs her readers that this ethic of caring is presented
                                           through a relational ethic in that it is "tightly tied to experience because all its
                                           deliberations focus on the human beings involved in the situation under consideration
                                           and their relations to each other" (1994, p. 173). Noddings also notes that this caring
                                           and emotional labor is often characterized as feminine labor. This framework for
                                           understanding the role of an educator reinforces long held beliefs that schools should
                                           be responsible for the growth of students into contributing and thoughtful members of
                                           the citizenry. As Noddings indicates, this work if truly embraced changes how schools
                                           function and emphasizes dialog and changes, "almost every aspect of schooling: the
                                           current hierarchical structure of management, the rigid mode of allocating time, the
                                           kinds of relationships encouraged, the size of schools and classes, the goals of instruction,
                                           modes of evaluation, patterns of interaction, selection of content" (1994, p. 175).
                                           Noddings concludes her key paper on this topic by noting that society does not really
                                           want to solve this problem, "as there is too much at stake, too much to be lost by those
                                                                                      A GUIDING COMPASS: ETHICS FOR EDUCATORS 195

already in positions of power" (1994, p.179). The "caring teacher" approach embraced
by Noddings (1984), Gilligan (1982), Greene (1995), and Belenky, Clinchy, Goldberger,
and Tarule (1986) all support a positionality in which the teacher enacts change through
a supportive and nurturing classroom.

     MEET THE THEORIST - MAXINE GREENE

       Maxine Greene (1917-2014) was an American teacher and theorist. She centered
       much of her work on the gendered work of teaching and the role of women in the
       field. She also was an advocate and spoke often on the work of the "social
       imagination" allowing one to imagine a different future to work toward for social
       justice. She is best known for her work The Dialectic of Freedom (1988).

This early work by theorists to encourage a well-intentioned "ethic of care" and the
societal expectation for education to solve all social ills has crafted an untenable situation
for educators and in particular one for those educators that embrace a nurturing
classroom identity. This is not to say that this should not be a goal of educators, but
in recent years educators have been demonized, de-professionalized, and dismissed while
also having increased expectations laid at their feet. This is not a new problem. The
risk of burnout and personal stress as a result of increased emotional labor by educators
that support an ethic of care in their classrooms is high (VanSlyke-Briggs, 2010). In a
National Education Association survey conducted in 2022, it found that, "90 percent
of members say feeling burned out is a serious problem, with 67 percent saying it's
very serious" (Walker, 2022). Educators must consider mechanisms to prevent their own
burnout while also attending to the needs of students and working to establish an ethic
of care in their classrooms.

ONE STATE'S APPROACH

In New York State a Code of Ethics for educators was established by the State Standards
and Practices Board in June of 2002 and voted into effect by the Board of Regents in July
of the same year. This came after a call for an ethics code development in 1998 as part of
a teaching reform initiative outlined by The State Board of Regents. The current code
was developed in partnership and collaboration with teachers, school administrators,
higher education representatives, public members and even a teacher education student
as members of a 28 person Standards Board. After a draft of the code was completed,
it was reviewed by the Board of Regents and sent out for public comment. The Code
of Ethics is comprised of 6 Principles which are designed to include new developments
and scenarios in education. This code cannot be used as a basis for discipline by an
employer. Instead, there is a different mechanism for that process. This is simply a
guidance document to assist teachers in understanding best practices in relation to
ethical practices in the classroom.

                              The following six principles can be found at the New York State Education Department
                                  website at https://www.highered.nysed.gov/tcert/resteachers/codeofethics.html
                                                   Discuss each principle and how it may impact practice.

                              Principle 1: Educators nurture the intellectual, physical, emotional, social, and
                                                            civic potential of each student.

                              Educators promote growth in all students through the integration of intellectual,
                              physical, emotional, social and civic learning. They respect the inherent dignity and
                              worth of each individual. Educators help students to value their own identity, learn
                              more about their cultural heritage, and practice social and civic responsibilities. They
                              help students to reflect on their own learning and connect it to their life experience.
                              They engage students in activities that encourage diverse approaches and solutions to
                              issues, while providing a range of ways for students to demonstrate their abilities and
                              learning. They foster the development of students who can analyze, synthesize, evaluate
                              and communicate information effectively.

                                Principle 2: Educators create, support, and maintain challenging learning
                                                                  environments for all.

                              Educators apply their professional knowledge to promote student learning. They know
                              the curriculum and utilize a range of strategies and assessments to address differences.
                              Educators develop and implement programs based upon a strong understanding of
                              human development and learning theory. They support a challenging learning
                              environment. They advocate for necessary resources to teach to higher levels of learning.
                              They establish and maintain clear standards of behavior and civility. Educators are role
                              models, displaying the habits of mind and work necessary to develop and apply
                              knowledge while simultaneously displaying a curiosity and enthusiasm for learning.
                              They invite students to become active, inquisitive, and discerning individuals who reflect
                              upon and monitor their own learning.

 Principle 3: Educators commit to their own learning in order to develop their
                                            practice.

Educators recognize that professional knowledge and development are the foundations
of their practice. They know their subject matter, and they understand how students
learn. Educators respect the reciprocal nature of learning between educators and
students. They engage in a variety of individual and collaborative learning experiences
essential to develop professionally and to promote student learning. They draw on and
contribute to various forms of educational research to improve their own practice.

  Principle 4: Educators collaborate with colleagues and other professionals in
                              the interest of student learning.

Educators encourage and support their colleagues to build and maintain high standards.
They participate in decisions regarding curriculum, instruction and assessment designs,
and they share responsibility for the governance of schools. They cooperate with
community agencies in using resources and building comprehensive services in support
of students. Educators respect fellow professionals and believe that all have the right to
teach and learn in a professional and supportive environment. They participate in the
preparation and induction of new educators and in professional development for all
staff.

   Principle 5: Educators collaborate with parents and community, building
                           trust and respecting confidentiality.

Educators partner with parents and other members of the community to enhance school
programs and to promote student learning. They also recognize how cultural and
linguistic heritage, gender, family and community shape experience and learning.
Educators respect the private nature of the special knowledge they have about students
and their families and use that knowledge only in the students' best interests. They
advocate for fair opportunity for all children.

 Principle 6: Educators advance the intellectual and ethical foundation of the
                                    learning community.

Educators recognize the obligations of the trust placed in them. They share the
responsibility for understanding what is known, pursuing further knowledge,
contributing to the generation of knowledge, and translating knowledge into
comprehensible forms. They help students understand that knowledge is often complex
and sometimes paradoxical. Educators are confidantes, mentors and advocates for their
students' growth and development. As models for youth and the public, they embody
intellectual honesty, diplomacy, tact and fairness.

                                DISCUSSION QUESTIONS

                                            1. Why is it important to have ethical standards and guidelines in place for the
                                                 teaching profession? What purposes do they serve?

                                            2. How do ethics differ from morals? Why is this distinction relevant when
                                                 examining professional ethics and guidelines?

                                            3. Past ethics codes sometimes reflected problematic assumptions or
                                                 disproportionately impacted certain groups. How can we ensure contemporary
                                                 ethics standards align with ideals of equity and fair treatment? What processes
                                                 help shape this?

                                            4. How might teacher ethics codes need to evolve moving forward to address new
                                                 issues arising, like the use of artificial intelligence in classrooms? What new
                                                 considerations might this require?

                                            5. How can educators integrate an "ethic of care" within a critical pedagogy

                                                 Before beginning this activity, review the New York State Code of Ethics for
                                           Educators. Below are three scenarios that examine potential ethical violations by
                                           educators. After reading each scenario, examine it for potential violations of ethics and
                                           consider the guiding question posted after each scenario.

                                                                                       Scenario 1

                                           Emily is a 22-year-old student teacher completing her final field experience at Roosevelt
                                           Middle School prior to certification. One day, Emily decides to sneak off to the deserted
                                           student bathroom during her prep period to take a few puffs from her e-cigarette/
                                           vape pen in order to relax. Unbeknownst to her, a recently installed security camera
                                           outside the bathroom catches footage of Emily exiting the bathroom. Later that week,
                                           the school's IT administrator detects abnormal levels of vaping residues in tests of the
                                           bathroom's air quality sensors during Emily's timeframe.

                                                 When the principal calls Emily into his office about these issues, she vehemently
                                           denies vaping or even owning an e-cigarette. Once presented with both the sensor data
                                           and camera footage evidencing otherwise, Emily changes her defense by arguing that "at
                                           least she did it secretly where no students could see, so it shouldn't matter." Was Emily
                                           in violation of any components of the professional code of ethics or laws? Why or why
                                           not?

                                                 Did Emily violate any aspects of ethical or legal standards for teachers based on

this scenario. Make sure to cite specific sections and language from the ethics codes in
justifying your arguments. Your response should demonstrate a thoughtful application
of the standards to Emily's concerning behaviors and statements.

                                            Scenario 2

Mark is an 8th grade math teacher who through social media befriends Luis, a quiet
student new to his school this year. Luis has few friends and seems to struggle with
anxiety in Mark's class. Wanting to support him, Mark messages Luis on weekends to
see how he's coping, reminds him of class material, and encourages him to join a school
dance. While Mark aims to mentor Luis for his benefit, the frequency and familiar tone
of the off-hours communications increasingly makes Luis uncomfortable. However,
Luis is hesitant to report their interactions or confront a teacher.

      One day, a counselor notices Luis' change in behavior and reaches out to see if
anything is wrong. Reluctantly, Luis shows her some messages where Mark appears
overly invested in his personal issues unrelated to course studies. The counselor finds
this concerning and speaks to the principal regarding whether Mark may have crossed
internal communication policies or professional ethical boundaries, even though aiming
to help Luis.

      Did elements of Mark's efforts to support his student potentially violate any
components of the Code of Ethics? Why or why not? Analyze Mark's behavior and
statements in relation to appropriate educator and student boundaries. Make sure to cite
language from the ethics standards in justifying your arguments.

                                            Scenario 3

As online lesson material repositories grew, middle school science teacher Kayla
subscribed to several sites offering AI-generated lesson plans aligned to state standards.
With 120 students across five periods, manually planning engaging projects every day
was challenging. Kayla began assigning the AI-crafted lesson plans after quickly
reviewing and approving their quality first. Students were responding well. However,
some colleagues felt fully delegating fundamentals like lesson objectives, essential
questions and formative assessments violated principles on diligently upholding duties
vital to the learning process.

      During a district EdTech conference session discussing AI ethics, sharp divisions
emerged even among technology staff and administrators. Some argued AI supports
teachers in accessing shared best practices by automating routine design tasks. They said
just as with teacher toolkits from textbook ancillary materials, the core interaction of
creatively guiding activities still comes from Kayla. However, others contended relying
on AI algorithms threatened teacher development of contextualized curriculum attuned
to students' needs. Debates ensued around whether AI lesson aids should constitute
unethical outsourcing of basic teaching competencies - or if emerging assistive
technologies will necessitate updating professional standards for modern times.

      Is Kayla's use of AI to facilitate lesson planning in conflict with any components
of the Code of Ethics? Why or why not? Relate principles in the Code to this case

                                           around responsible use of resources and diligently upholding duties vital to student
                                           development.

                                GLOSSARY

                                           Code of Ethics: A set of principles and standards that outline the professional
                                           responsibilities and conduct expected of individuals within a particular profession. In
                                           the context of education, a teacher's code of ethics outlines the expectations for ethical
                                           behavior and decision-making.

                                           Conflict of Interest: A situation in which a person's personal interests or relationships
                                           may potentially influence their professional judgment or actions in a way that could
                                           compromise their integrity or impartiality. In education, conflict of interest situations
                                           should be avoided to maintain professional ethics.

                                           Critical Pedagogy: An approach to education that emphasizes the development of
                                           critical thinking skills, social justice, and equity. Critical pedagogy encourages students
                                           to question and challenge societal norms and structures.

                                           Ethic of Care: An ethical framework that emphasizes the importance of relationships,
                                           empathy, and compassion in moral decision-making. In the context of education, an
                                           ethic of care highlights the educator's role in nurturing students' well-being and
                                           supporting their holistic development.

                                           Integrity: Being honest and demonstrating strong moral principles.

                                           Moral Character: Qualities like honesty and integrity that reflect one's ethical values.

                                           role in designing learning experiences and supporting student development.

                                           Praxis: The process of applying theoretical knowledge or concepts into practical action
                                           or application. In education, praxis involves the integration of theory and practice in
                                           teaching and learning, emphasizing the transformative nature of education.

                  What Can U.S. Educators and
                  Schools Learn from Finland?

                                                           Ann Fradkin-Hayslip

                                                       Before You Read
                                                       Before reading, spend some time thinking about how teachers teach. Some profess
                                                       that teachers teach the way they were taught. It has also been postulated that college
                                                       faculty teach not only the way they were taught but that their teaching is influenced
                                                       by past experiences (Hora, 2013). In The Making of a College, a blueprint for the
                                                       inception of Hampshire College, Longsworth and Patterson, propose a school that
                                                       includes The Idea of the Student as Teacher. This philosophy encourages students to
                                                       act as teachers, such as leading discussions and seminars, and forming collegial
                                                       relationships between faculty and students. It recognizes that both teachers and
                                                       learners may switch between those roles. It is about absolving the rigidity of teacher
                                                       and student roles and recognizing that all of us can be teachers or learners
                                                       throughout our lives (Longsworth, 1966).
                                                       Critical Question For Consideration
                                                       As you read, consider these essential questions: In what ways can the United
                                                       States adopt practices from Finland to improve teacher preparation and schooling
                                                       for its students? In what ways does equity impact teachers and students? In what
                                                       ways does teacher autonomy impact learning and teaching? In what ways do the
                                                       pedagogical and philosophical differences between schooling in the United States
                                                       compare with those in Finland?

                                INTRODUCTION: WHY FINLAND?

                                           Walk into any school in Finland and obvious differences from U.S. schools will be
                                           immediately recognized. The density of parked bicycles near the entrance may be your
                                           first indicator. Depending on the size of the school, you may see hundreds of two and

three-wheelers. This is because students in Finland walk or ride bikes to school. There are
no school buses in the country, unlike in the United States, where thirty-eight percent
of students ride a school bus. In the United States, students typically qualify for bus
transportation if their designated school is two or more miles from their residence.
Neighborhood schools in Finland are within three miles of most students' homes and
the commute is viewed as safe and an essential part of being outdoors (Pietarinen, 2009).
Rarely do parents in Finland drive their children to school, as compared to the fifty-
four percent of parents who do so in the U.S. (New York School Bus Contractors
Association, n.d.). Even the youngest of children walk or bike throughout the school
year, including the winter months when the temperatures may dip below freezing, and
the absence of sunlight lasts for months.

      Finland is a small country that espouses an education system steeped in equity,
teacher autonomy, and quality education. Named the "happiest nation in the world," it
is a country that personifies not euphoria, but rather contentment. Its model of learning
and teaching supports a belief that teaching is not a one-way street, that learning occurs
when equity, respect, and meaning are paramount, and that education extends beyond
the physical confines of a building. Finland is a model for the rest of the world.

                                                                                              Even the youngest of children
                                                                                              walk or bike to school throughout
                                                                                              the school year.

The next notable difference may be the hundreds of shoes arranged within the school
vestibule or outside classrooms. Teachers, students, and visitors remove their shoes upon
entering any school in Finland. This practice is two-fold. It eliminates debris from the
outside and fosters coziness. No-shoe classrooms and hallways encourage students to sit
on the floor to collaborate with peers or to engage in projects. The practice also gives the
school an inviting feeling. Teachers and students can be seen barefooted, in stocking feet,
or clad in indoor shoes or slippers.

      Other differences may depend on the size or location of the school or the
population of students. Funding is equitable among all schools in Finland and members

                                           of each school may decide how that money is spent. An emphasis on physical comfort
                                           and community extends to social interaction for members of the school. Pool tables,
                                           video consoles, and rooms for students to lounge, visit with peers, or play board games
                                           is a common sight. For teachers, that sense of community can be felt in rooms outfitted
                                           with comfortable couches and chairs. The smell of brewing coffee is commonplace
                                           and encourages a collaborative and relaxed environment. The minimalistic design sets
                                           the mood for a peaceful aura. Warm paint tones and uncluttered walls contrast the
                                           institutionalized colors and often poster-plastered walls of American schools. Perhaps
                                           the most contrasting element is the absence of jarring announcements, blaring bells, hall
                                           passes, and in general, an authoritative, penal design. There is a calmness that permeates
                                           the buildings, and yet, an environment that is alive with activity.

                                                 Regardless of where schools are located, or the populations they serve, all schools
                                           are equitable. Local autonomy determines curriculum, teacher autonomy is paramount,
                                           and parents trust their children's teachers. In recent years, Finland has become
                                           synonymous with high-quality education. This was not always the case. Decades earlier,
                                           the country lagged behind its counterparts in terms of teacher training preparedness
                                           and student outcomes. The transformation that took place in the 1990s unwittingly
                                           propelled the country into the world spotlight. Unbeknownst to the collaborators, their
                                           plan worked; not only for their relatively small nation but as a model for the world to
                                           follow.

                                PISA - FINLAND RANKINGS AND
                                TRANSFORMATIONS - FOR BETTER OR WORSE

                                           Much has been written about educational reform in Finland; its rising PISA ((Program
                                           for International Student Assessment) rankings, and most recently, its descent. PISA is
                                           an international organization that every three years assesses fifteen-year-old students in
                                           the areas of reading, mathematics, and science literacy. The program, overseen by the
                                           OECD (Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development), began in 2000,
                                           and tests for competencies toward the end of the compulsory schooling for students
                                           (Overview, n.d.). In 2000, 32 countries participated. By 2018, that number had grown
                                           to 79, with a projected participation of 90 countries by 2025 (The Irish Journal of
                                           Education, 2023). Due to the COVID pandemic, the 2021 testing date was moved to
                                           2022, thereby moving the 2025 date up one year (PISA Scores By Country, 2023).
                                           Since 2000, and the inception of the first PISA, Finland has ranked in the top tiers of
                                           reading, mathematics, and science literacy, although scores did decline in 2015 and 2018
                                           (National Center on Education and the Economy, 2023). Has educational attainment
                                           declined, or rather, reached a stable point? Do international scores adequately define the
                                           worth of an educational system, or do other factors more realistically offer an unbiased

HISTORICAL CONTEXT - HOW FINLAND BECAME

SYNONYMOUS WITH QUALITY EDUCATION

Throughout the late 1970s, students in the small Nordic country of Finland routinely
scored near the bottom of the rankings by the OECD. A decade later, the Ministry
of Education adopted a common curriculum (National Center on Education and the
Economy, 2023). Finnish students began to earn average scores on international
assessments, with slightly higher scores in reading (Sahlberg, Finnish Lessons: What
Can the World Learn from Educational Change in Finland?, 2011). Still, the scores
were not stellar, and no one was taking notice. Then, during the 1990s, a revamping
of the curriculum produced a national design focused on a less-is-more approach. This
undertaking pared the objectives for each grade, from lengthy pages to concise attributes
for student learning. With an emphasis on learning, rather than teaching, educators
strove to delve deeper into fewer concepts and focus on encouraging critical thinking
and problem-solving skills. The plan also included elevating the teaching profession
and by extension, granting teachers the autonomy to make their own choices about
what and how they would teach and assess. The transformation that took place in the
1990s unwittingly propelled the country into the world spotlight. Unbeknownst to
the collaborators, their plan had worked; not only for their relatively small nation but
as a model for the industrialized world to follow. The rankings soared; with Finnish
students outscoring their peers in reading, mathematics, and science literacy. Thrust
into the world spotlight, educators around the globe wanted to know their secret. How
did Finland become the forerunner for academic achievement? What was even more
remarkable was that Finnish students and teachers spent less time in the classroom than
most others, most notably, Americans. Homework is minimal, if at all, and standardized
tests are practically non-existent. Yet, despite these differences, the scores outranked
the other nations. Finnish educators widely speculated that there might be a scoring
error, but indeed, this was not the case. What was soon realized was that there were
206 RESTORYING EDUCATION

                           no magical or extreme measures that predicted these results. Instead, a coming together
                           of creating a national curriculum, respecting the rights of individual schools to amend
                           this curriculum, a less-is-more attitude, a healthy respect for all learners, trust in and
                           autonomy for teachers, and a balance between life and school was the prescription that
                           healed a floundering educational system.

The Educational System of
Finland

                           PEDAGOGICAL FRAMEWORK

                           The framework of the National Curriculum is built on a commitment to ensure that all
                           Finnish students will have "the knowledge and skills" to "remain strong in the future,
                           both nationally and internationally." Student-centered, the fabric of the plan is to
                           encourage students' "interest in and motivation for learning" (Finnish National Agency
                           for Education, 2023). It is a structure intended.
                                                  WHAT CAN U.S. EDUCATORS AND SCHOOLS LEARN FROM FINLAND? 207

      "to enable a reform of school culture and school pedagogy which will improve
the quality of the learning process and enhance learning outcomes" (Finnish National
Agency for Education, 2023).

      This design supports active participation by learners, to intersect knowledge and
feelings, with goals and problem-solving skills. Schools are publicly funded, follow a
national curriculum, and support a play-based ideology. Teachers are viewed as
instructors who facilitate these aims and encourage life-long learning.

CURRICULUM

The curriculum in Finland is rooted in a pedagogy that supports the belief that student-
centered and collaborative learning will benefit all learners (Council for Creative
Education, n.d.). Regardless of the locations or populations of the schools, all are
equitable, and local autonomy enables schools the latitude to adapt the national
curriculum to their situations. Unlike the United States, where the emphasis is on
teaching, testing, and accountability, in Finland, the focus is on learning, and an ideology
that students and schools do not need to be compared to each other. This contrasts with
the standards-based curriculum that currently exists in the United States. The notion of
an accountability report for all U.S. public schools led to standards-based educational
benchmarks for all schools. The premise was for each grade level to articulate the skills
and knowledge expected of all students after the school year with the goal of teachers
and schools helping students attain these criteria (Alex Spurrier, 2020). At its inception,
some professed the system to be equitable and a means to identify lower-performing
schools. The latter would enable educators and policymakers to find inducements or
enforcement to improve these lower-performing schools. Criticism of the approach
points to teaching to the test; a method to teach strategies to pass a test. Time is spent
on "using the test in instruction so that the students will have encountered all of the test
items before the actual test" (Top Education Degrees, 2023). Opponents argue that the
time spent to prepare, take, and remediate after testing would be better spent on engaged
learning activities. Currently, thirty-eight states require a standards-based curriculum,
and an additional twelve states recommend its adoption (BALLOTPEDIA, 2023). In
Finland, learning is fluid, asset-based, and free of threats about not measuring up.

COMPULSORY EDUCATION

Every child in Finland who is a permanent resident between the ages of six and sixteen
is required to attend public or private school, both of which are at no cost to families
(Ahonen, 2023). Learning materials, school meals, and health services are also provided
free of charge (Finnish National Agency for Education, 2023). Although a national
curriculum includes learning objectives and core contents for each grade, schools, and
teachers are encouraged to create or adapt the framework (Finnish National Agency
for Education, 2023). They may also choose how the curriculum is to be implemented
and how teaching and learning will occur. The educational framework is designed to
208 RESTORYING EDUCATION

                                           encourage and support learning from birth through adulthood. Although early
                                           childhood education is not compulsory, it is an integral part of the structure. This is
                                           followed by a year of pre-primary education for six-year-olds, and basic education for
                                           those between the ages of seven and sixteen.

                                EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION AND CARE

                                           The Early Childhood Education and Care Program (ECEC) in Finland serves children
                                           between zero and six years old. Overseen by the Ministry of Education and Culture it
                                           supports the belief that all children have the right to quality early childhood care and that
                                           parents have the right to choose if and how they will participate in the program(Starting
                                           Stong IV Early Childhood Education and Care Data Country Note, 2016). Parents
                                           choose whether to stay home with their infant, hire in-home care, or place the child
                                           in a public or private early childhood daycare center. If they opt to stay home, one,
                                           or both parents may take a leave of absence from their job with a combined total of
                                           320 days of leave coverage. Monetary compensation is also provided. If parents choose a
                                           daycare center, ECEC supplements the costs. Family income determines their financial
                                           contribution, at a maximum of 300 euros, or approximately $321.18 a month (City of
                                           Helsinki, n.d.). Compared to early childhood centers in the United States, the average
                                           cost for early childhood care is $1, 230 a month, or approximately $15,000 a year. The
                                           flexibility of the Educare Model supports parents to make choices in the best interest
                                           of their children. It also prescribes the ideology that children can learn from everyday
                                           activities, whether in the home or at a center. Young children learn by serving themselves
                                           lunch or putting on their boots. This ideology also encourages independence and fosters
                                           a sense of accomplishment. Learning is viewed as joyful, and children are free to develop
                                           at their own pace. All early childhood teachers have a bachelor's degree. The teacher-
                                           student ratio for the ECEC system is 10 children per teacher. For children under the
                                           age of 3, the ratio is 1:3, while for ages 3 to 5 the ratio is 1:8 (Starting Strong IV Early
                                           Childhood Education and Care Data Country Note, 2016). By comparison, in the
                                           United States, the average ratio is 15.3 students per teacher in kindergarten; with some
                                           states employing a 20:1 ratio (State K-3 Policies, 2020).

                                                                                          Play

                                           Embedded in early childhood philosophy is the belief that play is essential for developing
                                           minds and bodies. This includes romps outside, communing with nature, overnight
                                           trips, even for three and four-year-olds, and breaks to interact with peers. Play-based
                                           learning is child-initiated and child-centered. It is open-ended and taps into their natural
                                           curiosity and interest in the world around them. Play is not a fun project that a teacher
                                           introduces, nor is it a planned, adult-led activity. "Play is the answer to how anything new
                                           comes about (Brainy Quote, 2023)." Play contributes to cognitive and social-emotional
                                           development as children learn and interact with others. Language and literacy skills are
                                           enhanced, confidence and cooperative skills, and physical development are outcomes of
                                           play-based learning.

                                    Pre-Primary Education

Learning through playful activities and experiences extends to the pre-primary education
year.

      At age six, students enter the pre-primary education step, aimed toward providing
them with greater opportunities for learning and development. Pre-primary education
plays an important part in the continuum spanning from early childhood education and
care to primary and lower secondary education. It introduces students to mathematical
and reading skills without direct instruction. Instead, learners may play and explore with
manipulatives, books, games, and other interactive materials. This year of exploration
is designed to prepare youngsters for the following year. Childhood is meant to be
stress-free; therefore, students are not pressured to acquire academic skills at a set time.
Each child is viewed as an individual. Before 2015, pre-primary education was optional,
however, in August of that year, The Ministry of Education mandated the program
for all children. The National Core Curriculum for Pre-Primary Education, approved
by the Finnish National Agency for Education, guides the planning of the content of
pre-primary education and a framework for local curricula (European Commission,
2023). The four-hour day is spent on play-based and interactive activities designed to
prepare young children for the subsequent school year. It is typical to observe children
working cooperatively as they complete puzzles, engage in vocabulary and number-
matching games, and do daily outdoor play. The emphasis is on hands-on, learning-by-
doing experiences (European Commission, 2023).

                                         Basic Education

Basic education commences after the pre-primary year, at the age of seven, and extends
until sixteen years of age. It is divided into primary and lower secondary education levels.
The Basic Education step, like the pre-primary year, is built on a belief that learning
should occur within positive environments. One way to achieve this is the relatively
short school days. Finnish students spend approximately five hours a day in school,
compared to the six to eight hours American students spend in class. To balance the
school day, students are given multiple breaks throughout the school day. For every
forty-five minutes of class time, students are given a fifteen-minute break, and like play-
based learning, this break is student-determined; not teacher-initiated. Students may
play a game of pool or video games, depending on the furnishings of their school, or
they may sit and visit with friends. The time is unstructured and designed to balance
work with free time. Another means of a positive environment is the non-existent or
limited homework assigned in Finnish schools. Homework that is assigned typically has
a practical intent. It may include planning and preparing dinner for the family as an
extension to a home economics class. The Finnish belief is that learners should be given
the time and choice after school to pursue sports, hobbies, or interactions with others.
This is contrary to the average U.S. student who may spend hours each day completing
required homework assignments (Education in Finland, n.d.). When learners reach the
age of sixteen, they have the option to add an extra year to their education plan. They also
have the choice to pursue an upper secondary general education or vocational education
210 RESTORYING EDUCATION

                                           curriculum. The first requires certain examinations and is aligned with preparation
                                           to enter a bachelor's degree program. The second requires vocational qualifications in
                                           preparation for a technical degree.

                                                                              Assessment

                                  Ironically, despite the consistently high rankings of Finnish students, the educational
                                  framework is a system adverse to assessments. Assessment in Finnish schools can be
                                  defined as a system of flexible accountability (Education reform in Finland and the
                                  comprehensive school system, 2019). This practice allows teachers to determine how
                                  and when to assess their students. Self and peer assessments are common in Finnish
                                  classrooms. These methods support self-reflection and constructive feedback, according
                                  to the premise that they contribute to a n support life-long learning. There are no
                                  mandatory standardized tests for schools and although national tests exist, they too, are
                                  voluntary (Education reform in Finland and the comprehensive school system, 2019).

                                        Core subjects for basic education include national and secondary languages,
                                  sciences, social studies, arts, technology, mathematics, religion, ethics, and home
                                  economics. Disciplines are continually updated to reflect current and best practices,
                                  and students are given choices within these disciplines. Multidisciplinary and cross-
                                  disciplinary learning often occurs as students learn skills and develop dispositions across
                                  multiple disciplines.

Transversal Competencies are also included within the education framework. Defined
as emotional intelligence and experience, these skills are not associated with a specific
discipline, but instead reflect the skills required to effectively navigate in the work
environment. Sometimes referred to as soft skills, these competencies can include
"critical and innovative thinking, interpersonal skills, global citizenship, and physical
and psychological health (Heron, 2019)." At its core, transversal competencies include
creativity, collaboration, conflict resolution, communication skills, teamwork, critical
thinking, and media and information literacy skills (National Initiative for School
Heads' and Teachers' Hollistic Advancement). Transversal competencies are designed to
prepare learners for the future and for those jobs that have yet to be created or idealized.

                                       Outdoor Education

Education outside the classroom (EOC) refers to curricula that take place outside the
classroom (Jarvinen-Taubert, 2022). Learning may occur in a structure, such as a library,
museum, or forest. Finnish culture revolves around a healthy respect and interaction
with nature and schools are included in this relationship. Embodied within the country's
educational pedagogical framework, it is a given that schools support "learning,
interaction, participation, well-being, and a sustainable way of living" (Finnish National
Agency for Education, 2023). Outdoor education is essential, beginning with outdoor
play in the ECEC program and spanning until the culmination of the basic education
year. Communing with nature is regarded as an interdisciplinary approach that
promotes cognitive skills and places value on individuals and the environment. Its social-
emotional impact includes inquiry-based learning for the student overseeing the process
and the teacher acting as facilitator (Finnish student teachers' ideas of outdoor learning,
2021).

                                        Everyman's Right

The emphasis on nature stems from Finnish culture. Everyman's Right is a decree that
establishes "the right of every person to use nature regardless of who owns or controls
the land" (Finnish Environment Institute, 2023). It is, therefore, not necessary to have
permission from a landowner to use said property. Finland is propagated with thousands
of wilderness huts and shelters across the nation. Structures range from simple lean-
tos to shelters that house bunks and cooking apparatus (GONE71, 2020). Expectations
are that users will respect and not alter nature and comply with rules such as staying
on marked trails, camping where allowed, preserving water sources, guarding against
potential forest fires, and not littering. These structures may serve as the backdrop for
daily visits by school children, or for overnight experiences for children as young as three
years old. This healthy interaction between school and nature brings learning to real-
world contexts including "mathematics, physics, languages, art, physical education, etc."
(Jarvinen-Taubert, 2022).

                          Equity

The equity inherent in the everyman's right is reflected in Finland's education system.
Every student in Finland is afforded an equitable education that spans from birth to
the university level; and every student has a right to educational support (Ahonen,
2023). Children enter school with varying life situations and the dynamics of their home
affect what they see and experience and impact their readiness to learn. Children who
positively engage in dialogue and play at home have "higher literacy skills, better peer
interactions, fewer behavior problems, and greater motivation and persistence during
learning activities" (Families Are the Heart of School Readiness, n.d.). Acknowledging
these variances propelled the Ministry to adopt "the equal opportunity principle ..." that
"...insisted that all students be offered a fair chance to be successful and enjoy learning"
(Sahlberg, Finnish Lessons 2.0 What can the world learn from educational change in
Finland?, 2015, p. 28). This commitment to equity is not synonymous with equality.
Rather than every student being taught the same thing in the same way, learning and
teaching would now take the individual into account; however, the overarching similar
component would be that all students receive a high-quality education. "People
sometimes incorrectly assume that equity in education means all students should be
taught the same curriculum or should achieve the same learning outcomes in school...
Rather, equity in education means that all students must have access to high-quality
education, regardless of where they live, who their parents might be or what school
they attend" (Sahlberg, Finnish Lessons 2.0 What can the world learn from educational
change in Finland?, 2015). This equity underscores the belief that all students can
and should receive the preparation for higher education or a career path (European
Commission, 2023). As the familiar cartoon below depicts, equality means that everyone
receives the same while equity means everyone receives what they need. The added
image of justice addresses the removal of systemic barriers; thus, eliminating many of the
resulting needed supports.

     MEET THE THEORIST

       Pasi Sahlberg (1959 - ) is a Finnish education scholar. His work explores Finnish
       education systems, educational reform, and education policy. He is a Professor of
       Educational Leadership at the University of Melbourne, Australia.

                                        Special Education
Special education in Finland is also rooted in a philosophy of equity and inclusivity. The
term special needs does not exist in the Finnish educational legislation. The belief is that
inclusivity is best for learning and social well-being and that learning together benefits
all students (Schools, 2022). Infused within the schools, special education support is
viewed not as a negative or a distractor, but as assistance to students and teachers.
Approximately 30 percent of all students receive special help (Hancock, 2011). Special
education services for Finnish students are mostly focused on reading, writing, and
mathematics, with an emphasis on teaching and learning rather than on a deficit
mentality. In Finland, early identification is key to the prevention of learning difficulties
and so more children are identified at younger ages. Compared to children in the United
States, special education is defined as a disability that may entail physical, cognitive,
linguistic, or other developmental delays (U.S. Department of Education, 2017).
Parental permission for special education services is not required in Finland. This enables
214 RESTORYING EDUCATION

                                           specialists and teachers to provide support as needed and as quickly as possible, unlike
                                           in the United States, where parental or guardian permission is required and where
                                           one academic year can elapse between the time a student is potentially identified, and
                                           the time services are rendered. In compliance with the Individuals with Disabilities
                                           Education Act (IDEA), an initial evaluation must occur within 60 days of the request
                                           (Office of Special Education and Rehabilitative Services, 2017). In 2004, the
                                           reauthorization of IDEA introduced the Response to intervention (RTI) method to
                                           identify students. The three-tiered system monitors the progress of a student as
                                           interventions are intensified. Tier 1 represents approximately 80 percent of referred
                                           students, with Tier 2 and 3 representing approximately 15 and 5 percent respectively
                                           (Wiley University Services, 2013). Tier 2 may extend for eight weeks or longer. If
                                           progress is not satisfactory, further testing may be initialized. Legally, schools must
                                           evaluate students when there is reason to believe that a disability exists and need for
                                           special education services (Martin, n.d.). Months of progress monitoring, scheduled
                                           meetings, and other procedures can often mean that an identified student receives special
                                           education services toward the end of the current or at the start of their subsequent school
                                           year, unlike in Finland, where services can be immediate.

                                                 Finland also has a tier system of services; however, it differs considerably from
                                           the US model. General support refers to the strategies the teacher may provide to all
                                           students in the class. These adaptations may include flexible seating, guided practice, and
                                           differentiation strategies. Intensified support is when the teacher makes adaptations for
                                           individual students. These plans may be in consultation with the parents and or special
                                           education teachers. The third tier, special support, is for students who have a "severe
                                           disability, illness or developmental disorder" (Finland's Approach to Special Needs &
                                           Inclusion, 2022). Even with the most severe needs, the goal is to keep all students in the
                                           mainstream classroom, and for all students to interact in and out of the classroom.

                                                                            No Dead Ends - No Tracking

                                           Tracking, the practice of placing students in classes based on ability, I.Q., or achievement
                                           (National Association of Secondary School Principals, 2023), does not exist in Finland.
                                           Initiated in the United States in the 1930's, the practice places students on tracks,
                                           to "provide them with a level of curriculum and instruction that is appropriate to
                                           their needs" (National Association of Secondary School Principals, 2023). During the
                                           late 1960s and early 1970s, students were often tracked for either college-bound or
                                           vocational training. This meant that all their school courses propelled them on a
                                           trajectory toward college preparation, or lack thereof. In the 1970s, tracking evolved
                                           to placement for individual courses (The Brookings Institution, 2013). Students may
                                           be deemed to be on a college preparatory trajectory, thereby given a curriculum that
                                           includes requisite courses for college admission. Other students may be identified and
                                           tracked for a general education, on a path for a trade or job placement. Their track may
                                           be classified as general education with basic-level courses. A high school graduate who
                                           completed a general education track program might lack the (pre)requisites for college
                                           admission. They may then have to play catch-up, take the necessary courses of study
                                                  WHAT CAN U.S. EDUCATORS AND SCHOOLS LEARN FROM FINLAND? 215

after graduation, or accept a vocational path in life. This in no way implies that one path
supersedes another or that one is better than the other. Instead, it calls into question
how educators can predict an educational track for a pre-teen that may impose serious
consequences on their pursuit of higher education and career options. That a track is
based on judgments about perceived abilities and future trajectories is nothing short of
alarming. Even with the modification of tracking being course-specific, students may still
be denied entry to college if they have not taken the requisite secondary courses. Critics
of tracking have also long argued that groupings often reflect SES (socio-economic
status), with those at the lower SES levels tracked for vocational training and those at the
higher SES levels tracked for college preparedness. Not surprisingly, tracking has come
under fire for the past 20 years as being biased against low-income and minority students
(The Brookings Institution, 2013). By contrast, in 1985, Finland abolished ability-level
and tracking practices. Students were homogeneously grouped with the rationale that
grouping students by ability amounted to inequitable practices.

      Finland also provides a No Dead-End education system, designed to provide choice
and access to higher education for all students. The system also allows for avenues to
change paths without lapses or interruptions in school. As indicated in (Table ), if a
Finnish student chooses a general upper secondary school plan, that student may then
continue to higher education, earning a bachelor's, master's, or doctoral degree. If they
opt to pursue a vocational course at the upper secondary level, they may do so. For
the student who decides on a vocational path as their upper secondary school plan,
that student may also earn a bachelor's degree from a polytechnic institute. If, at that
point, the student chooses to pursue a master's or Doctoral degree at a university, that
path is also available. Hence, the term, No Dead Ends has been etched into the Finnish
education system to provide choices along with the pursuit of an education.

                                        Higher Education

Institutions of higher education in Finland, are also free of cost to its citizens. Two types
of institutions are available: universities and universities of applied sciences (UAS), Both
institutions offer bachelor's and master's degrees. Among the thirteen universities, all are
public, and extensive programs and courses are offered (Higher Education in Finland,
2023). Universities "focus on scientific research and education based on it" (Fulbright
Finland Foundation, n.d.). Admission is competitive and work is deemed to be rigorous.
Like the compensatory education system, choice is a fundamental tenet. For example,
some courses may allow students to take competency exams in place of class attendance
or course requirements. An additional 23 polytechnic schools, also known as (UAS),
focus on occupations in business, industry, and service. Degree programs, including
professional teacher education programs, are related to the workforce and may include
internships and other work experiences (JEDUKA, 2023).

                                      Teacher Preparation

The decision to move teacher preparation programs to research universities was to
elevate the profession (National Center on Education and the Economy, 2023).
216 RESTORYING EDUCATION

                                           Standards were raised and by elevating the profession, teaching became a highly
                                           respected and revered career (Sahlberg, Vision, sustainable leadership and intelligent
                                           educational policies: The Finland story, 2007). By setting the bar high for admission to
                                           teacher education programs, less than seven out of one hundred applicants are accepted
                                           (Jehlen, 2010), and by establishing a competitive teaching job market, Finland was able
                                           to fortify its schools with exceptionally intelligent and capable educators. In doing so,
                                           trust was placed in the teachers, and they were granted the autonomy traditionally
                                           offered to well-respected professionals. Now, teacher preparation programs are highly
                                           competitive, and the profession is revered. Only one in ten applicants are accepted into
                                           teacher education programs, and all teachers are required to earn a master's degree.
                                           Additionally, the university oversees programs "based on and supported by scientific
                                           knowledge" (Sahlberg, p. 75). Programs are consistent and entry is determined by
                                           academics, commitment to pedagogy, and a passion for education and teaching. The
                                           five-year program encourages creativity and thinking outside of the box. It prepares
                                           candidates to become autonomous yet reflective and collaborative teachers. In nations
                                           where students rank high according to PISA (Programme for International Student
                                           Assessment), teacher preparation is highly selective. Finland has one of the most
                                           competitive teacher education programs in the world (Sahlberg, Finnish Lessons: What
                                           Can the World Learn from Educational Change in Finland?, 2011). In a country where
                                           there is very little variation between schools ... and where "95% of Finnish schoolchildren
                                           fulfill the OECD minimum requirements for living in a modern society," the
                                           consistency of teacher education programs and enrollment standards is evidenced
                                           (University of Helsinki, 2006). Applicants to teacher education programs are required to
                                           "pass a rigorous matriculation examination.... possess high scores, positive personalities,
                                           excellent interpersonal skills, and (possess a) commitment to work as a teacher at a
                                           school" (Sahlberg, Finnish Lessons: What Can the World Learn from Educational
                                           Change in Finland?, 2011). Not surprisingly, teachers in Finland are respected similarly
                                           to how physicians are respected in the United States (D'Orio, 2008). High standards
                                           and a uniform educational philosophy have positively impacted longevity in the field.
                                           Finland boasts a 90% retention among its teachers; conversely, fifty percent of U.S.
                                           teachers leave the profession in the first five years (Pearson, 2005). "Those with the least
                                           training leave at more than twice the rate of those who are well-prepared" (Darling-
                                           Hammond, 2011). As Darling-Hammond and other researchers have found, the better
                                           the preparation, the greater the likelihood for the teacher to remain in the profession.
                                           In Finland, graduates of teacher education programs must pass two levels to be
                                           Sahlberghired for a teaching job. They are grouped according to their matriculation
                                           scores. This includes college examinations, "out-of-school accomplishments, and a
                                           national entrance exam in which questions focus on a wide range of educational issues"
                                           (Sahlberg, 2011).

                                                                                  Teacher Autonomy

                                           Once hired, teachers devote half of their time toward "planning with colleagues,
                                           collaborating with parents, and taking part in high-level professional development"

(Frysh, 2011). This lends credence to the notion of the teacher as an autonomous and
capable professional. Educational reform advocates within the United States, contend
that greater teacher autonomy and decision-making input will result in more informed
decisions than those made by district or state supervisors; however, they acknowledge
an organization that is deeply rooted in a top-down model. "Autonomy seems to be
emerging as a key variable when examining educational reform initiatives, with some
arguing that granting autonomy and empowering teachers is an appropriate place to
begin in solving the problems of today's school" (Pearson L. C., 2005). The teaching
profession in Finland is highly respected, and the curriculum is "deeply thoughtful,"
creative and cutting edge; it attracts people who lean toward "research, development
and design" (National Center on Education and The Economy, 2006). Teachers are
encouraged to "push their intellectual and creative bounds, and to "use their judgment"
(National Center on Education and The Economy, 2006). This process places the
teacher in the role of a leader and abolishes a top-down hierarchical system.

      Teacher evaluations were also abolished under the new framework. The autonomy
bestowed to teachers resulted in parents placing their trust and respect in the teachers.
This healthy relationship establishes a strong home-school connection. Teachers are
entrusted to choose what to teach, how to teach, where to teach, how and what to
integrate, and how to assess. Parents are supportive of the teachers whom they view
as professionals. Therefore, teachers are free to seek support services for students, take
students on outdoor and overnight trips, and make choices they deem appropriate.

                                     Autonomy and Efficacy

Teacher autonomy is also linked to efficacy and emerges as a key variable toward student
achievement. Autonomy means having control over oneself and one's work
environment (Pearson L. &., 2006). Thus, a pecking order is viewed as antithetical to an
autonomous work setting. Teacher autonomy is related to collegial relationships within
the school setting, shared decision-making, and flexibility and choice as it relates to
instructional methods. "...top-down decision making often fails precisely because it lacks
the support of those whose (sic) are responsible for the implementation and success of
the decision" (Pearson L. &., 2006). Herein lies the polarization of public education in
the United States in contrast to education in Finland. To allow one to maintain control
implies and is predicated upon the premise that one has the capabilities to do so. Hence,
before one can be afforded the trust inherent within an autonomous role, one must be
adequately trained, educated, and prepared for the task. It is therefore essential to ensure
that teachers are highly qualified before they enter the profession.

                                           Teacher autonomy has also been linked to teacher effectiveness; a quality often observed
                                           in Finnish schools. Effective teachers believe in a commitment to teach all children and
                                           believe that all students can learn. They exemplify collaborative methods within the
                                           classroom, contribute to the creation of a shared vision, and practice the art of self-
                                           analysis. A plethora of research confirms a significant link between effective teachers and
                                           student achievement (Tucker, 2011). This relationship extends to teachers who create
                                           higher-quality lessons and who exhibit a high level of self-efficacy. When individuals
                                           feel competent, they act confidently. These self-reflective ideologies then impact their
                                           behavior. Humans are more inclined to perform tasks in which they feel a level of
                                           competency, while their level of efficacy determines the amount of effort expended and
                                           the willingness to persevere in the face of adversity.

                                          School Culture

In describing the culture of schools in Finland, despite their geographical differences, a
unifying precept is evident. Characteristics that define the culture of a school can often
be described in terms of how it is perceived concerning its beliefs and attitudes and
how these perceptions impact the behavior of both its students and teachers (Tableman,
2004). Culture is formed by the interactions of "the attitudes and beliefs of persons
both inside the school and in the external environment, the culture norms of the school,
and the relationships between persons in the school" (SEDL, 1992). These deep-rooted
ideologies become embedded and ensconced within the school and help to define its
reputation. School culture also influences student behavior achievement. In studies of
turnaround schools, it was shown that student behavior correlated with schools that
exemplified a positive culture by demonstrating a commitment to "moral character
- treating others well....and performance character, doing things well (Character
Education Partnership)." The combination of believing and behaving ethically solidified
the positive culture of these schools. In identifying the traits of positive school culture,
particular patterns emerge. These settings are marked by an atmosphere that includes
a "safe and caring environment," an "intellectual climate," a clear set of "rules and
policies," and a commitment toward "shared decision making" (Character Education
Partnership).

                                      Student Achievement

Not surprisingly, student achievement has strong links within positive classroom
climates, marked by those in which the teacher integrates both emotion and the interests
of students and where the teacher fosters and maintains interest levels. It is exemplified
within a smooth management, student-friendly environment that is permeated by
measures of fair evaluations. Rules, procedures, and expectations are clear and just.
It is an environment that is culturally responsive and where communication, with
individuals, families, and teams of teachers, is in evidence. Hence, the culture of the
school directly impacts the achievement of the student, academically, socially, and
psychologically. Studies have also supported the claim that effective teachers display high
levels of self-efficacy and that these same teachers promote self-efficacy among their
students (Hoy A. W., 2009). Effective teachers promote a caring classroom environment
in which the beliefs and culture of the students are valued within an atmosphere that
fosters a belief that all students can learn (Hoy A. W., 2009).

FINAL THOUGHTS - LEARNING FROM OTHERS

Since 2012, the United Nations Happiness Report has listed the countries in order of
happiness and for the past six years, Finland has been ranked as the happiest nation.
Like their high-scoring status on the PISA exams, residents at first, questioned these
rankings. In conversations with Finns, I have come to realize that happiness is not about
euphoria; it is not about walking about with a broad smile or an ecstatic air. Instead,
220 RESTORYING EDUCATION

                                           happiness is about contentment. It is about living in a society that values health and
                                           well-being and part of that well-being is the education of its citizens. Happiness, or
                                           contentment is about living in a community that exalts equity for the people. It has often
                                           been asked how the education system in the United States can attain the level of success
                                           as Finland, given our societal and economic differences and the answer remains the same.
                                           To make overarching changes, a reconfiguration of values and mindfulness about the
                                           framework of education would need to occur. Like the figure (Figure 14) of children
                                           watching a baseball game, barriers that prevent access and equitable opportunities need
                                           to be removed. Systemic change needs to include a reevaluation of the core curriculum,
                                           teacher preparation and autonomy, and authentic assessment. Finland has modeled how
                                           students can and do achieve academic and social-emotional success under a system
                                           that promotes a less-is-more curriculum, within a culture of equity, founded on the
                                           principles of believing that each person can learn, and where the individual is valued and
                                           respected. When respect for the teaching profession is respected, and when the absence
                                           of threats of evaluations frees teachers and students to think critically, create, and explore
                                           in an atmosphere of joy, encouragement, and positiveness, the seeds for lifelong learning
                                           will be nourished. Your journey may lead you down the path to cultivate change on a
                                           systemic level, or your steps may be closer in stride.
