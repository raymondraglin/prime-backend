Research justification

This book covers original research on the implementation of open educational practices
(OEPs) through the use of open educational resources (OERs) at university level. The
emphasis on open education in this book is on contextualising resources, supporting
student agency and fostering self-directed learning (SDL), specifically within the
South African milieu.

    The chapters covered conceptual and review research as well as empirical work
focusing on OEPs and the use of renewable assessments. The work starts off with an
overview of an institutional-wide open education project that prompted the research,
followed by research on open education in terms of various modules in health science,
music education, law, philosophy, dietetics, French language learning and journalism.
The target audience of the book includes academics and researchers in the field of
OERs, OEPs and SDL, specifically in higher education.

    The editors screened all the chapters for inclusion through submitted abstracts
and then they reviewed all the chapters for the sake of consistency and quality before
this was submitted for an independent and rigorous peer review process that was
administered by AOSIS. The editors are confident that the chapters in this book will
contribute to academic scholarship in the wider fields of OERs, OEPs and SDL.

    Furthermore, in accordance with the requirements of the Department of Higher
Education and Training (DHET), this book contains original research substantiated
by means of scholarly scientific referencing and the book's content has not been
published before and no part of the book has been plagiarised.

          Professor of Practice, Center for Learning and Teaching,

At their heart, open educational practices (OEPs) strive towards an ideal of
social justice. Open educational practices include the creation, adaptation
and redistribution of open educational resources (OERs), as well as leveraging
the open web to foster social connections. At the very least, OEPs involve
making educational materials and opportunities accessible for free and
removing barriers to who can use these materials and how.

    In reality, it is more complex. So much of the existing open materials are
offered in dominant/colonial languages, predominantly English, and therefore
inaccessible to those who are not fluent in the language. Although openness
allows anyone to translate these works, we know that epistemic justice is not
merely a matter of translation: ideas are themselves a product of cultures and
politics, and the dominant epistemologies of knowledge in open materials
reflect the same dominant colonial knowledge of non-open materials
traditionally used in formal schooling and academia. In this way, openness
may address an economic injustice challenge but not redress cultural and
political injustices (Bali, Cronin & Jhangiani 2020, Hodgkinson-Williams &
Trotter 2018, building on the work of Fraser 2005).

    In another sense, openness creates space for learner agency in ways
unprecedented before the Internet made it possible: anyone who wishes to learn
something and has access to a good enough Internet connection can find
materials that others have made available for free - if they have the digital
literacies to find what they need, and if they have the time and ability to focus on
autonomous learning that may or may not result in an acknowledged credential.

    Educators from around the globe can adapt and curate open material to
better fit their local needs, and they can create their own. If they have the
digital literacies to do so and if they have sufficient freedom within their
institutions to choose or create their own learning material, the open web
enables educators and learners to find people to learn from all over the world,
people who are not formally responsible for educating them, but who may be
willing to share pieces of their knowledge to help fill gaps.

    Open education fosters learner and educator agency in what they learn
and how they learn, by making so much available for free, by giving choices in

time and space and by reducing the bureaucracy of asking permission to take,
modify and converse. Yet many educators and learners have never had these
freedoms and choices and may not know how to best make use of them
(Walker & Unterhalter 2007) and they may even simply reproduce dominant
knowledge in more open forms and use open knowledge with traditional
pedagogies.

    Making all of these ideals we strive towards actually work in reality is
multilayered, multidimensional and challenging. This book gives the reader a
closer look at how some of the efforts to use openness to decolonise and
empower have worked in practice in the complex landscape of South Africa.
The contextualisation and recognition of the work it takes to cultivate agency
and self-directed learning can inform and inspire others striving towards the
socially just use of open education.

This book explores contextualised open educational practices (OEPs) in terms
of the intersections between open educational resources (OERs), student
agency and self-directed learning (SDL). Apart from some theoretical chapters
setting the scene in terms of the aforementioned aspects, this book specifically
reports on work done within the North-West University (NWU) OERs
Fellowship. This Fellowship involved university staff of this South African
university being supported and incentivised to create OERs and do research
on the process or some aspect of OERs or OEPs. The Fellowship also involved
a number of webinars and workshops on aspects related to OERs, OEPs, and
the application and research thereof. Consequently, this book not only
presents original research on the context and use of OERs within a specific
context but also aims to contribute to the wider scholarship of open education.

    Chapter 1 provides an overview of the Fellowship by establishing the
theoretical foundation while also unpacking the steps followed through the
process. Importantly, this chapter also involves findings from a qualitative
analysis of the perceptions about the initiative by the fellows themselves. This
research has shown how participants perceived elements of self-directedness
in the process of learning about and ultimately researching and using OERs
within the context of OEPs. A significant finding was the value of positive
interdependence within groups. It was also clear that a Fellowship such as this
with expert inputs and a financial incentive may act as a motivator towards
OER creation. Furthermore, unique ways in which student agency could be

promoted and localisation be implemented were also clear from the responses
from the participants and this is also shown in some of the chapters included
in this book.

    In Chapter 2, the unique South African context is unpacked. This conceptual
chapter involves an overview of multilingual digital education in higher
education in terms of social justice through localised self-directed OEPs in
South Africa. Firstly, the wider multilingual South African context is described
after which the role of OERs and OEPs in terms of social justice is clarified.
From this chapter, the affordances of localised self-directed OEPs as an
approach to language harmonisation are clear. These practices imply fostering
self-directedness amongst students with regard to their open translanguaging
practices and localisation. This chapter not only provides a theoretical basis
for some of the localisation efforts noted in subsequent chapters but also
makes some concrete recommendations for self-directed OEPs in similar
contexts.

    Chapter 3 also extends the theoretical background of OERs by specifically
interrogating what OERs are, the needs, benefits and challenges in using
OERs, while establishing a clear link with SDL. This chapter provides a detailed
rationale for the work that was done in the chapters that follow while bringing
in a unique review of pertinent OER and SDL scholarship. Importantly, the
benefits for students are discussed in comprehensively and this emphasises
the importance of initiatives such as the NWU OER Fellowship and others that
are similar. From this literature overview, a number of gaps and possible future
research and development opportunities in terms of OERs and intersections
with SDL are evident. The challenges for implementing the use of OERs within
the context of SDL are not only stated, but some solutions based on the
existing discourses on open education are also posed.

    Building on the importance of language within the open education sphere
in the South African context, Chapter 4 reports on multilingual philosophy
glossaries as OERs which can be regarded as steps towards socially just
pedagogical praxis. Within this chapter, the use of openly licensed multilingual
philosophy glossaries in classrooms is recommended as a way to promote
participatory parity in this field and, by implication, support student agency
and SDL. From this discussion, the authors explain how they created a glossary
within the field of philosophy and then translated the content into a number
of South African languages and then shared it. This chapter proposes the
creation of subject-specific glossaries to bridge the gap between the language
of instruction and the mother tongues of students. However, it is also noted
that translation exigencies be considered, and the authors argue for
accentedness, which relates to an ethical orientation to the translation that
counters homogenised representations and also questions the historicity of
certain abstract codes and master narratives.

Chapter 5 relates to the design of an OER as part of a technology-enhanced
practice environment developing the oral interactional competence of
beginner French language learners. The impetus for this OER, which in this
case involved the creation of open-source software, was the need to develop
oral communication skills in a foreign language, given that the average foreign
language learner would mostly function in a context with limited classroom
time and few speaking opportunities. To address this issue, a technology-
enhanced practice environment was developed, which would provide more
exposure to the target language and opportunities for students to foster self-
directedness in terms of their oral interactional competence. Furthermore, the
chapter describes the different phases involved in creating a contextualised
OER that is based on sound instructional design principles and OEPs.

    Chapter 6 focuses on the decolonisation of the journalism curriculum
through the co-creation of an OER textbook with students. In this chapter, it
is proposed that adapting and decolonising the curriculum can be achieved
by a process of SDL through which students participate in the creation of
their own learning material. Consequently, the students are actively involved
in deciding what they would like to learn. The chapter reports on an empirical
investigation of a project which involved the co-creation of an open educational
textbook by a lecturer and his students. From the chapter, it is clear that
fostering SDL as part of an OEP project to create learning material can play a
significant role towards student agency and decolonising the curriculum.

    Chapter 7 relates to OERs as student-generated stories and specifically
reports on the Singing Feelings project. In this project, which was also part of
the NWU OER Fellowship, students were encouraged to create open
educational music resources (OEMRs) that focus on socio-emotional learning
(SEL) for an online platform, singingfeelings.com. This chapter also involves a
qualitative narrative inquiry aimed at exploring the students' learning
experiences within this project. Central themes derived from this inquiry
include challenges, creativity, feelings and emotions, and value. It is proposed
in this chapter that through the students' personal stories, meaningful learning
experiences could be designed. This has the potential to increase awareness
of the value of OERs and also promote innovative opportunities to create
OEMRs and thereby support student agency in this context.

    Chapter 8 also focuses on student-created OERs as this chapter examines
second-year health and social care students' perceptions of engaging with
and developing OERs as part of an interprofessional collaborative learning
opportunity. The study aimed to gain a deeper understanding of the use of
OEPs within a collaborative learning environment and explore students'
perceptions of OEPs in a second-year module. This study confirms that OEPs
provide opportunities to apply knowledge and foster active cooperation and
collaboration in group settings as a way of learning. The participants also

                                                                                                                                       xxxvii
Preface

valued the opportunity to actively engage in the co-creation of knowledge as
OERs and apply this knowledge to empower themselves and others.
Furthermore, the learning gains observed included the development of
transferable skills, self-directedness and higher-order thinking skills. However,
some challenges were also identified that could inform future similar OEP
interventions.

    Chapter 9 covers the development of an OER as a tool to create awareness
of infectious diseases. This OER addresses the gap between information and
understanding in terms of the human immunodeficiency virus and acquired
immunodeficiency syndrome (HIV and AIDS) and tuberculosis (TB), and most
recently, the ongoing waves coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic.
For this NWU OER Fellows project, an OER was created to allow participants
to educate themselves on the identified subject matter. This chapter involves
a discussion of infectious diseases and the tools previously used to create
awareness around the subject matter. Furthermore, the concept of and the
role that OERs, specifically open education games (OEGs), can play in creating
awareness is also covered. In addition, this chapter provides an overview of
the creation, application and success of the pilot version of the developed
OER.

    This book concludes with Chapter 10, which explores how decolonial
practices can assist with researching OERs and developing open legal
pedagogies from a South African perspective. Within this context, this chapter
deals with epistemic injustice as being central to the idea of decolonising the
curriculum. In this process, epistemic justice and access to open legal education
are discussed. However, the main aim of the chapter is to advance a framework
for an inclusive educational learning environment using a decolonial approach
within the context of OERs and OEPs. Furthermore, the chapter also
approaches OERs in terms of teaching and student agency within a South
African university. The chapter concludes with a discussion of OERs as tools
for social justice and how they can be used to develop open legal resources
and pedagogy.

    The book's contribution to the scholarship of open education and SDL is
clear from the chapters. The unique needs regarding OERs and OEPs in terms
of language, localisation, contextualisation and decolonisation are also
apparent. This mix of conceptual and empirical research presents a coherent
picture of the opportunities and challenges for open education not only at a
selected South African university but also in the country and the wider Global
South. Moreover, these chapters provide recommendations for further
supporting student agency and SDL in using OERs for OEPs.

  Abstract

Despite increased interest in open education worldwide, not all institutions
have seen widespread uptake of open educational resources (OERs). To address
this issue, higher education institutions (HEIs) worldwide have established
initiatives to support the development and use of OERs. This chapter provides
the context for the rest of the book by discussing such an initiative at a South

African university; it was decided to establish a fellowship programme based on
self-directed learning principles to empower lecturers in order to adapt or
create OERs for their classrooms. This research involved the collection of
qualitative data based on reflections by the OER fellows who were part of the
programme. The research provides insight into the overall process of envisioning,
designing and executing the fellowship. The opportunities and challenges
during the process are discussed from the viewpoint of different stakeholders,
with a special focus on aspects of self-directedness.

  Introduction

The use of OERs is expanding globally as a result of advocacy for its use by
international organisations and a need for openness and flexibility in terms of
learning resources. Furthermore, the importance of OERs within the African
(Tlili et al. 2022) and South African (Olivier 2021) contexts is also clear. In this
context, UNESCO (2019) is advocating for the wider use of OERs in its
Recommendation on Open Educational Resources. In this recommendation,
OERs defined by UNESCO (2019) are:

    [...] learning, teaching and research materials in any format and medium that
    reside in the public domain or are under copyright that have been released under
    an open license, that permit no-cost access, re-use, re-purpose, adaptation and
    redistribution by others. (p. 5)

This is also the working definition for OERs within this chapter and the rest of
the book. Many different types of artefacts can be considered as OERs. For
example, Picciano (2019:150) lists `materials such as textbooks, reading
material (e.g. case studies), simulations, games, tests, quizzes, assessment
tools, presentations (e.g. PowerPoint), and multimedia'.

    The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has highlighted the need
for OERs as a cost-effective alternative to address existing and wide digital
divides. Importantly, OERs alone may not be sufficient for effective learning, and
their use needs to be supported by appropriate pedagogical and assessment
strategies. Consequently, UNESCO (2019) also emphasises this aspect in stating:

    [...] the judicious application of OER, in combination with appropriate pedagogical
    methodologies, well-designed learning objects and the diversity of learning
    activities, can provide a broader range of innovative pedagogical options to engage
    both educators and learners to become more active participants in educational
    processes and creators of content as members of diverse and inclusive knowledge
    societies. (p. 5)

There are many reasons to embrace OERs within higher education (HE), and
within this context, it is important to take note of the following statement by
UNESCO (2019):

    [...] the application of open licenses to educational materials introduces significant
    opportunities for more cost-effective creation, access, re-use, re-purpose,

                                                                                                                                  Chapter 1

    adaptation, redistribution, curation, and quality assurance of those materials,
    including, but not limited to translation, adaptation to different learning and
    cultural contexts, development of gender-sensitive materials, and the creation of
    alternative and accessible formats of materials for learners with special educational
    needs. (p. 5)

Towards addressing this need for appropriate pedagogical methodologies,
this project proposed fostering self-directed learning (SDL) within the wider
context of promoting OERs among university lecturers.

    The concept of self-directed open educational practices (OEPs) is proposed
by Olivier (2020a), and the relevance of SDL for OEP is clear from the scholarship
in this field (Morgan 2016; Olivier 2020b). The importance of SDL is especially
evident in online environments, in which OERs are often used. In this context,
Lasfeto and Ulfa (2020:35) state that `[t]he level of SDL readiness in using
online technology is very significant to reach academic success'. De los Arcos
et al. (2016:24) also highlight that `OER foster independent and personalised
learning by engaging students in choosing what they learn and how they learn,
and teachers in customising content to learner needs'.

    The use of OER in the learning context relates to the wider concept of OEPs.
Wolfenden and Adinolfi (2019:327) define OEPs as a `wide range of individual
and collective practices inherent in conceptualising, creating, adapting, curating
and sharing OER'. In this regard, this project explores the use of OEPs at the
university level in terms of engagement with OERs by lecturers through both
training and capacity building through an initiative called the North-West
University OER Fellowship. Central to this intervention was fostering SDL in
terms of OEPs. Within this context, this research was driven by the following
research question: How can lecturers become self-directed in their use of OERs
and embracing of OEPs within the context of an institutional fellowship initiative?

   Conceptual framework

Social constructivism underpins the activities within the NWU OER Fellowship.
Collis and Moonen (2009:328) acknowledge that within constructivism, a
need exists for `active construction of meaning by the learner for learning to
occur', while this also relates to `active learning, goal setting and self direction
[sic], authentic learning' and collaboration. Similarly, Mentz et al. (2018:171-
172) aver that `[t]hrough social construction of knowledge, meaning should
thus emerge for active participants'. In the context of SDL, students take an
active role (Van der Walt 2016) in the learning and knowledge construction
process. The concept of communal constructivism is based on constructivist
and social constructivist learning theories. According to Holmes et al. (2001),
communal constructivism involves:

    [...] an approach to learning in which students not only construct their own
    knowledge (constructivism) as a result of interacting with their environment (social

                                                                                                                                              3

    constructivism), but are also actively engaged in the process of constructing
    knowledge for their learning community. (p. 1; [emphasis in the original])

From a renewable assessment view, this approach involves that `each
member of the community learns with and from each other as well as
contributing resources to the learning community' (Rothkrantz 2016:2).

   Open educational resources and open educational
   practices

Central to the fellowship was using OERs for OEPs. Building on the definitions
stated in the Introduction to this chapter, it is also essential to consider the
5Rs+2Rs that determine the parameters of what can be done with OERs. The
5R permissions are specifically relevant for open pedagogy as, according to
Wiley and Hilton (2018:135), open pedagogy relates to a `the set of teaching
and learning practices that are only possible or practical in the context of the
5R permissions which are characteristic of OER'. The 5Rs specifically include
the following as noted by Wiley and Hilton (2018:134-145):

·· Retain: The right to make, own, and control copies of the content (e.g.
    download, duplicate, store, and manage).

·· Re-use: The right to use the content in a wide range of ways (e.g. in a class,
    in a study group, on a website, in a video).

·· Revise: The right to adapt, adjust, modify, or alter the content itself (e.g.
    translate the content into another language).

·· Remix: The right to combine the original or revised content with other
    material to create something new (e.g. incorporate the content into a
    mashup).

·· Redistribute: The right to share copies of the original content, your revisions,
    or your remixes with others (e.g. give a copy of the content to a friend).

These permissions or characteristics have since been used in various
publications and even embraced within the Creative Commons licensing
framework. In this regard, Creative Commons licences provide `everyone from
individual creators to large institutions a standardised way to grant the public
permission to use their creative work under copyright law' (Creative Commons
2022). Since the initial publication of the original 5Rs, there have been a
number of attempts to add to this list. The sixth R, Recontextualize, proposed
by Olivier (2020a), is:

    Recontextualize - the right to append, adapt or modify content to be relevant
    to a specific learning context while considering existing biases and hegemony of
    knowledge from the West and the Global North. (p. 23)

In addition to this characteristic, Liberty et al. (2021) also proposed adding
Recognition as a seventh R. These permissions or characteristics are relevant
not only for open pedagogy but also for OEPs.

The affordances of OEPs are clear from the literature, as Hilton (2019) found
in an overview of studies in which the efficacy and perceptions around OERs
and commercial textbooks (CT) were explored:

    (1) more than 95% of published research indicates OER does not lead to lower
    student learning outcomes, and (2) the vast majority of students and faculty who
    have used both OER and CT believe OER are of equal or higher quality. (p. 21)

One way of involving students in the OEP process is the use of renewable
assessments, sometimes called renewable assignments in the literature. In this
regard, Wiley and Hilton (2018:137) define renewable assignments as
`assignments which both support an individual student's learning and result in
new or improved open educational resources that provide a lasting benefit to
the broader community of learners'.

    One way of exploring the impact of OERs is the Cost, Outcomes, Usage
and Perceptions (COUP) Framework. According to the Open Education Group
(2022), this framework is an `approach to studying the impact of open
educational resources (like open-access textbooks) and open pedagogy in
secondary and post-secondary education'. Within this context, Clinton (2019)
has used the COUP Framework to explore the nature of OERs available for
psychology. It is significant that in this study, Clinton (2019:16) found that
OERs `offer comparable quality and learning opportunities at a much lower
financial cost than commercial materials'.

    The use of OERs has the potential to support student engagement through
student-centred open pedagogy (cf. Olivier 2021). A possible practical
approach in this regard is the Framework for Practices with OERs and student-
centred open pedagogy towards demiurgic decolonisation (cf. Chapter 6 and
Chapter 10) of teacher education, as proposed by Olivier (2021).

   Self-directed learning and learner agency

For the purposes of this chapter and the rest of the book, the concept of SDL
is defined as (Knowles 1975):

    [...] a process in which individuals take the initiative, with or without the help of
    others, in diagnosing their learning needs, formulating learning goals, identifying
    human and material resources for learning, choosing and implementing appropriate
    learning strategies and evaluating learning outcomes. (p. 18)

Learning requires a measure of confidence in one's actions and the outcomes
of those actions (Du Toit-Brits 2020; Mercer 2012; eds. Metcalfe & Terrace
2013). Students may become active participants in their own education
rather than passive recipients (Bandura 2006:164-180). While teachers
largely agree that allowing students some degree of autonomy increases
their motivation and learning results, they also acknowledge that there are
limitations to this autonomy. As both the freedom to make choices and the
scaffolding to restrict those choices are recognised, it is vital, yet nuanced,

                                                                                                                                              5
Open educational practices for self-directed learning: A staff fellowship as a case study

to design to encourage successful learner agency (Xie et al. 2020). This is
particularly true in SDL environments, such as online courses and educational
games, where developers craft the whole instructional experience, and no
real instructor is present to help. Learning environments and learners are
both involved in this phenomenon, in which the behaviours desired by
learners are among those that learners can actually perform (Wardrip-Fruin
et al. 2009). Students should have the ability to make educated decisions
that promote their engagement, motivation and learning if they are given
the opportunity to do so. Learners' SDL may appear in a variety of ways.
They may decide that an activity is too simple and go on to something more
challenging, or they may realise that they are still unclear about certain
concepts and go back to review previous lessons. When a learner sets out to
do something, they take whatever activity is available and then reflect on
the outcome (Xie et al. 2020).

    However, not all aspects of SDL environments promote learner agency in a
positive manner. In order to exercise agency, students must first believe they
have the capacity to do so (Corbalan, Kester & Van Merriënboer 2009; Mercer
2012). The structure of the learning environment has a direct influence on the
agency of learners. Designers can influence student behaviour in an indirect
(Schell 2008) manner. Using these aspects of indirect control, students may
unintentionally pursue the same routes without benefiting from them, so
restricting their own agency. An SDL experience must be adequately scaffolded
in order to encourage learners to take control of their own learning and to
make informed decisions (Xie et al. 2020).

    Agency in SDL settings was previously studied in terms of how much or
how little it affects learning. A study of Crystal Island (Rowe et al. 2011) - a
self-directed instructional game in which players are in charge of their own
activities - revealed that participants learned more from the game when they
had fewer alternatives to choose from than they did in a high-agency condition
(Sawyer et al. 2017; Taub et al. 2020).

    Prior research, on the other hand, has demonstrated that having too much
agency may be negative (Atkinson 1972). According to Chen, Mitrovic and
Mathews (2019), in a high-agency situation (in which learners may select their
own preparatory activities), learners with higher previous knowledge
demonstrated equally wasteful behaviour, including guessing. Using these
data, we may conclude that designing for agency entails finding a `sweet spot'
that delivers the advantages of choice while avoiding learners being
overwhelmed (Chen et al. 2019).

    Previous studies on SDL have examined various degrees of agency and
distinct features of agency in learning (Chen et al. 2019; Long & Aleven 2013,
2014; Roll et al. 2014); however, they have not investigated diverse degrees of

6
                                                                                                                                  Chapter 1

information to develop agency together. Giving learners the option of what to
do next and providing them with knowledge about the dangers and possibilities
associated with those decisions makes a substantial difference (Xie et al.
2020).

    Prior theoretical work refers to this as proximal action-related information
(eds. Metcalfe & Terrace 2013), and it aims to assist learners in determining
their capacity to act (e.g. by means of checkboxes that show incomplete
practice); their current ability (e.g. using skill bars to indicate estimated
knowledge (Hosseini et al. 2015) and badges reflecting accomplishments); as
well as the predicted outcome of taking a specific action (e.g. an adaptive
recommendation pertaining to a specific practice question). Such an approach
outlines how information may be provided by systems, but past work gives
little design direction on the consequences of increasing degrees of action-
related knowledge on agency.

  Methodology

Educational research needs to be done `in a lifelike way', and several in-depth
procedures are required, as a variety of variables can influence the outcome
of identified interventions (Middleton et al. 2008:29). A pragmatic paradigm
is therefore applied to focus on the research problem and to use the most
appropriate methods to answer the research questions (Creswell 2014:10-11).
The research design and orientation, population and sampling, as well as the
data collection and data analysis strategies used for this research are unpacked
under Research design and orientation.

   Research design and orientation

To collect data for the qualitative component of the research, the researchers
employed a case study as an inquiry approach. A case study is an in-depth
examination of a bounded system or a case across time that employs numerous
sources of data obtained in the environment (Merriam 2009). The case might
be a programme, an event, an activity or a group of people who are constrained
in time and space, and it entails an intense and thorough description and
analysis of data in connection to the case (Merriam 2009). In this chapter, all
the participants formed part of a unique group of fellows who participated in
the NWU OER Fellowship.

   Population and sampling

This research involved non-probability sampling by means of convenience
sampling. Non-probability sampling pertains to a sampling technique through
which samples are obtained in a process that does not provide an open

                                                                                                                                              7

opportunity to all possible individuals in a population but rather a specific
selection (Cohen, Manion & Morrison 2018).

    Purposive sampling refers to selecting participants for a specific purpose
(Cohen et al. 2018). In the case of this study, the researchers purposively
focused on the lecturers involved in the OER Fellowship. The sample could
also be considered as being convenient, as the participants were located in
the same institution where the researchers worked. The researchers, therefore,
had easy access to the participants.

    The lecturers included in this study involve individuals creating or adapting
OERs for use in classrooms or applying renewable assessment practices using
OEPs. This group included any university lecturer, including those participating
in the NWU OER Fellows, who met the inclusion criteria relating to OER use
and OEPs, willing to take part and provide informed consent to be included in
this research.

   Data collection and data analysis

Qualitative data were collected from lecturers creating or adapting OERs
towards OEPs that foster SDL as part of the NWU OER Fellowship. In this
regard, lecturers' perceptions around OEPs and SDL were explored through
open-ended questionnaires (see Appendix 1 at the end of this chapter). The
data analysis of this project involved inductive qualitative data analysis
(Creswell & Creswell 2018:33) of the created open-ended questionnaires.
This process involved identifying codes and then deriving sub-categories
and themes.

    To ensure the trustworthiness of the data analysis, the authors considered
credibility, transferability, dependability and confirmability (Lincoln & Guba
1986). The credibility of the analysis was ensured through the prolonged
engagement of the researchers within the fellowship initiative and the
participants, as well as cross-checking the recorded researcher reflections
and requested participant inputs through open-ended questionnaires.
Transferability was addressed through thick, descriptive data used as the
basis for this chapter. Dependability and confirmability were handled by
means of establishing an audit trail (Lincoln & Guba 1986).

    Ethical conduct and adherence to national and institution-specific ethical
policies were ensured throughout the research. Ethical clearance and
gatekeeper permission from the institution were obtained prior to the
commencement of the research. Participation was voluntary, and only
lecturers willing to participate and provide written informed consent were
included in this study.

   Overview of the North-West University open educational
   resource fellowship

The NWU OERs Fellowship was an opportunity for interested university staff
to create and `include new openly licensed online resources in their classes or
adapt their resources to their students' specific contexts to receive support
and funding for creating or adapting open learning content as well as
researching the process' (NWU 2022).

This 18-month fellowship involved the following (NWU 2022):

    A grant of ZAR40000 for OER development (adaptation, text editing and
research expenses) for individuals or groups working on a project:

·· Funds for online conference attendance and presentation (ZAR7000).
·· Opportunities to attend workshops on OERs, open licensing and open

    pedagogy.
·· Support to create or adapt OERs such as open textbooks, online tutorials,

    wikibooks or combinations of open learning objects.
·· Support and workshops on how to research OERs and write up the research.
·· Writing a book chapter on the process or evaluation of the use of the OER.

The fellows committed themselves to (1) following the training as set out for
this fellowship; (2) completing an OER for the selected module(s); (3)
conducting research; and (4) making the OER available under a Creative
Commons License. The workshops and seminars which formed part of the
fellowship included presentations by international and South African experts
on open pedagogy, open practices and social justice, open licensing, research
OERs and OEPs, ubuntu, student advocacy and professional development,
open textbooks, open-source authoring tools, OERs and quality frameworks,
as well as researching OERs using the cost, outcomes, use, perceptions and
engagement (COUPE) framework.

  Results and discussion

From the inductive qualitative analysis of the open-ended questionnaire
responses, certain codes and themes were derived. The identified verbatim
quotations are discussed in this section in terms of the identified themes and
codes. The identifiers used for the quotations below note the participant
number, question number and date the responses were received.

    It was quite significant that the OERs created within this fellowship involved
different formats and interfaces. In this regard, the OERs involved open
textbooks, interactive text and visual content, a glossary, music and software.

                                                                                                                                              9
Open educational practices for self-directed learning: A staff fellowship as a case study

Some of the OERs had direct student involvement, while others were mainly
lecturer-driven.

   Theme 1: Self-directedness in terms of open educational
   resources and open educational practices

It was evident that the participants took charge and responsibility for
becoming knowledgeable about and skilled in using OERs for OEPs.

   Setting goals
The responses show how participants set their own unique goals in the process
of becoming self-directed in terms of OERs for OEPs. The responses below
show evidence of this process:

    `My goal was fairly simple - I simply wanted to create a multilingual glossary in
    four languages. I have already achieved this goal. I therefore hope to elaborate
    on this goal in 2022 by adding more languages to the glossary.' (P1, Q2, 13
    December 2021)
    `My first goal was to create the first draft of my textbook by mid-2021, so that I
    could use the textbook in my teaching in the second semester of 2021. This was
    essential, because I set assessments where students had to edit the textbook,
    provide feedback and suggest new content.' (P3, Q2, 17 January 2022)
Many of the goals set within the fellowship were driven by specific problems,
such as creating an open textbook for a specific group (P3) or addressing a
wider gap in knowledge within the community (P7).

   Independent resource finding, identification and use
Apart from some content and learning opportunities provided as part of the
NWU OER Fellowship, participants were also encouraged to explore OERs
specific to their disciplines and needs. From the participants' responses, this
independent process is also clear:

    `I also gained more knowledge through simply creating my OER - a few google
    searches here and there to solve my own problems helped with creating an
    understanding of OERs.' (P1, Q1, 13 December 2021)
    `OER was a completely new term for me. The more I researched the field, the more
    interested I became.' (P2, Q11, 12 January 2022)
    `I also read some research as part of my chapter work, which provided further
    insight.' (P3, Q1, 17 January 2022)
From these quotations, participant-driven engagement in terms of extending
knowledge and skills regarding OERs and OEPs was evident.

   Peer interaction

Even though greater collaboration across projects could have been supported,
such interactions were perceived as being positive, as was noted by the
participants in the following quotations:

    `It was also very interesting to listen to some of the ideas of other fellows - these
    presentations gave me some new ideas that I will continue to explore in future.' (P3,
    Q9, 17 January 2022)
    `I learned so much from the individuals that shared their knowledge.' (P6, Q9, 16
    March 2022)

In addition, some of the fellows (e.g. participant 2) also noted how they
completed additional online courses on OERs and also went through OER-
related research.

   Theme 2: Strategies employed towards self-direction
   with open educational resources and open educational
   practices

    Value of workshops and seminars

From the analysis, the value of the structured series of online workshops and
seminars was evident, as is noted in the following quotations:

    `I have gained more knowledge through the workshops, and also through one-on-
    one conversations [...]. While the workshops provided more theoretical perspectives,
    the consultations with [...] solved practical problems.' (P1, Q1, 13 December 2021)
    `I attended most of the OER workshops presented as part of the fellowship. These
    workshops covered a very wide range of topics and gave me much deeper insight
    into OERs, particularly the way open license work.' (P3, Q1, 17 January 2022)

The value of this approach with some structured activities where experts
shared their knowledge on aspects of OERs and OEPs was clear.

   Theme 3: The fellowship as the prompt for open
   educational resources for open educational practices

    T he fellowship acted as motivation to embrace open educational
    resources

From the data, it was understood that some of the participants would not
have used or even known about OERs were it not for the fellowship.

    `Without the fellowship, I doubt I would have even given creating an OER any
    attention this year.' (P1, Q8, 13 December 2021)
    `The fellowship gave me the confidence to really explore OERs, to discuss OERs
    with my colleagues more, to develop and adapt OERs more. The fellowship really
    gave me the confidence to actually use OERs well.' (P3, Q8, 17 January 2022)

                                                                                                                                              11
Open educational practices for self-directed learning: A staff fellowship as a case study

Through the mentoring and support process of the fellowship initiative, it is
clear that the fellows were motivated and became more self-directed in terms
of their own engagement with OERs.

    Furthermore, the combination of information-sharing, project-specific
support and financial incentive proved to be valuable in getting lecturers to
embrace OERs.

   Theme 4: Open educational practices creating
   opportunities for student agency

By using OERs through OEPs, students may also have the opportunity to
make a contribution to learning content. Previous research has shown how
students often consider that they have very limited opportunities to contribute
to or influence the content used in HE (Olivier 2020c). Within the wider NWU
OER Fellows initiative, student agency was evident in the projects where
students contributed to the creation of OERs.

    From student participation to student agency

    `Students were offered the opportunity to be co-creators. I achieved the
    goal and used the textbook as a prescribed work. Students completed all
    assessments and provided much feedback and very interesting inputs.' (P3, Q2,
    17 January 2022)
    `[The students] provided me with many new ideas. By just reading their
    comments and inputs I also gained some really deep insight into their thinking
    and their ideas of what journalism is and what it should be. I think students
    really appreciated the chance they were given to voice their opinions.' (P3, Q7,
    17 January 2022)
    `Having an opportunity to hear our students' voices really provided a lot of insight.'
    (P6, Q4, 16 March 2022)

Student-generated OERs are well documented in the literature and are often
associated with renewable assessments (Wiley & Hilton 2018). However, even
if the content is not re-used for learning purposes, the affordances of such
student involvement are evident.

    Student involvement challenging the status quo

    `[The fellowship] opened my eyes to a new world and my students were also
    challenged to think outside the box.' (P2, Q8, 12 January 2022)
    `In my view, it has changed how my students view education and their role when it
    comes to the sharing of knowledge. I want to link it to developing a sense of social
    responsiveness. In our module, students are developing as health professionals and
    they especially mentioned that they can draw from and develop OERs to empower
    others.' (P6, Q7, 16 March 2022)

Interestingly, implementing OEPs in some cases meant a total rethinking of
traditional roles and processes within the classroom.

   Theme 5: Affordances of open education

    P ossibilities around open educational resource localisation of
    content
The importance of localisation of OERs within the South African context is
evident from the literature (Olivier 2020a), and aspects of localisation were
also found in the responses from the participants:

    `[S]tudents participated in creating the textbook, because they were offered the
    chance to change and adapt content, they felt empowered.' (P3, Q7, 17 January 2022)
    `The fact that OERs can be adapted is also very valuable - it means the textbook is
    really relevant and up to date. In journalism there simply are no completely current
    textbooks, but an OER can be current and highly relevant to current circumstances.'
    (P3, Q7, 17 January 2022)
    `The OER we are creating allows us to tailor make content for our beginner students.
    We are free to choose the content and we can integrate the technology-based learning
    activities within the broader context of our modules.' (P4, Q7, 24 February 2022)

These quotations show the importance of it being possible to adapt OERs,
but also the value of keeping content up to date.

    P ossibilities around open educational resource
    localisation of language
The issue of language was addressed by some of the projects, and particularly
the possibilities of sharing content multilingually seemed to be highly relevant.
In this regard, projects involved the translation of content into languages
other than English as well as the creation of a multilingual glossary as an OER.
The need for further translation of OERs was expressed by one of the
participants:

    `By the end of 2022, I hope to have it translated into all official languages, and if
    that is not feasible, then at least a few more than the four it is available in now.'
    (P1, Q4, 13 December 2021)

The relevance of increased translation (cf. Chapter 4) is also in line with the
needs expressed in the literature (Olivier 2020a).

    L ower costs as a social justice consideration
The lower costs of OERs were expressed as an important advantage. Within
this context, the following quotations illustrate the views of the participants:

    `The appeal of OERs to me is that it is free, apart from the cost of data, often. In a
    country like South Africa, this then fulfils a social justice mandate. #FeesMustFall

                                                                                                                                             13
Open educational practices for self-directed learning: A staff fellowship as a case study

    demonstrated the need for lower costs associated to tertiary education. Following
    from this, I simply think it is unconscionable to provide expensive resources to
    students, when these are often available freely on the internet anyway.' (P1, Q7, 13
    December 2021)

    `The greatest advantages of OERs are that they are free, and that they can be
    adapted. This means ALL my students have had access to their prescribed textbook
    for the first time ever in 2021. It is a fact of teaching that many students simply
    never buy the textbooks, and simply never read the textbooks, mostly for cost
    reasons. Now students received the textbook for free, and they all read it, because
    assignments involved editing certain chapters in the book.' (P3, Q1, 17 January 2022)

    `It opened up the possibly for other ways of teaching and learning. Because it is
    cost free, it can easily be tried and tested.' (P5, Q7, 3 March 2022)

    `In terms of developing our OER, the commercial route would have been limiting
    as the amount of content covered would have been guided by cost. Collaborating
    with individuals in the academic setting who understood our purpose, allowed for
    greater flexibility and a project that will likely birth several others.' (P7, Q7, 8 April
    2022)

This view is aligned with international literature and also confirms cost-savings
in using OERs (Clinton 2019; Walsh 2020). Furthermore, the importance of
OERs for social justice has been expressed widely (Tlili et al. 2022) and not
only in terms of cost-savings.

    Lecturer agency

From one of the participants, the value of lecturers taking charge of the
resources of their own classes was also expressed:

    `OER's [sic] may also be more academically inclined than commercial resources,
    because they were most likely developed by and for educators for the purpose of
    education.' (P5, Q7, 3 March 2022)

According to this participant, as the lecturers themselves are involved in
creating resources to be used in class, they can then adapt and focus the
resource on the specific needs of their students.

   Theme 6: Continuance of using open educational
   resources for open educational practices

The lecturers also indicated a future continuance of using OERs beyond the
project. They also indicated the implications of the use of OERs for the benefit
of students:

    `I would like to use and create OER with my students for a very long time.' (P2, Q12,
    12 January 2022)

    `I think I understand OERs well and I am able to find OERs quite easily. I use OERs
    regularly in my teaching - my own and others. I have not yet published an OER,
    but from what I can gather most repositories provide clear instructions and the

14
                                                                                                                                  Chapter 1

    process seems simple enough. I would, however, like to improve understanding and
    recognition of OERs among my colleagues, I think there is still a lot of scepticism.'
    (P3, Q1, 17 January 2022)

    `I believe my role as lecturer goes beyond the classroom and if I can get my students
    to search for, use, develop and share OERs as part of their learning, we are making a
    difference in our communities and that for me, is the purpose of higher education.'
    (P6, Q11, 16 March 2022)

From the participants' views, it is clear that the participants intend to continue
using OERs and implementing OEPs. Furthermore, it is clear that they see the
value in embracing OERs and also transferring the value of open practices to
their students.

  Discussion and findings

From the data analysis, a number of unique findings in terms of SDL, OERs
and OEPs were evident, specifically within the context of lecturer development
within a South African HE setting. There was clear evidence of self-directedness
in terms of OERs for OEPs amongst the participants, as they were able to set
goals around their individual or group needs. Participants were also quite
capable of finding resources individually, and there was even evidence of
groups achieving positive interdependence (Johnson & Johnson 2019) in their
collaboration in this context. The participants experienced the collaboration
within as well as across projects quite positively; however, more opportunities
for cross-project interactions could have been created.

    The workshops and seminars acted as useful starting points to inform and
prompt further engagement by the participants in terms of OERs for OEPs in
a self-directed manner. The value of expert inputs was also evident, and that
acted as a starting point for further exploration by participants outside of the
formal workshop or seminar context. To this end, participants regarded the
fellowship as a motivation to know more about OERs and even embraced this
for their classroom practice.

    As regards the students in the participants' classes, it was clear that OEPs
may act as a way to foster student agency, as OEPs created opportunities for
students to actively engage and have a voice in terms of classroom resources
and content. This led to a change in the current practices in classrooms and a
distinct move from mere participation to student agency.

    The value of OERs for learning and teaching was clear from the responses.
Firstly, the possibilities around localisation in terms of content and language
were prominent. In this regard, OERs provide a vehicle to adapt content to the
specific needs of specific groups of students and student communities.
Furthermore, the affordances of OERs for multilingualism (cf. Chapter 2) were
also confirmed, as is evident in the literature (Olivier 2020a). The cost
implications of using OERs were also highlighted by participants as being an

                                                                                                                                             15

important advantage. Finally, a sense of lecturer agency was also supported
by this specific self-directed approach to OERs for OEPs.

    Finally, it was also important to note that participants within this fellowship
indicated that they would continue embracing OERs and integrate OEPs into
their classrooms. In this regard, the fellowship reached its aim to form
champions for OERs who may promote good practices in this regard within
their subject groups and schools.

  Recommendations and limitations

From the discussion, a number of recommendations can be made for future
initiatives pertaining to using OERs and embracing OEPs, with specific
emphasis on fostering SDL and student agency. The recommendations are:

·· Incentivising the use of OERs and OEPs may act as a good motivator for
    lecturers.

·· The screening process for such programmes should also gauge existing
    skills and build in some individualisation.

·· Buy-in and support from institutional management are essential.
·· In most cases, it tends to be more appropriate if projects are done in

    groups.
·· Opportunities should be created not only for collaboration within groups

    but also across groups.
·· After initial structured workshops and webinars, participants may gain self-

    confidence to engage with OERs and OEPs in a more self-directed fashion.
·· Researching OERs and OEPs as part of the process is quite positive, but

    this implies varying needs and may result in research-focus conflicts.
·· Resource provision could be more structured and actively supported for

    participants.
·· Developing and adapting OERs may take longer than twelve months, and

    even that might not be enough time.

  Conclusion

At the start of this chapter, it was stated that this chapter aimed to explore
how lecturers could become self-directed in their use of OERs and embracing
of OEPs within the context of an institutional fellowship initiative. After an
overview of some key theoretical concepts around OERs, OEPs, SDL and
student agency, the empirical findings of qualitative research on the NWU
OER Fellowship initiative were discussed. In this regard, it was found that this
fellowship created ample opportunities for university lecturers to empower
themselves in terms of OERs and OEPs and infuse open pedagogy within their
classes. As is evidenced by the chapters that follow in this book, this fellowship

also opened up unique avenues for research for the fellows towards moving
from actively engaging with open education in their classes to also embracing
appropriate research practices.

  Abstract

The needs of a changing society and the looming Fourth Industrial Revolution
(4IR) have led to increased technology infusion into classrooms. However, this
digital education is driven by commercial entities and the hegemony of English
and content from the Global North. In order to ensure social justice and the
sustainability of digital education in highly multilingual and under-resourced
contexts, such as South Africa, alternative approaches need to be considered.
To this end, this conceptual chapter explores the affordances of localised self-
directed open educational practices (OEPs) to address the needs within

multilingual digital environments. Despite many initiatives around open
educational resources, there have been limited developments around open
educational practice, especially localisation. Based on the review of documents
and research, this chapter concludes with recommendations for policy changes
and some practical recommendations for localised self-directed open
educational practices that would be responsive to the country's needs and a
drive towards social justice.

  Introduction

This conceptual chapter explores the affordances of localised self-directed
OEPs towards multilingual digital education for social justice in South Africa
and contextualises this book on open educational resources (OERs) and self-
directed learning (SDL) within the South African context. Consequently, this
chapter provides a broad perspective within which the university staff - who
took part in the NWU OERs Fellowship (cf. ch. 1) - functions and also clarifies
the need for contextualised, localised and multilingual open content for social
justice.

    The unique context at the southernmost tip of the African continent is
generally regarded as being very multilingual, with eleven languages being
recognised as official languages. Mwaniki (2012) notes how social justice issues
are more manifest in this country as a result of its complex history in terms of
exclusion practices and inequities within, amongst others, the educational
context. Ultimately, for Mwaniki (2012), the issue of access links language with
social justice, specifically in the higher education (HE) sector. Localisation
allows content to be adapted in terms of content and language and contextualised
through collaboration between content experts and the wider community. In
addition, open education implies the re-use of existing content and allows for
the open licensing of initially created digital content appropriate and relevant
for students and their contexts. Within this context, it has been suggested that
there is a need for students to become self-directed in translanguaging
processes for OEPs (Olivier 2020a, 2021c). The term `translanguaging' implies,
according to Canagarajah (2011), the following assumptions:

    [F]or multilinguals, languages are part of a repertoire that is accessed for their
    communicative purposes; languages are not discrete and separated, but form an
    integrated system for them; multilingual competence emerges out of local practices
    where multiple languages are negotiated for communication; competence doesn't
    consist of separate competencies for each language, but a multicompetence that
    functions symbiotically for the different languages in one's repertoire; and, for
    these reasons, proficiency for multilinguals is focused on repertoire building. (p. 1)

Self-directedness in this context implies that, within an open multilingual
context (Knowles 1975), students:

    [...] take the initiative, with or without the help of others, in diagnosing their learning
    needs, formulating learning goals, identifying human and material resources for

    learning, choosing and implementing appropriate learning strategies and evaluating
    learning outcomes. (p. 18)

The advantages of multilingual content are evident from the literature, and
hence, this chapter favours an additive approach rather than a monolingual
approach to digital content. In this regard, students would benefit from
accessing original content in English and have the opportunity to draw on
content in their mother tongues and even contribute to creating suitable
content. For this chapter, the concept of harmonisation is also considered,
and this refers to a re-evaluation of prevailing formal borders between
languages.

    In this chapter, such access extends beyond mere opening up of access to
learning through the use of more languages and the empowerment of
students. Hence, the emphasis is on creating resources in students' languages
of preference while becoming self-directed through localised OEPs. The
central research question driving this chapter was: How can multilingual digital
education for social justice be achieved through localised self-directed OEPs
in South Africa?

  Contextualisation and concept clarification

The increase in the availability of new technologies has prompted the
importance of opening up access to education and resources (Ogange & Carr
2021) and such open access to resources is also essential for SDL, where
students should be able to select their own resources. A very important
realisation of such resources is OERs. Using OERs is highly relevant for a
context such as South Africa because of the need for affordable resources
that can be adapted to the unique educational context. In this chapter, this
aspect is regarded in terms of social justice which relates to Fraser's (2005:76)
concept of `participatory parity', which relates to both an outcome and a
process.

    The student-driven movement demanding a decolonised curriculum (Cox,
Masuku & Willmers 2020) also prompted additional impetus for a localised
curriculum and localised resources. Makalela (2018) details the broader
student protest movement in South Africa. Amongst other issues, the
decolonisation of the curriculum was demanded by students, and this
researcher explicitly highlights the important role language has to play in
the process. The important role of OERs for the decolonisation of the
curriculum (cf. Chapter 6 and Chapter 10) is evident from the literature (Olivier
2020a, 2021c). Amiel (2013) notes the divides between those who generally
develop and those who merely use OERs and the role of more prosperous
nations in terms of the bulk of resources being produced in the broader
context. In South Africa, as is the case in the rest of Africa (Mosweunyane
2013), colonial education supplanted many existing precolonial African

                                                                                                                                             21
Digital multilingualism for social justice through localised self-directed open education

educational practices, and this colonial approach did not value cultural
transmission. For this chapter, the concept of OERs is understood in terms of
how it is defined by UNESCO (2019) as being

    learning, teaching and research materials in any format and medium that reside
    in the public domain or are under the copyright that has been released under
    an open license, that permit no-cost access, re-use, re-purpose, adaptation and
    redistribution by others. (p. 3)

The relevance of OERs for localised teaching and learning, specifically in the
South African context, has been highlighted in the literature (Olivier 2020a,
2021c). However, the focus in this chapter is also specifically on the use of
OERs for the sake of learning, and hence the concept of OEPs is explored.
According to Cronin (2017), OEPs are

    collaborative practices that include the creation, use, and re-use of OER, as
    well as pedagogical practices employing participatory technologies and social
    networks for interaction, peer-learning, knowledge creation, and empowerment
    of learners. (p. 4)

The relevance of OERs, such as open textbooks and OEPs for social justice, is
also clear (Bali, Cronin & Jhangiani 2020; Cox et al. 2020; Hodgkinson-
Williams & Trotter 2018; Ogange & Carr 2021), and this emphasises the
importance of OERs for the context of this chapter and this book. For this
chapter, social justice relies on acknowledging issues around access to
education through the availability of resources, especially localised resources
and open practices supportive of SDL.

    Central to this chapter is localisation, which pertains to adapting both
language and content to make content (Wolfenden & Adinolfi 2019), in this
case, OERs, relevant to a specific context in terms of lingual, social,
geographical and other variables pertaining to the learning milieu. The need
for localisation is supported in this statement made by Amiel (2013:136) in
terms of remixing `[a]n often-ignored barrier to remix and revision is the
English-language and Western bias of the Internet and particularly OER'.
Consequently, the hegemony of English in education globally and in South
Africa drives the increased need for representation and the use of more
languages. Localisation should also be considered to address artefact-based
content in a multilingual context. The concept of translanguaging, which is
highly relevant to the process of localisation promoted in this chapter,
relates, according to García (2009:140), to an `act performed by bilinguals of
accessing different linguistic features or various modes of what are described
as autonomous languages, in order to maximise communicative potential'.
Here autonomous languages refer to the different languages that make up
the repertoire from which multilingual-speakers choose to draw in their
communication process. The relevance of translanguaging for social justice
is also clear from the literature as this is a means to address challenges in
this context (García & Leiva 2014). However, it is essential to note that merely

22
                                                                                                                                 Chapter 2

translating OERs might not be sufficient as, according to Hodgkinson-
Williams and Trotter (2018), localisation

    May change the linguistic interface through which students engage with this
    knowledge, it may not do much to alter the underlying frames of reference upon
    which that knowledge is built. (p. 214)

However, in the South African language context, there have also been some
attempts to expand on translanguaging, with much research being done on
translanguaging in South African schools (Sefotho & Makalela 2017) and
universities (Carstens 2016). The issue of translanguaging has also been raised
in terms of the use of OERs (Olivier 2020a). This is then also the focus of this
conceptual chapter as it engages with the affordances of self-directed
localised OEPs towards multilingual digital education for social justice in
South Africa. The self-directed aspect is central to the argument as it is
intertwined with the concept of student agency, as is shown throughout this
book, but also noted by Bali et al. (2020:1) as they regard that OEPs `consistently
focus on fostering learner activity and agency'. This approach underlies the
way in which social justice and multilingual education are approached in this
chapter.

   Social justice and multilingual education in a digital
   context

   Social justice and language

Social justice has been approached in terms of the role of language and
specifically through scholarship on linguistic justice. This issue in language-
related fields can relate to linguistic and cultural anthropological research
using ethnographic approaches or focusing on language economy and policy
(Barakos 2020). Furthermore, the issue of language is embedded in the role
of multicultural education and social justice. Despite the apparent links, it is
evident that these two concepts are regarded as distinct (Cho 2017).

    The concept of intersectionality is also pertinent to the HE sector in South
Africa. The term intersectionality refers to a `method and a disposition, a
heuristic and analytic tool' (Carbado et al. 2013:303) derived from the work by
Crenshaw (1989). In this regard, Rojo (2021:174) notes that `[l]inguistic
requirements become an example of intersectionality, where social and
economic differences are inseparable from linguistic ones, reinforcing the
social stratification of the academic field'. However, it is clear that issues
around language cannot merely be approached through a distribution or
redistribution view of social justice but rather a relational paradigm, as is the
case with multicultural education (Cho 2017). Despite the recognition of
language being a resource (Delavan, Valdez & Freire 2017; Wright 2002), it is
essentially a social phenomenon (Cooper & Cooper 1989; Fishman 2019;
Kovacevic, Spetic & Pleslic 2018), and its use is determined through relationships

                                                                                                                                            23
Digital multilingualism for social justice through localised self-directed open education

and societal structures. Within these structures, there is a need for students to
have agency and become self-directed in negotiating their lingual context.

    However, this chapter focuses specifically on language within the complex
South African context.

   Multilingual higher education context in South Africa

Before interrogating the role of language in terms of social justice, it is essential
to get a sense of the broader language context within South African HE. In the
scholarship on language in education, there is general support for mother-
tongue instruction and the promotion of multilingualism. Notably, there has
also been a trend to move away (García & Leiva 2014):

    From studying language as a monolithic construct made up of discrete sets of skills
    to a conceptualisation of language as a series of social practices and actions that
    are embedded in a web of social relations. (p. 201)

As noted earlier, this chapter approaches languages from the point of view of
integrational linguistics, which in terms of translanguaging, involves rejecting
`language as a discrete, bounded, autonomous, and abstract object that can
be named and counted, as posited by canonical, mainstream sociolinguistic
theory' (Chaka 2020:8).

    The Constitution of the Republic of South Africa, hereafter the Constitution,
recognises eleven languages as being the republic's official languages while
explicitly acknowledging the historical reduced use and status of indigenous
languages and committing the state to promote such languages (Republic of
South Africa 1996). The eleven languages include English, which is prominent
as the lingua franca and perceived language of social mobility. Afrikaans,
which historically had a high status because of its support by the apartheid
governments before 1994 and then nine indigenous languages: siSwati,
isiNdebele, isiXhosa and isiZulu make up the Nguni language group; the Sotho
group of languages includes Sepedi (also more neutrally known and Sesotho
sa Leboa or Northern Sotho), Sesotho and Setswana; as well as Tshivenda and
Xitsonga. Despite the mentioned languages being grouped as indigenous
languages in this chapter, it is essential to note that they are considered
independent and functional languages in their own right. The grouping is not
intended as an act of de-naming or othering.

    Furthermore, recognition and status between these languages vary
according to the number of speakers and geographical location. However,
they are considered together in terms of wider national recognition and
overall trends. In a discussion on language and social justice, it is necessary
to consider that one can regard `language as social action that operates to
reduce social justice but can equally be used to create more equitable
societies' (Barakos 2020:271). Furthermore, languages are viewed in this

                                                                                                                                 Chapter 2

chapter not as separate compartmentalisable units but rather as social
constructions on a dynamic continuum and within the context of integrational
linguistics (Chaka 2020).

    Social justice has implications for education as it is becoming increasingly
relevant to the educational context, even leading to the establishment of
social justice pedagogy (Cho 2017). When it comes to education, the
Constitution (Republic of South Africa 1996) clearly states that `[e]veryone
has the right to receive education in the official language or languages of their
choice in public higher education institutions (HEIs) where that education is
reasonably practicable'. English and monolingual approaches dominate HE in
South Africa despite constitutional and policy requirements (Makalela 2018),
with a continued diminishing role of Afrikaans as a language of learning and
teaching. There have been many symbolic attempts to recognise African
languages in university policies, the national minister for the Department of
Higher Education and Training (DHET) has also even expressed support for
the promotion of indigenous languages in the higher sector, and universities
have even tried to make introductory courses for specific indigenous languages
compulsory (Olivier 2014a, 2014b).

    In terms of the power dynamics of language in HE in South Africa, despite
the Constitution recognising eleven official languages, the dynamic has shifted
from mainly using only two official languages in HE to using only one language,
English, with diminished use of Afrikaans and only symbolic recognition of
other indigenous languages (Olivier 2014a; Wright 2002).

    Multilingualism in classrooms is regarded as a common reality worldwide
(García & Leiva 2014) and in South Africa (Carstens 2016). However, Duchêne
(2020) is critical of the general discourses on multilingualism that do not
address power relations and social conditions. According to Duchêne
(2020:93), `multilingualism is not neutral, but rather intrinsically embedded in
social processes that inform who and what counts as a legitimate speaker,
language, and practice'. Furthermore, the notion `that acknowledgement of
linguistic diversity will foster social progress' is also critically interrogated
(Duchêne 2020:94). Consequently, the benefit of mere recognition of
multilingualism might not be sufficient and proactive and practical efforts in
the education context - as will be expanded upon towards the end of this
chapter - might be necessary.

    Like many other countries, South Africa has seen many initiatives from the
government and society to promote multilingualism and, specifically,
indigenous languages (Carstens 2016). However, Smagulova (2021) states
that language policy and management through ritualistic and symbolic
gestures may not lead to language reforms. Similarly, as Smagulova observed
in post-Soviet Kazakhstan, in South Africa, constitutional recognition of
indigenous languages has been relatively symbolic.

                                                                                                                                            25
Digital multilingualism for social justice through localised self-directed open education

   Literacies as and for social justice

An important aspect regarding social justice and language, and in the context
of this chapter, as regards localisation, is the issue of literacies. This chapter
should be considered within a context where the concept of literacy has been
extended to a myriad of different literacies, either attempting to encompass a
range of sub-literacies or being shaped to address a specific need. Broadly,
the movement around multiliteracies, as was conceptualised by the New
London Group in the 1990s, is relevant to this discussion as this pertains to
`the importance of multiple modalities in meaning-making as well as the value
and necessity of diversity in representations and meaning-making' (Serafini &
Gee 2017:3). The digital environment and specifically the use of OERs and
related OEP require certain digital literacies for use, adaptation and creation.
However, because of limitations in access and challenges around infrastructure,
teachers and students may lack appropriate digital literacies in the South
African context (Hodgkinson-Williams & Trotter 2018).

    This concept of multiliteracies shows specific affordances in terms of open
education (Olivier 2019). A further extension of literacy is the approach of
metaliteracy. Metaliteracy has developed from acting as a form of literacy to a
broader pedagogical framework. In the context of this chapter, metaliteracy is
also relevant as it `promotes critical thinking and collaboration in a digital age,
providing a comprehensive framework to effectively participate in social
media and online communities', and it is considered as `a unified construct
that supports the acquisition, production, and sharing of knowledge in
collaborative online communities' (Mackey & Jacobson 2011:62). Importantly,
from a social justice point of view, it is essential to take note of how metaliteracy
puts the student in the centre of the learning and critically supports student
content creation (O'Brien et al. 2017).

    North (2016) distinguishes between five types of different social justice
literacies. This includes functional, critical, relational, democratic, and visionary
literacy. Aspects of these literacies can be infused in OEP. As North (2016)
notes, these competencies are required to excel academically and `effect
positive change at local and more global levels'. The five types of social justice
literacies are briefly considered in terms of the focus of this chapter.

    There seems to be a tension between functional literacy, which relates to
functioning independently in terms of language ability, and critical literacy,
which challenges prevailing knowledge paradigms (Cho 2017). Critical literacy
is traced back to the work of Paulo Freire. This literacy is regarded as `an
overtly political orientation to teaching and learning and to the cultural,
ideological, and sociolinguistic content of the curriculum', which also focuses
explicitly on `uses of literacy for social justice in marginalised and
disenfranchised communities' (Luke 2012:5). Within this context, literacy in
itself becomes integral to attempts to address social justice issues.

In moving towards developing visionary literacy, localised OEPs must allow
for the development of students' own stories and recognise them as key
contributors to the open resource content in a self-directed manner.

   Open educational resources and localised self-
   directed open educational practices
   Open educational resources and self-directed open
   educational practices

An essential benefit of OERs is that they can be adapted and localised to be
aligned with the language and content needs of a specific learning context.
These needs extend to the student and are also relevant for SDL within an
open context (cf. Chapter 3). As stated at the start of the chapter, OERs can
be used as a learning tool in themselves through OEPs. The opportunities for
increased access and making learning culturally relevant are important reasons
for using OERs and the movement around the resources (Hodgkinson-
Williams & Trotter 2018). In terms of open education in South Africa, it is
essential to note that `[c]hallenges still remain at the political level where
national and institutional IP [intellectual property] legislation and/or
regulations often restrict educators from sharing their teaching and learning
materials' (Hodgkinson-Williams & Trotter 2018:220).

    Open educational practices are also interpreted as open pedagogy or
OER-enabled pedagogy by some scholars. For Bali et al. (2020:1), OEPs refer
to the use of OERs but also to `multiple forms of openness beyond or even
without OER'. Wiley and Hilton (2018:135) view OER-enabled pedagogy as a
`set of teaching and learning practices that are only possible or practical in the
context of the 5R permissions which are characteristic of OER'. In addition to
David Wiley's (2021) 5Rs - retain, re-use, revise, remix and redistribute - Olivier
(2020a) also suggests adding recontextualise, which relates explicitly to
localisation as it pertains to

    [T]he right to append, adapt or modify content to be relevant to a specific learning
    context while considering existing biases and hegemony of knowledge from the
    West and the Global North. (p. 23)

Any self-directed OEPs within a South African context should consider not only
the 5Rs but also specifically the needs for continued recontextualisation to
address the varied and dynamic needs of students. In the reporting of the
Research on Open Educational Resources for Development (ROER4D) project,
Hodgkinson-Williams and Trotter (2018) note that in that project, OEPs involved

    [I]individual or collaborative conceptualisation; creation, curation (retention),
    circulation (distribution) of OER through practices such as open pedagogies;
    crowdsourcing; and open peer-review using open technologies so that they can
    be easily located to encourage copying (re-use `as is'), adaptation, re-curation and
    re-circulation. (p. 205)

                                                                                                                                            27
Digital multilingualism for social justice through localised self-directed open education

Despite the advantages of OERs and OEPs, South Africa, as is the case in
many parts of the Global South, has certain restrictions. In this regard,
Hodgkinson-Williams and Trotter (2018) observe that

    [E]ducators and students in the Global South may be impeded from full
    participation by the lack of access to necessary educational infrastructure and
    materials, such as adequate buildings for instruction, uninterrupted power supply,
    functional technological equipment, affordable and stable connectivity and access
    to requisite educational materials. (p. 207)

It is therefore important to address these challenges in order to allow for the
effective implementation of OEPs within the South African context.

   Open educational practices and social justice

Using Sleeter's (2015) dimensions of social justice, education provides a solid
foundation for localised OEPs. Firstly, it is essential to situate communities in
terms of structural inequities. In this regard, lingual dispositions and multilingual
repertoires should be considered within broader local and national policies
and systems. For the sake of open pedagogy, developing relationships of
reciprocity in terms of students and the wider community allows for content
to be localised for specific students in their specific social contexts. Moreover,
the inputs from the broader community in terms of learning content cannot
be overstated. Underlying the open localised approach advocated for in this
chapter is explicitly informing the teaching process with expectations building
specifically on the culture, language, experience and identity of students.
Despite the focus of localisation on the learning content and language, the
process itself should also be framed by students' culture and experiences.
Finally, localised open content should overtly address marginalised
perspectives and cover aspects of inequity and power. These four dimensions
of Sleeter (2015) provide a bridge between social justice and the learning
process and also provide a solid basis for more equitable and relevant localised
open pedagogy.

    The role of OEPs in social justice should be considered within the broader
approach to social justice and education. In this regard, this chapter is aligned
with Ogange and Carr's (2021) dual view of social justice:

    When looking at social justice in terms of education, we can conceptualise
    two facets: accessing education as a learner, a form of distributive justice,
    and participating in shaping education systems and processes, as a co-creator
    and contributor to one's own learning experience, which speaks to recognitional
    and associational justice. (p. 63)

When it comes to OEPs, the emphasis would be on the second face relating
to co-creation and student agency within the learning process.

   Localisation as part of self-directed open educational
   practices

As stated at the start of the chapter, localisation implies adapting both content
and language to make a resource appropriate for a specific context. The term
localisation is used in different disciplines and for different purposes.
Wolfenden and Adinolfi (2019:327-328) state that localisation `encompasses
both adaptation (adjusting the content of materials to distinct environmental
and contextual factors) and translation (converting the text or audio to a
different language or linguistic variety)'. The term can also be used to adapt
the education system in terms of values, knowledge, technologies and norms
(Geo-Jaja 2013). However, the term is also widely used in the field of translation
studies.

    Language is central to any realisation of OEPs as learning is regarded as an
act of communication (Canale 2019; Olivier 2020b) and communication is
essential to SDL in an open context (Olivier 2020a). Amiel (2013), in reference
to remixing, refers explicitly to the role of language within the process of
finding, relating, creating and sharing resources, as there are lingual aspects
relevant to all these steps. Furthermore, Amiel (2013) highlights the importance
of repositories and tools being open in the languages relevant to remixing to
support the process.

    It has been proposed that teachers and students be supported to become
self-directed in the process of localisation within OEPs. In this regard, Olivier
(2020a) observes that there is a need for `an open ongoing process which
provides agency to local teachers and students to use the language of their
choice to engage with content applicable and relevant to their contexts' (p.
26). This need for agency is highlighted by Du Toit-Brits and Blignaut (2021)
as well as Wolfenden and Adinolfi (2019). In their research, it was clear that
different individuals from different subjects acted differently as regards the
extent to which localisers would feel comfortable changing the content of
resources. Furthermore, within the precolonial African context, this lifelong
learning approach also aligns with the idea that `[t]he teacher in precolonial
Africa never stopped learning, which means the teacher was also a learner'
(Mosweunyane 2013:53).

    Significantly, Acharya (2019) highlights how the localisation of technical
products has the potential to promote social justice. Furthermore, Acharya
(2019:22) notes that in terms of `a social justice perspective, participatory
localisation for usability empowers the local users, especially those whose
role is often deemed less important to play during the design process'.
Hodgkinson-Williams and Trotter (2018:220) also noted the importance of
localised content. However, they make the following observation: `localised
OER are not always re-disseminated on public platforms, thereby
unintentionally lowering the potential value of these localised resources'. They

                                                                                                                                            29
Digital multilingualism for social justice through localised self-directed open education

also advocate for the re-acculturation of material in order to `create or remix
OER that critically engage with and challenge hegemonic perspectives, to
deliberately encourage a more deliberately "pluralist" perspective' and
ultimately also share such OERs (Hodgkinson-Williams & Trotter 2018:220).

  Open translanguaging through localisation

   Alternative ways of knowing

The need for localisation is primarily related to linguistic representation.
However, there is also a need to adapt content to be relevant within the
context in which it will be used. In this regard, Amiel (2013:136) observes that
`[t]here is a need to foment the production of local knowledge and indigenous
ways of knowing in order to foster adequate learning opportunities'. It is
proposed in this chapter that such ways of knowing can be supported through
open translanguaging for localisation.

    It is also essential that OEPs be underpinned by a theoretical foundation
focused on learning and collaboration as is associated with SDL. In drawing
from social constructivist ideas (Holmes et al. 2001), it is essential to move
from merely collaborating for learning to collaborate for the benefit of others.
In this regard, it is proposed that OEPs as open translanguaging be approached
from a communal constructivist perspective. In this regard, Holmes et al.
(2001) describe communal constructivism as

    [A]n approach to learning in which students not only construct their own
    knowledge (constructivism) as a result of interacting with their environment
    (social constructivism) but are also actively engaged in the process of constructing
    knowledge for their learning community [emphasis in the original]. (p. 1)

Open translanguaging as OEPs implies knowing and knowing through
others in a contextualised manner. Furthermore, such OEPs rely heavily on the
translanguaging process and the affordances it provides to students as
creators.

   Translanguaging as a self-directed open process

Translanguaging is considered a fairly common and natural phenomenon in
multicultural contexts (Sefotho & Makalela 2017). It is essential to take note
that García and Leiva (2014:214) contend that `all doing is knowing and
languaging, and all-knowing and languaging is doing, will there be a space to
educate all children equitably and for social justice', and this implies that
students who are bilingual should `be allowed to build on their translanguaging
practices, their peers must be engaged in translanguaging discourses, and
teachers must value translanguaging and build on those flexible practices'. In
this regard, students should be supported to make use of the available
language codes in a self-directed manner.

The concept of translanguaging has been interpreted within the South African
and, more specifically, African context as ubuntu translanguaging (Makalela
2018) as it is regarded as an African cultural competence within an `African
worldview where there is a deep sense of cultural and social understanding of
oneness or familyhood' (Sefotho & Makalela 2017). Chaka (2020) considers
ubuntu translanguaging one of seven general frameworks of translanguaging,
as evidenced through a systematic review of translanguaging literature. This
communal approach to translanguaging also epistemologically ties in with the
basic tenets of SDL in terms of ubuntu (cf. Du Toit-Brits, Blignaut & Mzuza
2021). Furthermore, Makalela (2018) also makes the following important
statement in this regard:

    Beyond deeper learning, in ubuntu one discovers the humane nature of the
    education enterprise and its decolonising outcome. In multi-languaging we find a
    plural vision of interdependence of the language systems and their fluid, overlapping
    and discursive nature to match the cultural competence of the students and their
    everyday ways of making sense of who they are and of the world. (p. 9)

So, through a contextualised form of translanguaging or, as Makalela (2018)
calls it, ubuntu translanguaging or even multi-languaging, empowering
students to use their language resources in itself may have social justice
implications. However, in this process, the realities of different languages and
multilingualism should be considered for the sake of practical implementation.
Consequently, the issue of language harmonisation should also be considered.

   Harmonisation as a pragmatic localisation approach

An important issue within the South African context is the potential for
language harmonisation. Historically single languages have been divided into
multiple languages through interventions by missionaries and the language
politics of the day. These `languages' are considered unique entities despite
mutual intelligibility (Makalela 2018; Sefotho & Makalela 2017). In a study
related to the Sotho languages (Sefotho & Makalela 2017), it was found that in
terms of decoding and comprehension across the borders of related languages,
there are no clear differences in understanding when moving between
languages.

    The harmonisation of related languages is not a new concept and was
already raised by Nhlapo (1945) in the 1940s. Despite initial combined
developmental efforts between related languages, the apartheid government
emphasised language independence and differences. Consequently, languages
were also deemed symbols of autonomy and self-identity in the ethnically
segregated homelands (Msimang 1994).

    Within the context of open translanguaging and ultimately localised OEPs,
it should be considered within the South African context that collaboration
takes place within related languages. Furthermore, the benefit of pivot

                                                                                                                                             31
Digital multilingualism for social justice through localised self-directed open education

translations of texts between related languages should be considered as this
might ease localisation in even more languages.

  Recommendations

The broader use of localised OERs and OEPs would require new approaches
to recognition within institutions, specifically addressing challenges around
universities' IP policies (Cox et al. 2020). Consequently, as important as it is
that initiatives for localised self-directed OEPs are started from the bottom at
the classroom level, the policy context should also be conducive to localised
OEPs.

    Lecturing staff should be motivated and incentivised to localise OERs and
embed this in pedagogies supportive of SDL. Amiel (2013) notes the barriers
to getting instructors involved in the authoring process and engaging with
OERs. In this regard, the language repertoires of lecturing staff should be
employed as a valuable supporting resource within the localising process.

    Localisation activities should be approached in a participatory manner. In
this regard, Ogange and Carr (2021) note the importance of participatory
OER adaptation. It allows for a quality process that draws on communal and
diverse expertise, supports student agency and self-direction and allows for
peer-review processes to ensure the quality of the resources. Collaboration
between lecturers and especially between students in the localised OEPs
should be considered essential. In this regard, Wolfenden and Adinolfi (2019)
are of the opinion that

    [L]ocalisation process needs to both draw on the expertise that the localisers bring
    and enable their participation to go beyond the familiar, allowing them to see the
    value of engaging in a practice which they may not previously have associated with
    what it means to be an educator. (p. 341)

Amiel (2013) also advocates for participatory practices in terms of remixing
where translation is involved.

    Microlearning may also present many opportunities in terms of OERs on a
practical level. In terms of defining this concept, Corbeil, Corbeil and Khan (2021)
share the following definition of microlearning as proposed by Khan in 2020:

    Microlearning can be viewed as a single objective-focused, outcome-based, stand-
    alone, meaningful, and interactive learning unit delivered in bite-sized snippets (i.e.,
    a short modular format) either digitally (i.e., via computer, tablet, or mobile phone)
    or non-digitally (i.e. as via a flashcard or booklet). (p. 4)

The use of microlearning in terms of OERs and social justice is highlighted
by Ogange and Carr (2021). Olivier (2021a) noted how short student-
generated videos as microlearning objects could be used effectively for
learning and be shared as OERs. Such an approach also shows promise
towards localisation of OERs.

Any discussion about language and social justice should not merely focus on
the language but rather, in the words of Barakos (2020:276), `which agents,
institutions, affects, discourses, and ideologies shape the way language is
vested in (re)producing justice'. Hence, it is essential to specifically look at the
societal power structures around, and linked to, language, and not merely
language itself. As was noted by Duchêne (2020), mere recognition and
enthusiasm about multilingualism may not lead to actual change or affordances
from the use of more languages in a lingually unfair context.

    Infrastructure and the broader ecosystem should be conducive to open
practices and access to resources (Amiel 2013). Furthermore, it is recommended
that repositories provide additional instructions and guidance towards
effective localisation. This issue aligns with Amiel's (2013) concern regarding
little guidance in remixing within the OER repository contexts. Similarly,
Ogange and Carr (2021) also emphasise that in terms of social justice when
working with OERs, the content should be considered, and the delivery
medium as the nature of the technology may potentially exclude possible
relevant persons. Furthermore, a multimodal approach might be necessary as,
in some cases, OERs that are only available online might not be accessible to
the target audience (Ogange & Carr 2021). This sentiment aligns with Olivier's
(2020b) view that for students to be part of the OERs creation process would
imply self-directed multimodal learning, which involves students taking charge
of their own learning in the negotiation of different educational levels of
multimodality. This covers not only blends of technologies but also different
modes of communication and classroom delivery.

    Certain language-specific issues also need to be considered in implementing
open localisation practices. To this end, students need to be empowered
through training on translanguaging practices and relevant corpora of
translated content be created (Makalela 2018) that can be shared for broader
re-use and ultimately to support language standardisation. Consequently, at a
policy level, compulsory open licensing of translated content in African
languages in a context such as South Africa should be seriously considered.

    Based on the literature review, five steps towards localised self-directed
OEPs are recommended, as shown in Figure 2.1.

    From Figure 2.1, some form of evaluation of the needs would be necessary
to empower students for the translanguaging and localised self-directed OEP
processes. In addition, within the context of open education, it is essential to
consider whether existing OERs cannot be re-used rather than merely be
created. Furthermore, issues around understanding content (epistemological
distance) and language (linguistic distance) need to be considered. For more
on epistemological and linguistic or language distance, see Olivier (2021b).
Finally, the process of localised OEPs will also be informed by the available
time, expertise, adaptability, the relevant modality and student capabilities.

                                                                                                                                            33

  Conclusion

In conclusion, it is considered that a move towards localised self-directed
OEPs could support a return to the precolonial African notion that is aligned
with a social constructivist and, more specifically, communal constructivist
(Holmes et al. 2001) ideals. In this regard, Mosweunyane (2013:53) notes that
historically, `every member of an African society was a teacher by virtue of
them having vast experience that was worthy'. Furthermore, localised self-
directed OEPs may potentially be a vehicle for negotiating social justice issues
around access in terms of language (cf. Mwaniki 2012) as it allows for a more
open, participatory and communal approach to language accommodation
and recognition. Localised self-directed OEPs through digital technologies
allow for student-driven translanguaging practices that are not limited by
distance, adaptive systems responsive to language preferences and open
language repositories that allow for the sharing of linguistic data.

    This chapter explored the affordances of localised self-directed OEPs
towards multilingual digital education for social justice in South Africa. The
unique South African context shows the importance of language in terms of
social justice in education. However, approaching language in this way also
relates to global approaches to social justice and language and issues around
intersectionality. Despite constitutional guarantees around multilingualism,
monolingualism is a reality in South African HE. Furthermore, embracing
various literacies is a crucial prerequisite for any localised OEPs and addressing
relevant social justice issues.

The social justice potential of OEPs should be embraced as it may have a
positive impact on students and their self-directedness in this context. In this
regard, this chapter proposes building on the two elements of positive impact
noted by Bali et al. (2020):

    [F]irstly, when used with individuals in marginalized populations, and secondly,
    in the long-term development of students as citizens who learn how they might
    empower others when they are in a context to do so. (p. 10)
In this chapter, it is proposed that through a communal constructivist approach,
students may become active agents in localising OERs through open
translanguaging activities where they use their language repertoires. This
open translanguaging through localisation implies different ways of knowing,
a totally open process, and considering the opportunities posed through
language harmonisation. Finally, some practical recommendations are made
towards localised OEPs through open translanguaging.

  Abstract

Open educational resources (OERs) under open copyright license are
emerging as a result of technological advances and improved Internet access.
Incorporating OERs has benefits for education, including implications for self-
directed learning, but only a small body of research provides empirical
evidence of such benefits for use in convincing decision-makers to invest in
OERs and educators to embrace them. Our review of the literature reveals an

urgent need for researchers to investigate improved ways to develop and use
OERs. Preliminary studies suggest significant cost-savings when OERs
replace traditional textbooks, so investigating and deploying OERs seems
worthwhile. However, embracing OERs is hampered by challenges, stakeholders
remain largely unaware of these materials and finding suitable OERs and
appraising their quality is difficult. The pace of wide-scale adoption of OERs
could be accelerated with evidence to convince investors of their benefits and
by steering educators towards the best ways to develop and use these
resources.

  Introduction

As information technologies improve, OERs used in open education practices
(OEPs), as well as open-source software, could potentially help to address
some of the challenges faced by education systems worldwide. As defined by
the William and Flora Hewlett Foundation (2018), OERs are:

    [T ]eaching, learning and research materials in any medium - digital or otherwise -
    that reside in the public domain or have been released under an open license that
    permits nocost access, use, adaptation and redistribution by others with no or
    limited restrictions. (n.p.)

The comparatively unrestricted legal copyright licences attached to OERs, in
contrast to other materials, offer an unprecedented opportunity to develop
and co-create educational materials without needing further permissions
(Kawachi 2014). Growing numbers of OERs are becoming available (McKerlich,
Ives & McGreal 2013). However, the OER movement has not permeated formal
education despite rising interest and the appeal of adopting open-access
resources (Al Abri & Dabbagh 2018). Furthermore, there is a large gap between
educators who are aware of OERs or willing to consider them and those who
actively use them (Baker 2008; Padhi 2018). In addition, awareness of higher
education (HE) amongst faculty members and students remains low (Allen &
Seaman 2014, 2016).

    Numerous claims are made by OER proponents, even as further potential
benefits remain unexplored, with more expected to emerge in future.
Appreciating current benefits is a necessary starting point, but hard evidence
is needed both to convince governments, organisations, institutions, educators
and other stakeholders to invest and for the OER movement to expand and
flourish. The claims should be reviewed in terms of whether they remain
theoretical or whether there is scientific evidence to support them and to
direct and steer researchers. Broadening the espousal of OERs across
education institutions requires proof of their effectiveness in teaching-
learning, including self-directed learning (SDL). When enough indisputable
evidence has accrued to support the use of these resources, wide-scale OER
investment could be motivated to nurture a diverse and inclusive ecosystem
in which open content is shared and OEPs place information in reach of all as

a public good. In this way, some of the challenges faced by the education
sector can be more effectively addressed.

  Methodology

Given that OERs offer relatively new advantageous scenarios, including the
replacement of expensive proprietary textbooks, surveying the evidence in
terms of perceived advantages and disadvantages and identifying gaps that
can be filled with serious research is paramount when informing governments,
education sectors, and policy and other decision-makers. To this end, the
present review explores the advantages of OERs in the literature, determines
whether the rewards claimed are evidence-based or whether more research is
needed in support and suggests studies or standardisation of methods to
allow comparisons. We argue, amongst other things, that OER adoption can
improve the quality of the learning experience, especially SDL, by assisting
flexibility and openness of resources. Also, because of the challenges of
embracing OERs - including initial development cost, insufficient awareness
of them, and difficulties associated with finding, appraising and using them -
we identify them and recommend future research directions that could guide
and facilitate effective OER development and deployment.

  Defining open educational resources and
  self-directed learning

The benefits of OERs have been linked to their characteristics. Therefore,
understanding their nature is important for appreciating their potential impact
when adopted. Open educational resources are teaching, learning and research
resources and materials in any medium and format that belong to the `public
domain' or resources not protected by copyright, or with expired copyright
protection, or a combination of these, can be accessed without payment of any
fee and are available for retention, reuse, adaptation, revision, remixing or
editing, re-purposing and redistribution (UNESCO 2020). Wiley has introduced
the 5R framework based on five permissions under the Creative Commons
licences, which allow users to (1) retain the original material as well as control
copies; (2) reuse original work as an exact copy; (3) revise original subject
matter by adapting, improving and or translating; (4) remix original material
through incorporation with other content and (5) redistribute the resource
amongst educators, students or the public. Although OERs can be non-digital,
Kawachi (2014) suggests that conveying their benefits would require them to
be available in digitised form at some point to enable them to be stored,
searched, retrieved, reused and shared, and proposes defining an OER as

    [A] digital self-contained unit of self-assessable teaching with an explicit,
    measurable learning objective, having an open licence clearly attached to allow
    adapting and generally being free-of-cost to reuse. (p. 12)

                                                                                                                                            39
Open educational resources' likely contributions and implications

Chapter 1 has defined SDL, but, to repeat, Knowles (1975) defines it as:

    [A] process in which individuals take the initiative, with or without the help of
    others, in diagnosing their learning needs, formulating learning goals, identifying
    human and material resources for learning, choosing and implementing appropriate
    learning strategies, and evaluating learning outcomes. (p. 18)

  Benefits of open educational resources

Drawing on the inherent nature of OERs, the Hewlett Foundation (2013)
summarised their potential benefits as:

    (a) to offer access to knowledge for all, (b) to reduce the cost of education, (c)
    to deliver greater learning efficiency, (d) to promote continuous improvement
    of instruction and personalised learning, and (e) to encourage translation and
    localisation of content. (n.p.)

The present review extends these categories by adding subsections, and
proposing advantages of OERs, beyond those previously suggested, relating
to ways in which they could be more environmentally friendly, improve learning
by opening possibilities for SDL practices, potentially harness technology in
line with the fourth industrial revolution (4IR), move students from being mere
users of information to co-creators of it and advance research as part of the
`credibility revolution'.

   Benefits to students and those that support them
   financially, the education sector and society at large

   Expanded accessibility

As Nelson Mandela famously observed (Nelson Mandela Institute for Education
and Rural Development 2022:n.p.), `it is not beyond our power to create a
world in which all children have access to a good education. Those who do not
believe this have small imaginations.'

    The availability of learning materials as OERs could provide a crucial tool
towards achieving universal and quality education towards the realisation of
the United Stations' millennium development goals (MDGs) and Education
For All initiatives (United Nations 2011) and the sustainable development goals
(SDGs) (United Nations 2022).

    In 2015 in South Africa, the #FeesMustFall student revolt against denial of
admission to, and economic exclusion from, HE again placed the spotlight on
lowering the cost of education to improve accessibility for those with lower
socioeconomic status (Godsell, Chikane & Mpofu-Walsh 2016). In some parts
of the world, particularly in developing low- and middle-income countries
(LMICs), expenses linked to education - including tuition fees, accommodation,
travel and study materials - can be prohibitive, precluding citizens from

40
                                                                                                                                 Chapter 3

attaining even a basic level of education (Bhavnani et al. 2008). Education
entails more than merely providing free admittance to learning content; it
needs to facilitate the formation of learning communities so that interaction,
sharing of experiences and learning, and more can take place (Ally & Samaka
2013). Therefore, costs can be lowered only partly through the incorporation
of OERs, and open education processes are needed (Knox 2013). Nevertheless,
making high-quality educational materials available could equalise access to
knowledge for all, irrespective of people's location, status or background
(Conole 2012).

    Great strides have been made in developing learning technologies that
allow knowledge sharing, permit OEPs, and provide free and open-source
software and open content, in all of which OERs play an important part. It has
been argued that inadequate access to computers makes it difficult for those
in remote locations and, more broadly, in developing countries to access such
materials, but these users are now sidestepping the wired desktop or laptop
stage and progressing directly towards the adoption of wireless mobile tools
(Bhavnani et al. 2008). Whilst mobile devices with improved technology are
becoming reasonably priced, the cost of Internet data remains high in several
areas of the world. However, solutions are possible, for example, during the
height of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic in 2020-2021,
South African universities negotiated for their online sites to be available free
of charge for registered visitors. Whilst OERs and OEPs are quickly increasing
in developed western countries, their adoption is lagging in LMIC, including
those in sub-Saharan Africa (Mtebe & Raisamo 2014) and the East (Hu et al.
2015), and this issue would need to be overcome for the envisioned benefits
to be fully realised and for the achievement of social justice and more inclusive
practice.

    Improved technology and the erosion and disappearance of the digital
hardware divide coupled with the introduction of OERs could also reduce the
access barrier and learning divide (Ally & Samaka 2013). Eliminating at least
some of the related financial barriers to access to education would benefit all,
especially previously disadvantaged individuals. It could, for example, impact
entry and facilitate career progression by enhancing the representation in the
workplace of all people in any society, enabling them to be more productive,
improve their quality of life, uplift economies and build nations (Azevedo et al.
2022; Bhavnani et al. 2008).

    Currently, the restricted availability of teachers and educators and physical
classrooms and the cost of accommodation and travel to attend physical
institutions can deny learners or students an education in the present system
(Ally & Samaka 2013). For OERs to impact education and to result in Education
For All, as well as to reduce the need for millions of educators and physical
spaces, a paradigm shift is needed from `bricks to clicks' (Ally & Samaka 2013).

                                                                                                                                             41
Open educational resources' likely contributions and implications

Rather than spending precious resources on extensive building and
maintenance of classrooms, delivering OEPs and educational materials to
learners in situ could help to service virtual learning communities instead of
specific physical schools/colleges/universities and save accommodation and
travel expenses (Ally & Samaka 2013). Access to education through the use of
mobile technology for delivering OERs within online courses could offer
equalising opportunities for all to learn by permitting access from anywhere
and at any time, even in difficult conditions such as pandemics (Singh et al.
2020), political instability, natural disaster or other classroom-disrupt
scenarios.

    Expanded access to traditional, distance and virtual e-learning education
could add value in the spheres of lifelong learning and continuing professional
development (Al Abri & Dabbagh 2018; Latchem 2014). In addition, OERs
expand informal access to education through autonomous, self-directed study
and learning (Kawachi 2014). Effective SDL is an acknowledged promoter of
lifelong learning (Blignaut & Du Toit-Brits 2022; Tekkol & Demirel 2018),
enabling learners to adapt to a continuously changing universe of information
and problems (Van Woezik, Reuzel & Koksma 2019). It boosts students' desire
and willingness to continue learning and to improve their learning processes
(Du Toit-Brits et al. 2021). The benefits of SDL through OEP to students' daily
lives and future employment have been described as undeniable because it is
both progressive and distinct from traditional approaches (Blignaut & Du Toit-
Brits 2022; Olivier 2020) (see the `Improved student learning' section for ways
in which combining open education with SDL practices could impact learning).
Further research is needed, however, to understand more fully the optimal
conditions for designing and developing effective OERs based on SDL
pedagogy for lifelong learning (Ally & Samaka 2013).

    To promote reaching those not reached so far, Kawachi (2014) suggests
translating OERs into local languages to augment access to information (see
also the section `Improved study materials: Quality, context and language
preferences'). To the best of our knowledge, research to quantify increased
information and education accessibility is scarce - possibly because OERs
have been slow to be fully utilised in education sectors and it may be too early
to measure effects on accessibility. As OERs start impacting education more
profoundly and reducing costs more substantially, researchers and economists
will be able to design studies that quantify OER influences on information and
access to education. However, preliminary data already suggest reductions in
cost that would contribute to improving access.

   Lowered cost of education

Budgets for education are often restricted and even tightened. Learning
resources are accessible at a cost for educators and learners or may be

42
                                                                                                                                 Chapter 3

available only at specific locations (schools or libraries), which requires users
to travel to get access (Ally & Samaka 2013). Textbook costs keep rising
(exceeding normal inflation rates) and have been contributing to rising
education costs (Allen & PIRG 2010), so sharing OERs can reduce financial
barriers for students' access to educational material. Advocates for using
OERs to replace traditional publisher-produced proprietary textbooks claim
cost-savings as a major reason, and the literature contains the most evidence
for this benefit (Hilton III et al. 2014; Wiley et al. 2012). Given the limited
samples of educators and disciplines in existing studies, further work on a
larger, more comprehensive scale is needed. Several approaches have been
used to estimate costs. A standardised method would allow the accrual of
studies' results and comparisons. Wiley et al. (2012), for example, suggested
incorporating teacher input in combination with OER production costs; they

    [S]ummed the money paid to teachers for participating in professional development/
    training activities, estimated the monetary value of the unpaid time teachers spent
    making their adaptations (at a rate per hour which should be standardised per
    country/district per year), and added these to the printing-related costs (including
    printing, binding, tax, and shipping or delivery costs). (p. 266)

Wiley et al. also factored in the number of students served. Hilton III et al.
(2014) simplified their analysis by assuming that OERs are free. In digital
formats, hardware, software and Internet costs should be considered.
Computing the cost of traditional textbooks (e.g. as reported by bookstores
or online stores or other sources), new or second-hand/used hard copies,
hard copy versions or digital versions, with or without shipping or delivery
costs, should also be standardised to facilitate study-replication. Non-
purchasing behaviours, such as borrowing, renting, sharing textbooks, or
using a library copy, or even actions that undermine traditional copyright,
could affect the costs of traditional published books as well as address some
of the difficulties when conducting such research ex post facto. In addition,
surveying students enrolled in a course to obtain data on non-purchasing
behaviour and the cost involved, such as travelling to the library, could yield
more trustworthy cost analyses.

    Giving or lending mobile technology to learners at entry level and
supporting students with data to connect to the Internet in countries where
individuals do not own their devices or where Internet access is expensive
would increase costs for the education sector and also affect students'
budgets. However, Ally and Samaka (2013) argue the former would be an
easier task than designing and delivering inexpensive teaching and learning
resources for access with mobile devices. They observe that many innovative
technology-based education initiatives have failed not because of technological
shortcomings but because of a dearth of quality content. Studies on costing
conclude that the ideal situation is for international philanthropic and public
funding to be used initially in OER creation and afterwards to allow private

                                                                                                                                            43
Open educational resources' likely contributions and implications

initiatives to globalise or localise and use the materials (Kawachi 2008;
Robinson 2008). For OERs to break into mainstream education, they must
improve through collaborative efforts to reduce developmental costs (Wiley
et al. 2012). Such coordinated projects improve efficiency because having
various instructors designing learning material for the same class content
misuses human resources as well as time - that could have been spent tutoring
students (Ally & Samaka 2013).

    Although developmental costs need to be considered, time spent to locate,
vet or appraise and select OERs and then adapt or remix them can add
substantially to the cost of adopting OERs. These factors are complex (Wiley
et al. 2012) and are not easily researched. Some studies have considered the
time spent on modifying OERs but note that the time used does not necessarily
correlate with the extent of alteration - some quick alterations, such as
removing chapters, can result in large changes, whereas amending content
requires more time and results in comparatively smaller changes (Wiley et al.
2012). Therefore, researchers should not only ask educators to report on the
percentage of modification but also on the time it took. The cost of maintaining
and processing the developed materials in repositories to facilitate sharing
should also be estimated. Another neglected cost involves training educators
in searching for and using the technology, customising OERs, and implementing
their use. These expenses should be calculated and considered carefully by
the education sector. Coordinated collaboration in the development of OERs,
such as new course designs and textbooks, could substantially lower
development costs and improve quality (Wiley et al. 2012). In some instances,
the creation cost of OERs is funded by grants from foundations, governments
(Baker et al. 2009; Hilton III et al. 2014; Tlili et al. 2019) or universities
(e.g. NWU OER Fellowship project, funded by institutional grants); in other
instances, by the free time of instructors who are willing to share their work.
Development costs are one-time costs, amortised when the OERs are used
effectively by educators and students (Hilton III et al. 2014). In the long term,
cost-savings for the education sector could be envisaged when teachers and
lecturers can access lesson plans online, saving time, effort and money and
serving more students per instructor with less need for physical classrooms
(Ally & Samaka 2013; Pownall et al. 2021). Indirect cost benefits because of
better student retention are also envisioned with OERs (Kawachi 2014). Whilst
the cost of OER production and consumption remains to be established but is
probably substantial, the potential cost-savings for learners make OERs
valuable to explore and will contribute to the sustainability of their adoption.

    Lowered environmental impact of education

If OERs are digitised - recommended as essential (Kawachi 2014) - and replace
printed textbooks, OERs could be more environmentally friendly. Even if OERs
are printed, it would be commensurate in a reduced environmental impact

44
                                                                                                                                 Chapter 3

because they are customised to contain only the information needed for
achieving the course's learning outcomes as opposed to prescribed textbooks
containing elaborate content. Studies have indicated, moreover, that students
using electronic textbooks achieved comparable mastery of outcomes to those
using traditional textbooks (Daniel & Woody 2013; Grissett & Huffman 2019).
Some work indicates that materials with interactivity led to improved course
outcomes (Edgcomb et al. 2015). Currently, no research has endeavoured to
measure the reduced perceived effect of OERs used instead of textbooks on the
environment.

   Benefits for students

   Improved student learning

To widen the adoption of OERs, the effectiveness of their influence on learning
must be demonstrated, as well as whether the quantity and quality of learning
they facilitate warrants the development costs. Well-designed, customisable
and openly licensed materials are not just a key part of cost-saving, but their
advocates also cite improved learning outcomes as a benefit.

    Although studies are only now emerging that report on feedback from
learners and students about improved learning achieved through the use of
OERs, several reasons have been postulated. One is that students often fail to
purchase traditional textbooks because they cannot afford them. The
introduction of OERs to such students gives them access to the study material
(but no evidence is available as yet to support this claim). Some researchers
have observed no apparent differences in students' results (Grissett & Huffman
2019; Wiley et al. 2012) and no evidence that OERs improved student mastery
compared with previous years when the same instructor prescribed traditional
textbooks. Grissett and Huffman (2019) reported that students who compared
using open textbooks and those from traditional publishers perceived cost,
weight and convenience as advantages of open textbooks and cited reading
ease, convenience, ability to annotate, to search a topic quickly and as a
reference as the benefits of traditional textbooks. More research in this regard
is needed, especially from developing countries such as South Africa. There
are practical difficulties in researching changes in student outcome scores
related to the use of OERs compared to traditional textbooks. Controlling for
variability among instructors when investigating changes in learning by
following up on teachers is preferred (Wiley et al. 2012). Using previously
available data to compare when the same course used traditional textbooks
versus prescribing OERs also poses difficulties in that educators move (Wiley
et al. 2012) or gain experience and therefore might teach better so that
improvements are not only due to the incorporation of the OER but partly to
other confounding factors. Controlling for increased experience is more
difficult and could be done statistically or approached by at least using
comparative data that are not separated by long time periods in between.

                                                                                                                                            45
Open educational resources' likely contributions and implications

Other reasons suggested for improved learning when OERs are used include
the fact that OERs often contain multimedia and other interactive elements
that could engage students better than traditional textbooks. Furthermore,
OERs could democratise knowledge and empower learners and students
more effectively. Access to materials by many authors with varied perspectives
and views could help students to achieve course and programme goals and
could also contribute to the global citizenry and greater in-depth understanding
(currently, evidence for this view raised here is lacking). Open educational
resources could promote deep learning through problem-based learning in
which learners are given problems to solve, during which process they have to
locate the necessary information and apply it (Hmelo-Silver et al. 2007). Using
mobile technology during problem-solving allows learners to access
information as OERs improve access to learning materials. Improved access to
remedial study resources in the form of OERs could also help to reduce
dropouts from formal education and improve retention of at-risk students
(Kawachi 2014; Weller et al. 2017).

    Including OERs in blended or online learning modalities can support
learner autonomy, self-reliance and independence, leading to learning that
can be more self-directed and learner-centred. As reviewed in Chapter 1,
SDL occurs when a person or group of students takes charge of the learning
process and accepts responsibility for and the consequences of such
learning. To facilitate SDL, educators jettison their traditional role as `givers
of knowledge' (Du Toit-Brits 2018), break down traditional power structures
and shift the classroom to one where the student and the educator work
together to create a valuable and meaningful learning experience (Wiley &
Hilton III 2018). Student participation in the learning process is essential to
provide meaning to teaching and learning (education). Self-directed learning
supported with OERs is an active meaning-making process in which students
should not be viewed as passive recipients of learning content but rather as
active and self-directed contributors to the learning process, developing a
consequential understanding of the learning content and resources available
in their learning setting (Du Toit-Brits 2018). Du Toit-Brits (2018) believes
that students should be encouraged to pursue their personal development
with an emphasis on:

    [L]earning as belonging, learning as becoming, learning as experiencing, and
    learning as doing. (p. 54)

A solid teaching objective, focus on independence, a positive attitude toward
SDL, and being practitioners of SDL themselves and incorporating OERs in
SDL may help educators to establish learning circumstances that encourage
students to own their learning (Blignaut & Du Toit-Brits 2022; Du Toit-Brits
2015; Olivier 2020). Students need to be skilled in controlling and master SDL
to foster a focus on independence in students' approach to open education
(Du Toit-Brits 2018).

                                                                                                                                 Chapter 3

Students derive several benefits from SDL. One of these is that self-directed
learners create a commitment to learning, actively participate in the process
and overcome obstacles to learning (Blignaut & Du Toit-Brits 2022). Integrating
SDL with OERs and real-world learning can potentially increase students'
appreciation for the significance of such learning and the value of its
contribution to their future jobs or careers (Du Toit-Brits et al. 2021; Olivier
2020).

    Open education can be seen as a creative and innovative development in
teaching-learning that provides students with the opportunity for creativity
and self-direction (Picciano 2021). The potential of using OERs in OEPs to
improve the nurturing of student interaction and to generate opportunities for
innovative teaching that focuses on getting students to take ownership of their
learning advocates for open education (Cronin & MacLaren 2018; Olivier 2020;
Picciano 2021). Open education can also be seen as a learner-centred approach
that fosters self-directedness and SDL skills by promoting and empowering
students to improve their ability and willingness to use OERs in a creative,
collaborative and encouraging learning environment (Cronin & MacLaren 2018).
Cronin and MacLaren (2018) believe that students need to be empowered with
appropriate skills to explore OERs and find high-quality learning material online
to fit their learning needs. They also believe that these skills and OER will give
students more autonomy and encourage self-direction in their learning.

    Open education has been shown to improve student outcomes, critical
thinking and self-direction and generate a stronger sense of satisfaction
(Picciano 2021). In addition, research suggests that open education may
positively influence student engagement, assist in developing skills essential for
educational success and promote motivation (Jung 2019; Picciano 2021).
Openness in educational design is explored by Picciano (2021) as increased
engagement in creating learning activities such that students themselves are
active. Jung (2019) suggests that such openness relates to the establishment of
learning objectives, selection of resources used in the teaching-learning process,
the activities in which students will participate, and assessment procedures. An
atmosphere in which students are thoroughly engaged in the learning processes
and OERs needs to be fostered by acknowledging students' learning needs and
the purpose of learning and assessment tasks (Du Toit-Brits 2018; Jung 2019).
In this way, OEPs can foster, nurture and facilitate the skills of learning to learn.
The research reported in this section shows that open education and SDL are
progressively developing as desired learning methods worldwide.

    Improved study materials: Quality, context and language
    preferences

Open educational resources include multimedia content (text, images and
videos), simulations, interactive materials, website resources and conventional

                                                                                                                                            47
Open educational resources' likely contributions and implications

educational resources (articles, open-access textbooks and digital objects)
and collections in repositories include scholarly journal publications and open-
access textbooks (McGreal, Anderson & Conrad 2015). Other OER repositories
most used by K-12 teachers were TED (technology, entertainment and design)
talks, YouTube, KhanAcademy and iTunes, and the formats of OERs frequently
used by a sample of teachers were videos, open textbooks, images and
quizzes (De los Arcos et al. 2014). These examples show that OERs can widen
the variety of resources and provide more interactivity for instructors or
learners to support different approaches to learning. The provision of more
interactivity to materials, including navigational aids, constitutes a significant
improvement over using a traditional textbook (Baker et al. 2009). In addition,
learners value pop-ups, in-place glossary definitions, show-and-hide exercises
with various problems, interactive simulations and practice quizzes, all of
which are possible with digitised content (Baker et al. 2009).

    Wide concerns regarding the quality of OERs have been reported, however
(Chen 2011; Yilmaz 2011). As more Internet users generate information and
learning content and edit such resources, instructors and learners must check
the content's trustworthiness, reliability, accuracy and validity (Ally & Samaka
2013). Learners should access content from accredited and credible
educational organisations and recognised experts or specialists in the fields
being studied (Ally & Samaka 2013). The challenge for OER providers and
instructors when reusing OERs is to ensure that the materials are of sufficiently
good quality for learners and students to obtain a valid education (Ally &
Samaka 2013). Some evidence has emerged that OERs have been perceived
to be better or of the same quality as conventional textbooks (Baker et al.
2009; Bliss et al. 2013). In two further studies, faculty reported OER quality to
be on par with traditional materials but also indicated that they were unaware
of how to judge the quality apart from offering their own perceptions (Allen &
Seaman 2014, 2016). Evaluating materials' quality objectively is fraught with
difficulties where quality depends on whose perspective is adopted (Kawachi
2014). Defining quality for global use and establishing frameworks to assist in
assessing quality is challenging. Fitness for purpose, that is, satisfying the
objectives or reasons for conceiving and creating an item (proposed by
Harvey and Green [1993]), seems to be the most relevant way to evaluate
OERs. It requires that the purpose of the OER be defined (Kawachi 2014).
Standardisation of such tools will improve OERs design by creators and enable
researchers to conflate similar research results or make comparisons between
studies. The TIPS (Teaching and learning process, the Information and material
content, the Presentation, product and format, and System, technical and
technology) Framework version 1.0 was developed after reviewing various
frameworks of quality dimension (Kawachi 2014:14). Further improvements to
this framework have been made (TIPS Framework version 2.0) and 205 criteria
for quality assessment have been identified that are continually added to and
reduced or simplified for ease of use (Kawachi 2014). Notwithstanding the

usefulness of having this framework and others such as OERTrust (Almendro &
Silveira 2018) and COUP Framework (https://openedgroup.org/coup), the
challenge lies in searching for and judging several OERs before using them.
Other initiatives - such as collaboration and peer review by the entire
community of instructors linked to carefully curated repositories from
accredited and credible educational institutions as trusted clearing houses -
have increased user confidence in the quality of the materials in collections
(such as MERLOT; http://merlot.org) (Al Abri & Dabbagh 2018) and Connexions
(http://cnx.org) (Baker et al. 2009).

    Reuse of OERs will enable continuous cycles of content improvement,
provided that users offer critical feedback and evaluations of the quality and
effectiveness of these resources (Casserly & Smith 2008). The rapid
dissemination of information in the form of OERs provides access to relatively
more up-to-date information than traditionally published textbooks, and
OERs can be disseminated more quickly online in digital formats than
traditional publishing allows.

    Because licences governing OER use generally permit adaptation, most
instructors have adapted, tailored, re-purposed and remixed existing OERs to
suit the needs of their students and to promote the opportunity for them to
personalise what they have learned and how they learned it (De los Arcos et
al. 2016). According to Baker et al. (2009), learners often find it disturbing
when instructors assign lectures in an order different from that in their
textbooks and customisation can address this issue. Open educational
resources, however, can be tailored to be more context-specific and can be
narrowed down to topics relevant to the course (Baker et al. 2009).

    Traditional textbooks often lack regional, local or cultural information
relevant to diverse student populations (Baker et al. 2009). Customisation
allows content to be presented in locally meaningful ways to address the
specific context in which they are used (D'Antoni 2009; Kawachi 2014).
Instructors can customise OERs to the context of their own geographical area
rather than prescribing materials that are either almost context-free or that
present contexts with which they and their students are unfamiliar. However,
instructors should be trained in customisation that adapts existing OERs to
varied cultures or contexts, and the OER license must permit customisation.
We believe that, in some instances, excessive tailoring of content could rob
students of the benefits of working with original content compiled by multiple
authors with different perspectives and views. Materials incorporating
divergent views and contexts could not only help students to master course
and programme goals but could also contribute to the global citizenry and
deepen understanding of views surrounding a topic. To address the lack of
skills in creating global OERs and the need for culturally relevant OERs,
educators should be trained to design OERs whilst considering cultural
differences, values and different contexts of learners globally (Holmberg 2011).

                                                                                                                                            49
Open educational resources' likely contributions and implications

Kawachi (2014) uses the following four terms in this regard -globalisation,
internationalisation, localisation and world-readiness - and defines these in
the glossary as:

    Globalisation: taking an old OER and retrofitting it to suit other local context(s),
    e.g. taking an OER from an old local context, internationalising it, then re-localising
    it into a new local context; Internationalisation: creating a new context-free OER
    that is transmissible and enables later easy adaptation to a local context, having
    the capabilities built in to be adapted but not local-contents built in; Localisation:
    adaptation of OER from any other place to suit the culture, language, and other
    requirements of a new other specific local context, where the resulting OER appears
    to have been created in the end-user local culture; World-Readinesss: creating a
    new OER that is internationalised and has a wide range of or all localisations/local
    contents built into it, where simpler versions allow intermediate-level users to add-
    in local culture (self-localisation). (p. 33)

Open educational resources can be translated into different languages
promoting multilingual material development provided that the licenses of
the OERs permit translation (see Chapter 2). Currently, most available
OERs are in English, with educators who translate them requiring language
proficiency in English; alternatively, when left untranslated, students require
a command of English, and learners are obliged to choose English as their
preferred language for studying and learning OERs (Yilmaz 2011). Almost
all (88%) of 27 international students preferred to read or use OERs in
English, even though only one of them had English as their mother tongue
(Yilmaz 2011). Because we are of the opinion that language preferences
might be influenced by the learner's phase in the education system (mother
tongue might be preferred for setting the foundation for learning, whereas
English might be preferred for work place readiness, especially at exit level
in HE) and the quality of the available translations, we encourage researchers
to investigate the language preferences of OERs to extend the work of
Yilmaz (2011) on the HE system. Care is needed to make sure that translations
are reliable. Open educational resources in extensible markup language
(XML) semantic format can accelerate achieving compliance with the
Americans with Disabilities Act for digital materials and thereby improve
access to information for those with disabilities (Baker et al. 2009). When
OER cost is independent of the number produced, customisation is
rendered more feasible (Baker et al. 2009).

   Exposure to technologies aligned with the Fourth Industrial
   Revolution

The drive of education is to provide learners with the knowledge and skills
that will enable them to be productive (Fullan 2001). However, Kivunja
(2014) argues this moral purpose was applicable to pre-21st-century
learning but is no longer sufficient. Preparing students (in some instances
for jobs that do not yet exist) and giving them a competitive advantage to

become global citizens when the world moves further into the 21st century
and enters the 4IR requires changes in education systems. Such changes
would entail embracing, harnessing and aligning with emerging technology
to meet the needs of new generations of students and impart essential
technology, computer literacy and digital fluency skills. According to
Kivunja (2014):

    [O]ccupations relate not just to the application of technology but more importantly,
    to the ability to engage in independent critical thinking, and a high level of problem
    solving, often using technology. (p. 81)

Open educational resource initiatives, in which educators re-think how they
design materials and Web 3.0 allows high levels of social collaboration, will
help to move education into the innovative Learning 2.0 era and to equip
students adequately (Ally & Samaka 2013). In Learning 2.0, learning material
and social interaction conflate to improve and provide a global education for
post-modernity (Ally & Samaka 2013; Seely Brown & Adler 2008). Ally and
Samaka (2013) further envisioned

    [L]earning in the cloud where OERs and access to learner support will exist
    everywhere and anytime where cloud applications will facilitate sharing, networking,
    communication, and the production and publishing of OER. (p. 16)

   Students as co-creators of learning materials

Another beneficial avenue can arise from the promotion of learner-created
OERs that can be published publicly under a copyright license in which
learners' works can be distributed and reused by other learning settings in so-
called reusable or renewable assignments. Keegan and Bell (2011) asked
learners to generate videos as OERs. They reported that, as learners became
creative in the process of compiling the video, they were learning by processing
the content they presented in the videos at a high level. After the generated
videos were posted on YouTube, peers and users provided excellent comments.
Having learners design and generate OER has various advantages, including
the use of relatively simple language, step-by-step procedures and providing
examples that their peers would easily grasp. It is at the core of open education,
where learners may contribute insights into learning materials. Educators in
open education acknowledge that knowledge building is not a closed process
but one to which information is constantly contributed and allows students to
take charge of their education (Wiley & Hilton 2018). Taking control of their
education empowers learners, and educators and students can participate in
the co-creation of learning when students take part in online communities,
implement and construct OERs, and apply technology as they do so.

   Benefits for educators or instructors and for researchers

Further research that showcases the benefits to faculty, educators and
instructors should help to close the gap between willingness and action in the

                                                                                                                                             51
Open educational resources' likely contributions and implications

use of OERs (Baker et al. 2009) and practising openness in their research
(Azevedo et al. 2022). Research indicates that most educators have positive
attitudes and perceptions regarding the use of OERs but lack experience in
online teaching (Zhang & Li 2017).

Research that tracks the familiarity with and acceptance of OER amongst
educators and learners is needed to target those who remain unaware. Raising
awareness amongst educators about the open licenses and OERs and
empowering educators to search for, appraise and reuse OER should be
closely aligned with their development. Some educators might be using OERs
but be unaware that the resource they are using is an OER because they do
not recognise the special copyright permissions (Allen & Seaman 2014, 2016).
Even though research efforts have only begun touching on the benefits for
educators, several are perceived and discussed here.

    Educators must be made cognisant that OERs exist, and their capacity
should be developed to search for, access and use them (Nikoi et al. 2011).
Creating and developing OERs can empower instructors as writers, increase
their self-esteem and even social status, and help raise the profile of the
institution to which they are affiliated (Kawachi 2014). Tlili et al. (2019)
reported, for example, that the Chinese Quality Course funded by the Chinese
Ministry of Education provided bonuses (in addition to salary) for instructors
publishing their courses within the project.

    Whilst empowerment and incentives benefit educators directly, an indirect
benefit is that OERs enable instructors to find similar or even better resources
relatively easily (Gurel & Wiley 2008) and to tailor those materials to meet
their needs. Access to materials generated by others, and storing them in
private repositories to customise them to meet their learners' requirements,
could reduce time spent creating learning content and free up time to facilitate
students' learning. Good quality OERs could energise educators and lead to
cross-pollination among educators in ways that enable more responsive
teaching and better learning (William & Flora Hewlett Foundation 2018).
Cohen, Reisman and Sperling (2015) reported that the reuse of OERs in a
personal online environment created a lively virtual community through user
activities (such as writing comments, rating, making recommendations,
sharing learning activities and peer reviews).

    The customisation of OERs (as discussed in the `Improved study materials:
Quality, context and language preferences' section) has several benefits. It
provides educators with assorted options to meet their own and students'
diverse learning styles and specific needs. Study materials improved by
customisation in a unique way aligned with instructors' teaching style and
personal style of use can enhance educators' capacity to deliver quality
instruction (Baker et al. 2009; Cohen et al. 2015).

    Whilst Wiley et al. (2012) indicated that OERs could be leveraged to enable
novel pedagogical practices, research conducted by Pitt (2015) was unable to
show that adopting OER led to any development or change in pedagogical
practices. There is a call for a qualitative study that examines how OER can
influence teaching and learning by building on or improving upon existing
pedagogical practices, including OEPs (Pitt 2015). In OEPs, SDL is required as
students must use sound judgement when deciding what, how and when they
will participate in learning activities and OER use. Because of the flexibility of
OEPs, self-direction in learning is essential. Students must be mindful of their
behaviour and actions and understand that they, rather than the educator,
bear the primary responsibility for their learning because of this flexibility.
Educators must therefore construct their pedagogical techniques uniquely
and creatively and consider active learning to generate meaningful learning
experiences in OEPs that encourage SDL skills. Furthermore, educators need
to regard the teaching-learning method as complementary to using OER in
open education. Incorporating OERs into SDL requires teaching-learning
strategies to help to develop students' SDL abilities and to prepare them for
autonomous learning in OEPs. However, conducive learning environments will
be more constructive when incorporating OER into SDL. Priority needs to be
given to OEPs that can engage students in constructive engagement with
OERs during the learning process and simultaneously empower students.
Open educational resource-based SDL should improve teaching and learning
experience quality by assisting flexibility and openness of recourses. Therefore,
implementing OERs can be seen as an SDL tool that effectively constructs an
active learning environment, which places more responsibility on students to
take the initiative in their learning.

    The benefits for research in terms of the `Open movement' and the Open
Science Framework (https://www.cos.io/) are numerous. The benefits are
improved quality and integrity of research generated by the future generation
of researchers (Azevedo et al. 2022). Open scholarship or the `credibility
revolution' endorses the vision that knowledge should be rigorous,
accumulative, reproducible, replicable, shared, transparent and inclusive and
that pre-registration and data sharing are practised (Azevedo et al. 2022); it
also improves the accessibility of science to both researchers and the public
(Azevedo et al. 2022). Sharing research data is especially beneficial because
data provide evidence for knowledge. The better the level of transparency
and reproducibility, the more efficiently the scientific process benefits the
researcher and society (Molloy 2011).

  Challenges for open educational resources

in 2017 at the Second OER World Congress (Ljubljana Declaration) is coupled

with a positive perception of academic staff and students towards OERs and
interest in using them even when awareness of such resources was minimal
(Allen & Seaman 2014, 2016), and can be harnessed to overcome the associated
challenges. Finding proper OERs is one of the biggest obstacles to utilising
these resources (De los Arcos et al. 2014). Several obstacles can be addressed
by determining best practices and training educators in OERs. Tlili et al. (2021)
provide a detailed report on key barriers hindering the use of OERs and how
challenges could be overcome through the assimilation of novel technologies,
such as artificial intelligence and blockchain, with big learning data and
educational data mining algorithms. The dynamics of integrating emerging
technologies to solve OER challenges are revealed using examples, and the
possible boundaries are discussed. Whilst these challenges must be resolved,
Al Abri and Dabbagh (2018) warn that other hurdles may arise as more faculty
and learners begin developing and using OERs.

    The Commonwealth of Learning provides suggestions for educators to put
OERs into practice, including developing the skills to evaluate OERs successfully;
considering the publication, compilation, adaptation and contextualising of
existing OERs; leveraging networks and communities of practice; encouraging
learner participation; promoting OER use through publication on OER; providing
feedback on, and data on the use of existing OERs; and disseminating and
updating knowledge of intellectual property rights, copyright and privacy policies
(COL 2011) (Table 3.1).

  Conclusion

The growing body of scholarship about OER benefits, effectiveness and
practices is encouraging, but more is needed. Systematic reviews are
emerging, with some (Tlili et al. 2019) answering important holistic research
questions such as `What policies and initiatives have been launched to
support the adoption of OER and OEPs?'; `What kinds of OEP have been and
are being implemented?' and `What are the impacts of OERs and OEPs?' and
`What challenges might hinder the use of OERs and OEPs?'. When reflecting
on the status of OERs, it needs to be remembered that OERs are relatively
new and in that the concept was first coined at UNESCO's Forum on Open
Courseware in 2002. Several advantages of OER use, based on their nature,
have been envisioned that should inspire the use of fully vetted, high-quality
OERs. Social inclusion, justice and cost-savings are compelling reasons to
move the OER movement forward and OERs can have great practical
economic significance in providing for everyone to achieve a basic level of
education; their continued growth also depends, however, on demonstrating
the benefits for learning to enable and sustain open education. Researchers
in the field urgently need to demonstrate the discernible impact of OERs, to
prove to decision-makers that OER can indeed profoundly impact education
and OEP. Preliminary data indicating OERs' comparative affordability could
be leveraged to encourage further research about OERs in developed and
developing countries. Because the OER and OEP movement is promising
and emerging, its impact on the education sector must be continually
examined to determine best practices and explore its impact on teaching
and learning outcomes and behaviour.

    In conclusion, it is considered that OEP can change education by changing
the `balance of power' in teaching and learning. In this regard, the change in
`balance of power' focuses on promoting collaboration in sharing learning

outcomes, OERs and learning activities amongst students and educators.
Furthermore, OEP can be expected to encourage and stimulate students to
become more involved and connected in their learning as learning partners,
co-creators of knowledge and knowledge owners in the enhancement of SDL
experiences. Letting students be autonomous learning partners, knowledge
creators and knowledge owners, thereby integrating SDL in OEPs, can
contribute to meaningful educational practices. Educators and students in
OEPs also need to create and build reliable learning environments where
OERs, commitment and self-confidence are essential for achieving individual
and collective learning goals. Finally, effective implementation of OERs as a
self-directed education and learning tool helps to construct and support an
active learning environment; OER-based SDL also supports learning further
within the learning environment and permits students to participate in
learning and lifelong learning. However, if educators do not see the benefits
of developing and using OERs, they will neither use them nor promote their
use. To this end, practical implementation can be facilitated by setting
standards for developing and delivering quality OERs and certifying learners
after they complete open courses in which OERs are employed. Applying
advances in technology to address key barriers hindering the use of OER will
be paramount.

Multilingual philosophy glossaries: Steps towards socially just pedagogical praxis

  Abstract

Like many other academic disciplines in South Africa, philosophy is haunted
by the legacies of colonised curricula and English teaching instruction and the
epistemic injustices that emerge from these. In this chapter, we think about
what some of these epistemic injustices are and how we can practically begin
to ameliorate some of the challenges posed by them. As a step towards more
socially just pedagogical praxis, we propose the use of openly licensed
multilingual philosophy glossaries in classrooms as one way to promote
participatory parity in this field. We also describe our experience of the
creation of such an openly licensed glossary, discussing translation exigencies
and how these might be overcome. This glossary is created as an open
educational resource (OER), serving to aid philosophy students in southern
Africa to access key terms in their own language. Making a glossary like this
available to students encourages self-directed learning as students can take
learning into their own hands by searching for key terms.

  Introduction

The long history of apartheid in South Africa - and colonialism before that - is
well known and documented. Moreover, whilst it is true that apartheid was
officially disbanded in 1994, the effects thereof persist. South Africa is, for
example, one of the most unequal societies in the world - a reality which has
serious implications not only for living standards but also for access to every
phase of learning, from preschools to higher education institutions (HEIs)
(Amnesty International 2020).

    On 09 March 2015, attention was called to this situation. Few South Africans
have forgotten the viscerality of the bronze statue of the British politician and
colonialist Cecil John Rhodes covered with human faeces `obtained from a
portable flush toilet in Khayelitsha, a large "township" (or district) outside of
Cape Town' (Gray van Heerden 2018:15). The statue, then located on the main
campus of the University of Cape Town (UCT), was seen by students as
representative of the ongoing institutional racism on campus. The call for the
removal of this statue - as symbolic of the removal of structural racism -
known as #RhodesMustFall, soon gave way to a new wave of protests, namely
#FeesMustFall, which highlighted the frustration of a generation of students
who were fighting against centuries of systemic and systematic oppression
that left millions of people economically destitute and unable to afford their
studies. What these protests called for, in summary, was free higher education
(HE), decolonised curricula, mother-tongue instruction, and HEIs free from
the biases inherited from colonialism and apartheid (Fairbanks 2015).

    The government responded to the call for free HE by changing the National
Student Financial Aid Scheme (NSFAS) from a loan scheme to a bursary

scheme, thereby mitigating some of the economic obstacles to HE. Nevertheless,
other impediments remain, for example, what has been called epistemic barriers,
which include, but are not limited to, curricula dominated by Western voices
and discourses alien to the lived experiences of students and educational
instruction in languages other than students' mother tongue (home language) -
which is often a third or even fourth language. It is precisely this language
barrier that bears relevance to this chapter. Our argument is not that `poor
performance at university' can be solely `attributed to learning in an additional
language as such', but that it is `an aggravating factor when these students
also come from educationally, socially and/or historically disadvantaged
backgrounds' (Jonker 2016:iii).

    One way to attempt to mitigate the epistemic alienation that students face
is by creating course content that attempts in some way to bridge the gap
between the language of instruction - which typically is English in most HEIs in
South Africa - and students' mother tongues. Because South Africa has eleven
official languages and there are limited resources, it is necessarily not possible
to have a lecturer in every language for every module. This, we argue, is why
subject-specific glossaries are useful tools: because they help bridge the gap
between the language of instruction and the mother tongue of the student and,
in so doing, promote multilingualism and translanguaging class practices,
according to which all possible linguistic and cognitive resources and strategies
are employed to understand academic content (Freeman & Freeman 2017).

    Accordingly, in this chapter, we consider the need for a multilingual glossary
in the discipline of philosophy, drawing on previous work on socially just
pedagogies, decolonisation and our experience of creating such a glossary.
Having recognised the need for such a glossary, we (the authors of this
chapter) applied for and were awarded a fellowship to develop an OER in 2021
and 2022 by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural
Organization (UNESCO) Chair on Multimodal Learning and Open Educational
Resources at the North-West University (NWU) (cf. Chapter 1). Having created
a multilingual philosophy glossary, this chapter reflects both on why we
thought the creation of the glossary was needed and the process followed to
create it. To explain our process, we begin by unpacking the colonial
background against which the need for such glossaries arises and, thereafter,
consider the issue of language as a specific epistemic barrier. Finally, we turn
our attention to glossaries and OERs as means of addressing this specific
encumbrance, considering also the possible translation exigencies of projects
such as this one.

  The legacy of colonised curricula

In his article, The Struggle for Reason in Africa, Mogobe Ramose argues that
we cannot simply teach a philosophy that reflects and ratifies the white

                                                                                                                                             61
Multilingual philosophy glossaries: Steps towards socially just pedagogical praxis

people's experience but that we have to also teach African philosophy as both
a critique of racism and an affirmation that the black perspective `has been
devalued and omitted from' Western philosophy for ideological reasons
(Ramose 2003:7). The implication for classroom praxis and experience is
thus double: not only that Westernised canons do not reflect the lived
experiences of our students but also that not including African voices and
views carries with it the assumption that voices other than Western ones are
less than. As a call to decolonisation, this is a reminder that the expression of
self-determination lies, in part, in the `decolonization of imaginaries and of the
forms of representation' previously taken as given (Cusicanqui 2012:96). In
other words, it is the call for counter-narratives that can rupture what `appears
as a civilizational paradigm encompassing all domains of social life' which has
created strata of segregation, supremacy and discrimination that include the
economic, social and political spheres `but also cultural and epistemological
ones' (De Sousa Santos 2007:xix). As such, there is a need not only to challenge
and oppose existing paradigms but also for creating new critical theories and
emancipatory practices that incite and produce new subjectivities.
Decolonisation may, as such, be described as an `attempt to address systemic
or structural issues rather than merely the more apparent - if perhaps more
pressing - concerns, such as constitutional and legal rights, obligations and
support' (Van Heerden 2016b:7205).

    It is useful, here, to make a distinction between decoloniality and
decolonisation. Whilst the terms are often conflated and both traditions
present radical critiques of European dominion and assumed supremacy, as
well as their costly extraction practices - which extend not only to labour and
resources but also to knowledge, `where colonial subjects were classified as
the other in Europe's empire of reason' (Appadurai 2021 [emphasis added]) -
decoloniality and decolonisation in fact differ in terms of their scope and
emphasis. For decolonial proponents, such as Walter Mignolo and Catherine
Walsh, decoloniality does not succeed colonialism and coloniality; instead, it
`offers an alternative, one that is rooted in Indigenous thought and practice
about nature, community, and solidarity' (Appadurai 2021). This, as Indian
American anthropologist Arjun Appadurai argues, is a seductive vision, but
one which `rests on a reversal of the historical impact of capitalism and
colonialism' by seeking `to return us to an earlier period of precolonial splendor'
(Appadurai 2021). The problem with this kind of vision is that it smacks of
notions of the `noble savage' - as if precolonial peoples were not also capable
of the whole range of human emotions and capacities, including base and
vulgar ones. After all, even those lower tendencies and capacities are part of
our collective human heritage and should, as such, be regarded as belonging
to all of us, as part of our communal epistemic heritage. It is, for this reason,
that Appadurai sides with proponents of decolonisation, such as Achille
Mbembe, who, rather than arguing for a return to some imagined pure past,
urges us to `imagine a future based on our less-than-ideal present', requiring

us `to refashion the structures of race, power, and technology into a more
liberated relationship' in the here and now (Appadurai 2021).

    This kind of vision resonates with that of Frantz Fanon who, as early as 1961,
argued that the `proof of success' of decolonisation `lies in a whole structure
being changed from the bottom up' (Fanon 1963:35). As such, decolonisation
`sets out to change the order of the world' which, for Fanon, means it should be
seen as a historical process rather than a historical moment. As such, it cannot
`become intelligible nor clear to itself except in the exact measure that we can
discern the movements which give it historical form and content' (Fanon
1963:36). The objective of decolonisation can thus be described as a historical
process aimed at reconceptualising and re-enacting ways of knowing, being
and seeing previously excluded from or considered incompatible with
Eurocentric normative social orders, frameworks and dominant conceptions,
and which recognise the intersection between classes, ethnicities, races, sexual
differences, territories and so on. At the same time, there is a growing recognition
of the role played by capitalism and neoliberalism and the need for re-envisioning
and realising democracy outside of free market `conceptions of individual
agency and state government' (Talpade Mohanty 2003:8). What we see here,
then, is the need to resist single-focus narratives that replace one grand vision
with another. Instead, people like Fanon, Mbembe and Chandra Talpade Mohanty
urge us to affirm the heterogeneities and complexities of our many different
lived experiences. So too does Boaventura De Sousa Santos (2014) when he
says that `the understanding of the world by far exceeds the Western
understanding of the world' (p. viii). According to him, however, many of these
understandings were `murdered' as a result of European expansion - an act
which De Sousa Santos calls epistemicide. But epistemicide is in fact more than
just the `murder of knowledge' - it also involves `the destruction of the social
practices and the disqualifications of the social agents that operate according
to such knowledges' (De Sousa Santos 2014:153).

    When it comes to epistemological practices, we should also be careful not
to conflate coloniality and colonisation and what they did to our understanding
of knowledge-making with actual practices of knowledge production which
are, after all, a collective endeavour. Is not all knowledge collectively produced?
Does not all knowledge belong to all of us? And should the decolonising
project not, therefore, also entail a questioning of reductive propertarian
views of knowledge in favour of an epistemic undercommons as Stefano
Harney and Fred Moten (2013:28) name the space and time which is always-
already here whenever `the commons give refuge' and `the refuge gives
commons'? In a different but related register, Caribbean philosopher Édouard
Glissant (1997:11) calls this kind of epistemic undercommons a `poetics of
relation', where `each and every identity is extended through a relationship
with the Other'. In this extended relationality, the dominant figure is neither
that of the traveller, nor that of the discoverer, nor that even of the conqueror
but, rather, that of the errant who `strives to know the totality of the world yet

                                                                                                                                            63

already knows'; this can never be accomplished, all the whilst acknowledging
that this, precisely, is `where the threatened beauty of the world resides'
(Glissant 1997:20). Following Glissant, errantry `challenges and discards the
universal - this generalizing edict that summarized the world as something
obvious and transparent, claiming for it one presupposed sense and one
destiny' (Glissant 1997:20). In place of such universals that deny heterogeneous
experience in favour of totalitarian worldviews, errantry `plunges into the
opacities' of the world (Glissant 1997:20). Thus, decolonisation, from the point
of view of errantry - which is to say from the point of view of the wayward,1
the liminal, the undercommons - is expansionist in view: pan-Africanist rather
than parochial and nationalist. It is in this spirit of expanding knowledge that
we turn to the issue of language, again drawing on Glissant who, in his work,
`attempts to create an epistemology with which to understand the complex
nature of African diasporic culture' and particularly Creolised cultures in the
Caribbean (Mulira 2015:115). To do this, Glissant, in Poetics of Relation, takes
his readers back to the slave ship, `the incubator of Caribbean culture' (Mulira
2015:116), and calls on them to (Glissant 1997):

    Imagine two hundred human beings crammed into a space barely capable of
    containing a third of them. Imagine vomit, naked flesh, swarming lice, the dead
    slumped, the dying crouched. Imagine, if you can, the swirling red of mounting to
    the deck, the ramp they climbed, the black sun on the horizon, vertigo, this dizzying
    sky plastered to the waves. Over the course of more than two centuries, twenty,
    thirty million people deported. Worn down, in a debasement more eternal than
    apocalypse. But that is nothing. (pp. 5-6)

Once docked - wherever that might be - the dispossessed had to find new
ways to keep on living, to survive despite not knowing what the future held.
`Hailing from different ethnic backgrounds and realities', the now enslaved
Africans had to find:

    [W]ays to weave the fragmented pieces of their past into a cultural fabric that
    could support their lives in a foreign land. Over time, this fabric became Creole
    culture as we know it today. (Mulira 2015:116)

It is perhaps needless to say that Caribbean culture is not exactly African
culture, but the Caribbean exists because Africa exists - and there is something
we can learn here about what Glissant calls créolité (or creoleness): how, in a
territory, despite the many different linguistic and cultural backgrounds forced
into divergent socio-political dynamics, a rhythm emerged that formed `the
basis for a style of life' (Glissant 1997:63). Drawing on these theories, we asked
ourselves: How can we forge this kind of créolité in our classrooms? And how
can this, in turn, help us ameliorate at least some of the epistemic barriers
created by language in our classrooms? It is here, then, that the idea of a
multilingual glossary comes to the fore.

1. Here we think of Saidiya Hartman's important work Wayward Lives, Beautiful Experiments (2019), for example.

  Language as epistemic barrier and carrier of
  epistemic injustice

Philosopher Miranda Fricker (2007) describes epistemic injustice as the
wrongdoing done to a person in their capacity as a knower or epistemic subject,
which we argue extends also to their capacity as knowledge producer. Ian James
Kidd, José Medina and Gaile Pohlhaus (2017:1) expand this definition by describing
epistemic injustice as `unfair treatment that relates to issues of knowledge,
understanding, and participation in communicative practices'. Recently, Fricker
expanded her initial definition by arguing that epistemic injustice is not only
discriminatory but also distributive in nature - meaning it is not just inequitable in
terms of access but also in terms of uneven dissemination (Fricker 2013:1318,
2017:53). There are, of course, many examples of how epistemic injustice is both
discriminatory and distributive, though language is perhaps one of the most
prominent examples receiving international attention in literature at the moment
(see Da Costa 2021; Rees Kind & Newton 2019; Vargas-Bello-Pérez & Hernández-
Castellano 2019). One of the reasons for this is that language is the foremost
vehicle for disseminating and cognitively synthesising and integrating information,
whether online or as part of classroom instruction. However, in South Africa, as
we have noted, most instruction takes place in English, even though many of our
students are not first-language English-speakers. This poses a significant obstacle
to students' knowledge intake and in fact their entire experience of HE where it
is not only the case that English is the language of instruction but also that of
their educational milieu more broadly. The effects of this cannot be
underestimated - or overstated - because how we make sense of ourselves, our
place in the world and the world at large are directly influenced by language.
When language becomes an instrument of ghettoisation, it has a direct effect on
students' capacities to know and produce knowledge. It is clear, then, that
language is an epistemic barrier and contributor to epistemic injustice, especially
given that South Africa is a multilingual society where two languages are of
Germanic origin (Afrikaans and English), with the remaining seven being of Sintu
origin (siSwati, Sesotho sa Leboa, Xitsonga Setswana, Sepedi, Tshivenda, isiXhosa,
isiNdebele and isiZulu). How to deal with students from diverse backgrounds
with various levels of English competency is not only a challenge for students but
also for lecturers - one that is exacerbated by discipline-specific language or
jargon. This is not to say that jargon is `bad' - it is often very necessary - but the
point is that we need to find ways to be more epistemically just in our classrooms.
Philosophy is a good point in case, as it is a discipline riddled with jargon, often
from Western philosophical traditions (analytic and continental), such as those
being taught at South African universities. Although the use of jargon itself is not
problematic, it does become so if a student does not have the means to translate
these terms into their first language, or at least a language they are comfortable
learning in. At this point, jargon becomes an epistemic barrier, not only because
it hinders understanding but also because it creates problems in terms of the

                                                                                                                                            65
Multilingual philosophy glossaries: Steps towards socially just pedagogical praxis

reproduction of knowledge in tests and exams. Besides demotivating students
because of low marks, this can also deter class participation and lower students'
general confidence and motivation. In fact, research conducted by Vittorio
Tramontin et al. (2015) found that students whose mother tongues were not
English emphasised language `as highly affecting their performance due to the
fact that they experienced problems in understanding lecturers' explanations
and were mostly prevented from participating in classroom discussion and asking
questions' (p. 23). Clearly, language is an epistemic barrier and vehicle of
distributive epistemic injustice. So, how might we overcome these persistent
epistemic injustices in our pedagogical praxis? One way in which to start
overcoming the language barrier, in our view, is through the translation of key
concepts - especially discipline-specific jargon - in glossaries.

   A practical suggestion: Multilingual glossaries

Against the background of colonisation and apartheid, the issue of language
is not a trifle one, and it should be clear to readers by now that language
remains a prominent epistemological barrier to many students in South Africa,
impeding their capacity as knowers and knowledge producers. The challenge
for pedagogues and students alike is thus to challenge `existing ways of
knowing and the power attached to certain forms of knowledge' and
knowledge production (Gray van Heerden 2018:26). However, as Donna
Haraway (1988) explains, it also entails an understanding that the:

    [K]nowing self is partial in all its guises, never finished, whole, simply there and
    original; it is always constructed and stitched together imperfectly, and therefore
    able to join with another, to see together without claiming to be another.
    (pp. 586-587)

Nonetheless, whilst it is helpful to remember that we are all knowers in the
making and that we produce knowledge together, it is imperative that we try
to provide contexts that lend themselves to making such knowledge
production as equal as possible for all participants. That is, how we produce
knowledge together should be interrogated as much as who produces it,
which led us to create an OER in the form of a multilingual glossary for our
discipline, philosophy, to be made available online.

    By availing key terms to students, students are empowered to learn in a
self-directed manner because they can read the terms in their mother tongues
and incorporate them into their own epistemic world. Moreover, creating and
using multilingual glossaries is a useful tool for challenging existing paradigms
and aiding new forms of knowledge co-production. Having said that, openly
available online glossaries in philosophy are a dime a dozen (e.g. Axtell et al.
n.d.; Dahnke & Dreher 2016; Perry, Bratman & Fischer 2007; The Basics of
Philosophy 2008), but most of these glossaries have two shortcomings that
we attempted to address. Firstly, these glossaries focus mostly on

66
                                                                                                                                 Chapter 4

Anglo-American (or analytic) philosophy and, secondly, they are available
only in English. Our glossary addresses these shortcomings by including terms
from African and Continental philosophy and making the glossary available in
three additional languages to English, namely isiZulu, Setswana and Afrikaans.
Our glossary can therefore also be seen as a project in localisation because it
takes terms that are usually only available in English (and perhaps Afrikaans),
and provides the terms and/or the definitions in the local languages that are
relevant to our students. It is especially this latter aspect that distinguishes
our glossary from the majority of those available online.

    Because our glossary is an OER, it is useful, at this juncture, to briefly
discuss OERs before turning to the actual glossary. UNESCO (2021) defines
OERs as:

    [T]eaching, learning and research materials in any medium - digital or otherwise -
    that reside in the public domain or have been released under an open license that
    permits no-cost access, use, adaptation and redistribution by others with no or
    limited restrictions.

The term was coined in 2002 by UNESCO with the goal of providing access to
quality education (SDG 4) as a way to contribute to peace, sustainable and
economic development, as well as intercultural dialogue (UNESCO 2021).
Open educational resources fulfil their own social justice (cf. Chapter 2) ends -
because education drives social change, and OERs provide `educational
resources at the most convenient place/location and cost', it follows that the
wider inclusivity and non-discriminatory design of OERs contribute to social
justice ends (Ochieng & Gyasi 2021:107-108). As Vollan Ochieng and Razak
Gyasi (2021:109) argue, the academic practice of freely sharing resources for
HE purposes encompasses the social justice ideals of fairness and equity.
A similar argument is put forth by Virgina Clinton-Lisell et al. (2021:317) who
hold that OERs `serve as tools to improve teaching and learning and promote
social justice in higher education'. As such, it is a practical response to
epistemic injustice.

    Cheryl Ann Hodgkinson-Williams and Henry Trotter (2018:205) warn,
however, that OERs face unique challenges in the Global South. For example,
structural inequalities may, in some cases, hamper the social justice ideals of
OERs. This `implies that educators and students in the Global South may be
impeded from full participation by the lack of access to necessary educational
infrastructure and materials', which include aspects `such as adequate buildings
for instruction, uninterrupted power supply, functional technological equipment,
affordable and stable connectivity and access to requisite educational materials'
(Hodgkinson-Williams & Trotter 2018:207). In addition, `the current domination
of Western-oriented epistemic perspectives' as well as the `proliferation of
hegemonic English-language' OERs (Hodgkinson-Williams & Trotter 2018:207)
may hamper Global South educators and students in terms of what Nancy
Fraser (2009:16) calls participatory parity. She defines participatory parity as

                                                                                                                                            67
Multilingual philosophy glossaries: Steps towards socially just pedagogical praxis

the `most general meaning of justice' because it `requires social arrangements
that permit all to participate as peers in social [and educational] life'. All of
these aspects highlight the importance of creating OERs in local languages and
from alternative epistemic positions.

    It seems to us that creating multilingual glossaries not only addresses
epistemic injustice but also improves participatory parity by creating the
conditions for créolité to emerge and form the basis of a new socio-political and
educational space that welcomes all participants more equally in the classroom
- in our case, the philosophy classroom. Besides the legacies of colonialism and
apartheid, the history of the NWU itself makes it a pertinent place for the creation
of such resources. Between 1951 and 2004, the NWU was known as Potchefstroom
Universiteit vir Christelike Hoër Onderwys (Potchefstroom University for
Christian Higher Education), and its language of instruction was mainly Afrikaans.
However, the university has an even more contentious history when it comes to
language. Many readers may be aware that Potchefstroom Universiteit vir
Christelike Hoër Onderwys merged with the University of Bophuthatswana to
become the NWU in 2004. However, by 2013 most lectures were still conducted
in Afrikaans, with non-Afrikaans students able to receive lessons only through
translation headsets (Nkosi 2013). This did not only cause linguistic discomfort
but also contributed to racial tension (John 2013). In 2018, a new language policy
was adopted (NWU 2018). Broadly, this policy encourages the use of `functional
multilingualism' where `sensitivity is shown towards the language preferences,
language needs and language expectations of individuals and groups that have
an interest in the institution' (NWU 2018:2). The policy also states that `within the
parameters of the principle of functional multilingualism English, Setswana,
Sesotho and Afrikaans are employed as official languages of the NWU' (NWU
2018:2). It is still the case, however, that some lectures continue to be given in
Afrikaans, with English translation being offered to those who might need it.
Keeping in mind the goals of this policy, the original aim in the creation of our
glossary was to provide key terms and concepts as well as their definitions in the
four official languages of the NWU.

    After some consultation, however, we decided to replace Sesotho with
isiZulu, as Setswana and Sesotho are fairly similar and including isiZulu broadens
the reach of the glossary. In future, however, the hope is to translate it into all
official languages of South Africa. Once these decisions had been made, we
compiled a list of common philosophical terms and concepts, aiming to strike a
balance between those commonly used in philosophy courses and those we
use in our own courses. This resulted in a term bank of roughly 110 terms and
concepts, after which we compiled definitions for them, drawing, where
possible, on extant OERs, such as the glossary of philosophy made available
through, for example, Wikipedia (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_
philosophy) and entries in the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (https://
plato.stanford.edu/index.html). Definitions garnered from other OERs were
added to a Google Docs file that was shared between us. As subject specialists,

68
                                                                                                                                 Chapter 4

we all took turns to read, edit and amend the definitions. Google Docs allows
for real-time collaboration and discussion using the `comments' feature. Where
suitable definitions could not be found, they were created using our subject
knowledge. It is important to note that the glossary remains a work in progress.
Thus, whilst the initial glossary was set up by the four authors of this chapter,
we will be incorporating feedback from students and other lecturers in future.

    Once the list was approved by all the members of the team, a website
(saphilglossary.com) was created (see Figure 4.1). The website was released
under a Creative Commons Attribution-Non Commercial-Share Alike 4.0

International License. It is worth mentioning here that the designer we chose
has a long history of working on educational materials and went to great
lengths to further our goal of accessibility by including specific design
elements to this end. For example, in terms of typography, the font noto serif
was used to increase legibility on screens. Additionally, the font colour was a
`muted' black rather than a pure black against an off-white rather than stark
white background to reduce the harsh contrast and aid readability.

    Going forward, the plan is to continue to grow the glossary, both in terms of
the number of languages it is translated into and the number of terms that are
used. In addition, we hope to create audio recordings to help with the pronunciation
of key terms. We also welcome feedback on the `Contact' page in the hope of
having a collaborative space to improve and expand on the glossary.

  Some translation considerations

Translating terms into African languages is indubitably a complex process but
one that cannot be put on hold if we want to ensure epistemic justice and
participatory parity. However, as Moragh Paxton (2009:345) argues, students
already engage with concepts multilingually by code-switching between
English and their primary languages in order to better grasp unfamiliar
concepts (cf. Chapter 2). That being said, many difficulties remain when it
comes to enacting multilingualism, one being diminishing resources, especially
as universities are increasingly being treated as businesses with little incentive
to implement transformation policies (Mesthrie 2008:328). Other difficulties
pertain to translation itself, for example considering how to minimise translation
losses and balance the inevitable losses with translation gains so that concepts
and terms maintain their integrity as far as possible, especially in the case of
lexical gaps or the lack of direct translation equivalents. Yet even when there
are similar concepts in different languages and cultures, it sometimes happens
that the words that make those concepts concrete do not exist or hold
meaning in exactly the same way. In epistemology, engaging with the
universality theory can assist us here. The universality theory is the claim that

    [T]he epistemic properties referred to by the English epistemic verb `know'
    contained in the expressions of the form `S knows that p' or `S knows how to '
    are shared by the translations of the epistemic verb in all other languages, such as
    Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Russian, and so on. (Tsai & Lien 2018:267)

But, as Cheng-Hung Tsai and Chinfa Lien argue, if it can be shown that there
is an epistemic property in the Chinese verb form of  (`know') that cannot
be found in the English, then this would go to some lengths to show that the
universality theory does not necessarily hold for all cases of semantic primes -
concepts thought to be in their simplest terms, cross-translatable between
different languages, and innately and universally understood.

70
                                                                                                                                 Chapter 4

Put simply, semantic primes are thought to have lexical equivalents in every
human language, meaning the verb equivalents `know' (English), ukwazi
(isiZulu) and  (Chinese) are not only lexically equivalent but also carry the
same epistemic properties. Although `know' seems to be the same across
languages, the abstract noun `knowledge' - that is, to `think about' or `know
about' (ulwazi in isiZulu) - does not seem to function quite the same in every
language, nor to hold exactly the same meanings across languages, making
translation more difficult. Another such word is `believe'. In isiZulu, ukukholwa
can mean `spiritually' or `faith-based'. It can also be used as the verb `to believe
in' or `belief of something', translated as ukholwa ukuthi and ukholelwa
ekutheni, respectively. In English, however, the word `believe' is used to reflect
the `folk epistemology embedded in modern English', meaning `the word
believe (or belief)' is `not semantically simple' and therefore not easily `cross-
translatable' because it carries `a highly language-specific set of meanings,
complicated patterns of polysemy, and a complicated grammatical profile'
(Goddard 2020:140). The English phrase `I don't believe we have met' can, for
example, be translated into isiZulu as `angikholwa sisake sahlangana', but the
English phrase `I believe we have met' - translated as `ngikholwa ukuthi sisake
sahlangana' - makes no sense in isiZulu because the use of the word believe
is not proper in this sense. The appropriate syntax for this translation would
be `ngicaba ukuthi sisake sahlanga', roughly translatable as `I think we have
met' in English. We see here that for the universality theory to hold, it needs
to be fair to all languages. It therefore makes more sense to use terms that are
semantically simple. Yet this is not always possible - especially for philosophy
glossaries filled with jargon, as we have seen.

    Translating from English to Afrikaans poses a different challenge, namely
that much of the philosophical terms do not exist in Afrikaans. However,
Afrikaans allows for the use of anglicisms, which proved pragmatic in the
construction of the glossary. For example, `anti-natalism' was translated into
`anti-natalisme', `determinism' to `determinisme' and `ethical egoism' to `etiese
egoïsme'. Even for a person with no understanding of Afrikaans, it is obvious
that these words relate strongly to the English equivalent. The reason for this
is that both English and Afrikaans are Germanic languages, making translation
easier vis-à-vis anglicisms than it would be from English to Sintu languages.

    The preceding discussion illustrates why Walter Benjamin argues that `no
translation would be possible' if it strove for perfect `similarity to the original'
(Benjamin 2012:77) because the original itself changes in translation to gain
an `afterlife' (Benjamin 2012:76). At best, then, the translator's task `is to find
the intention toward the language into which the work is to be translated, on
the basis of which an echo of the original is awakened in it' over and over
again (Benjamin 2012:79). It is for this reason that Coetzee (2013:1), in Accented
Futures, argues `against translation' in favour of what she terms accentedness.
In other words, the translator `has to resist the homogenised (orientalised,

                                                                                                                                             71
Multilingual philosophy glossaries: Steps towards socially just pedagogical praxis

some might say as a shorthand) representation of ourselves/themselves, and
offer, instead, heterogeneity and a refusal of essence' (Coetzee 2013:3).
This `refusal to translate' (Coetzee 2013):

    [M]ay be viewed as a reclaiming of social agency by the translator in that it requires
    writing and translation not to be solely about cultural transfer and the manipulation
    of linguistic conventions or semantic content, but instead to be.(p. 3)

That is, an ethical, affective, linguistic and cognitive `orientation' (Van Heerden
2016a:94). Put differently, accentedness - as an ethical orientation - asks us to
`question the historicity of abstract codes (such as master narratives) and be
situational' and relational in our translation practices, taking into `consideration
the complexities of the legacies or our disciplines that are always linked to
"specific narratives and power structures"' (Van Heerden 2016a:95).

  Conclusion

This chapter looked at some of the effects of colonialism and apartheid on
current educational practices. It is our argument that the dominance of English
as the medium of instruction creates certain constraints for students, particularly
in terms of their capacity as knowers and knowledge producers. Accordingly,
language can be viewed as an epistemic barrier that is both discriminatory and
distributive in nature - meaning it is prejudiced in terms of access and uneven
dissemination. This is not solely a problem for students, however. We see this as
a challenge for pedagogues too, one which asks us to challenge existing power
structures and the manner in which they inform our ways of seeing, knowing
and being. Having said this, we recognise that limited resources mean that it is
not possible to have a lecturer in every language for every module. It is for this
reason that we propose the creation of subject-specific glossaries to help
bridge the gap between the language of instruction and the mother tongues of
students. At the time of writing, the glossary has been included on some of our
class sites on our learning management system (LMS) as an additional resource.
Students were informed of this resource either in class or via an announcement.
Anecdotally, students have reported finding the glossary useful, but there has
not been a sustained inquiry into this yet.

    In closing, we hold that openly licensed subject-specific glossaries promote
multilingualism and translanguaging class practices which can be seen as the
enactment of more socially just pedagogical praxis. We acknowledge, however,
that the creation of glossaries presents certain translation exigencies which
need to be taken into consideration. Thus, we argue for what Coetzee (2013)
calls accentedness - an ethical orientation to translation that resists homogenised
representations and questions the historicity of abstract codes and master
narratives, aiming for more situational, relational and ethical praxis instead.

Developing oral communication skills in a foreign language is difficult given that
the average foreign-language learner mostly functions in an environment with
limited classroom time and few speaking opportunities. A technology-enhanced

target language and opportunities for students to foster self-directedness.
However, software that could facilitate the creation of context-specific content
for such an environment is not readily available. This necessitated the creation
of an open educational resource (OER) software package which meets
the needs of the teacher and content creator and the language learner.
To create a practice environment that is contextualised, meaningful and
integrated into the broader teaching and learning context, activities should be
planned in an informed and structured way. This chapter describes the different
phases involved in creating a context-sensitive OER - a process that is based on
sound instructional design (ID) principles and general open educational
practices (OEPs).

  Introduction

Communication relies heavily upon spoken language, and the development
of this skill therefore deserves the same attention in the language learning
process as written language skills (Clancy & Murray 2016). Although spoken
interaction is seen as the most difficult skill to master when learning a foreign
language (Mystkowska-Wiertelak 2011; eds. Pawlak, Waniek-Klimczak &
Majer 2011; Salcedo-Viteri, Pinza-Tapia & Toro 2021) and a skill that represents
and benefits an encompassing knowledge of a foreign language (Pawlak
2011; Pica et al. 1996) at most South African universities - as is the case in
other contexts - students learning a foreign language have very few
opportunities to develop these skills because of different constraints: a
limited number of contact sessions per week and the lack of interaction with
other speakers of the language in their local environment (Helmke et al.
2007; Ko 2012; Pino James 2013). A need for more opportunities at local
institutions to practise oral communication in French has long been firmly
established (Delena-le Roux 2010). Focusing more intently on oral
interactional competence is particularly important in the current educational
climate where online teaching & learning seems to have a negative impact
on the development of oral communication skills (Alcalde Peñalver & García
Laborda 2021).

    From the perspective of beginner students in French at a local university
(in this case, the North-West University [NWU], South Africa), oral interactional
competence has been identified as the most desired skill to master when
learning a foreign language. In this study, 64% of respondents listed spoken
interaction as the main priority in foreign language learning, and pronunciation
was identified as a skill that merits special attention (Grobler & Smits 2016).
These findings correlate with the finding of studies that were conducted in
other contexts, such as Texas and Georgia in the United States of America
(USA) (Swanson & Nolde 2011; Volle 2005) and Nottingham in the United
Kingdom (UK) (Stollhans 2015).

Because the average foreign language learner must function in an environment
where teaching hours are limited and classroom conditions are not conducive
to speaking, developing spoken interactional skills remains challenging
(Alrabadi 2011; Mystkowska-Wiertelak 2011). There is thus a need for more
time-on-task exposing students to the target language - hearing the language
and producing the language themselves. One must keep in mind that the
extent to which target language input and feedback are provided has an
influence on language acquisition (Doughty 2003).

    The challenge is compounded by the limited number of appropriate
resources to support the development of oral interactional skills. Available
resources for beginner learners of French as a foreign language are either
limited to users of a specific French textbook or its content or progression do
not correspond to that of the modules offered at the different institutions and
no adaptation of the content was possible. Neither adopting nor adapting an
existing educational resource was thus not an option (cf. OERs in the broader
educational context). To address this problem, it was decided to create
context-specific OERs that would provide a platform and content that would
support the development of students' oral communication skills in French in
an out-of-class environment.

    These OERs include a three-part software package and its accompanying
content that are aligned with the learning outcomes for the specific level of
competency. When referring to the content aspect of the OERs specifically,
the aims were to identify the pertinent activities and their associated tasks
that should form the basis of a practice environment that promotes the
development of oral communication skills and to determine the best way to
organise these activities and tasks.

    This study, therefore, addressed two research questions: (1) What activities
and tasks should be included when designing an OER that aims to develop
beginner language learners' oral communication skills?; and (2) how should
these activities and tasks be organised to create a research-based learning
experience? Open education practices and strategies to foster self-
directedness were the main preoccupation in the dual process of identifying
these activities and tasks and creating the software to support the out-of-
class practice environment.

  Openness: Educational resources, education
  and educational practices

The practice of sharing educational resources in many ways predates the
labelling of these as OERs at the 2002 Open Courseware in Higher Education
forum hosted by United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural
Organization (UNESCO). Since then, much work and collective effort have

                                                                                                                                            75

gone into fleshing out what OERs are and what role they play in different
sectors. This culminated in the adoption of a global standard for OERs at the
UNESCO General Conference in 2019: to `support[s] the creation, use and
adaptation of inclusive and quality OER, and facilitate[s] international
cooperation in this field' (UNESCO 2019).

    A definitive description of what an OER is, is not yet formulated, however.
Standardisation in the definition of the concept of `OER' would go a long way
to support the expansion of OERs given that it would provide a shared
understanding of what an OER is and is not. Various definitions are provided
to contextualise and stress the importance to allow for non-restrictive
interpretation of OERs in general.

UNESCO (2019) defines OERs as being:

    [...] learning, teaching and research materials in any format and medium that
    reside in the public domain or are under copyright that have been released under
    an open license, that permit no-cost access, re-use, re-purpose, adaptation, and
    redistribution by others.

The Creative Commons' (CC) definition echoes the UNESCO perspective and
describes OERs as:

    [...] teaching, learning, and research materials that are either (a) in the public
    domain or (b) licensed in a manner that provides everyone with free and perpetual
    permission to engage in the 5R activities. (CC n.d.)

The 5R activities refer to the `open' aspect elements such as retain, revise,
remix, reuse and redistribute that correlate with those mentioned in the CC
definition of OERs as what an open license permits. Retain is, however, an
expansion of UNESCO's access, as it opens up the possibility for the user to
`own' a reproduction of the work (CC Wiki 2020; CC n.d.; Wiley n.d.).

    The Hewlett Foundation supports the CC view when defining OERs as
`teaching, learning, and research resources that reside in the public domain or
have been released under an intellectual property license that permits their
free use and re-purposing by others' (Hewlett Foundation 2015). Another
interpretation of OERs is done by Kawachi (2013). The 2002 UNESCO definition
of an OER is interpreted as `a small technology-enabled self-contained unit of
self-assessable teaching with an explicit measurable learning objective, being
at some point in time in digital electronic format and generally free-of-cost to
use' (Kawachi 2013:7, 12). This means that assessment questions and their
answers are integrated into the OER, and it is preferable that these questions
are open-response questions rather than multiple choice, for example
(Kawachi 2013:7).

    When looking at the Hewlett Foundation's previous definition of OERs, one
sees more specific examples of what could constitute an OER: `[...] full courses,
course materials, modules, textbooks, streaming videos, tests, software, and

76
                                                                                                                                 Chapter 5

any other tools, materials, or techniques used to support access to knowledge'
(Hewlett Foundation 2016). Though clearly sharing the broad definition of
what an OER is, the removal of the practical examples by the Hewlett
Foundation could be seen as inadvertently limiting what could be classified as
an OER, as it provided a rare explicit classification of software as an OER,
which is an area of interest for this chapter.

    When looking at the different elements encapsulated within the notion of
`OERs', `open' refers to instances where constraints that vary from cost, place
and time to language, people and ideas are `minimised compared with
alternative practices' (Kawachi 2013:9). The Hewlett Foundation - a foundation
actively involved in funding development and creating awareness of OERs -
defines `open education' as `the myriad of learning resources, teaching
practices and education policies that use the flexibility of OERs to provide
learners with high-quality educational experiences' (Hewlett Foundation
2022). This also alludes to where OERs may fit in educational practices and
how that can play a role in providing the desired high-quality educational
experiences. Open education is also defined as `encompassing resources,
tools and practices to improve educational access, effectiveness, and equality
worldwide' (Cronin & MacLaren 2018:127).

    Open education (or open pedagogy) is considered to be a subset and a
central element of OEP (Cronin & MacLaren 2018; Olivier 2020). Definitions of
OEPs vary widely, but either the creation or both the creation and use of
OERs is always included (Cronin & MacLaren 2018; Olivier 2020). Wider
definitions of OEPs refer to practices such as constructive engagement with
content, tools and services; working in teams; promoting learners' self-
management - also a salient aspect of self-directedness; sharing of teaching
ideas; and respecting and empowering students to become co-producers of
learning (Cronin & MacLaren 2018).

    This chapter provides a reflective report on the creation of a software
package and its related content. At its core, the software is an unpopulated
environment that allows teachers to create content for language learning
activities. These learning activities would allow learners to work towards
obtaining the objectives identified at a specific point in their foreign language
curriculum. In this way, the software constitutes an OER that can integrate
and expand beyond its original self-contained design. It could be argued that
the custom-designed software on its own cannot be described as a `self-
contained unit of self-assessable teaching' (Kawachi 2013:7, 12) and that it
does not strictly qualify as learning, teaching and research material in the
sense that it could be used independently. However, this chapter shows its
value as an OER by examining how it was designed, how it can be used in
conjunction with context-specific content and how it integrates within a
broader educational context.

                                                                                                                                            77
Designing an open educational resource for oral interactional competence

  Managing the open educational resource
  design process

The definitions and context provided as part of the section `Openness:
Educational resources, education and educational practices' provide a broad
starting point when embarking on OER design. However, elements pertaining
to integrating quality management as part of the creation process still require
more reflection and prominence when defining what an effective OER is or
what quality standards an OER should ideally adhere to. This can shift the
focus to integrating quality management as part of the OER design process
(rather than evaluating an OER post creation) and would ensure adherence to
UNESCO's global standard of `equality OER' (UNESCO 2019).

    There are several aspects to consider when creating an OER for a specific
context. This is particularly pertinent, because the challenges associated with
OERs are no longer limited to their availability and accessibility but have long
since shifted to their `area of use', for example, skill demand for OER usage
and learning design of OERs (Ehlers 2011).

   Open educational resources in the broader
   educational context

When considering OERs as defined by Kawachi (2013), the self-contained
nature of an OER as well as its specific learning objective are stressed. One
could argue that this would contribute to ensuring that an OER is a well-
rounded learning artefact that can be used for the specific learning purpose
for which it is designed. This approach would provide new OER creators
with a clear focus on what is expected and would guide OER development
for their specific context. However, this view puts less emphasis on what is
one of the strongest contributions that OERs bring to the educational
domain, which is its reusability and adaptability. Viewing an OER in isolation -
even in the case where it is a fully self-contained artefact - has the potential
to limit its future usability for different contexts and levels of learning, as it
would limit the OER's potential to be reused, revised, remixed and
redistributed (Wiley 2013).

    It could be argued that it would be more beneficial to first know what
OERs already exist and rather focus on adapting or creating bridging
content for a specific learning artefact to contextualise it within the specific
learning programme for which an OER is created in the first place. This
would ensure better positioning of the contribution within the broader
educational context. This would allow for much more efficient use of limited
time, energy and financial resources in the development of OERs, especially
in resource-constrained environments such as South Africa (Godongwana
2022).

   Considerations for integrating an open educational
   resource in a learning environment

Building on the idea that OER development should take into consideration
what is already available before `reinventing the wheel', one should ask what
approaches would enable and support the future reuse and adaptation of an
envisioned OER. In this section, the authors propose and discuss three
integration concepts that would assist in framing non-isolative OER
development: horizontal expansion, vertical integration and elements of
cross-domain integration.

   Horizontal expansion

When referring to horizontal expansion, the focus lies on the creation of more
of the same content on a specific learning level. Within the context of foreign
language learning, an OER artefact could entail a lesson plan with specific
examples that can be used to test and hone students' understanding and
subsequent application of content shared with learners. This could include
efforts to contextualise OER materials using relevant examples, or purely the
addition of more examples and content at a particular level that expands the
availability of material that can be provided.

   Vertical integration

Vertical integration can be explained as how an OER can be inserted at a
specific point on a student's learning pathway or as a specific building block
within a specific course (Great Schools Partnership 2013; Green et al. 2019).
Drawing from the domain of language learning, one OER may deal with
introducing oneself and greeting other people in the target language; the
next OER could then focus on places, things and asking for directions. In the
context of language learning, this systematically builds towards higher levels
of language competency. Students can gain greater autonomy if a sufficient
number of OERs are available for use in a self-directed manner in order to
achieve a specific learning objective (cf. Chapter 3).

    Horizontal expansion and vertical integration may be best illustrated using
a puzzle (Figure 5.1) as a metaphor where different OERs can systematically
cover a sufficient area or domain of learning that would provide the learner
with a complete picture of a specific domain or subfield in a domain such as
the content that forms part of a first-year course in French.

   Cross-domain integration

The level of cross-domain integration refers to how well an OER could be
transferred to different knowledge domains. At its simplest level, cross-domain

                                                                                                                                            79

FIGURE 5.1: A proposed approach to horizontal expansion and vertical integration of open educational
resources.

integration could, for example, entail re-using the OER or its structure. In the
case of the custom-designed software discussed in this chapter, which was
designed for use in a beginner's module in French, the OERs structure could
be used for a beginner's module in Setswana or another language-acquisition
context. This could also refer to how the OER could be adapted to learning-
specific skills that are central to other learning domains such as interpreting
studies, for example. What makes this especially challenging to plan for is that
the OER creators do not know what potential uses or adaptations the OER
might hold. This is especially true in the context of a software package that
forms an integral part of delivering specific content in a technology-enhanced
environment.

    One way to address this in part is to ensure that open-software development
standards are adhered to as part of the design process. This would ensure that
reuse and adaptation are possible in the future. This brings to the fore the
need to be clear on how software could support the creation of an OER and
how some custom platforms could be classified as an OER as proposed by the
authors earlier. One could argue that by seeing software only as part of the
technology-enhanced practice environment and not an OER itself limits ways
of encouraging the creation of such novel environments. The custom-designed
software package described later in this chapter not only enables the creation
of a self-contained learning artefact but is also part and parcel of the OER that
is used by a learner, as it delivers the content that is engaged and interacted
with and which also finally enables individualised feedback to a learner from
the teacher or facilitator.

Lastly, ensuring that all forms of expansion and integration can take place
would require good documentation to be present in the case of an open-
software package as well as the availability of relevant metadata accompanying
an existing OER. Metadata can be defined as information about a specific
artefact (Collins et al. 2022). In the context of an OER, this could be the scope
of content covered, the mediums in which the OER is available, its licencing
and its structure. In other words, ensuring good metadata would contribute
towards the openness of the artefact. The use of open standards, which assists
in keeping technologies `open', would also further the potential for cross-
domain integration (Red Hat 2022).

   Findable, accessible, interoperable and reusable
   principles and open educational resources

Together with the last-mentioned concepts, it may be useful to consider the
findable, accessible, interoperable and reusable (FAIR) principles in short as a
departure point to encapsulate these in the same way that the FAIR principles
have been put forward to better guide scientific data management and
stewardship (Wilkinson et al. 2016). The acronym FAIR aims to summarise
important principles when managing research data that must be FAIR. We
would argue that designing OERs with FAIR principles in mind can foster a
design focus that lies beyond the creation of a self-contained learning artefact
that could be used in the context of self-directed learning. The design includes
possibilities for reuse and adaptation beyond an artefact's original scope. The
following summary, with examples of using the FAIR principles in the context
of OERs, can guide design considerations for future OER users and reusers on
their OER creation journey.

   Findable open educational resources

Ensuring that OERs are easy to find is crucial; otherwise, they would not be
used. Platforms that host content should ensure adherence to good metadata
practices, such as the learning level of an OER (e.g. high school, undergraduate,
etc.). This can make it possible to find content or identify a lack thereof for a
specific domain at a specific learning level. Findability would differ between a
learner and user (i.e. teacher) of an OER. A user may require a broader
overview of what is available for specific learning outcomes and how these
may scaffold or be vertically integrated or horizontally expanded. It would be
equally important to ensure that the final artefact is described well enough to
enable a learner to find it and use it self-directedly.

    When considering software in this context, it goes beyond the downloadable
programme or app, as there is a need to ensure that the open-source code is
also available through a dedicated repository for programming code such as

                                                                                                                                             81
Designing an open educational resource for oral interactional competence

GitHub (GitHub 2022) that would enable further development and reuse by a
broader community.

   Accessible open educational resources

Accessibility primarily relates to the cost or the effort to gain access. YouTube's
educational videos may not compare favourably to a well-developed massive
online open course (MOOC) by a leading university, but it has the benefit of a
nearly zero barrier to access. For a user, this is also an important consideration:
where to place an OER? Is it or will it be shared in a way that promotes ease
of access to reuse, refine or adapt in the future?

    In the case of software, its accessibility is also an important consideration.
It is possible that the final software package or app can be downloaded
directly on a device via a link from an OER repository, but to enable further
development, additional access should be facilitated. This includes linking out
to the source code which could be reused or built upon using general version
control platforms such as GitHub or GitLab which allow for open public access.

   Interoperable open educational resources

When an OER creator designs with interoperability in mind, it would ensure
that future users are not locked into a specific platform or way to develop an
OER. The use of open standards and approaches are encouraged. This can aid
further vertical integration and horizontal expansion. As an example, one
could consider the TedEd platform (TedEd 2022) which is free and allows for
very easy adaptability to create a self-contained unit of learning, but it is not
interoperable beyond the point of embedding a fully contained unit on a
course website.

    In the software development context, adherence to open standards is
encouraged, as it would enhance interoperability. The use of open standards
would help to ensure that further development is possible, as the `way it works'
would be open and transparent. As an added benefit, these standards typically
do not attract royalties in the case of audio open (Opus 2017).

   Reusable open educational resources

For a user of an OER, its reusability remains the most crucial part. One could
argue that a so-called OER that limits its reuse through pricing, restrictive
licencing or general usage restrictions is not really an OER to begin with.
However, as contextualised by Petrides (2013), there are good reasons why
somewhat more restrictive licences may actually be required to protect the
open-source nature of the OER from commercial exploits. It is, therefore, not
that simple or clear-cut as, to rephrase Biswas-Diener (2017), a free OER does

82
                                                                                                                                 Chapter 5

not mean that it was free to produce (Biswas-Diener 2017; Elder 2020; Petrides
2013). The reuse of an OER lies at the core of OERs and should therefore be
one of the most important considerations when designing an OER. An
application or software package can be reused and reinstalled many times.
However, reuse in the context of software as an OER goes beyond just the
reuse of the application and includes the reuse of the source code to adapt or
extract elements that can be built into future development projects, which
aligns with the rationale of using free software in general (Free Software
Foundation 2021).

    The FAIR principles can provide an easy-to-use approach when developing
an OER by considering whether it would be consumable, reusable and
adaptable for use cases not yet known or conceived. This also links well with
ID principles, used as part of the OER design process described in this chapter,
which aim, through effective planning, to create a final learning artefact, or in
this context, OERs that can make a positive impact on the efficiency and
effectivity of language learning (Morrison et al. 2011).

    Important considerations for open educational resource design reflects on
the practical application of the design considerations discussed as part of the
design process followed for an OER as part of a technology-enhanced practice
environment.

  Important considerations for open
  educational resource design

In this section, the role and advantages of computer-assisted language
learning (CALL) are investigated. This is followed by a discussion on the
conversational framework (Laurillard 2012) and its role in determining the
different design elements that should be included when creating a teaching
and learning environment. Lastly, the domain of oral communication and,
more specifically, the elements that are fundamental to the development of
this skill are discussed.

   Computer-assisted language learning

Advantages offered by CALL and context-sensitive asynchronous computer-
mediated communication (ACMC) - especially at the beginning of language
learning - are widely recognised and include, for example, an increase in
student interaction, receiving both intrinsic and personalised extrinsic
feedback, allowing students to determine the pace at which they work and
enhancing student motivation (Almoshigeh 2022; Collentine & Collentine
1997; Laurillard 2012; Pino James 2013; Reinders & Hubbard 2013; Reinders &
Thomas 2014). Some of these advantages such as working at one's own pace

                                                                                                                                            83
Designing an open educational resource for oral interactional competence

and increased learning motivation are indicators of a higher level of student
self-directedness (Cheng et al. 2010; Knowles 1975). A technology-enhanced
practice environment could provide greater exposure to the target language
and more opportunities to practice speaking (Bluestein 2017), especially if the
practice environment is designed for out-of-class use. Software that could be
used in such an environment and that allows language teachers to create
context-specific content is, however, not readily available. Creating a context-
sensitive software package that addresses the specific needs in the process of
developing students' oral interactional competence and that aims to provide
support to students who are in the process of developing their oral interactional
skills in an out-of-class practice environment seems like a viable option to fill
the existing gap.

    An extensive literature review revealed the different components of a
technology-enhanced learning environment and the components that are
fundamental to the development of oral communication skills (Grobler 2020).
These components - for example, focused listening, extensive practice and
receiving feedback - served as the basis for the ID process described in the
section `Instructional design: Approach and method'. The theoretical
foundation of the broader teaching and learning environment, the different
elements of the software package and the motivation for including these
design features are discussed in the section `The conversational framework'
and the section `Elements specific to spoken interaction'.

   The conversational framework

To ensure a pedagogy-driven design approach, Laurillard's Conversation
Framework (CF) was used as a starting point in mapping the elements required
for the design of the different activities in the teacher-peer communication,
practice and modelling cycles that form an integral part of the CF (Laurillard
2002, 2012). The CF encompasses requirements from different approaches to
learning as well as design principles from the field of ID to clarify the role of
teachers and students (Laurillard 2012). Within the context of creating new
software, this translates into creating opportunities for students to generate
and share their productions with the teacher, exposing students to explicit
and implicit feedback, creating an environment that models the desired
outcomes, and creating a practice environment that facilitates student actions
(Grobler 2020; Laurillard 2012) - activities that once again promote self-
directed learning (also see the section `Computer-assisted language learning').

   Elements specific to spoken interaction

When designing a teaching intervention, the activities should be contextualised,
meaningful and integrated into the broader context (Pawlak 2011), and
elements that could contribute to the mastery of a language should be

84
                                                                                                                                 Chapter 5

identified and included in these teaching interventions so that students can
optimally learn the language. In the context of the study presented here, the
following elements were identified for inclusion in the design of the software.

   Productive and receptive activities

Speaking as a learning outcome is comprised of both oral production and oral
comprehension (Dumais, Lafontaine & Pharand 2015) and at the beginner
level, it is most advantageous to address oral and aural skills as a unit and in
equal measures (Clancy & Murray 2016; Eisenmann & Summer 2012). The new
software will provide ample opportunity for students to both listen to
recordings in French and participate in speaking activities, thus encouraging
learning.

   Focused listening

Including focused listening activities in a teaching intervention establishes a
balance between listening and speaking. This can be achieved by providing
recordings of either simulated conversations or assessments that have been
completed successfully and asking students to pay particular attention to
words or phrases in order to answer questions (Eisenmann & Summer 2012).
This is then followed by feedback on students' replies. Within the technology
environment created for the context of this study, focused listening will be
required when students listen to the questions they have to answer, and if
they struggle, they could listen to a pre-recorded simulated conversation to
identify the structures that are modelled.

   Extensive practice

By exposing students to practice - defined as `an opportunity learners receive
to perform the task at least twice, with the first performance treated as a
preparation for the one that follows' (Mystkowska-Wiertelak 2011:248) -
repetition and elaboration, they are given the opportunity to plan their
utterances. Having more time to plan leads to more fluent and more
grammatically correct utterances (Altarriba & Basnight-Brown 2009; Chen
2020). Procedural knowledge is acquired through extensive practice and
feedback and is subsequently more easily activated when producing speech
(cf. Heredia as cited in Altarriba & Basnight-Brown 2009; Morgan-Short et al.
2014). The custom-designed software will provide the students with ample
time to perform tasks for the first time and with opportunities to repeat their
contributions in the simulated practice environment. Elaboration on these
tasks will be integrated into the broader teaching and learning context by
asking students to make videos in pairs and to participate in an individual oral
with the teacher. The SDL domain of interpersonal communication (Cheng
et al. 2010) especially comes into play here.

                                                                                                                                            85
Designing an open educational resource for oral interactional competence

   Review of own oral production

Providing students with opportunities to review their own oral production
allows them to address challenges and difficulties, which leads to improved
performance, improved accuracy and spontaneous error correction (Dumais
et al. 2015; Song 2018). The technology-enhanced practice environment will
also allow students to compare their production with target-like outputs (i.e.
a model dialogue) and to evaluate the effectiveness of their learning strategies
(Mok et al. 2006; Ölmezer-Öztürk & Öztürk 2016). This provides an opportunity
for students to identify their own learning needs and to establish their
individual future learning goals, thus encouraging self-directed learning
(Knowles 1975) in the learning environment.

   Oral corrective feedback

Corrective feedback provides information on errors in student utterances, and
this enables students to monitor their learning (Bransford, Brown & Cocking
2000; Doughty 2003; Mohamed 2020). Delayed feedback offers the
advantage of not hindering direct communication, and it allows the teacher to
provide more comprehensive and individualised feedback (Ölmezer-Öztürk &
Öztürk 2016). In the case of this study, the focus is on providing personalised
oral corrective feedback on student productions, which could have the
additional benefit of improved pronunciation (Pino James 2013). The last
element, self-assessment, identified for inclusion in the design of the software
is discussed in the section `Self-assessment'.

   Self-assessment

Self-assessment is a continuous and dynamic process through which students
become self-directed learners who monitor and reflect on their performance,
learning behaviour and proficiency, and confront their weaknesses (De Saint
Léger 2009). By participating in self-assessment activities, students become
increasingly autonomous and self-regulated (Lew, Alwis & Schmidt 2009).
A compulsory self-assessment activity will be included at the end of a series
of activities done within the practice environment.

    In this section, an answer to research question 1 was provided by identifying
the activities and tasks that constitute the foundation of the content of an
OER. Next, a process of ID was implemented to guide the organisation of the
practice learning experience (cf. research question 2).

  Instructional design: Approach and method

This empirical study was based on a pragmatic research paradigm, thus
focusing on finding the best possible solution for a problem through a process

86
                                                                                                                                 Chapter 5

of action and reflection (Creswell & Poth 2018; De Vos et al. 2006; Newby
2014). Because a design-based research approach aligns well with a pragmatic
paradigm (Sloane 2006), it was decided to adopt this approach. This implies
doing research in a real-world setting and implementing iterative cycles to
test and refine a new learning environment, thus ensuring a quality product
(Kawachi 2013:13). This, in turn, results in new context-sensitive design
principles (Amiel & Reeves 2008; Wang & Hannafin 2005).

    A design-based research cycle consists of four phases: analysis,
development, testing and reflection (Amiel & Reeves 2008). During the first
phase, researchers and practitioners work together to analyse and identify
the practical problems and research goals. The second phase focuses on the
design and development of the new learning environment. This is then
implemented, tested and refined in the third phase and finally, the results are
used to redefine the problem and to evaluate the possible solutions in order
to create new designs in the fourth phase (Amiel & Reeves 2008; Wang &
Hannafin 2005).

    To strengthen the ID process, a model of ID was included. The design
process of ID models is a theory-based decision-making process that guides
researchers and practitioners on how to apply the different steps of the ID
process (Seel et al. 2017). For this study, the ADDIE (analysis, design,
development, implementation and evaluation) model of ID (Almelhi 2021;
Branch 2009; Yeh & Tseng 2019) was selected, because the phases of the
ADDIE model - analyse, design, develop, implement and evaluate - correspond
well with those of the design-based research cycle.

    Two cycles of the design process were completed over a period of 3 years.
The analysis phase of the ADDIE model was completed once at the start of
the study, whereas the remaining phases were completed twice. The literature
review presented in the section `Important considerations for open educational
resource design' formed the foundation of this first phase by identifying
possible causes of a performance gap, identifying necessary resources and
possible delivery systems.

    The aim of phase two - the design phase - is to identify the tasks that
would be conducive to reaching the specific performance objectives and to
generate appropriate testing strategies for the specific context. This is
followed by the development phase, which has several objectives, including
selecting or developing media, creating appropriate content, deciding how to
present learning activities and applying formative revisions where necessary.
During the implementation phase, students are actively involved in the learning
activities, which allows researchers to assess whether the activities performed
were as expected. Empirical evidence on student performance, the worth and
effects of the learning activities implemented in a previous phase, is gathered
during the evaluation phase. The aim is to make informed decisions about
revisions that would strengthen the context-specific procedures implemented.

                                                                                                                                            87
Designing an open educational resource for oral interactional competence

  Instructional design: Practical application

As part of the first iteration of ID design process (cf. the section `Instructional
design: Approach and method'), the general characteristics of the software
were established, the tasks related to the performance objectives were
identified, and testing strategies to establish the suitability and effectiveness
of the practice activities were established (ADDIE: design), and the first
version of the new software - Papotons! (Let's chat!) - was developed (ADDIE:
develop). This was followed by the first implementation (ADDIE: implement)
and evaluation (ADDIE: evaluate) phases. During the second cycle, the same
phases were completed. The two cycles, their related phases as well as the
results of these cycles are discussed in the subsections `Cycle 1 - Design',
`Cycle 1 - Develop', `Cycle 1 - Implement', `Cycle 1 - Evaluate', `Cycle 2 - Design',
`Cycle 2 - Implement' and `Cycle 2 - Evaluate'.

   Cycle 1.1: Design

The different tasks that would enable students to reach the performance
objectives and the strategies implemented to evaluate the out-of-class
practice environment are discussed in this section. This is done in relation to
the elements discussed in the section `Important considerations for open
educational resource design'.

   Tasks and activities

As a starting point for the conceptualisation of the software, it was decided
that it would be made available as an OER and that once the software and the
necessary content were downloaded from the learning management system
(LMS), students could continue working offline. Students are allowed to work
independently in the environment of their choice (at home or in a language
laboratory) requiring students to display self-directedness by taking initiative
and to be less dependent on teacher intervention (Knowles 1975; Yang 2015).

    The interface remains basic to facilitate navigation, and apart from the
navigation prompts, no written support is provided. However, students are
not left to their own devices and have access to a model dialogue (`simulated
authentic conversation in a communicative situation'; Laurillard 2012:216) on
the LMS supporting their understanding of the task and their readiness to
participate in the task (Eisenmann & Summer 2012:49) (cf. the sections
`Productive and receptive activities', `Focused listening', and `Review of own
oral production').

    The teacher determines the content of the learning activities based on the
outcomes that have been defined within the broader teaching and learning
context. Each learning activity is presented as a simulated conversation - with a

88
                                                                                                                                 Chapter 5

question-answer format - during which students listen to a series of questions,
record and save, or re-record their answers (cf. the section `Review of own oral
production'). There is no time restriction allowing students to consult their notes
or other sources of information, and they can re-record their replies as many
times as they wish (cf. the section `Extensive practice'). After completion, students
take part in a self-assessment activity (cf. the section `Self-assessment') before
submitting the task to the teacher, who, in turn, records personalised feedback
on each task (cf. the section `Oral corrective feedback'). As a final step, the
teacher attributes marks according to predetermined assessment criteria.

   Testing strategies

To investigate the suitability and perceived usefulness of the technology-
enhanced practice activities, a mixed-methods approach was chosen. This
method is appropriate for this design-based research project, because it is
closely linked to this study's pragmatic paradigm (Creswell & Poth 2018;
Johnson & Onwuegbuzie 2004). When the software was implemented for the
first time, the teacher-researcher and the software developer were present,
firstly, to support students in using the new software and secondly, to observe
student behaviour and to take note of student comments. These observations
and notes were used to subsequently improve different aspects of the software
(cf. the section `Cycle 1 - Evaluate').

    For the second evaluation cycle, a context-sensitive instrument was designed
and validated to obtain information related specifically to the Papotons!
software and the activities done within this environment. Participation was
voluntary, and students who decided to take part signed a form confirming
their consent. The relevant ethics committees at the NWU granted permission
for this study to be conducted. The instrument consisted of a questionnaire on
oral communication practice activities in general. The questions related to the
software were of a quantitative nature that focused in more detail on the
simulated conversation activity, the self-assessment activity and the teacher's
individualised audio feedback. Information about these three aspects was also
gathered during face-to-face focus group interviews. These interviews were
conducted 3 months after the last practice cycle. The results obtained from
the quantitative and qualitative analysis of student feedback were used in
the first evaluate phase (cf. the section `Cycle 1 - Evaluate') to improve the
software and its related activities. This feedback was supplemented by
observations made by the teacher, assessors and software designer throughout
the semester.

   Cycle 1.2: Develop

During this phase, a three-part software package was created. Each part has
its own functions. The Create and Feedback elements are destined for use by

                                                                                                                                            89
Designing an open educational resource for oral interactional competence

the teacher, whilst the Student part allows the students to participate in the
learning activity.

    Create: The teacher records questions or imports audio files to create the
basis for the simulated conversation and then captures the criteria for the
student self-assessment activity.

    Student: This part allows students to listen to the teacher's questions as
many times as they like (cf. the section `Extensive practice') to record a reply
to each individual question, and then they have the option to listen to their
answer before saving or re-recording the answer (cf. the section `Productive
and receptive activities' and the section `Focused listening'). Students have
continuous access to a model dialogue illustrating the skills required for
completing the Papotons! activity if they need help with understanding a
question or with formulating a reply. When done, students use a sliding scale
to evaluate their performance, after which they save and submit their
assignment (cf. the section `Self-assessment'). The activities could be
completed either at home or in a designated university language laboratory
where technical support was available.

    Feedback: The teacher uses this part to listen to the recordings submitted
by the students. The performances are rated within the software based on
criteria formulated by the teacher. Lastly, the teacher records feedback on the
assignment in its entirety (cf. the section `Oral corrective feedback'). The
format of the final audio output starts with the questions and the students'
replies (allowing a review of one's performance). This is followed by the
teacher's feedback. The content for each of the practice cycles was created
according to the performance outcomes defined for each of the cycles. The
content that was intended for use during the simulated conversation activity
included the recording of a model dialogue and the questions that students
must answer. The first implementation of the technology-enhanced practice
activities within the broader teaching and learning context is described in the
sub-section `Cycle 1 - Implement'.

   Cycle 1.3: Implement

During the 12-week semester, the Papotons! activities were integrated into
three practice cycles of learning activities within the broader context
(cf. Grobler and Smits [2016] for more detailed information), and each
cycle included the following steps (the software is used during the steps
marked with*):

    Step 1: Face-to-face classes

    This involves traditional classes where the teacher guides students to discover and
    master different aspects of the French language. The teacher provides practice
    activities and model answers, and the group engages in discussions on relevant
    topics.

    Step 2: Module dialogue
    Students participate in a listening comprehension activity on the LMS. The recording
    consists of a simulated conversation that illustrates the different outcomes identified
    for each of the cycles. After having listened to the recording, students are required
    to answer a series of questions. During this process, they receive metalinguistic
    cues or questions to help them discover the correct answer. This is followed by
    overt automated feedback provided on the LMS.

    Step 3: Simulated conversation*
    In this step, the Student part of the software is used. The activities involved are
    described in detail in the sub-section `Cycle 1 - Develop'.

    Step 4: Audio feedback*
    The Feedback part of Papotons! allows the teacher to record personalised audio
    feedback (cf. the sub-section `Cycle 1 - Develop - Feedback'), and students receive
    their recordings via the LMS.

    Step 5: Student videos
    Students work collaboratively in pairs to make videos to demonstrate their mastery
    of the outcomes specified at the beginning of each cycle, thus including the social
    constructivist element that is at the core of OEPs (Cronin & MacLaren 2018). A list
    of instructions is provided to students, and they are informed that they are not
    allowed to read a text during filming. The final product is shared with a peer group
    who comments on the video.

    Step 6: Individual face-to-face oral
    In the final step of each of the cycles, students participate in a face-to-face oral with
    the teacher, and students can illustrate the skills acquired in the steps described
    in this section. The interaction follows a question-reply format during which the
    teacher can repeat or reformulate questions if students struggle.

The last phase of the ID process - the evaluation - is discussed in the sub-
section `Cycle 1 - Evaluate'.

   Cycle 1.4: Evaluate

Following observations made by the researchers during the implementation
phase (cf. the sub-section `Cycle 1 - Design - Testing strategies') on the
simulated conversation learning activity, several changes that had to be made
during the next ID cycle were identified within each of the three parts of the
software as well as in the general management of the software and activities.
These changes are discussed in this section.

   Papotons! Create

·· Increased flexibility: When creating activities, the teacher has no option to
    combine importing audio recordings and recording questions within the
    Papotons! software.

                                                                                                                                             91
Designing an open educational resource for oral interactional competence

   Papotons! Student

·· Interface: The interface was seen as bland, and students requested a more
    colourful and modern display.

·· Accessibility of model dialogue: Students proved to be reluctant to consult
    the model dialogue outside of the Papotons! environment. This might be
    because of the elaborate action of having to log in to the LMS and retrieving
    the recording. This limits their opportunities to receive important intrinsic
    feedback on their performance (Laurillard 2012).

·· Review of recorded replies: Observations on the time students spent on
    completing the activities revealed that students generally rushed through
    the questions and that they rarely reviewed their own replies before
    continuing to the next question.

·· Preparation for self-assessment: In the first version of the software, students
    have no opportunity to listen to their recorded answers before doing the
    self-assessment.

   Papotons! Feedback

·· Easier access to student recordings: The first version of the software
    restricts teachers' access to student productions to the Papotons!
    environment, thus limiting opportunities to replay certain excerpts and
    forcing the teacher to wait until the end of the recording to complete the
    assessment with the software.

·· Teacher-student assessment criteria: Differences in the criteria for the
    student self-assessment and teacher assessment must be eliminated to
    ensure a just and fair assessment.

·· Adapted format: Benefitting from the teacher's audio feedback is hindered
    by the fact that students are obliged to listen to the whole `conversation'
    before having access to teacher feedback.

   Papotons! General management

·· Software incompatibility: Several instances of incompatibility between the
    software and students' personal devices were recorded.

·· Improved architecture: The initial architecture for accessing files created by
    teachers and students is clumsy, and file retrieval is unnecessarily
    complicated.

   Cycle 2.1: Design and develop

The improved version of the Papotons! software was prepared during the
second design and develop phases of the ID process, considering the elements

                                                                                                                                 Chapter 5

that resulted from the first evaluation (cf. the sub-section `Cycle 1 - Evaluate').
The adaptations that were made are presented in this section.

   Papotons! Create

·· Increased flexibility: In future, the teacher will be able to both record
    questions directly in the software environment when creating activities
    and to import pre-recorded questions. This will improve flexibility in the
    activity creation process.

   Papotons! Student

·· Interface: The new version is more modern, and more nuanced colours are
    used. The interface has an iPod-like look.

·· Accessibility of model dialogue: Providing direct access to the model
    dialogue will encourage students to make use of this opportunity to receive
    intrinsic feedback through one-click access within the Papotons!
    Environment (Figure 5.2).

·· Review of recorded replies: In the new version of the software, students are
    obligated to listen to their production before continuing to the next
    question, thus encouraging them to reflect on their work.

FIGURE 5.3: Interface where students are prepared for self-assessment activity.

·· Preparation for self-assessment: Including an additional step which allows
    students to review their productions before completing the self-assessment
    not only allows students to assess their work more accurately but the time
    spent on the task will increase (Figure 5.3). It was also decided to provide
    pre-recorded model answers with which students could compare their
    work, which allows the integration of answers to open-response questions
    into the OER (Kawachi 2013:7), and this again allows students with another
    learning opportunity (Laurillard 2012) and to receive intrinsic feedback
    once again.

   Papotons! Feedback

·· Easier access to student recordings: Student productions will in future be
    made available in a format not strictly associated with the software,
    allowing teachers and assistants to access the recordings independently.
    This allows assessment whilst listening to student recordings, and it
    facilitates sharing of recordings for assessment by others.

·· Teacher-student assessment criteria: An assessment grid was created and
    refined. This grid consolidates the criteria for the student self-assessment
    and the teacher's assessment and can be used in both contexts.

·· Adapted format: The teacher is now able to record feedback on each
    question, creating a final recording that consists of the original question
    from Papotons!, the student's recorded answer and the teacher's audio
    feedback, in this sequence, question by question. This replaces the
    dissociated feedback at the end of student productions from before.

   Papotons! General management

·· Software incompatibility: To minimise technical challenges in future,
    students will be required to complete the Papotons!-based activities in a
    language laboratory where the software is already installed and where
    technical support is available.

·· Improved architecture: The architecture is streamlined, and new file extensions
    are created for the Papotons! environment. This facilitates file retrieval.

   Cycle 2.2: Implement

Following the first implementation of three practice cycles (cf. Cycle 1 -
Implement), it was decided that in future, only two practice cycles of the
teaching and learning activities will be completed per semester to allow more
time to complete the different steps and to benefit from teacher and peer
feedback. The outcomes remain unchanged, however.

    The practice cycles were implemented during the second phase of
implementation, and the steps were completed over a period of 13 weeks.

   Cycle 2.3: Evaluate

The evaluation was done by means of a 25-question questionnaire with
multiple choice and open-ended questions (Grobler 2020). This was
supplemented by face-to-face semi-structured group interviews with students
who agreed to participate in these discussions (cf. the sub-section `Cycle 1 -
Design - Test strategies'). Student feedback revealed that no further changes
were necessary to the software or the activities that are done within the
Papotons! environment. The teacher and software designer did not report any
other aspects that needed to be changed either.

  Discussion and recommendations

Open educational practices provide teachers at different institutions and different
levels of education with an opportunity to share resources with colleagues and to
use or adapt those of colleagues within the same discipline. Open educational
practices do not, however, focus solely on teachers but encourage student self-
management, creativity and teamwork (cf. Cronin & MacLaren 2018).

                                                                                                                                            95
Designing an open educational resource for oral interactional competence

Ensuring quality educational experiences when using OERs is a prominent
aspect of open education (Hewlett Foundation 2022). The current definitions
of OERs do not, however, allude to this. Creating an all-encompassing definition
is challenging, no matter what the topic at hand. The act of defining something
is in its very nature a limiting exercise (Harper n.d.). In the case of software, an
OER definition that is too narrow could hamper active development, and
opening the domain of OERs to an open-software development community
could contribute to furthering the foundational aims of OERs in general.
Ideally, an expanded definition which aims to capture the breadth of
possibilities that OERs can hold should be encouraged; a definition that allows,
for example, the explicit inclusion of software as an OER, the importance of
strengthening the OER design process through embedding quality assurance
and ensuring that openness is actively planned for from the start. Such a
definition could assist with the acceptance of unpopulated environments such
as the Papotons! software package as an OER.

    Considering the points discussed above, one could then suppose that
quality should firstly be ensured by the teaching practices or education
policies that allow the incorporation of OERs within the teaching and learning
context. To do this, teachers and policymakers should know what strategies to
implement that would result in the desired level of quality. Investigating and
proposing different ways to reach this goal would empower decision-makers
when deciding to include OERs in their teaching environment and would allow
a greater degree of openness in their teaching practices (cf. the section
`Openness: Educational resources, education and educational practices'). This
could include, firstly, active integration in the broader educational context
through horizontal expansion - that is, the material with more relevant
examples for a specific learning outcome - secondly, vertical integration which
focuses on building supplemental OERs that could feed into or from a
particular OER and finally, cross-domain integration of the structure of an
OER. In the case of Papotons!, an unpopulated environment is provided to
help teachers with content creation and learners to achieve learning objectives
in other domains. This integration and expansion would allow for broader use,
adaptation or re-purposing of these materials.

    Building quality OERs entails more than a self-contained artefact; it entails
an artefact that can be built on and expanded within the software context.
This particularly links to open standards, good documentation and ingraining
the FAIR principles (cf. FAIR principles and OERs), Findable and Accessible
OERs, as well as OERs that are Interoperable and, importantly, Reusable. This
would enable horizontal expansion, vertical and cross-domain integration.
Quality OERs also require sound ID to create impactful learning experiences
for learners using an OER.

    The practical application of such an ID process described in this chapter
could serve as an example of what responsible design could represent.

96
                                                                                                                                 Chapter 5

This process started with an overview of the context and subject-specific
considerations that should be considered before embarking on the ID process.
This includes delivery considerations (technology-enabled or not), applicable
theoretical frameworks, and elements that would ensure a contextualised and
meaningful teaching intervention. Deliberately focusing on including strategies
to promote self-directed learning is recommended as part of the conceptualisation
of the ID process, because this is part and parcel of an open education approach.

    This is followed by structuring a design process that suits the specific
teaching and learning context. Decisions about the approach (e.g. pragmatism)
and the ID instruments to be used (e.g. ADDIE) are then taken. The inclusion
and practical application of these considerations and decisions should be
rigorous and precise to ensure an optimal result.

    Certain skills are required for creators and users of OERs to be responsible
designers and to function effectively in the OER context. For designers, a core
recommendation is to familiarise oneself with what OERs are before embarking
on the design process. This would allow for better planning and ingrained
quality assurance as part of the design process. For users, developing one's
own technical skill set should be encouraged, as it could be a limiting factor
when using OERs. Certain technical skills, such as understanding how
microphones function and how to make recordings in the best possible way,
are required.

    Designing effective and impactful OERs requires time and a lot of effort to
ensure that these are not spent in vain. The following recommendations can
be kept in mind by future users and creators of OERs:

1. Think broadly: An expanded definition that leaves room for different
    learning artefacts, such as software packages, can benefit the overall use
    and impact of OERs.

2. Quality is key: Design with quality in mind; use ID principles to ensure high
    levels of learner benefit.

3. Think about how your OER can be expanded and integrated further from
    the start - embrace the FAIR principles.

4. Hone your skill set and build your open networks.

This list is not exhaustive, and aspects such as working collaboratively with
students to co-create an OER could be pertinent in certain contexts (Olivier
2020).

    More room exists to explore how to focus on quality assurance that can be
ingrained as part of the design process and less as an evaluative exercise.
Possible ways that this could be achieved is to expand the TIPS framework
(Kawachi 2013) to be a design tool that could be used side by side with the
OER creation process. This framework provides quality assurance guidelines
for OERs. It addresses the following aspects: `Teaching and learning processes;

                                                                                                                                            97

  Conclusion

At the beginning of this chapter, we looked at the existing definitions of OEPs,
open education and OERs, and the challenges resulting from a too narrow
description of what OERs entail. Because quality is a prominent characteristic
of what open education, OEPs and OERs should entail, we investigated
different principles that could be implemented to ensure that OERs adhere to
this requirement. These principles include considerations for integrating OERs
into the broader educational context and design principles that one should
consider when creating the artefact for a specific teaching and learning
context.

    This was followed by a description of the practical implication of these
principles during the design process of a custom-designed software package
and context-specific content that aim to support the development of the oral
communication skills of university students studying French as a foreign language
in South Africa. The design principles were sensitive to including opportunities
for students to increase their level of self-directed learning practices through,
amongst others, independent work, participation in self-assessment activities,
working with peers and receiving explicit feedback. The chapter is concluded
with a discussion of the design project, and recommendations are made.

  Abstract

Journalism as an academic discipline is relatively new. The field of journalism
has changed significantly as a result of the effects and challenges of
digitalisation. The changes in journalism mean that the curriculum needs to
adapt to remain relevant. In a decolonising society such as South Africa, there
is also a need to decolonise the journalism curriculum. A possible route
towards adapting and decolonising the curriculum is through the use of open
educational resources (OERs) and open educational practices (OEPs).
Adapting and decolonising the curriculum can be achieved through a process
of self-directed learning (SDL), where students can participate in the creation
of their own learning material and play an active part in deciding what they
would like to learn. This chapter reflects on a project at the School of
Communication at the North-West University (NWU), Potchefstroom campus,

Decolonising the journalism curriculum through co-creating an open educational textbook

where students participated in a project to co-create an open educational
textbook with the lecturer. By inviting students to participate in writing the
textbook, the lecturer provided an opportunity for students to integrate their
own knowledge and learning experience into the curriculum. The aim of the
project was to address the lack of locally relevant, up-to-date and decolonised
learning material in the field of journalism. This chapter is a critical reflection
on the project by systematically analysing student contributions to evaluate
whether the creation of an OER textbook offers a way to address decolonisation
demands from students, which often centre on the need to participate in
creating their own learning experiences and the need for content that is more
relevant to indigenous contexts. The project showed that SDL as part of an
OEP project to create learning material can play a significant role in
decolonising the curriculum and giving students a voice in their own learning.

  Introduction

In many countries, formal journalism schools or departments were only formed
in the 1970s. The debate about what journalism schools should teach and how
they should teach is a continuous and contentious one, both in academia and
in the industry (Anusharani & Benda 2020; Ercan 2018; García-Galera, Martinez-
Nicolas & Del-Hoyo-Hurtado 2021; Gillmor 2016). Technological changes,
economic realities, the loss of career opportunities (Dugmore 2018; Jacobson
2021; Kruger 2022), the increasing participation of ordinary citizens in
journalism (Kruger 2022; Mabweazara & Mare 2021:5) and the need for
decolonising the curriculum (cf. Chapter 10) in a country such as South Africa
add further layers of complication to the question of how journalism curricula
at higher education institutions (HEIs) should adapt to remain relevant. As
journalism is no longer simple to define in the 21st century (Deuze 2019; Deuze
& Witschge 2018), educators should regularly evaluate what journalism is and
how journalism should be taught. In the South African context, there is a need
to decolonise the journalism curriculum, which is still dominated by normative
views from the Global North (Dube 2017). This chapter proposes that some of
the challenges facing journalism educators may be addressed through a SDL
process within the framework of OEPs. The discussion in this chapter reflects
on the co-creation process of an open educational textbook by students and
their lecturer by systematically analysing student contributions to the
textbook. This was part of a process to empower students, decolonise
the curriculum and adapt the curriculum to become more relevant to the
challenges of the 21st century.

    The journalism curriculum encompasses skills that can be useful to anyone
who creates or distributes information. In 2008, a former Public Broadcasting
Service (PBS) host in the United States of America (USA), Robert MacNeil,
called journalism education probably `the best general education that an
American citizen can get' (Gillmor 2016:815). The skills journalism students

learn are, indeed, useful 21st-century life skills. These skills include the
development of critical thinking and the ability to evaluate information - in
other words, the development of information literacy skills (Swart 2021). By
empowering students to take charge of their own learning, they are encouraged
to critically evaluate their own knowledge and add this knowledge to the
curriculum (thereby participating in renewable assessments), thus becoming
self-directed learners. In turn, this process contributes to decolonising the
curriculum by providing an outlet for student voices and promoting SDL.

    However, despite much academic debate on the need for transforming
the journalism curriculum in South Africa, little has in fact changed (Dube
2017:2). Western normative views of what journalism is, still dominate
curricula. Two decades ago, De Beer and Tomaselli (2000) already showed
that the journalism curriculum in South Africa needed to become more
Africanised with a more social-democratic outlook. A decolonised
curriculum should represent previously marginalised voices (Rodny-
Gumede 2018). This has not happened in journalism education (Reid &
McKinley 2020; Shaw 2017).

    Decolonisation also relates to access to educational material, which could
help address inequalities and social injustice in higher education (HE) (Cox,
Masuku & Willmers 2020). Cox et al. (2020) argue that textbooks in South
Africa are prohibitively expensive for most students. Indeed, one of the main
demands of student protestors in 2015-2017, when the #RhodesMustFall and
#FeesMustFall protests took place on university campuses in South Africa,
was for free or equal access to education (Quinn & Vorster as cited in Cox
et al. 2020).

    Viewed against the need for decolonisation and the need to adapt the
journalism curriculum because the field of journalism is changing so fast, the
value of OERs becomes apparent. Open educational resources, particularly
when co-developed by lecturers and students, can provide an outlet for
student voices and needs (Olivier 2020:25). Listening to student voices can
be a way to help integrate indigenous knowledge into the curriculum (De Beer
& Mentz 2019). Such a process helps keep learning material relevant and helps
to decolonise learning material by increasing access and encouraging the
transformation of contents. As regards co-creation, OERs are `particularly
conducive to multi-authorship strategies and participatory content
development processes, integrating the learner in resource development and
providing opportunities for pedagogical innovation' (Cox et al. 2020:2). The
creation of an open textbook in this project is an example of OEP (cf. Chapter 1),
a term that broadly describes the use of OERs and open practices (Cronin
2017) - a `suite' of open practices in education that can help address inequalities
and lack of access to educational resources (Cox et al. 2020:2).

    In this chapter, the author of the textbook How to be a journalist in the 21st
century (published under a CC BY-NC-SA licence) reflects critically on a

                                                                                                                                            101

project in his journalism modules at the School of Communication at the
NWU's Potchefstroom campus. He invited students to co-create their own
learning material by contributing to a new journalism textbook. The book was
a prescribed text in 2021 in two of his journalism modules. The textbook fills a
gap in the corpus of journalism textbooks. It is, as far as the author knows, the
most up-to-date journalism textbook currently available in South Africa taking
into account the changes brought about by digitalisation as well as calls for
more relevant and decolonised content. The author and his colleagues have
struggled over the years to source up-to-date South African textbooks for use
in teaching and learning, and currently use either online sources, self-created
teaching and learning material or the textbook Introduction to journalism by
Gwen Ansell, published in 2011 in South Africa. The process of co-creating a
new textbook with students is a good example of SDL, where students were
empowered to be `open-minded and aware of their role as active learning
participants', to reflect on their own knowledge, and add this knowledge to
the curriculum (Du Toit-Brits 2021:29).

    In order to meaningfully reflect on the co-creation process and analyse
student contributions, this chapter initially explores, through a literature review,
three important issues facing journalism educators in the 21st century, namely:
the core question of what journalism in the 21st century is and how it should be
taught; the need for the decolonisation of journalism education in South Africa
and adapting the curriculum to remain relevant; and open pedagogy with
reference to the creation of an OER through SDL and renewable assessment.
These three broad themes provide a conceptual framework for further discussion
in this chapter. There are still few empirical studies about the use of OEPs in HE
(Cronin 2017). This study contributes towards an understanding of OEPs in a
particular context in South Africa and can help promote the use of SDL.

  Problem statement

Journalism is faced with various challenges and changes because of the
effects of digitalisation (Deuze 2018; Guo & Volz 2019). Historically, journalism
was practised mainly by what is commonly known as the mass media, legacy
media outlets such as traditional printed newspapers and magazines, as well
as broadcast media, both private and public (Nygren, Tenor & Leckner 2018).
Many legacy media outlets have now created online versions of their
publications, particularly in attempts to attract younger readers (García-
Avilés, Kaltenbrunner & Meier 2016). However, many legacy media outlets
have struggled to remain relevant in the digital era, because of, amongst other
factors, the loss of income and readers, with the inevitable loss of income and
subsequent loss of career opportunities for young graduates (see Dugmore
2018; Jacobson 2021; Kruger 2022). Journalism has been an industry in crisis
for some time, with the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic again
leading to mass retrenchments and financial losses at legacy media outlets in

2020-2021 (Skinner 2021). The challenges and changes in journalism as a
practice, which refers to journalists and other people doing journalistic work
(Deuze 2021:8), and journalism as an academic field of study have led to much
debate in academia about what journalism is and who can be a journalist
(Anusharani & Benda 2020; Deuze 2021; Ercan 2018; García-Galera et al. 2021;
Gillmor 2016; Kruger 2022). However, despite the changes and challenges in
journalism, the journalism curriculum in South Africa has remained relatively
static. The curriculum has traditionally been rooted in a Western, liberal
normative media model (Dube 2017), while there have been increasing calls
for decolonising the curriculum (Garman & Van der Merwe 2017). It has also
become clear that formal career opportunities have become fewer, while
other opportunities have become available (Morrish 2019). These opportunities
include entrepreneurial journalism (Caplan, Kanigel & Tsakarestou 2020),
often through the use of social media and blogging (Bor 2014), public service
journalism (Kruger 2022) and what Kruger (2022:28) calls `accidental
journalism'. Many people drift into doing journalistic work without realising it,
presenting news on YouTube or other platforms.

    Considering the changes and challenges in the field of journalism, it seems
clear that the curriculum needs to adapt to remain relevant (Kruger 2022;
Rodny-Gumede 2018). The curriculum does not yet fully reflect the changing
definitions of what journalism is, nor the new opportunities that have opened
up, nor has it been decolonised sufficiently (Dube 2017; Kruger 2022). Open
educational practices provide a possible option to address this gap, particularly
through co-creating an open textbook with students. By providing students
with an opportunity to direct their own learning through the textbook creation
process, it is possible to adapt the curriculum and to address many of the
gaps in the journalism curriculum,, including new definitions of journalism,
entrepreneurial journalism and decolonised content. This could help keep the
curriculum current, relevant and help address the need to decolonise the
curriculum.

    The reflection in this chapter is based on the following general research
question: How can the co-creation of an OER textbook for journalism, as part
of an SDL process within the context of open pedagogy, assist educators in
updating and decolonising the curriculum in South Africa?

  Conceptual framework

Journalism education has not adapted well to the challenges of changing
technology, changing definitions of journalism and changing ideas of the roles
of journalists (Kruger 2022). In South Africa, there is a need to decolonise
journalism as well as journalism education (Dube 2017; Rodny-Gumede 2018;
Shaw 2017). Based on the discussion in the problem statement, it can be
argued that the changing face of journalism and journalism education demand

                                                                                                                                           103
Decolonising the journalism curriculum through co-creating an open educational textbook

that journalism educators should constantly reflect on and adapt their curricula
to remain relevant (Jordaan 2018).

    An overview of the conceptual framework whereupon the reflection and
analysis in this chapter is based, is necessary. The overview that follows briefly
explores the meaning of journalism in the 21st century, suggestions on how to
teach journalism, debates around the decolonisation of the journalism
curriculum in South Africa and the use of SDL within open pedagogy to help
achieve the goals of decolonisation.

   What is journalism and how should it be taught?

To teach journalism effectively, one needs a clear understanding of what
journalism is. This is not simple. More than a decade ago, Stephenson (2009)
argued that the world of journalism education had changed beyond recognition
in the preceding two decades because journalism itself was changing. Now,
another decade later, some scholars argue that it is even harder to clearly
define what journalism is and how it should be taught (Deuze 2008; Deuze &
Witschge 2018; Guo & Volz 2019; Lee 2021). Stephenson (2009) identified
various changes in journalism, writing from a European perspective. These
included technological changes because of increasing digitalisation as well as
economic challenges faced by many legacy media outlets in the face of
increasing competition from the Internet. These factors still remain relevant,
while there have been further important changes since then. Deuze (2018)
and Mabweazara and Mare (2021) highlight the increasing participation of
ordinary citizens in journalism, whether through blogs or social media posts.
Journalism in the 21st century is no longer necessarily practised within the
routinised operations and industrial arrangements of the past, as explained by
Deuze (2018, 2019, 2021). There are now many actors in journalism, both
professional and amateur, producing forms of journalism across many different
platforms (Deuze 2019) and in new ways.

    Another increasingly important challenge is the rise of fake news and
disinformation; both the general public and journalists now need sophisticated
information literacy skills (Swart 2021) to navigate the media world. The rise
of a post-truth society has seemingly added additional challenges to the
teaching of journalism (Friesem 2019). The rise of journalistic entrepreneurship
is also important. Against the backdrop of fewer career opportunities at large
and well-known media outlets (Kruger 2022; Skinner 2021), journalistic
entrepreneurship has become essential (Caplan et al. 2020).

    The journalism curriculum should reflect these changes but, in many cases,
does not (Kruger 2022). The world of journalism is significantly different from
just a decade or two ago when journalism schools had a clearer path towards
producing graduates who would generally join industry - either print,
broadcast or web-based media outlets (Garman & Van der Merwe 2017).

Traditionally, curricula in South Africa have focussed on technical training and
preparing journalists to join industry (Garman & Van der Merwe 2017), with
curricula based on the correct way of writing and producing stories for mass
media outlets (Mensing 2010:512). Many journalism schools were in fact
founded by or received significant help from mass media organisations - the
Perskor-sponsored School of Communication, founded in 1959 at the former
Potchefstroom University for Christian Higher Education (now the
Potchefstroom campus of the NWU) is one example (Garman & Van der
Merwe 2017). The Journalism School at Stellenbosch University (SUN),
founded in 1978 by a former newspaper editor from Naspers (Rabe 2018), is
another.

    For journalism schools, the question of their students' future career paths
is a challenge, which, arguably, they do not always manage to address. Too
many journalism schools in South Africa still prepare students for professional
careers in industry, while these careers are becoming fewer and fewer (Kruger
2022:24). Against the background of the many changes in the journalism
industry, journalism schools need to produce more independent thinkers
(Dube 2017) and more entrepreneurs (Caplan et al. 2020). The educator
should carefully balance the needs of industry with the changing face of
journalism and the changing needs of students.

    It seems clear that it is no longer easy to define journalism and career
paths, as they are not as clear-cut as before. Not only are the definition of
journalism and the roles of journalists no longer clear (Morrish 2019; St Clair
2015), but in South Africa, an over-reliance on the liberal model does not fully
take into account the realities of the new journalism environment in a
decolonising society.

    Furthermore, in a world of disinformation and fake news, journalism
education now seems to have some relevance for a much wider variety of
students and not only those who are interested in becoming professional
journalists. For example, Deuze (2019) is a proponent of a new definition of
journalism that looks beyond current and existing structures and organisations
towards a more inclusive form of journalism where anyone who practises
journalism, even if they do not realise it, understands the `perspective of a
journalist'. Journalism educators in Africa should also teach innovation and
make students aware of expanded opportunities in the world of journalism
(Jjuuko & Njuguna 2019).

  Decolonising the journalism curriculum

The need for transformation and change in HE have been highlighted by the
#RhodesMustFall and subsequent #FeesMustFall movements (Cox et al.
2020). Students have been demanding better access to HE, transformation,
decolonisation of the curriculum and their voices should be heard for some

                                                                                                                                           105
Decolonising the journalism curriculum through co-creating an open educational textbook

years (Olivier 2021a). Olivier (2021a:149) explains that decolonisation of the
curriculum is not about destroying existing knowledge but `implies some
change with specific sensitivity to historical and political origins, and influence
on knowledge within the educational context'.

    However, the journalism curriculum in South Africa is mostly rooted in the
liberal, Western model which relies on the assumption that journalism is
necessary for democracy to function (Hanitzsch & Örnebring 2019:110). At a
normative level, what Bromley (2009) calls the North Atlantic or liberal media
model, has always had a strong influence on South African journalism schools.
All Journalism 101 students in South Africa know the basic principles of the
liberal model, the idea of the media as the Fourth Estate, as a watchdog, holding
power to account, being objective and reporting events based on fact (Wahl-
Jorgensen & Hanitzsch 2019). The liberal model is also underpinned by an
adherence to commercialisation (Bromley 2009); it is about making money.
According to this liberal model, which is widely taught at South African
universities, journalism's functions include being a watchdog, holding
governments and corporations accountable and informing citizens, plays a vital
role as a watchdog, holding governments and corporations accountable for
their actions and ensuring that citizens are informed. These assumptions are,
however, increasingly being questioned. Other non-Western societies also have
journalism (Wahl-Jorgensen & Hanitzsch 2019) but they `may prioritise collective
needs and social harmony' (Bromley 2009:110). This is relevant in the postcolonial
context of a country such as South Africa. The emphasis on the link between
journalism and democracy `has been seen as necessary props for each other
since the earliest normative theories of journalism prescribed parameters that
the news was expected to follow in democratic regimes' (Zelizer 2012:462). This
view neglects the fact that journalism is a central institution in many societies
that are not democracies (Wahl-Jorgensen & Hanitzsch 2019). The reliance on
the assumption that journalism is the defender of democracy has led to the
construction of a theoretical framework that considers journalism `in terms of
its more or less consensual news values, dominant frames, routinised operations,
gatekeeping functions, and industrial arrangements' (Deuze 2019:3) while
neglecting all the other things that journalism can be and does. Deuze (2019:3)
suggests the need to examine new structures and new ways of telling stories
that matter. It is important to remember that, in an African context, journalism
can also be about storytelling, social cohesion, nation-building and
transformation (Rodny-Gumede 2018). However, in South Africa, the mainstream
media have patterned themselves on Western models of gathering and
reporting news by `largely operating on free-market principles and according to
neo-liberal functionalist logic' (De Beer & Wasserman 2005:38).

    It can be argued that there is a clear need for a different type of journalism
in a decolonising society such as South Africa, where there is a need for an
African model of journalism in the context of nation-building and developmental

106

needs (Dube 2017; Rodny-Gumede 2018). There are still very few examples of
decolonised journalism curricula at universities in South Africa (Dube 2017).

    One way to approach the decolonisation of the curriculum is through the
process of open pedagogy and content production by students as Olivier
(2021a) suggests. In this chapter, it is argued that the creation of an open
textbook by students, through SDL, can help contribute to the decolonisation
process.

  Open pedagogy: Creating an open textbook
  through self-directed learning

Based on the four broad interpretations of openness in education discussed
by Cronin (2017:16-18) - namely open access, free education, OERs and
OEPs - this study can be broadly placed within the domain of OEPs. Open
educational practices entail `collaborative practices that include the creation,
use, and reuse of OER, as well as pedagogical practices employing participatory
technologies' (Cronin 2017:4). Open pedagogy, seen within the broader
context of OEPs, is `associated with the creation, use and sharing of OERs'
(Wiley & Hilton 2018:134). Wiley and Hilton (2018) define OER-enabled
pedagogy as:

    [T]he set of teaching and learning practices that are only possible or practical in the
    context of the 5R [retain, reuse, revise, remix, and redistribute] permissions which
    are characteristic of OER. (p. 135)

According to Wiley and Hilton (2018), one of the great advantages of open
pedagogy is that learners can engage with content, change it and learn by
doing. As Cronin (2017) explains, citing the Open Education Consortium (n.d.),
openness in education is not just about access but about the ability to adapt
and personalise material for specific circumstances. The creation of an OER
textbook in this study is an example of an OEP.

    The open textbook discussed in this chapter was created through SDL.
Self-directed learning is `an approach to education which involves learners
taking responsibility of their own learning' (Letseka & Seeletso 2021:176). Self-
directed learning was defined by Knowles (as cited in Letseka & Seeletso
2021) as:

    [A] process in which individuals take the initiative, with or without the help of
    others, in diagnosing their learning needs, formulating learning goals, identifying
    human and material resources for learning, choosing and implementing appropriate
    learning strategies, and evaluating learning outcomes. (p. 178)

This process allows learners to identify what they would like to learn and
allows them to participate in creating their own learning strategies.

    Self-directed learning can be implemented as part of open pedagogy (cf.
Chapter 3), such as in the project discussed in this chapter, where learners

                                                                                                                                           107
Decolonising the journalism curriculum through co-creating an open educational textbook

participated in creating their own, open textbook through SDL. Furthermore,
in the light of the preceding discussion, it can be argued that SDL within open
pedagogy can play a decolonising role in the South African context by
providing students with the opportunity to identify their own learning needs
and contribute to their own learning. This process allows for student voices to
be heard. As has been explained in the section `Decolonising the journalism
curriculum', one of the demands for decolonisation from students is for their
voices to be heard. Letseka and Seeletso (2021:182) argue that open learning
has always been a feature of traditional African education, where learning was
a lifelong practice and teaching happened through socialisation. Open
education in the South African context also relates to the philosophical
concept of ubuntu, where `the individual is seen as an integral part of and
from the community' (Olivier 2021b:2). According to Kemeh (as cited in Olivier
2021), ubuntu and the goals of sustainable development (which include open
education) are the same, namely making equal opportunities open to all. Open
pedagogy can, therefore, help improve access to education, and through SDL,
open pedagogy allows for a more student-centred approach (Olivier 2021b:3),
which one can argue is, by definition, a decolonised approach. This approach,
as Letseka and Seeletso (2021:175) argue, helps create autonomous and self-
directed learners `who can champion their own learning', which is essential for
the creation of decolonised OERs.

    Olivier (2020:31) suggests that SDL has an important role to play within the
context of open education. Open pedagogy and SDL share a student-centred
approach (Olivier 2020). This student-centred approach can help decolonise
the curriculum by empowering students to contextualise and localise content.
Localising content means adapting the curriculum to be more relevant to
students in their specific context, namely South Africa, and also includes
translation of content into indigenous languages (Olivier 2020). De Beer and
Mentz (2019) found that indigenous knowledge is often held by learners
themselves, therefore the use of SDL within the context of open pedagogy
gives students an opportunity to share their local knowledge. By taking part
in the process of creating an open textbook as an OEP, students are permitted
to take charge of their learning. In this way, the textbook creation process can
also address issues of marginalisation and unequal access to educational
material (Cox et al. 2020), and it can contribute to making educational material
more relevant to students.

    The creation of an open textbook as discussed in this chapter also represents
an example of renewable assessments, which are assessments that `result in
new or improved open educational resources that provide a lasting benefit to
the broader community of learners' (Wiley & Hilton 2018:136). Renewable
assessments will not merely be discarded once graded, but will add value to
the world, as suggested by Wiley (2013). He argues that renewable assessments
make students invest more time and effort into their work because they know

108
                                                                                                                                 Chapter 6

their peers will benefit from their work in the future. The textbook students
helped create is an example of renewable assessment because it will be
distributed as an open textbook and will continue to be prescribed at NWU
for use by future students. Cox et al. (2020) define open textbooks:

    Digital collections of OER and open access materials published under an open licence
    on platforms and in formats that provide affordances for the integration of multimedia,
    remixing of various content components, printing and redistribution. (p. 2)

Cox et al. (2020) argue that open textbooks can help address social injustices,
particularly three specific injustices, namely economic, cultural and political
injustices. These injustices correlate with demands of students for decolonising
the curriculum, namely free access to teaching and learning, and demands for
greater representation of marginalised voices. By involving students in the
process of creating a textbook, these injustices can be addressed by students
themselves because students are provided with the opportunity to direct
their own learning (Du Toit-Brits 2021).

    Cox et al. (2020) argue that the absence of student voices in creating
learning material is an injustice that suppresses students' ability to shape what
they learn. Cox et al. (2020) explain:

    Open textbooks help to overcome various types of silencing (political
    misrepresentation) by including student voices. They provide academics with an
    opportunity through which they can design teaching activities to include student
    content in textbooks, facilitate opportunities for students to guide the content in
    textbooks, and, in a truly transformational sense, author the textbooks themselves.
    Through open textbooks, lecturers have the ability to change the way they teach,
    include student voices and create innovative teaching activities. (p. 8)

As has been shown, the involvement of students in co-creating a journalism
textbook creates the opportunity for recontextualising and localising,
empowers students and gives them a voice. The creation of an OER textbook
together with students can help provide students with an opportunity to
`construct meaning in particular contexts indigenous to them' (Du Toit-Brits,
Blignaut & Mzuza 2021), a significant step towards creating a decolonised
curriculum. The open textbook is also an example of renewable assessment -
students knew they were creating value for others.

  Methodology: The process of reflection

This chapter is a qualitative analysis of and reflection on student contributions
to an open journalism textbook. This section describes the research paradigm
and analysis methodology.

   Research paradigm

As a qualitative reflection on and analysis of student contributions to the
creation of the textbook How to be a journalist in the 21st century, this study

                                                                                                                                           109
Decolonising the journalism curriculum through co-creating an open educational textbook

is rooted in the interpretivist paradigm. Interpretivism flows from the idea
that there is `no single objective view of reality and that individuals have
their own view of a situation or event' (Du Plessis & Abdool-Satar 2020:111).
Interpretivism is a research tradition that is more interested in exploring
different truths and different meanings by interpreting findings (Scauso
2020). To understand (Fossey et al. 2002) and reflect on student contributions
to the journalism curriculum, the author of this chapter reflects on student
contributions to their textbooks in the interpretivist tradition. This approach
allows for the social construction of knowledge (Du Plessis & Abdool-Satar
2020:110), which is one of the main aims of the textbook project discussed
in this chapter. Critical reflection in this study is an approach where the
author not only thinks about the curriculum but listens to student voices and
their own understandings of social reality (Jordaan 2018). The author also
acknowledges student agency, where students play active roles as
participants (Du Toit-Brits 2021) in the learning process. An interpretivist
approach is also particularly suitable because it allows for the integration of
marginalised voices (Scauso 2020).

    Student contributions were examined through reflective practice
(Hébert 2015). Reflective practice should serve a clear purpose; it is not
merely `to think about things' (Jordaan 2018:826) but should be a practice
that helps educators evaluate and adjust their own work to remain relevant
in a fast-changing world. Dewey (as cited in Hébert 2015:362) describes
critical reflection as focussed, careful and methodological. Such a reflection
should be focussed on a clear problem, and examined in a careful way, by
offering justification for views and the chosen methodology, like any
scientific study.

   The research design

This study is a qualitative reflection on student contributions to a textbook
creation process. Qualitative research is traditionally seen as interpretive,
involving a search for meaning and understanding (Aspers & Corte 2019).
Qualitative data are `rich in meaning' (Babbie 2021:26) and useful to provide
explanations in social science but require an understanding of the context of
the participants (Allan 2020). This chapter aims to develop an understanding
(Du Plessis & Abdool-Satar 2020) of student views of the journalism curriculum
by reflecting on and interpreting the collected data (i.e. student contributions
[in the form of assignments] to their textbook). Ultimately, the aim is to give
students a voice. Qualitative research should help illuminate the subjective
understandings of research participants (Fossey et al. 2002) because of the
richness of the data collected. The reflective discussion in the section
`Reflection: What students want and how they think' is based on this methodical
content analysis of student inputs as received in their assignments.

   Sampling

Students from the School of Communication who completed a first-year
introduction to journalism module and a second-year news writing module
participated in the OER textbook creation project through a process of
renewable assessment. The first-year module is an introductory course that
aims to provide students with a broad overview of journalism. The second-
year module is more focussed, with outcomes related to news writing and the
layout of printed news material. Students were prescribed a first-draft
(unpublished) version of an open textbook, written by the author of this
chapter, called How to be a journalist in the 21st century, in the second semester
of 2021. A total of 97 second-year students provided inputs to one chapter of
the textbook related to their outcomes, whereas a total of 145 first-year
students provided inputs to three chapters related to their outcomes. Not all
students gave informed consent for their contributions to be used in this
research or in the final version of the textbook (ethical concerns are discussed
in the section `Ethical issues'). Students were asked (via Google Forms) to
provide informed consent for their inputs to be used for this research, and
also to give permission (via Google Forms) for their inputs to be used in the
textbook. Out of 92 students registered for COMS222, 49 consented. Out of
142 students registered for KCOM121, 67 gave consent. Inputs and comments
from students who did not give consent do not form part of this study or the
final textbook.

   Data collection and analysis

Data were collected from assignments submitted by students. The
assignments consisted of inputs from students to the draft version of the
textbook provided to them. Students were asked to comment on three
chapters (listed in Table 6.1 with a brief explanation of the outcomes of
each chapter).

    The textbook consists of original material and remixed open-source material.
The author of this chapter created a draft version of the textbook by
recontextualising and remixing existing OER material and adding new, original
material. Students were given assignments where they had to comment on
relevant chapters in the book. Students were invited to add their own content,
add comments or simply ask questions if the contents were unclear. In this way,
the project also became a renewable assignment (see Letseka & Seeletso 2021).
Student inputs in this project were added to the final version of the textbook,
which will continue to be prescribed at first- and second-year levels. This means
that student assignments from 2021 will continue to be useful to future students.
Students were asked for informed consent to use their inputs (anonymously)
for this research.

                                                                                                                                             111

                       is relevant and important when considering
                       the challenges facing legacy media.

Students were encouraged to be open-minded and to add any comments
they wished to add. The assignment instructions on the NWU learning
management system read as follows:

    Read the chapter and think about what you are reading. Add AT LEAST FIVE
    comments (using Microsoft Word track changes) to the chapter, a total of at least
    400 words, with suggestions, ideas, clarifications, questions or anything that you
    think might make the chapter more complete or better. Do not be afraid to even
    question what is written there. As university students you should critically reflect on
    texts, there are many different views in the world, and you are entitled to your views.
    HOWEVER, all suggested changes should be accompanied by sources, academic
    textbooks are based on sources and not just ideas. That being said, sometimes your
    own experience does count as a source, if you would like to add a comment about
    some ideas that you have already tried, or something that you know someone else
    did, feel free to add that and explain it clearly. (n.p.)

Student inputs were analysed inductively and sorted according to recurring
themes to help the author identify the most important topics of interest to
students in their learning material.

   Trustworthiness

The findings of a qualitative study, such as the findings reported in this chapter,
must be reliable to be trustworthy. The author ensured trustworthiness of the
data by creating a clear research process (Du Plessis & Abdool-Satar 2020)
and documenting the results, as explained in this section. The researcher
collected real-world data (Du Plessis & Abdool-Satar 2020), namely student
contributions to the textbook. The data evaluation was informed by existing
literature in the field of journalism, decolonisation and open SDL, and then
systematically analysed according to identified themes.

For a qualitative study to be meaningful, the sample size should be meaningful
and the data gathered should be relevant (Fossey et al. 2002). A meaningful
number of students participated and provided informed consent for their
data to be used in the research. The research data in this study were gathered
through student assessments. These assessments were created in such a way
that only relevant data would be collected.

   Ethical issues

Iphofen and Tolich (2018:3) suggest that the qualitative researcher should ask
four important questions when considering ethical issues in research. These
questions are about the content of the project, identifying ethical issues,
addressing these issues and contingency plans to address ethical issues if the
research plan changes. The project described in this chapter is a reflection on
student contributions to a textbook to decolonise the curriculum. The ethical
questions that arise relate to voluntary participation, harm to participants and
anonymity (Babbie 2021:61). The lecturer-student relationship is an important
issue, particularly whether students felt compelled to participate and possible
disadvantages for students who did not participate (Head 2020), which leads
to the question of anonymity (or not), considering that student contributions
will be published as part of an open-source textbook, available to all. These
ethical questions were addressed through an ethics of care (Head 2020). The
question of voluntary participation was addressed by asking students for
permission to use their work for this chapter and the textbook only after their
assignments had been completed. This ensured that nobody felt compelled to
participate. The question of anonymity was addressed in the same way;
students were asked for informed consent to add their names as contributing
authors to the textbook, but the informed consent form did not allow for
individual students to be associated with particular content in the textbook.
There is a list of all contributing student authors. The question of the
researcher's own biases while reflecting on student contributions was
addressed through reflective practise by constantly evaluating results as
informed by current literature so as to ensure that research results were
informed by the data and not by the researcher's own preconceptions (Fossey
et al. 2002). The researcher received ethical clearance for this research from
the NWU Faculty of Education Research Ethics Committee (EduREC) as part
of a group project entitled `Open educational practices and self-directed
learning'. Approval was granted on 30 September 2021.

  Reflection: What students want and how
  they think

Analysis of the collected data showed that students often added completely
new content or new ideas, but they sometimes also added clarifications to

                                                                                                                                            113

existing content or asked for more clarifications on the content. Questions
and requests for clarification showed what students were uncertain about,
while new inputs often showed what students would like to learn. Many of the
examples discussed in this section show that students grabbed the opportunity
to decide what they wanted to learn and to direct their own learning - an
example of SDL in practice. The strong participation of students in creating
their own learning material was one of the most significant insights gained
from this project. It was clear to the author that students wanted to have a say
in what they were learning and when provided with the opportunity, they
would share their own knowledge. This correlates with many of the arguments
in the literature in favour of decolonisation, where there are many calls for
student voices to be heard. The project showed that when students were
empowered, they took charge of their own learning (see Cox et al. 2020; Du
Toit-Brits et al. 2021; Letseka & Seeletso 2021; Olivier 2020).

    The most important themes that emerged from an analysis of student
inputs are illustrated in Table 6.2. The table shows student inputs after an
initial sifting process, where the author selected representative inputs from
the vast number of inputs provided, as explained in the section `Methodology:
The process of reflection'. The table, therefore, does not illustrate all inputs
from all students enrolled for the modules. There were several hundred inputs
in total. Inputs and contributions were selected and classified inductively
as themes that emerged during the analysis. It is important to clarify that
students were not presented with a blank canvas. They were asked to provide
inputs or contributions to a first draft of the textbook. Many of the themes
listed in Table 6.2 were already covered in the textbook. Student inputs served

to highlight the importance of some themes, while students also made some
completely new suggestions for additional content. Analysed inputs were
provided by the 116 students across the two modules who gave consent for
their inputs to be used. Student inputs are discussed anonymously.

    Themes that emerged from student inputs to the open textbook How to be
a journalist in the 21st century are listed in Table 6.2. Students were given the
freedom to add inputs anywhere in the three prescribed chapters. Many inputs
from different students overlapped while some individual inputs contained
many different themes.

    It was clear from student participation in the OER textbook project that
students seized the opportunity to give their opinions and inputs. This was one
of the greatest successes of the project. As has been discussed in the `Conceptual
framework' section, the literature assumes that students would like to take
charge of their own learning, which is one of the aims of SDL (Letseka & Seeletso
2021), that there is a need to decolonise the curriculum and that there is a need
for the curriculum to be adapted to remain relevant in the 21st century. As
suggested by Du Toit-Brits (2021) and Dube (2017), amongst others, it seemed
clear from an analysis of student inputs that when students were given the
opportunity to take charge of their own learning, they felt empowered to make
real changes. In this project, students participated in SDL to diagnose their own
learning needs, to formulate their own learning goals and to choose appropriate
strategies to reach these goals (Knowles as cited in Du Toit-Brits et al. 2021:3).
By offering students the opportunity to diagnose their learning needs and
choosing their own strategies (by creating their own content), the textbook
creation process was a good example of SDL in practice. Students contributed
their own and local knowledge, as is discussed in this section. It is worth noting
that the chapter-editing assignments that students had to complete as part of
this project carried relatively low weights in terms of final module marks.
Students could have quite easily skipped these assignments and could still have
passed their modules; yet in all three assignments, student participation was
extremely high (more than 80% of the 234 students in both modules completed
the assignments). Many students added much more content and comments to
their edited chapters than what was required.

    The themes identified in Table 6.2 encompass the following six broad
topics, which are discussed below:

·· Compassion and the importance of doing it right
·· Distorted views of journalism
·· Sources and finding the correct information
·· How to tell news stories
·· Technology
·· Telling untold stories and new types of journalism
·· Practical suggestions
·· Decolonisation

Decolonising the journalism curriculum through co-creating an open educational textbook

   Compassion and the importance of doing it right

Ethical issues in journalism attracted many inputs from students. Overall, this
theme was the one that seemed to elicit the most questions and concerns.
The results show that students see the need for a different type of journalism
in Africa, which ties in with the question of decolonisation, ubuntu and social
cohesion. Students also showed concern for readers, for example `the people
who most suffers from journalists being unethical are the people which are
the readers' (student, female, first year). Inputs about journalistic ethics
addressed the question of compassion, empathy, an ethics of care, as well as
the need to know what is right and what is wrong.

A student made a link between journalism in Africa and ubuntu, writing:

    `The idea that journalists in Africa put others before writing a story is good. The decision
    they make will be informed by ubuntu. Ubuntu advocates for humanity. Journalists who
    practice it will not put others in a compromising position.' (Student, male, first year)

Many students appeared to favour a community-centred model of journalism,
in line with the principles of ubuntu (Olivier 2020) and an African journalism
model as suggested by Rodny-Gumede (2018), which is about social cohesion
and nation-building. This finding also shows that students wanted to add their
local knowledge to the curriculum. Whereas the Western view of journalism,
driven by the profit motive, is strong in the industry in South Africa, it seems
clear that some students felt the need for more socially responsible journalism.
The following quote by Mahatma Gandhi, social activist and politician, - added
by a student (student, female, first year) to the start of the chapter on
journalistic ethics - summarises to a great extent a general theme of care that
emerged from all inputs:

    `The sole aim of journalism should be service. The newspaper is a great power,
    but just as an unchained torrent of water submerges the whole countryside and
    devastates crops, even so an uncontrolled pen serves but to destroy.'4

Another student added that journalism should care for people and be socially
responsible (student, female, first year). Another (student, female, first year)
suggested that journalists should be `empathetic'. This theme of social
responsibility and feeling empathy for the community was a recurring one, a
further representative example was a student (student, female, first year) who
wrote `community standards that take into account local values should be
applied' and another (student, female, first year) said `different communities
have different needs'.

    Student inputs about ethics also regularly returned to the question of what
is right and what is wrong, for example:

    `Can it be seen as unethical when a news organisation changes a story to protect
    people in the story doing something illegal because it is friends or family of the

    editor or stakeholders of the organisation and what can journalists do about it?'
    (Student, male, first year)

Many students (male and female, first-years) asked quite similar questions,
including:

·· How do journalists know how to do the right thing?
·· How do journalists overcome ethical dilemmas?
·· Why is it difficult to follow clear ethical guidelines?
·· Where do journalists draw the line when making ethical decisions?
·· How can journalists protect the privacy of people in pictures?
·· Do journalists need to apply ethical principles all the time?

Judging by the comments from students, the question of the consequences
of unethical decisions by journalists seemed to be covered insufficiently in the
textbook. A number of students asked for clarification on the consequences
of unethical journalism, such as who should take responsibility. It seems clear
that it matters to students to know what would happen if unethical journalism
is practised. Students wanted to know, in particular, whether journalists
themselves, sub-editors or chief editors would be held responsible for
breaches, and how they would be held responsible, for example `what will
happen if the sub-editor checks the story half-heartedly and miss reads
information that is not correct?' (student, female, first year).

    The textbook did discuss the South African Press Code and the processes
defined by the code, but the consequences of breaches were not clear.
Students were also concerned about news media that do not subscribe to
the Press Code (of which there are quite a number), one student (student,
female, first year) asked, `Are small news organisations independent from
the South African Press Code and therefore have their own code of conduct?'
The concern appeared to be that some media follow certain rules, while
others do not.

    The sheer amount of interest in journalistic ethics and questions about the
consequences of ethics breaches, which were visible from a large number of
inputs from students, show that students have clear and strong views about
doing the `right' kind of journalism. This was a significant realisation for the
author. The comments from students correlate with assumptions from the
conceptual framework about the need for a new kind of journalism in Africa
(Dube 2017; Rodny-Gumede 2018) and show that students feel strongly that
journalism should be compassionate and caring. It seems that the textbook
chapter on ethics in journalism did not address the question of ethics
sufficiently. The chapter is relatively concise, but it seems that, even at an
introductory level to the field of journalism, students require more information
about ethics. They require practical examples and more specific advice about
how to address ethical issues. Upon reflection, it seems as if the Western
tradition of journalism education in South Africa does not adequately address
the needs and sensibilities of students for journalism that is more compassionate

                                                                                                                                            117
Decolonising the journalism curriculum through co-creating an open educational textbook

and caring. Allowing for a more compassionate type of journalism in the
curriculum would contribute to decolonising the curriculum. By showing more
empathy and concern for unheard voices, journalism would be able to provide
a platform for the voices of marginalised people.

   Journalism as `sensationalism'

An interesting theme - almost directly opposed to the discussion in section
`Compassion and the importance of doing it right' - that emerged from some
students was a certain understanding of journalism as sensationalist and
exposé driven. Some students argued that journalists should secretly observe
people or `go undercover' (student, female, first year) in order to expose
wrongdoing or scandals. Another (student, female, second year) wrote:
`Unless the person you are interviewing is the person you want to expose,
most of the time journalists go undercover to obtain information'. Some
students added inputs related to `hidden cameras' (student, male, first year)
to film sources or gathering information in surreptitious ways or speaking to
sources without clearly identifying themselves as journalists, for example a
student (student, female, first year) wrote, `it is important to remain ethical
when using hidden cameras. What is going too far to collect a newsworthy
story?' One student asked, `I'm confused a little bit about paparazzi and
journalists, is this the same thing?' (student, female, first year). A student
(student, male, first year) said, `I believe that we can sometimes bent[d] rules
to keep our readers/listeners/viewers entertained and informed'. These
suggestions by students to gather information secretly or `go undercover'
point to an understanding of journalism that is not ethical (see Retief 2002;
Wyatt 2014).

    These examples show that many students need a clearer explanation of how
ethical journalism works, and that secret information gathering is not ethical
journalism practice. This question was, therefore, addressed in much more
detail, with clear examples in the final textbook. An example of unethical
information gathering that was provided in the final textbook is the News of the
World phone-hacking scandal in the United Kingdom (UK) in 2011. This scandal
led to the closure of the newspaper the News of the World (Wyatt 2014).

    Students who want to gather information secretly to `expose' people seem
to rely on the market-driven model of journalism, to attract more readers
(and, therefore, income) by publishing sensationalist stories. However,
comparatively speaking, many more students emphasised compassion and
empathy for sources (as discussed in the section `Compassion and the
importance of doing it right' about compassion in journalism), which shows
that educators could employ concepts of compassion and empathy, together
with actual ethical codes and guidelines, to teach the correct and ethical ways
of information gathering for news stories.

   Sources and finding the correct information

The theme of sources and gathering information is an important one.
Information gathering for stories relies mostly on primary and secondary
sources. Good journalistic sources include people, for example experts in their
field, ordinary people who experienced events in their own lives or personal
observations by the journalist, and secondary sources such as other published
texts (Ansell 2011). The question of how to find and treat human sources and
how to interview them for stories was a recurring theme in student inputs. The
vast range of inputs on sources show that sources and information gathering
are aspects of journalism that students struggle with. Students appeared to
struggle with identifying good sources (who to speak to for stories) and also
with interviewing sources (what questions to ask them and what information
to use). One student (student, female, second year) called interviews `nerve-
wracking', another (student, female, second year) asked how to distinguish
between facts and perceptions when interviewing a source, and whether to
use perceptions (or opinions) of sources in stories. This was a good question
that needs clarification - opinions of events are the good source material for
news stories. Another student (student, male, second year) provided the
example of his mother who gets very frustrated when she does not receive
replies to emails at work. This is a useful example directly from a student for
the textbook to show that emails are not the best way to find information
from sources. It has been very insightful to hear from students themselves,
through their inputs to the textbook, about the perceived challenges to finding
information and there seems to be a need to explain sources in much more
detail.

    A number of students also mentioned that sources should always be
protected, without clarifying when this is really needed. Some inputs
questioned how to protect the journalist's identity and safety when interviewing
certain sources. One example:

    `How do you deal with your safety as a journalist because I don't think its ethical to
    publish a story without mention[ing] that you're the byline [i.e. providing the name
    of the journalist] but just deciding to stay anonymously?' (Student, male, first year)

When discussing sources, the question of accuracy and fake news also arises.
Fake news and disinformation are serious challenges in journalism
(Applebaum & Pomerantsev 2021; Corner 2017; Friesem 2019). It was very
encouraging to see many student inputs on the importance of accuracy.
Students referred to using trustworthy sources, checking facts and the risk of
losing the public's trust when publishing falsehoods.

    Encouragingly, a few students mentioned that numerical literacy is
important. One student (student, female, second year) mentioned that it is
important for students to know how to use numbers correctly in stories, while
another (student, female, second year) noted the following in the section

                                                                                                                                            119
Decolonising the journalism curriculum through co-creating an open educational textbook

about numerical literacy: `many journalists use too many numbers in an article
that the reader gets confused and [the reader] stops reading'. Numerical
literacy is often neglected in journalism and needs to be addressed properly
in the curriculum.

    From student inputs, it seems clear that finding information and interviewing
sources are difficult for students. This aspect needed more attention in the
final textbook, with more examples of sources and some more details about
how to approach sources, as well as suggested interview questions. Good
sources also relate to accuracy in the news. Being truthful and using the
correct information were aspects that all students agreed on, and it was very
encouraging to see that this very important aspect of journalism was
unanimously supported by all students. The question of accuracy can,
therefore, be used as a tie-in when addressing student concerns about sources.
Stories cannot be accurate without good, clearly identified sources.

   How to tell news stories

A difficult part of journalism teaching for educators is to teach students the
correct (author's emphasis) way to tell journalistic stories. There are clear
journalistic story-writing and storytelling styles (depending on the platform,
whether in print, for broadcast or electronically), but many students questioned
prescribed styles in their inputs. This matter relates to assumptions about the
need for an African form of journalism and the need to tell African stories
(Rodny-Gumede 2018). Student contributions seem to confirm that they feel
a need for different ways of storytelling in journalism. A student added the
following suggestion:

    `I think it is very important for journalists to consider their targeted audience when
    writing a story, for example, in my hometown of Giyani in Limpopo, we use a lot
    of phrases that some people in other areas of the country may not understand,
    however these phrases could add more meaning to the story if local journalists
    were to make use of them in their stories, thus resulting in more people becoming
    interested in reading their stories.' (Student, male, second year)

It seems as if students do not understand the need for the inverted pyramid
form of print news writing (Ansell 2011) or do not believe that it is necessary
anymore. Seen in the context of the assumption that journalism is changing,
there might be some truth to these views. One student (student, female, second
year) asked, `When do you use the inverted pyramid?', and another suggested:

    `I think most stories needs to be played around to keep the readers on the story too,
    yes, it is not a fiction, but you must keep readers on the story but taking a little turn
    and not being straight to the point [...] when telling a story, I believe that you must
    keep your audience in mind.' (Student, male, first year)

The inverted pyramid format of news writing relies on the idea that the most
important information is placed first and the least important information is

120
                                                                                                                                 Chapter 6

placed at the end, with no real ending that wraps up the story. However, from
student inputs, such as the examples in this section, it is clear that students
question this concept. A student (student, female, second year) asked for
`other ways write a news story'. Many students want stories to end, one student
(student, female, first year) said, `I don't understand why inverted pyramid is
the only story structure that does not have a traditional "ending"?'. Perhaps in
an era where students are surrounded by visual and video stories (Bydree,
Fietkiewicz & Lins 2019; Head et al. 2018) that begin and end in more traditional
storytelling ways, students see the need for printed news to also `end'. This is
a really interesting realisation and something that deserves further exploration.
It does concern some of the basic building blocks of journalism, but educators
are faced with an interesting challenge here: If students are permitted to
diagnose their own needs and direct their own learning through SDL - as was
the case with the creation of the textbook discussed here - educators should
then listen to student voices and accept that there is a need for change in how
journalistic storytelling is taught. It is possible to still teach traditional ways of
news writing, while also introducing some new ways, as suggested by students
themselves.

   Technology

Many students expressed concerns about using technology in journalism and
access to technology in general. Employing open pedagogy by using
technology means that one should also address the question of access to
technology (Cox et al. 2020; Olivier 2020, 2021b). The question of access was
a concern for many students in this project. The chapter about entrepreneurial
journalism refers to many new career opportunities for journalists by using
online platforms such as social media or online newsletter providers such as
Substack. A number of students mentioned that many people in South Africa
still do not have good Internet access, or cannot afford it, therefore they might
not be able to use these platforms. Student mentions of access also indicate
that educators who use technology as part of their open pedagogy should
keep in mind that some students might need support to ensure proper access
to learning material and that the question of access to technology is also
important in creating new news platforms. For example, a student, said
(talking about journalism):

    `It is therefore vital to note that a person without access to technological devices or
    the Internet, or someone who cannot afford to make use of such available facilities,
    may not be able to contribute to citizen journalism. In such cases, many of the
    events may remain unreported, especially in rural villages where media houses are
    also rare.' (Student, female, first year)

Interestingly, some students also asked for more detailed explanations of how to
use technology. It is often assumed that young people know technology, especially
mobile phones, well. This is clearly not always the case; it seems as if students do

                                                                                                                                            121
Decolonising the journalism curriculum through co-creating an open educational textbook

still need guidance. One student (student, male, second year) asked for clear
explanations of how to use Google Drive and another (student, male, first year)
asked for more information on how to use a mobile phone as a journalist - good
suggestions. Students might know how to use phones, but they do not know how
to re-purpose their phones as journalistic tools. The How to be a journalist in the
21st century textbook discussed in this chapter will be accompanied by a website
with tutorial videos, where students are shown exactly how to use some of the
most popular technology that is useful for journalists. Technology use was,
however, not explained in detail in the textbook. From student inputs about
technology, it seems clear that there is a need for practical tutorial videos on a
website. This could also provide an opportunity for peer learning.

   Telling untold stories, entrepreneurship and new
   types of journalism

In the conceptual framework it has been stated that journalism as a profession
and journalism as a field of study have changed significantly in the digital era.
Legacy media have lost much influence, and other types of storytelling have
emerged, often on social media (see Deuze 2008; Deuze & Witschge 2018;
Guo & Volz 2019; Lee 2021). It has become apparent in the digital era that
news should be localised (Ezumah 2019) to reach communities where legacy
media are no longer well-represented. Students indicated that it is now
possible for everyone to distribute news and information. A student (student,
female, first year) said, `new technologies have made it possible to disseminate
(distribute) information just as widely as major news organisations'. Many
students referred to the importance of telling local stories or the stories of
marginalised communities. A student (student, female, first year) said
`nowadays anybody can be a journalist [...] and create a community where
you can help people'. Another student (student, male, first year) said,

    `Community members may find it hard to get news from large mass media outlets
    and therefore desperate for local news of what goes on in the community, and
    whether problems are addressed accordingly.'

While another said `journalism is about giving the voiceless a voice' (student,
female, first year), a student (student, female, first year) suggested that this
gap can be filled through `a little newsletter that you can do weekly for your
community [...] or you can create a community Facebook or WhatsApp group'.

    It is an important finding that students recognise there is a news gap and
feel because of this gap, problems in communities are not being addressed.
This links with ideas on the representation of marginalised voices and a more
socially conscious media (Rodny-Gumede 2018) because legacy media outlets
do not represent local voices. A student said:

    `People who live in smaller communities get their news from the local newspaper,
    even though that news might not be important for bigger companies to publish.

122
                                                                                                                                 Chapter 6

    People who live in rural areas don't want to hear the news from big cities, they want
    to know what is going on near them.' (Student, female, first year)

Another representative input from a student:

    `It is also important as an aspiring journalism student to involve yourself with the
    local community project in bring[ing] about development, this can help you to gain
    the respect from people and become popular.' (Student, male, first year)

Yet another example of the importance of giving voice to marginalised groups:

    `The move from print to the digitalisation of newspapers and magazines
    disadvantages so many people in South Africa. Many South Africans are poor and
    uneducated. Data is expensive and as a result, many people cannot participate in
    the access of information and exchange of it.' (Student, male, first year)

New technology, including social media as news platforms in local communities,
came up often. A number of students referred to local news platforms in
specific communities, using Facebook, Instagram, YouTube or Twitter. For
example, (referring specifically to YouTube) `This is a very good and effective
way to earn money as a journalist' (student, female, first year). Some students
also mentioned TikTok influencers in their communities. A student (student,
male, second year) suggested that podcasts are another easy way for
journalists to tell local stories. He said technology made it `more than possible
for anyone to start a podcast'. All these suggestions show that students see
many opportunities to tell stories by using easily available technology. One
student (student, female, first year) spoke about citizen journalism to show
that ordinary people now also practise journalism: `the public and local
community now also play an important role in sharing news, as they experience
it first-hand and have access to sharing platforms'. A student (student, female,
second year) mentioned that local news influencers might be perceived as
more trustworthy by news users because the influencer is someone who is
resident in the community, known by the community and reachable. The
student said it is someone that people would trust, while another (student,
female, first year) said that influencers `give their audiences informed opinions
on the current events that are happening in the world'. While this is certainly
debatable, there is no reason why news influencers with the right skills should
not be able to give informed opinions. A student (student, male, first year)
said, `journalists themselves can become their own influencers'.

    The examples in this section show the student experience of the changing role
of journalism. In South Africa, this means telling more local stories and giving
more people a voice, especially in areas where legacy media are no longer well-
represented. Students evidently feel strongly about local news and providing a
voice to the voiceless. This shows that some students understand that journalism
is no longer only commercial (Bromley 2009), while they also understand that
there are now other voices in journalism (see Deuze 2019). Many students
expressed interest in becoming news entrepreneurs by creating their own local
news platforms. As discussed in the conceptual framework, journalistic

                                                                                                                                           123
Decolonising the journalism curriculum through co-creating an open educational textbook

entrepreneurs are now a large part of the journalism workforce (Caplan et al.
2020), and from student inputs, it seems clear that students are motivated to
create their own news platforms. Student interest in becoming small news
entrepreneurs is a significant finding, as the traditional assumption at journalism
schools has been that journalism graduates will work for legacy media. This
finding also points to the need to broaden the scope of journalism teaching to
reach students who do not necessarily plan to become professional journalists, as
Kruger (2022) suggests. There seems to be a clear need to empower students to
become independent journalists, but one student said a lack of money would be
an obstacle. As Deuze (2018) and Mabweazara and Mare (2021) pointed out,
there are now many people who practise journalism as ordinary citizens, outside
professional structures. Empowering students to become journalism entrepreneurs
should also involve teaching technical skills. The textbook section on
entrepreneurial journalism addressed some of these needs, but there is a need to
expand this section to also address funding more directly and to provide more
practical examples of independent journalism opportunities.

   Practical suggestions

A large number of students provided practical suggestions to improve the
book chapters or add additional content. Some students edited the language
(not always correctly, but they tried), and some students suggested that
tables and more visual content be added and that more visual explanations of
concepts or processes be included. All these inputs were very useful and
showed the need for some practical improvements to the textbook. These
inputs clearly showed that students saw the OER project as an opportunity to
improve their learning by addressing their own learning needs and experiences
in a textbook. Some of the new content that students asked for (all these were
asked for by several students) are:

·· Graphic representations of the interview process and the news reporting
    process

·· A graphic representation of the inverted pyramid, with a clear example of
    a real story. The textbook did contain a graphic example of the inverted
    pyramid, but students asked for a depiction of a real news story inside the
    inverted pyramid - a good idea that was adopted

·· The dos and do nots of ethical journalism
·· A discussion of the work of infographics journalists
·· Additional examples of journalistic ethics codes
·· More examples of journalistic entrepreneurship.

   Open educational resources and decolonisation

The preceding discussion leads to a reflection on the contribution of SDL
within open pedagogy towards the decolonisation of the curriculum, as was

                                                                                                                                 Chapter 6

discussed in this chapter. The contextual framework for this chapter shows
that access to learning material is problematic in South Africa because of the
high costs of textbooks (Cox et al. 2020), but access is not the only problem
when discussing decolonisation. It is also about giving students the opportunity
to decide what they would like to learn and giving them a chance to create
their own learning material by participating in SDL. Students should know
they have agency to influence their learning. The simple act of allowing
students to contribute to their learning can contribute to decolonising the
curriculum by, in fact, listening to students and integrating their views and
contributions into the curriculum. As many students as possible were included
in this project, from previously marginalised students to wealthy students. The
OER textbook discussed in this chapter was provided to students for free on
the NWU e-learning platform (eFundi). Students did require Internet access to
be able to read or download the textbook. The university provided students
with free Internet access in 2021 (because of the remote teaching environment
brought about by the coronavirus pandemic), which meant that access was
not a problem. All students had access to the textbook. Therefore, the provision
and subsequent adaptation of the OER textbook in this project serve as an
example of a decolonised approach to introducing local knowledge to the
curriculum, as suggested by De Beer and Mentz (2019) and Olivier (2020).
The project discussed in this chapter helped address the injustice that
suppresses students' ability to shape what they learn (Cox et al. 2020). In this
project, students were able to shape their learning through the process of
SDL. There were many examples (as shown throughout this section) where
students adapted the textbook to their needs. Some of these changes are
requests for a more socially responsible type of journalism and suggestions to
include other types of storytelling in news writing apart from the well-known
inverted pyramid formula.

  Recommendations and limitations

The following recommendations flow from this study:

·· Localising the curriculum (Olivier 2020) is important to make the journalism
    curriculum more relevant to students in the South African context. This can
    be done by involving students in the process of creating textbooks through
    renewable assessments, as has been shown in the textbook creation
    process discussed in this chapter.

·· Students require visual representations of difficult concepts in the
    journalism curriculum.

·· The journalism curriculum can be decolonised by listening to students and
    incorporating their inputs and local knowledge, such as their experiences
    of news events in their local communities and how these events should be
    covered, into texts. Introducing local knowledge and student views to the
    curriculum contribute to the creation of localised resources.

                                                                                                                                           125
Decolonising the journalism curriculum through co-creating an open educational textbook

·· The process of creating OERs through student inputs can empower
    students and provide them with a strong motivation to take part in creating
    their own learning.

·· The provision of an OER textbook ensures that no students are excluded.
    By using OERs, academics can ensure that all students have equal access
    to quality resources.

·· There are still few studies about the use of OEPs in HE. This study has shown
    that OEPs can be useful to reach specific goals, such as the integration of local
    knowledge and the decolonisation of the curriculum. Furthermore, similar
    studies would contribute to a growing corpus of studies on the use of OEPs.

·· An aspect that was not addressed in this project, but that is still important,
    is the availability of resources in indigenous languages (cf. Chapter 2). To
    fully decolonise the curriculum, it is necessary to translate textbooks into
    more indigenous languages (Olivier 2020). Journalism educators should
    address this.

Students who participated in creating the OER textbook discussed in this
study are undergraduate students with little experience in journalism. One
should accept that some of the student suggestions might not be practical.
For example, the strong desire by students to give voice to the voiceless in the
media does not take into account funding issues. Who will pay for the news in
this case? It is beyond the scope of this chapter to explore funding issues in
journalism, but it is worth noting that there are still many challenges and
unanswered questions in this regard, providing possibilities for future studies.
Localising the curriculum should also involve translation of learning material
into indigenous languages. This was not addressed as part of this study and is
a gap that should be addressed in future research.

  Conclusion

This chapter attempted to offer an answer to the research question: How can
the co-creation process of an OER textbook for journalism assist educators in
updating and decolonising the curriculum?

    This chapter shows that SDL - defined as the process where individuals
take the initiative to diagnose their own learning needs to formulate their own
learning goals and to choose appropriate strategies to reach these goals
(Knowles as cited in Du Toit-Brits et al. 2021:3) - as part of open pedagogy
can be an effective way for students to take charge of their own learning. This,
in turn, plays a significant role in decolonising the curriculum by giving
students the opportunity to adapt content to their learning needs. The South
African journalism curriculum is still Western-orientated, mainly because the
curriculum lacks the voices of students and therefore lacks indigenous and
contextual knowledge. Students can add this type of knowledge, as has
happened in the project described in this chapter.

The project showed that students have a strong need to take charge of their
own learning. Students have very strong views about what is right and what is
wrong in journalism and a desire for a more compassionate style of journalism.
This correlates with some of the assumptions in the conceptual framework
about the need for a new kind of journalism in Africa, different from the
Western normative model, which does not fit in with the viewpoints of many
students. Students expressed the need for more empathy and compassion in
journalism, which will result in representing more marginalised voices in the
news. By giving marginalised people a voice, journalism will become more
representative. Students' need to give voice to the voiceless also relates to the
reality that many smaller communities no longer have strong news media
representation. Students would like to address this gap in the journalism
ecosystem.

    Students also have new ideas about telling journalistic stories. This relates
to the conceptual assumption that journalism is changing. While journalistic
storytelling traditionally follows very specific formats, students expressed
interest in doing it differently. It might be necessary to accept that journalistic
storytelling should also adapt.

    The process of creating a textbook together with students has shown that
students are holders of knowledge that they can share with future students by
adding their knowledge to an OER textbook. By involving students and
listening to them, the demands from students themselves for decolonisation
can be addressed (Cox et al. 2020). The knowledge of students comes from
their own, individual circumstances; their questions and inputs showed where
the textbook needed clarification or more information to make the textbook
more relevant to them. Creating a textbook with inputs from students is an
example of SDL, where students have been given agency to take charge of
their own learning. Not only were students able to direct their learning, but
the lecturer gained deep insight into students' thinking processes and their
knowledge about the subject. This is useful to create a textbook that is up-to-
date and representative of student views and knowledge.

  Abstract

Research consistently shows that music education benefits the socio-
emotional development of young child. Although there are many resources
available for childhood music education in general, music teachers continually
draw attention to a lack of music teaching resources to nurture young children's
socio-emotional learning (SEL). Second-year Bachelor of Music (BMus)
students at the North-West University (NWU) are required `to demonstrate
detailed knowledge and a clear understanding of the relationship between
child development and music education' (NWU 2022:323). Accordingly, the
Singing Feelings project was initiated, where students create open educational
music resources (OEMRs) that focus on SEL for an online platform,

singingfeelings com. This qualitative narrative inquiry aimed to explore the
students' learning experiences. The themes derived from a cross-case analysis
of the data were (1) challenges, (2) creativity, (3) feelings and emotions, and
(4) value. The author proposes that by exploring these themes through the
students' personal stories, more meaningful learning experiences could be
designed to increase awareness of the value of open educational resources
(OERs) and promote more innovative opportunities to create OEMRs.

  Introduction

The instruction process consists of four elements: `learning outcomes, learning
resources, teaching and learning activities, and assessments and evaluation'
(Paskevicius 2017:125). How the relationships between these elements are
managed by tertiary educators `could be considered the core of their
instructional practice' (Paskevicius 2017:125).

    Opportunities for innovative practices in education are created by using
available digital technologies, but it remains a challenge to apply digital
technologies effectively. Paskevicius (2017:125) claims that digital technologies
`enable the creation of digital resources that can be copied and shared with
minimal costs or effort'. In addition, the Internet provides a global network
that facilitates searches for and access to online resources. The recent
emergence in tertiary education of open access to teaching and learning
material - including educational content, learning designs and learning
activities - provides valuable resources and opportunities `to move towards a
more participatory culture' (Brown & Adler 2008:18; Ehlers & Conole 2010:3).
Consequently, models for open licensing support the legal copying, adaptation
and re-sharing of digital educational materials (cf. Chapter 1).

    Globally, childhood development can be assessed in four main profile areas
(UNESCO 2016): `executive function, social and emotional development,
motor development, and early literacy and numeracy'. A growing database of
research literature conveys how each of these profile areas can be fostered
`through sustained engagement in musical activity' (Welch et al. 2014:8).
Studies on children's social and emotional development (Barrett 2011:410,
2015, 2017; Barrett et al. 2019; Hallam 2010) are amongst the many available
resources for early childhood music education (Váradi 2022). However, a lack
of teaching resources in music classrooms poses challenges to teaching the
subject effectively and consequently contributes to learners' socio-emotional
development (Edgar 2013; Montgomery 2021; Strachan 2021). To address this
problem, students could create their own teaching resources. Students who
manage the materials for their own learning are self-directed learners. (Gharti
2019:62). Self-directed learning (SDL) `engages students in self-motivation,
self-consciousness, self-control, self-dependence and active learning' (cf.
Chapter 3). Through SDL, `individuals take the initiative, with or without the
help of others, to identify materials and resources for learning' (Gharti 2019:62).

  Problem statement and research question

The rationale for this study is that there are many musical resources available
that nurture SEL, but they are often costly. Although research related to OERs
has expanded, only a few researchers focus on OERs in music instruction.
Affordability and equitable access to tertiary education `affect students in
many disciplines, including music' (Allen 2022:1). Music learners often have to
spend much more for their education than learners in other disciplines do; for
example, they have to purchase instruments, pay for repairs and buy sheet
music. Allen (2022:2) claims that using OERs could reduce the financial burden
often associated with music study. However, the literature on music students'
experiences in creating open educational music resources (OEMRs) is
insufficient in South Africa and internationally (Gullings 2017; Sandoval &
Oshukany 2018).

    Open educational resources available on the Internet could be incorporated
`into other educational resources to develop online learning materials' (Beaven
2013) serving several purposes, such as sources to inspire (Borthwick &
Gallagher-Brett 2014; Weller et al. 2015) or for engagement in creative projects
(Tur, Urbina & Moreno 2016). However, `more theoretical research on the time,
effort and associated literacies is needed to conduct these activities and
gauge their influence on pedagogy' (Beetham et al. 2012; Jhangiani et al. 2016;
Littlejohn & Hood 2016; Paskevicius 2017).

    The research question for this study was: What are the learning experiences
of music education students creating OEMRs?

    The purpose of this qualitative narrative inquiry was therefore focused on
addressing this question and establishing how these learning experiences
could enhance SDL for students as creators of OEMRs.

  Literature

Creating original songs as OERs to nurture SEL through music, using open
educational practices (OEPs) (cf. Chapter 1 and Chapter 8), is appropriate in
the context of music education. For the purpose of this chapter, I will use the
acronyms OEMRs and OEMPs (open educational musical practices). To
establish how OEMPs as renewable assignments could enhance SDL for
students as creators of OEMRs, creating OEMRs was explored in the context
of SDL of music student teachers.

   Self-directed learning of music student teachers

The quality of the teacher-student relationship and communication are both
critical determinants of successful collaboration. Leahy and Smith (2021:289)
claim that although adult music students `may expect to be more independent

                                                                                                                                            131
Stories students tell abouttheir learning experiences

and, therefore more inclined to engage in SDL than younger learners, they
may not feel encouraged or supported to self-direct'. Grow (1990, 1994)
describes how adults participate in SDL across four distinct stages:

    During the first stage, low self-direction, learners need explicit directions, external
    motivation, and external reinforcement. In the next step, moderate self-direction,
    learners are interestable, responsible, and ready to learn. In the following stage,
    intermediate self-direction, learners are participants in their own education and
    able to explore a subject with a guide. The final stage, high self-direction, is where
    learners set their own goals and standards and make use of experts, institutions,
    and other resources to pursue their goals. (pp. 58-60)

Students' learning needs at each stage differ, which implies that educators
`take different roles and implement various strategies to support students in
any particular stage' (Grow 1990:59).

    Good teaching occurs when `(1) the teacher matches the learner's level of
self-direction, and (2) the teacher prepares students for greater self-direction'
(Grow 1990, 1994). According to Leahy and Smith (2021):

    To match a learner's level of self-direction, teachers can assess a student's learning
    stage by monitoring the student's behaviour and listening to their reported needs,
    making appropriate accommodations while being mindful that learners may
    vacillate between stages. (p. 289)

Teachers should create a more relaxed environment by using humour, praise,
respect and lightheartedness in lessons (Leahy & Smith 2021:289; Rohwer
2005, 2008). Teachers should `break things down and move step-by-step
without causing students to feel as though they are being treated like children'
(Rohwer 2012). Overall, in addition to musical competence, an educator's
`personality and capacity to be compassionate' are critical for being a
successful music student teacher educator (Rohwer 2008, 2012; Tsugawa
2009). Tekkol and Demirel (2018:3) have linked SDL `with upper-level thinking
skills such as creativity, problem solution and critical thinking'. When students
create OEMR, SDL is enhanced.

   Towards open educational music resources and
   open educational musical practices

The adoption of OER in higher education institutions (HEIs) has a secondary
impact on students' `initial exposure to open education, open licensing and
non-commercial sources of knowledge' (Carey et al. 2015:166). Acknowledging
and sharing these collaboratively created resources through open education
could impact students' knowledge practices (Carey et al. 2015:166). These
practices make higher education (HE) activities `more relevant in modern
society' and `foster the development of valuable literacies for students
entering the workforce' (Royle, Stager & Traxler 2014:130). For music student
teachers entering the workforce, valuable literacies include, but are not limited

132

to, applying knowledge to compose original songs that are relevant in an
educational context.

    As a developing area, specific terms related to OER may be familiar, but an
understanding of the premise and purpose of the openly licensed material is
still unclear to many. Continued research into OER will better inform all music
educators and emphasise how OER can provide free, high-quality teaching
materials for music instruction (Allen 2022:10). Many studies have highlighted
using OER both in and outside of traditional music classrooms, yet research in
the field of OER in music remains limited (Allen 2022:4; Gullings 2017; ISKME
2013; Schmidt-Jones 2012:14, 2017:113). Before OER adoption can occur,
`individuals and/or institutions must have the desire or volition to use or create
these resources' (Cox & Trotter 2017a:155). The six factors that comprise the
OER adoption pyramid are volition (the most critical factor essential to
successful adoption), access, permission, awareness, capacity and availability
(Cox & Trotter 2017a:155). These six factors provide `an analytical framework
for inquiry on OER adoption' (Figure 7.1).

Stories students tell abouttheir learning experiences

The OER adoption pyramid is a conceptual framework that has been used
primarily in tertiary education, a `major hub for the creation and consumption
of OER' (Baas, Admiraal & Van den Berg 2019:2; Cox & Trotter 2017b:290).
While OERs exist for music learning and have been scrutinised for use in
formal and informal education, `future studies examining OER adoption by
music educators at all levels are needed' (Allen 2022:5).

    An OER can benefit both faculties and students in many ways; hence,
`increasing awareness of these resources is essential to encourage creating
and sharing high-quality materials for music education' (Allen 2022:10). In
addition, Practical applications of OER and research investigating cost
benefits, perceptions, learning outcomes and use (Hilton et al. 2016:12) `would
add relevant data and provide clear evidence for considering OER for music
instruction' (Allen 2022:10).

    A high degree of openness would involve the joint formulation of the
learning outcomes, objectives and methods, allowing for greater
personalisation, autonomy, self-regulation and increased student engagement
(Ehlers 2011:2; Hipkins 2012; Paskevicius 2017:129; Reeve et al. 2004:151). Self-
regulation is an outcome of being self-directed in one's learning. Self-directed
learning refers to an individual's ability to take the initiative to identify their
own learning needs, determine their learning aims, define the learning sources,
`choose or use appropriate learning strategies and evaluate learning outcomes
with or without help from an outsider' (Knowles 1975). In SDL, students `take
primary charge of planning, continuing and assessing their learning
experiences' (Merriam, Caffarella & Baumgartner 2007).

    In the last decade, scholars have proposed `that research on OER should
focus less on access to digital content and more on the influence of openness
to support innovative educational practices' (Kimmons 2016:17; OPAL 2011).
By exploring a broader notion of openness in education, `the focus is shifting
from content (OER) to OEPs for using that content' (Deimann & Farrow
2013:347). The focus of discourses from OERs moving towards OEPs represents
a positive advancement in the field, `representing a change from developing
and releasing OER content to researching their impact' (Weller et al. 2015:352).
Friesen (2009:8) and Paskevicius (2017:127) emphasise that educational
technology initiatives should support and report not only on products but
also on practices and processes (Ehlers 2013):

    OEPs are educational activities where both resources are shared by making them
    openly available and pedagogical practices are employed which rely on social
    interaction, knowledge creation, peer learning and shared learning practices. (p. 94)

Stagg's (2014:159) continuum model for OEP ranges `from awareness of and
access to OER, sharing one's works as OER, passive remixing of OER, active
remixing of OER, and finally, student engagement' in creating OERs
(Paskevicius 2017). In SDL, `the responsibility to learn shifts from an external

source' (Boyer & Usinger 2015), such as a music teacher educator to the music
teacher-student. Self-directed learning includes the conceptualisation, design,
implementation and evaluation of learning guided by the student (Brookfield
2009). The student's control and active involvement in the learning process
are crucial (Boyer & Usinger 2015; Grover 2015).

    Student engagement with openness could promote the competencies,
knowledge and skills needed to participate successfully within a more open
society's cultural, economic, political and social realms (ed. Geser 2007:17;
McAndrew, Scanlon & Clow 2010). However, `a greater understanding of the
issues, challenges and necessary supports' are necessary to develop OEP
further when one wants to adopt such practices (Beetham et al. 2012;
Borthwick & Gallagher-Brett 2014:166; Camilleri, Ehlers & Pawlowski 2014:36;
Littlejohn & Hood 2016:505; Paskevicius 2017:126; Pitt 2015:145).

   Socio-emotional learning in music
   teacher education

Socio-emotional learning is `the process of understanding and comprehending
the socio-emotional aspects of life' (Wijaya, Bunga & Kiling 2022:114). Building
SEL skills can enable behaviour to calmly address stressful situations with
emotionally regulated responses and enhance critical thinking to allow more
informed decision-making and action (Arslan & Demirtas 2016). Critical
thinking and reflection, empathy, equity, cultural responsiveness and diversity
are guiding values in music teacher education (Allsup 2003, 2015; Allsup &
Westerlund 2012; Barrett 2015; Tucker & Powell 2021). These aspects could
simultaneously enhance SDL, as specific competencies that SDL requires,
according to Knowles (1975), including the ability to evaluate learning
processes and outcomes, turning students `into active participants in the
learning process and encouraging them to become deep learners' (Spencer &
Jordan 1999). Tucker and Powell (2021) postulate that music teacher education
is often viewed `as a locus for socially just transformation of music education
through the development of preservice teacher agency and identity
development'. Although values are implicit in agency, values have seldom
been directly examined in music teacher preparation programs (Kupana 2015):

    As music and SEL complement each other, further investigation into socio-
    emotional learning in music education (SELME) is motivated by the properties of
    music that can be used a) as an emotional stimulus; b) as an aesthetic experience; c)
    for relaxation and imagination; d) as a form of self-expression, and e) as a form of
    group experience. (p. 75)

Because of the significant relationship between teaching effectiveness and
socio-emotional skills, the knowledge and skills in music teacher training for
SEL should be nurtured (Kupana 2015:75). UNESCO (2020) suggests ensuring
SEL instruction and practice for teachers by including SEL in pre- and in-service

                                                                                                                                           135
Stories students tell abouttheir learning experiences

teacher education and professional development programmes to address stress
and boost social and emotional competencies in the classroom. They also
emphasise that school administrations should allocate sufficient time and
opportunities for student teachers to acquire SEL skills, which have been found
effective in promoting well-being, reducing psychological distress and improving
classroom interactions (Jennings 2019; Jennings & Greenberg 2009).

    Music education benefits the SEL of the young child (Belapurkar 2017;
Blasco-Magraner et al. 2021; Boucher et al. 2021). Therefore, second-year
music education students at our university are expected to `demonstrate
detailed knowledge and a clear understanding of musical development of the
young child and the relationship between knowledge, child development and
music education' (NWU 2022:323). To equip these students to understand
this relationship, the Singing Feelings project6 was initiated in 2021.

  The `Singing Feelings Project'

Undergraduate music education students, as future educators, could assist
children in developing the socio-emotional skills they need for sensitive
musicking - and for life (Jacobi 2012:68). The purpose of this project, which
was part of the NWU OER Fellowship (cf. Chapter 1), was to create a platform
that makes freely available the musical resources that can impact children's
socio-emotional development. At the same time, Music Education students
could teach children of diverse contexts and accommodate multilingualism by
creating their own songs for children in many languages (Okal 2014):

    Multilingualism practices in education could nurture the creation and appreciation of
    cultural awareness, contribute to academic and educational value, enhances creativity,
    improve adjustment in society and appreciation of local languages. (p. 223)

By creating their own multilingual songs, students would need to spend less
time finding resources and could spend more time developing their own skills
to create resources for early childhood contexts. This relates to Merriam's
argument that SDL goals should develop `the learner capacity to be self-
directed, fostering transformational learning and promoting emancipatory
learning and social action' (Merriam 2001:9). Gharti (2019:62) postulates that
in SDL, students should self-initiate learning, actively participate and learn
independently, but also have the boldness to ask for support from others
when necessary.

    As part of this narrative inquiry, students created OEMR for teachers,
children and undergraduate music educators. These resources are available
as renewable assignments on an online platform, singingfeelings.com
(Figure 7.2).

   Renewable assignments

Renewable assignments (cf. Chapter 1, Chapter 6 and Chapter 10) are tasks
`students compile and openly publish so that the assignment outcome is
inherently valuable and accessible to the community' (Chen 2018; Wiley &
Hilton 2018). Categories of assignments, defined by Wiley and Hilton (2018)
illustrate the spectrum between disposable and renewable assignments.
Regarding their criteria, assignments are categorised as `disposable,
authentic, constructionist and renewable'. The disposable assignment, a
student-created artefact that meets the essential criterion, is submitted to
the instructor. When the value of that artefact extends beyond the students'
own learning, for example, creating tutorial content for future classes, it can
be classified as `an authentic assignment'. Students make an authentic
assignment publicly available in the constructionist assignment. The educator
invites students to openly license and publicly share their work with the
global community to be considered renewable (Wiley & Hilton 2018). In the
Singing Feelings project, the students developed original renewable
assignments, and remixed or adapted existing OER (Wiley & Hilton 2018).
The renewable assignments created by the students were original children's
songs. They had to compose a melody, write the lyrics and record the song
related to specific feelings. They adapted existing OER when they translated
songs I wrote for the project into other languages, as seen in the following
examples. Students translated the Afrikaans song `Moenie worry nie' into
Setswana and English (Figure 7.3 and Figure 7.4).

                                                                                                                                           137

Learner autonomy is the characteristic of the person who independently
exhibits agency in learning activities (Mensch 2008; Ponton 1999; Ponton &
Carr 2000:273) `where independence is the characteristic of the person who
controls their actions, handling being a state of mind, as well as of one's
environment' (Sheldon & Elliot 1998:546). The students independently created
OEMRs as renewable assessments that could enhance SDL, as competencies
were developed that are required by SDL. These competencies include taking
responsibility for determining one's own learning needs, setting goals and
plans, and implementing and evaluating learning activities (Knowles 1975).

The five specific objectives in the Singing Feelings project for creating
renewable assignments as OEMR were:

1. To collect, produce and facilitate the creation of OEMR to support
    children's SEL

2. To equip young learners with musical tools for self-expression
3. To inspire students to apply their musical knowledge in practice
4. To engage young children through music
5. To nurture young children's well-being in creative and fun ways.

The renewable assignments were licensed with a Creative Commons (CC)
license. Specifically, a CC-BY-NC-SA license indicating that the songs and
music activities on the singingfeelings.com website should `be attributed to
the original author' and cannot be used for commercial purposes. If the
resources are adapted, they `should be shared under the same license as the
original' (Lewis 2022).

    The duration of the Singing Feelings project stretched over two months,
from introducing the project at the end of July, and students submitting the
final assignments at the end of September.

   Learning experiences

There were six renewable assignments set in the Singing Feelings project.
Every renewable assignment commenced with a freewriting exercise, after
which the students had to respond to a blog post related to the topic of a
specific assignment. Students then had to apply musical resources as
preparation for creating original songs. Initially, students added a second
verse to their own song choice (available on the singingfeelings.com website
under a CC license). Subsequently, students had to notate their second verse
using open-source music notation software and record the song they wrote to
be freely available as an OEMR. Open-source music notation software allows
one to create sheet music in printable form, including portable document
format (PDF) and images (Srivastava 2019). This software has open-source
license, which allow one to download, copy, analyse and modify the source
codes of the software. Open-source music notation software used by the
students were MuseScore Notation Software7 and Finale Notepad.8

input methods. It is released as free and open-source software under the GNU General Public License. (https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MuseScore)

8. Finale is `a proprietary music notation software developed and released by MakeMusic for Microsoft Windows
and macOS'. Finale is one of the industry standards for music notation software (Nicholl & Grudzinski 2007:110)
MakeMusic offers several less expensive versions of Finale, with limited features. These include the freeware
program, Finale Notepad, allowing rudimentary editing and playback.

Stories students tell abouttheir learning experiences

For the third assignment,9 students composed a four-line ditty10 based on the
toddler drone11 to help children discover their singing voice by using nonsense
syllables (singingfeelings.com). After that, they notated the melody with the
new lyrics and added a CC license before recording the ditty.

    The feeling-related topic for the fourth assignment12 was happiness.
Students composed `a song for children' related `to happiness or being happy'
and recorded the song before making their musical creations available as
OEMR (singingfeelings.com).

    The feeling-related topic for the fifth assignment13 was feeling worried. For
the first part of the learning experience, students translated an existing song
(available on the singingfeelings.com website under a CC license) about not
worrying into another language and saved it with a CC license. For the second
part of the learning experience, students composed a song for children that
related to feeling worried and recorded both songs before making their songs
available as OEMR.

    The feeling-related topic for the sixth assignment14 was sadness. For the first
part of the assignment, students translated an existing song about sadness
(available on the singingfeelings.com website under a CC license) into another
language and saved it with a CC license. For the second part of the assignment,
students composed a song related to sadness for children. They recorded both
songs before making their original songs available as OEMR.

  Procedures

A qualitative research approach within a social constructivist paradigm design
(Creswell & Creswell 2018:38) was most appropriate for this study, as data
were collected `in a natural setting in the context of the participants' (Creswell &
Creswell 2018:230), namely the Conservatory.

   Participants

The participants in this narrative inquiry were four female BMus students in
their second year of a music education module. The `Independent recruitment'

10. A ditty is a short, simple song.

11. The most familiar instantiation of the toddler drone is `on the taunting nonsense string "nyah, nyah, nyah,
nyah, nyah"'. `It has both a fixed melody (the intervals being quite exactly defined' based on the descending
so-mi-la-so-mi intervals) and a fixed rhythm (Liberman 1975:32).

section briefly explains the ethical measures to mitigate coercion. The
participants' identities were kept anonymous, and pseudonyms, which they
chose themselves, were used for identification. At the time of data collection,
Jasmine was 22-years-old, Pearl was 21-years-old, and both Lilly and Kiara
were 20-years-old.

   Sampling

The students involved in this research were drawn from university students
enrolled in a music education module where appropriate OEPs are utilised,
and OERs created as renewable assignments in support of SDL. These research
participants consisted of the four music student teachers who created OEMRs
as renewable assignments for Singing Feelings' online platform. They were
willing to participate and provide informed consent to be included in the
research. Convenience sampling was used as a sampling technique (Dörnyei
2007; Etikan, Musa & Alkassim 2015):

    Convenience sampling (also known as Haphazard sampling or Accidental sampling)
    is a type of nonprobability or non-random sampling where members of the target
    population meet specific practical criteria, such as easy accessibility, geographical
    proximity, availability at a given time, or the willingness to participate is included for
    the purpose of the study. (p. 20)

Convenience sampling also refers `to the researching subjects of the population
that are easily accessible to the researcher' (Given 2008). Although the
participants met the practical criteria, the purpose of the study was to explore
second-year students' learning experiences creating OEMR in a specific music
education module.

   Independent recruitment

Participation in this research was voluntary and only participants who willingly
provided written informed consent participated in the data collection. An
independent person obtained written informed consent from the participants.
The participants could withdraw from the study without any penalty or
disadvantage. As the participants were my own students, any possible power
relationships were negotiated through the additional use of an independent
person.

  Research approach

As a social constructivist, I used an interpretative lens to make sense of the
participants' experiences (Creswell 2014:8). Subjective interpretations of their
experiences were created (Creswell 2014:8), and their personal, distinctive
realities influenced their understanding. These interpretations and meanings
were diverse and numerous, and I explored the intricacy of their

                                                                                                                                            141
Stories students tell abouttheir learning experiences

views (Creswell 2014:9). I was interested in the meaning of the participants'
stories and therefore explored their perspectives on the studied phenomenon
(Creswell 2014:9), namely their experiences of learning to create OEMR.

    A qualitative research approach entails `exploring and understanding the
meaning that individuals or groups ascribe to certain problems' (Creswell
2014:4). This research process involved combining questions, data and
procedures to build specific themes based on the raw data (Creswell 2014:4).
Then, the four themes that emerged from the cross-case analysis of the data
were used `to interpret and ascribe meaning to the data' (Creswell 2014:4).

    I studied and interpreted the phenomenon of the learning experiences of
four students creating OEMR. These four participants' stories formed a
narrative (Denzin & Lincoln 2011:5).

   Narrative inquiry

Clandinin et al. (2016:23) describe narrative inquiry as `a collaboration between
researcher and participants over time, in a place or series of sites, and social
interaction with their surroundings'. Narrative inquiry was appropriate for this
research, as `narrative is present at all times, in all places, in all societies; indeed,
the narrative starts the very history of mankind [...] Like life itself, it is there,
international, trans-historical, transcultural' (Barthes & Duisit 1975:240). The
narrative allows the participants and the researcher `to comprehend, describe,
and act within previous experiences, as the story is how they make sense of the
world' (Clandinin & Connelly 2000; Singh 2014; Wang 2017:44). The student
participants told the stories of creating OER in a music education module by
describing their experiences. `Narratives have considerable significance in
teacher education' (Kaasila 2007:206). A narrative view of teacher education
emphasises `the personal process of becoming a teacher and construing one's
professional identity. An effective and emotional element is essential to these
processes' (Heikkinen et al. 2004). In this study, I strove to understand the
experiences as storied phenomena that could be best studied by attending
closely `to the stories we live and tell' (Clandinin et al. 2016:13). There would
never be a final story in a narrative inquiry, but pieces of the four participants'
stories could influence future research (Clandinin 2016:24-25).

   Data collection

To start the process of data collection, I interviewed and engaged in conversations
with the participants (Denzin & Lincoln 2011:3) in their natural setting, where
contact classes take place at the Conservatory.

    Although data collection spanned over four months, the duration of the
Singing Feelings project was two months, which entailed introducing
the project at the end of July and submitting the final assignments at the end

of September. The final interviews took place at the end of the academic year
after the marks had been finalised. In addition, students reflected on their
learning experiences by creating OEMR weekly through journaling. The
prompts that guided the reflections for each assignment, as stated on the
singingfeelings.com website, were:

·· Could you tell a story of a peak experience while involved in songwriting?
·· Could you tell a story of a challenging moment during this learning

    experience - if there was such a moment?
·· What in this learning experience did you find valuable? This can include

    skills, knowledge, experiences, insights, etc.
·· How do you think others might benefit from the work you put into this

    assignment?
·· Can you tell me more about how you experienced integrating technology

    with songwriting while working on this assignment?
·· Do you think you would use the OEMR on the website in your own teaching

    or maybe in another context?

I conducted three focus group interviews, one every fortnight and one
individual interview with each participant at the end of the semester.

   Narrative data analysis

I applied inductive data analysis in this study, using the data from the individual
reflections, focus group interviews, and personal interviews to form a narrative
for each participant. A back-and-forth working process between themes and
the raw data ensured that the best-suited themes were selected for the cross-
case analysis. The stories of the participants were interpreted as they were
told. The narrative analysis was executed in two phases. First, I manually
analysed each participant's account from the reflective journals and interviews
to compose a narrative while respecting each individual's original story
(Riessman 2007).

    After retelling each participant's story, a cross-case analysis was executed
to enhance transferability to other contexts and determine the findings'
relevance in similar settings. I used Atlas.ti 22 to assist in coding and
categorising the raw data from the narratives for the cross-case analysis.
Through the cross-case analysis of the data through Atlas.ti 22, four themes
related to the participants' learning experiences creating OEMR became
evident: challenges, creativity, feelings and value.

    Atlas.ti 22 is computer-assisted qualitative data analysis software (CAQDAS)
(Yin 2014:192) to assist in searching for connections, patterns or concepts to
establish relevant themes (Yin 2014:194) and categories (Creswell 2014:195).

was ensured through member checking, whereby `the final report or specific
description or themes' were returned to the participants (Creswell 2009:191)
to offer them `an opportunity to provide context and an alternative
interpretation' (Patton 2002:561). Because they are the ones in the experience
studied, Loh (2013:6) postulated that they would have detailed information
about the context of the experiences, their personal reasons for the occurrence
and their responses to it. Korstjens and Moser (2018:122) indicate that the
researcher's responsibility is to provide a `thick description' of the
participants and the research process, `enabling the reader to assess whether
the findings are transferable to their own setting' - the transferability judgement.
This implies that the reader, not the researcher, makes the transferability
judgement because the researcher does not know the readers' specific settings.

   Research ethics

Research ethics was regarded as an essential element of the research activities
within this study as part of the project Open educational practices for self-
directed learning. The NWU Faculty of Education Research Ethics Committee
(EduREC) granted ethical clearance for this low-risk study before conducting
the research with the ethics application number NWU-01014-21-A2. The
relevant research data gatekeeper (NWU RDGC) was also permitted to do the
research before recruiting the research participants. The final interviews took
place at the end of the academic year after the marks had been finalised.

  Findings and discussion

Through the cross-case analysis of the data through Atlas.ti 22, four themes
related to the participants' learning experiences creating OEMR were derived:
(7.7.1) challenges, (7.7.2) creativity, (7.7.3) feelings and emotions and (7.7.4) value.

   Challenges

Common challenges of SDL include `guidance, time constraints, distractions
because of technology, a lack of organisational skills, and difficulty learning
complex topics' (Buch, Rathod & Naik 2021). The students experienced
emotional challenges, technological challenges and creative challenges.

   Emotional challenges

Jasmine was confronted with realisations about herself as a person. She does
not view herself as one to speak openly about her sadness:

    `However, as sadness is the focus of the last assignment [...] having this activity
    could help people speak out about their sadness. This was tricky because it meant
    that I also had to dig deep and think about my own sadness as well. I discovered

144
                                                                                                                                 Chapter 7

    that sadness is an essential emotion because we can't experience joy and laughter
    and happiness without sadness. So sadness is really combined and intertwined with
    joy, and it is not wrong to feel sad. If you are allowed to talk about this sadness well,
    it will help you acknowledge it. I've learnt that I have to fix myself first and indulge
    in my sadness before I can give people advice [...] and I am really grateful for this
    experience.' (Jasmine, second-year student, female)

A challenging moment during the project for Kiara was connecting her own
emotions:

    `This project made sure that I had to come face-to-face with myself. The most
    challenging part was trying to understand, as an outsider, what a pre-schooler
    would be worried about, and understanding that they also have challenges, and
    that forced me to step out of my comfort zone and put myself in their shoes.' (Kiara,
    second-year student, female)

   Technological challenges

Although none of the participants had ever encountered OER before their
involvement in this project, everyone was excited and looked forward to
creating OEMR. Geng, Law and Niu (2019:18) found `that students who are
more self-directed and with active attitudes toward technology-based
products are more motivated to adopt online learning strategies and achieve
their learning goals'.

    The only technological difficulty Pearl experienced was converting her
notations to a PDF format. Using and applying technology was both
challenging and an asset for her during the Singing Feelings project:

    `It is essential to integrate technology with music, as this can nurture exposure to
    different musical genres. But one should not only focus on that single aspect. My
    challenging moments mostly related to the computer.' (Pearl, second-year student,
    female)

Technology posed many challenges for Lilly - she `always has bad luck with
computers' and found it difficult to add a CC license to her sheet music.
However, her peers assisted her with these tasks. This correlates with Gharti
(2019:71), who views SDL as `learning not only in isolation but collaboratively
and collectively too'.

    Kiara notated her songs on Musescore,15 while Jasmine, Pearl and Lilly used
Finale Notepad.16

15. MuseScore is a scorewriter that supports `a wide variety of file formats and input methods. It is released as
free and open-source software under the GNU General Public License' (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MuseScore).

16. Finale is `a proprietary music notation software developed and released by MakeMusic for Microsoft
Windows and macOS'. Finale is one of the industry standards for music notation software (Nicholl & Grudzinski
2007:110) MakeMusic offers several less expensive versions of Finale, with limited features. These include the
freeware program, Finale Notepad, allowing rudimentary editing and playback.

                                                                                                                                           145
Stories students tell abouttheir learning experiences

Jasmine's struggles with the notation software were evident in her final
submission, portraying an incomplete score with no lyrics. In her experience,
musicians are not always comfortable with technology. Therefore, it was `an
amazing idea to combine these two aspects':

    `Integrating technology was quite a task when it came to these assignments. I have
    never been fond of technology, as I like to do things the old-fashioned way, but
    hearing the song that I composed without playing in real life is a gift. I guess it's
    part of the new norm, integrating technology into music-making, a norm reinforced
    by the COVID-19 pandemic.' (Kiara, second-year student, female)

   Creative challenges

As an avid songwriter who has been writing songs since the age of 11, Pearl
and Jasmine found writing a song for children challenging:

    `The main difference between writing a song for children and for adults is that
    writing songs for children made me revert to being a child again. A peak experience
    at the end of the project was realising that there are similarities between myself
    and the children I am writing the music for. We all have the same emotions, and
    it's okay - regardless of my age and how much life experience I have.' (Jasmine,
    second-year student, female)

    `Writing songs brings me intense joy. However, it was challenging having to write a
    song for children. How you teach children can influence their love for music. I had to
    change The way that I think and humble myself. It was essential to think about what
    a child's thoughts would be on the song's content.' (Pearl, second-year student,
    female)

Lilly experienced similar challenges, and writing lyrics was just as challenging,
especially when working on second verses of existing songs. She struggled to
think of good lyrics that correlate with the rhythms. Composing a song
according to the toddler drone and accompanying it with lyrics for children
was difficult for her:

    `The difference between writing a song for adults and writing a song for children
    lies in perspective. It is easier to understand what an adult should be thinking, but
    writing songs for children entails that I have to consider how children think and
    think like them!' (Lily, second-year student, female)

   Creativity

In a study by Riley and College (2020:31), he found five ways in which the
concepts of creativity and SDL overlap. These connections were identified as
`the connection between life and learning, the role of play and experimentation,
increased personal autonomy, a strong sense of personal initiative, and an
egalitarian social structure'.

    Creating songs was the creative task of the Singing Feelings project. These
innovative learning experiences gave Jasmine a platform to express her

146
                                                                                                                                 Chapter 7

creativity, and she felt a sense of belonging as her creativity `took control and
just burst out'. However, her creativity was often constrained `due to inner
conflicts'. Pearl emphasised the benefits of putting herself in a child's shoes to
think like them to write songs for them.

    According to Sternberg (2006) and Torrance (1965), the connection
between learning and life encourages creativity. This is evident in research by
Sternberg (2006) and Torrance (1965) that emphasises the importance `for
those working on creative ideas or creations to have the ability to make
connections between disciplines and to think in unconventional ways' - core
principles of SDL.

    Although Kiara was confident with songwriting and enjoyed it, it became
easier to write songs for children as the project progressed because critical
feedback was not the main objective of the process. According to Gharti
(2019:63), SDL aims to assist learners in developing autonomy in the learning
process - being able to work independently without others' direction. An SD
learner (Gharti 2019):

    [T]akes the initiative and the responsibility for what occurs. The individual learner
    selects, manages, and assesses their own learning activities, which can be pursued
    at any time, in any place, and through any means. (p. 63)

    Although SDL has developed into an important educational research area that
    has garnered many researchers' interest worldwide, the role of assessment and
    feedback in supporting SDL has been the subject of relatively more minor attention
    in most SDL models. Furthermore, a review of the research literature related to
    assessment and feedback in an SDL context has revealed that research focusing
    on investigating the role of the evaluation and feedback in SDL other than self-
    assessment has been limited. (Mohamad Nasri et al. 2022, p. 195)

Kiara felt that she was mostly `on it' in terms of creativity during the course of
the project, but especially while working on the third assignment when writing
the ditty and creating the artwork. She loved writing original songs
and translating existing songs:

    `I experienced my creativity increasing during the project and experienced creativity
    at a new level in songwriting. This assignment forced me to be more creative and
    broaden my own knowledge. It helped me improve my creative side when writing
    lyrics and thinking of ways to help children express their feelings.' (Pearl, second-
    year student, Female)

Lilly experienced creativity at a new level during songwriting. She felt a sense
of accomplishment as she published her song with a CC license, `making it
more official' (Pearl, second-year student, female). Williams and Werth (2021:1)
investigated `students acting as content creators as an emergent trend in the
field of open educational practice'. The results showed that students are open
to sharing their work with credit and value helping others. Kiara was excited
to create original songs and hoped that making them freely available `could
make it possible for them to be used by many, and possibly help many too'.

                                                                                                                                           147
Stories students tell abouttheir learning experiences

She said that others might benefit from using her song to cheer children up,
and it could broaden everyone's perspective.

    Jasmine viewed `creating original songs' and `making them freely available'
as two contradictory notions:

    `I don't know exactly how I feel about this because (1) I love to write songs; it kind
    of comes easily to me, but on the same note; (2) giving it freely kind of puts me in
    a dark place. It reminds me of how I always do things, and other people take credit
    for it, and I'm pretty tired of that. So with that said, I think I would write songs
    but then make them freely available through companies like Creative Commons
    to make sure no one else takes credit for them.' (Jasmine, second-year student,
    female)

Kiara disagreed with creating original songs and making them freely available.
She would instead prefer to `copyright the material'. Nevertheless, she planned
on using the resources on the website in her own teaching to help introduce
music to young children. To achieve higher SDL skills amongst university
students, Tekkol and Demirel (2018:12) stress that `they should be allowed to
identify their own learning needs; and their opinions may be considered when
identifying learning objectives'. They suggest `various learning strategies to
be addressed in classes and that students should be encouraged to monitor
and evaluate their own learning processes'.

    While most of the students were open to sharing their work, survey
responses in a study on open licensing by Abri and Dabbagh (2019) indicated
that a few students were reticent. Their reticence was based on their lack of
knowledge regarding OER, mainly related to licensing that allowed others to
change their work. Other barriers to publishing under a CC license included
`lack of confidence about the quality of their work and the fact that a peer did
not review their work'.

    Jasmine has previously written songs. She has always had `a creative
streak', but for the duration of this project, she felt `something else, a sense of
belonging':

    `Instead of limiting my creativity with my self-doubts, it takes control and just bursts
    out. I loved experiencing my own creativity during the project. Being involved in
    this project reminded me why I wanted to study music once again. Nevertheless,
    creativity kind of stopped in some parts due to inner conflict, trying to convince me
    of some lies, for example, that I am not my biggest bully. However, these assignments
    gave a massive platform to my creativity, allowing me to write and tell my story in
    the way I feel most comfortable.' (Jasmine, second-year student, female)

   Feelings and emotions

`The emotional component of SDL is seldom discussed explicitly in the
literature' (Rager 2009:22). However, Zull (2006:7) views emotion as
`the foundation of learning', where `the chemicals of emotion act by modifying

148
                                                                                                                                 Chapter 7

the strength and contribution of each part of the learning cycle'. Wolfe
(2006:35) adds that the brain `seeks to create meaning through establishing
or refining existing neural networks' that accumulate in learning. He claims
that `emotion affects what is learnt and what is retained'.

    For Kiara, it was easy to think about emotions, but the project emphasised
the importance of expressing one's feelings healthily:

    `I enjoyed writing songs about feelings, as it is easy to think about emotions. I think
    others would benefit from the work I put into this assignment by reminding them
    how important it is to express one's feelings and emotions. I had to determine
    what I had to do to make something sound happy for one of the songs. Initially, I
    refrained from using the word "happy" but eventually decided to use it. I started
    with a melody for the song and added lyrics.' (Kiara, second-year student, female)

Lilly enjoyed learning about how children could learn to express their feelings
best through singing and how valuable it is for them to sing:

    `It is not easy to express feelings. Writing songs made it easier to express sadness
    and more complex to express anger. However, I think it is easier to express anger for
    the general population. During the Singing Feelings project, I became more aware
    of how to express feelings. I developed a new focus, namely, not being shy about
    feelings. I hope that after this project, I will be able to assist children in expressing
    their emotions better. A peak experience while being involved in this learning
    experience was definitely reading more about SEL and music.' (Lilly, second-year
    student, female)

Jasmine emphasised how she became subconsciously more aware of her
feelings because of her learning experiences while creating OEMR related
to feelings. She enjoyed seeing her classmates express themselves
emotionally through song. Her emotions became `more connected', and
her life became `less complicated while participating in the project'. She
realised that it is okay to feel other emotions, especially emotions that are
`classified as bad'.

Her highlight during the project was seeing how she portrayed her own
emotions:

    `I was okay with being connected. A new skill I acquired during this project was
    to nurture my connectedness with others' emotions. During this project, I became
    aware of the happy side of emotions: joy is joyful. I experienced intense joy when
    sharing in the expressions of my classmates. It felt as if I was doubling up on my
    own songs. I had an honest feeling. I have learnt how to let people in and tell them
    about my feelings, whereas before, I would just hide my feelings, and I have also
    learnt to be more considerate about other people's feelings. The peak for me
    halfway through the project was the realisation that - even though I had known
    this for a long time but actually to understand it - it's okay to feel other emotions,
    especially emotions that we classify as deviant. Dealing with feelings is something
    you can never say you mastered, no matter your age. The older you get, the more
    you filter your emotions and experiences; we work hard to justify many things. I am
    subconsciously more aware of my feelings because of the Singing Feelings project.'
    (Jasmine, second-year student, female)

                                                                                                                                           149
Stories students tell abouttheir learning experiences

Rager (2009) generated an interactive model of SDL:

    The essential premise of this model is that context, content, learning, and process
    each carry an inherent emotional load that is mediated by the characteristics of the
    individual learner. Failure to recognise the complexity of the role of emotion in SDL
    leaves us with an incomplete understanding of this critical form of adult learning.
    (p. 28)

   Value

Value was categorised according to six components that the students found
valuable while creating OEMR in a music education module: growth, others,
skills and resources, adaptation, songwriting and joy. These aspects could all
contribute to lifelong learning related to unique learning experiences that
could improve an individual's SDL skills (Tekkol & Demirel 2018:12).

    O'Shea (2003) and Gharti (2019:63) indicate that `SDL enables individuals
to improve their self-confidence, autonomy, motivation and lifelong learning
skills'. Autonomous learning refers to the students' ability to do work
independently without others' direction, `to take charge of one's learning or to
take the initiative and the responsibility for what occurs' (Little 1991:1). Ponton
and Carr (2000:281) propose that an educator's skills `are not complete until
they understand and can promote autonomy in SDL, thereby enhancing the
students' capability to engage in lifelong learning as individual desires evolve'.
A value of SDL that was also apparent during the students' learning experiences
creating OEMR is the development of student autonomy that promotes
lifelong learning. Candy (1991) views SDL:

    As a vehicle toward knowledge mastery that successfully transforms one's
    understanding through social and psychological constructs. Therefore, SDL can be
    viewed both as a process and a product of lifelong learning. (Mohamad Nasri et al.
    2022:190)

   Growth

Jasmine said that the learning experiences during the Singing Feelings project
`had a big impact' on her life and helped her grow into a more self-directed
student: `As a person, I was enriched by the learning experiences and enjoyed
growing in different aspects with my peers'. Zhoc, Chung and King (2018)
claim that SDL `entails three vital elements: autonomy, responsibility, and
growth'. Boyatzis (2002) argues that emotional commitment plays a crucial
role in accumulating these three SDL elements. Jasmine described how she
had to `reinvent' her identity through the lockdown during the coronavirus
disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, re-evaluating who she was - as she was
isolated and unable to participate in activities constantly:

    `I've found it valuable that it's good to say you're good at something...it's not a
    bad thing to praise yourself - even though, personally, I haven't tried it yet, it still

150
                                                                                                                                 Chapter 7

    lingers in my mind. Still, the other thing that remains is if I were to change and
    seek another's approval, am I still going to be me?' (Jasmine, second-year student,
    female)

Pearl realised that she `might actually enjoy teaching as a possible career
option'.

   Others

Jasmine felt like others might benefit from the work she put in by seeing
another angle. She believed that others would benefit from the skill of `being
at one with your emotions, especially those that are classified as bad, such as
worry and sadness':

    `We are all very different in my current class, like the sun and the moon, but we
    all have one thing in common: we respect how different we all are, which makes it
    easier for us to learn from one another instead of judging each other. Others will
    benefit from encountering a new point of view when they look at my work. I have
    noticed that I don't think like most people. At first, I thought it was a bad thing, but
    I am starting to see it as an essential element that makes me who I am.' (Jasmine,
    second-year student, female)

The highlight of this project for Kiara was the social aspects: their collaboration
as a group and making and recording a video for the early childhood
development (ECD) Comber Festival17 about the Singing Feelings project and
their encounters creating OEMR.

    Pearl found it exciting to share her songs with others: `It was a positive
experience to build each other up, and a sense of community was created
during the Singing Feelings project'.

   Skills and resources

The skills Jasmine acquired during the Singing Feelings project would benefit
her in the future as it opened her eyes to writing songs that accommodate
everyone, for example, happy and sad songs:

    `I would most definitely use the resources in my teaching. It changed me, and as a
    teacher, one wants your pupil also to be able to handle emotions... and if it worked
    for me, why not share it? I think this project should be compulsory for all music
    students, as it completely changed my perspective on dealing with stuff. After
    being involved in this project, my life was suddenly so much simpler.' (Jasmine,
    second-year student, female)

Lilly and Jasmine emphasised the value of the Singing Feelings project for
their future careers as music educators, being able to assist children in
expressing their feelings and writing songs for children:

17. The first NWU virtual ECD-COMBER Learning Festival in collaboration with PanSALB was held from 13 to 15
September 2021.

                                                                                                                                            151
Stories students tell abouttheir learning experiences

    `New skills that I acquired during this project were computer skills, patience and
    stretching my coping mechanisms. Integrating technology with music education
    taught me many things. However, the most positive part was that I had the
    confidence to utilise the software effectively. I think one term is enough to acquire
    the skills to create OEMR. The expansion will depend on the exposure if one wants
    to expand. The skills I have developed to create OEMR would benefit me as an
    educator, conductor, songwriter, and teacher.' (Jasmine, second-year student,
    female)

Kiara added that music educators could learn to work with students based
on SEL skills. She viewed the integration of technology with music education
as a good idea, as one could use it for one's own benefit. Using technology
was easy for her, as her mom assisted. She really liked integrating technology
into her work on the assignments to create OEMR by writing and notating
songs:

    `This project made me aware that it is essential that we work with care when engaging
    with children and that there are specific ground rules that apply when working with
    children. I feel more relaxed when writing a song for children, as adults can quickly
    feel intimidated, while most children will simply enjoy the process. Adults want
    to listen. When writing for children, the pressure from critics increases over time.
    Although I did not work directly with children during this project, it gave me a lot
    of ideas.' (Kiara, second-year student, female)

    `The new skills I acquired during the project included notating the song on the
    computer and seeing the song's rhythm in my head. Although I have never
    encountered OER before, I have now become aware of the possibilities of OER and
    the importance of handling it correctly.' (Pearl, second-year student, female)

   Adaptation

Kiara realised the importance of acknowledging emotions and how their
songs could bring communities together. She referred to people in a foreign
country who would be able to access the songs through the Internet. One of
the aims of the Singing Feelings project is to make the songs available for
anyone to adapt to another language. Therefore, Kiara postulated that cultural
responsiveness could be enhanced:

    `If there were more music education resources, cultures would be shared more
    easily. When music is sung only in the mother tongue, it might inhibit the expansion
    of cultures, especially on the African continent. I found it valuable to work on my
    translation skills.' (Kiara, second-year student, female)

Tucker and Powell (2021:24) urge `music teacher educators to develop
preservice music teachers' agency so that they may push boundaries for
greater inclusivity of underserved student populations through access,
innovative forms of music education, and collaboration':

    `It would help a lot if there were more OEMRs available for children in their mother
    tongue. Children learn easier when learning experiences are facilitated in their
    mother tongue. They would be more comfortable and not struggle to understand.'
    (Jasmine, second-year student, female)

                                                                                                                                 Chapter 7

Pearl thinks that the world would be different by making more music education
resources available for children in their mother tongue, as more children will
be able to develop their musical skills. The Singing Feelings project opened
Jasmine's eyes to writing songs that accommodate everyone.

   Songwriting

Kiara `found everything valuable in this learning experience - from learning
about SEL and writing a ditty for children'. Kiara liked writing songs and had
written her own songs before, but with less effort - she did not really know
how to approach the process. After the project, it is different. She has had
more practice and has worked with a specific goal in mind, which means she
will systematically reach it. She found it valuable to work on her songwriting
skills when writing her own song. In her opinion, music students must write
songs! These songs could bring communities together. She could easily relate
her previous experiences with the characteristics of a children's song. She
became more confident about writing songs throughout the process,
especially in combining the lyrics and the melody. The initial assignment
provided a way to refresh her memory and overcome writer's block:

    `Songwriting was fun, and I could include my own views on specific lyrics. I think
    one term is enough to acquire the necessary skills to create OEMR, primarily when
    related to emotions and aspects thereof. Others might benefit from the work I put
    in for most of the assignments; for example, music educators could learn how to
    work with students according to the SEL skills. I found learning how to express
    emotions correctly valuable.' (Kiara, second-year student, female)

Writing songs was the highlight of this project for Jasmine:

    `I especially enjoyed that the songs had to be written for young children. The
    experiences took me back in time to my own childhood. I experienced intense joy
    when writing and finishing songs - after completing every song; I felt as if I was
    successful.' (Jasmine, second-year student, female)

   Joy

The stories of Kiara's engagement with OER and songwriting during this
project reflect an enjoyable experience overall, with minimal challenges.

    The Singing Feelings project was valuable for all four participants, as they
had fun. By having fun together, they could motivate each other throughout
the project. This correlates with Breed's study (2016). This study investigated

    [T]he influence of incorporating five elements (positive interdependence, individual
    accountability, promotive face-to-face interaction, appropriate social skills, group
    processing) regarded as essential for effective cooperative learning on students'
    self-reported levels of SDL, and their views on the influence of collaborative learning
    on their self-directedness in education. (p. 1)

The researcher found that structuring group work activities to include the five
elements influenced the SDL area of evaluation, `needed to monitor own

learning, and interpersonal skills, which are prerequisites for becoming self-
directed learners'.

  Recommendations

Future recommendations for research include investigating how to create a
better-informed awareness of OER in music students to understand the
benefits of creating OEMR. Providing affordable access to culturally relevant
education is a core concept and central intention of the OER movement
(Hodgkinson-Williams & Trotter 2018). Therefore, exploring how an improved
consciousness of and exposure to OEMRs could promote culturally responsive
teachers, caregivers, students and learners.

    Sharing the music education, students' OEMRs will make other students,
teachers and stakeholders aware of the benefits of OER, and this could, in
turn, foster a willingness to engage with OER and specifically OEMR in different
musical contexts. Consequently, more meaningful learning experiences could
be designed to increase awareness of the value of OER and promote more
innovative opportunities to create OEMR.

  Conclusion

This chapter explored the learning experiences of four BMus students creating
OEMR to nurture SEL in children's development. None of the participants had
encountered OER before being involved in the Seeing Feelings project.
Consequently, there were mixed feelings about making their original songs
freely available to anyone. Taking my own ignorance into account when I
encountered OER for the first time, I can identify with the students' limited
perspective on the possibilities and value of OER, especially in a musical
context. However, the more I engaged with OER as an OER Research Fellow
(cf. Chapter 1), the more I realised the potential of OER to improve the
accessibility of musical resources and original songs to nurture SEL, especially
across different contexts and cultures.

    The main research question for this research is related to the nature of the
learning experiences of music education students creating OEMRs.

The four themes derived from the data analysis indicated that:

1. The students' experiences included a variety of challenges, including
    emotional challenges, technological challenges and creative challenges.

2. Their creativity was nurtured.
3. They had different perspectives on feelings and emotions.
4. The value of the learning experiences that could contribute to lifelong

    learning included growth, others, skills and resources, adaptation,
    songwriting and joy.

The students benefited from creating the songs and engaging with the
concepts of SEL, which contributed to their personal growth and their
development as music educators. This contribution had mutual benefits, as
students nurtured their own SEL while becoming more confident in creating
OEMR to nurture SEL in children.

  Abstract

The rapid web expansion and development of information and communication
technologies (ICTs) brought about opportunities in higher education (HE) to
develop a culture of cooperative and collaborative learning and co-creation of
knowledge using open educational resources (OERs) as part of open education
practice (OEP). Several studies have pointed out the gap in the body of
knowledge regarding how OEP can be implemented in HE for teaching
purposes. This chapter examines second-year health and social-care students'
perceptions of engaging with and developing an OER as part of an
interprofessional collaborative learning opportunity. The study aimed to
establish a deeper understanding of the use of OEP within a collaborative
learning environment. Furthermore, the study aimed to explore students'
perceptions of using OEP in undergraduate, interprofessional education (IPE)
OEP into a second-year module. The study population comprised all students
registered for the module (1734), with 1145 students giving written consent.
This qualitative study is positioned in a constructivist-interpretivist paradigm.
Findings confirm that OEP provides an opportunity to apply knowledge and
active cooperation and collaboration in group settings as a way of learning.
Respondents valued the opportunity to actively engage in the co-creation of
knowledge and apply this knowledge to empower themselves and others.
Learning gains included the development of transferable skills, self-
directedness and higher-order thinking skills. Challenges reported by students
include not understanding the rationale to include an OEP, and insufficient
information and support during the development of an OER.

  Introduction

The chapter starts by discussing the rationale for using an OEP in teaching
undergraduate health and social-care students. Thereafter, the OEP
development process is discussed, highlighting valuable lessons learned when
guiding undergraduate students in a cooperative and collaborative learning
opportunity. Based on the analysis of written student reflections, the chapter
concludes by sharing students' perspectives on using OEPs to enhance
student learning.

The rapid development of the World Wide Web and ICTs provides new
opportunities for the sharing, reusing and disseminating of knowledge in HE.
Education pivots around the sharing of knowledge and ICT integration,
therefore, has enhanced the notion of `openness' (Chiappe & Adame 2018:214;
Cronin 2017:16). Cronin (2017:16) explains that the term `open' is used to
describe resources (including artefacts and how they are used), learning,
teaching and institutional processes, as well as the use of educational
technologies and the guiding principles for educational endeavours. Chiappe
and Adame (2018:218) concur that in the 21st century, ensuring educational
access, effectiveness and equality is essential. Therefore, HE needs to adopt a
sense of `openness'. Openness provides the context for open education (OE),
and according to Cronin (2017:16), OE initiatives are often understood,
perceived and prioritised differently within different contexts. According to
the Cape Town Open Education Declaration (2007), `open education
encompasses resources, tools, and practices that employ a framework of open
sharing to improve educational access and effectiveness worldwide'. The
authors of this chapter also share this view.

    The Cape Town Open Education Declaration (2007) states that OE is not
limited to just OERs but also includes OEPs. This implies using open
technologies and teaching practices to facilitate cooperative, collaborative
and flexible learning. It can also expand into new learning, teaching and
assessment approaches. In this study, the authors draw from the work of
Cronin to define OEP. Drawing from various scholars, Cronin (2017) describes
OEP as:

    [A] broad description of collaborative practices that include the creation, use,
    and reuse of OER, as well as pedagogical practices employing participatory
    technologies and social networks for interaction, peer learning, knowledge creation,
    and empowerment of learners. (p. 18)

An OEP fosters student engagement and agency through `active, constructive
engagement with content, tools and services in the learning process, and
promoting learners' self-management, creativity and working in teams' (Geser
2007:37). Additionally, Evans, Muijs and Tomlinson (2015:9) stipulate that
student agency, autonomy and self-regulation can be enhanced through
flexible pedagogies and open technologies. It involves active participation
and engagement with the content, peers and the lecturer during the learning
process. Furthermore, OEP allows students to be more self-directed by
allowing them to source learning content, identify suitable open technologies
and actively engage in the co-creation of knowledge within collaborative
spaces of learning (Lasfeto & Ulfa 2020:35, 39; Olivier 2020:22). It is essential
that an OEP should promote self-directed learning (SDL) to enhance student
agency and lifelong learning (Olivier 2020:25).

innovative learning and teaching and cutting-edge research, thereby benefiting

                                                                                                                                           159

society through knowledge' (NWU), teaching and learning at the NWU
promotes students' self-directedness, student agency and lifelong learning.
The Senate approved the NWU Open Educational Resources Declaration in
2018 to further promote the dream, purpose, values and brand attributes of
NWU (2018). The Declaration echoes the NWU's commitment to using and
promoting OER, and ultimately, also OEP. Attempting to promote OE at the
NWU, the NWU OER Fellowship programme was initiated (cf. Chapter 1). The
fellowship aimed to support lecturers in their OE teaching, learning and
research endeavours. It involved a financial grant, several workshops by
experts in the field and mentoring for 18 months. This fellowship aligns with
the NWU's Open Educational Resources Policy which was in the process
whilst writing this chapter (North-West University 2022a).

    This study was carried out as a part of the NWU OER Fellowship at a
unitary, integrated, multi-campus university in South Africa during a second-
year, compulsory module in the Faculty of Health Sciences. Demonstrating its
commitment to IPE by delivering graduates that can work effectively,
cooperatively and collaboratively in the rapidly evolving health care landscape,
the Faculty of Health Sciences introduced a compulsory, philosophy-based
module to all second-year students registered as health students18 in 2010.
The compulsory module is presented at all three campuses of the university
and forms part of 22 academic programmes in the Faculty of Health Sciences.
Approximately 1730 students from fourteen diverse health care and social-
care disciplines enrolled annually for the second semester (June-November)
module.

    The module aims to develop a critical mindset concerning the world of
health by exposing students to diverse individual and disciplinary ways of
knowing, being and doing. Within the faculty's emphasis on IPE, students also
get the opportunity to work in an interprofessional team and, during
purposefully designed learning events, get the opportunity to learn from, with
and about each other (Van Diggele et al. 2020:1; World Health Organization
2010). In addition, the module aims to foster interprofessional competencies,
active, interprofessional collaborative and cooperative learning (CL), mutual
respect and appreciation, student agency, self-directedness, autonomy and
creativity.

    The module is facilitated online using the learning management system
(LMS) (Sakai) and other purposefully selected technologies to curb the spread
of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in this large module. As part of the
OER fellowship programme at the university, the lecturers responsible for
teaching the module introduced OEP into the module. In addition, they

Social Work, Psychology, Physiology, Consumer Sciences, Occupational Hygiene, Human Movement Science,
Biokinetics, Recreation, Sports Science and Coaching Science.

conducted a Scholarship of Teaching and Learning (SoTL) research study,
investigating students' perceptions of using an OEP as part of an
interprofessional collaborative learning opportunity.

    The lecturers scrutinised the curriculum to identify a suitable topic to
introduce OEP. The learning outcome Design of a health promotion community
intervention, which contains Dimensions of Wellness, was identified as a
suitable topic for introducing OEP into the curriculum. Applying the 5R
principle (reuse, retain, revise, remix and redistribute) (Zhang et al. 2020:2),
the lecturers worked through a wide range of materials to identify suitable
OERs on the topic. Given the unique context, the lecturers could not find OER
learning activities on the topic that could be used as is. However, they found
an OER assessment rubric that could be used after some revision. Therefore,
the lecturers designed a learning activity on the topic to address the contextual
needs. The lecturers also adapted the assessment rubric to suit the
interprofessional nature of the module. The newly designed and adapted
resources (the electronic wellness wheel, the learning activity and the
assessment rubric) will be shared as an OER for reuse in the open domain.

    The learning activity was divided into three steps and constructively aligned
with the outcomes and assessment criteria. In Step 1, each group member
used the wellness wheel to collect data from an individual who volunteered to
participate. Before the group discussion, students anonymised the data to
protect the identity of their volunteers. Thereafter, the interprofessional group
members met, discussed the anonymised profiles, and selected one profile for
the group to use in the next step. In Step 2, group members discussed each
of the wellness dimensions in the selected and anonymised profile to
determine the individual's overall wellness and identify areas of strengths and
improvement. Step 3 entailed selecting the wellness dimension with the lowest
score. After conducting research and using an open technology of choice,
students collaboratively designed an infographic that can be used to enhance
the dimension with the lowest score. All learning objects (infographics) were
assessed as part of the module mark using the revised OER assessment rubric.
Giving consent that the infographic could be shared at the end of the module
on a purposively designed OER website, was optional.

    The lecturers responsible for introducing OEP in the module conducted
research as part of the fellowship (cf. Chapter 1) thereby contributing to the
body of knowledge on the use of OEP in HE. Despite much research on group
work in IPE, the literature review revealed limited empirical evidence regarding
OEP in IPE. Within the evolving OEP domain, the purpose of this study was to
explore the use of OEP in an undergraduate, interprofessional module in the
Faculty of Health Sciences at a comprehensive university in South Africa. The
study aims to establish a deeper understanding of the use of OEP within a
collaborative learning environment. Furthermore, the study aims to provide
specific direction for the use of OEP to enhance undergraduate, IPE in

Health Sciences. The research question that framed this qualitative research
was how students from fifteen health care and social-care disciplines perceive
the use of OEP as part of an interprofessional cooperative and collaborative
learning opportunity. The usage of OEP for education is the focus of this
study; other facets of OEP, such as open research and open publishing, are
not included. Using a narrow `OEP' lens in this study enabled a deep exploration
into the use of OEP for teaching and learning in HE.

  Theoretical and conceptual frameworks
  underpinning this research

The theoretical framework forms the basis from which research knowledge is
constructed. This framework also supports the study's justification, the
approach to the problem, the purpose, and the importance of investigating
the phenomena. A conceptual framework is a representation of an expected
relationship between variables. Variables refer to the characteristics drawn
from existing literature and theories that underpin the phenomena (Collins &
Stockton 2018:2).

   Theoretical framework

Higher education institutions (HEIs) are expected to transform teaching and
learning using a more `open' approach. Open educational approaches include
educational practices inclusive of interactive cooperative and collaborative
learning within a social environment (Chiappe & Adame 2018:223). The main
outcomes is the co-construction of knowledge by students. According to a
social constructivist framework, knowledge develops because of social
interaction and is a shared, rather than an individual, experience. In addition,
in social constructivist learning, learning and the acquisition of new knowledge
are equally important (Chiappe & Adame 2018:223). In this study, the
researchers viewed social constructivism as an applicable framework as a
result of cooperative and collaborative nature of learning when engaging in
interprofessional group work.

   Conceptual framework for this research

The authors provide a conceptual overview of the concepts `openness', OE,
OER, OEP and open education pedagogy in the `Introduction'. Unfortunately,
the overlapping similarities and interchangeable use of the concepts
mentioned often lead to misunderstanding of these concepts and can
subsequently confuse them (Cronin & MacLaren 2018:128).

    Over the last few years, there has been a fast-growing trend in using open
learning materials and associated platforms and practices in HE. These open
platforms and practices include using OERs, massive open online courses

162
                                                                                                                                 Chapter 8

(MOOCs) and open courses such as Coursera (Chiappe & Adame 2018:216).
However, despite recent developments in the field of openness, the `meaning'
and precisely what openness entails remains unclear. `Open' in education is
currently mostly debated in ICT development in the 21st century.

    The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization
(UNESCO) defines OERs as `the open provision of educational resources,
enabled by ICTs, for consultation, use, and adaptation by a community of
users for non-commercial purposes' as cited by Ehlers (2011:2). Initially, OERs
included the use and development of free, open textbooks to counteract the
notion of formerly expensive textbooks (Colvard, Watson & Park 2018:263).
However, over time OER in higher education institutions (HEIs) has expanded
in using a variety of OERs such as assessments, articles, lesson plans, open
technologies and interactive software platforms (Griffiths et al. 2020:16). This
movement has set the scene for using open educational pedagogies and
OEPs in HE. However, the way OERs are utilised as OEPs is still in the early
stages of development (Ehlers 2011:3, 7).

    From the literature, it is evident that the development of OERs as part of
OEP is crucial as it holds a variety of advantages. These advantages include
using OEP as a vehicle for transformation as it fosters student agency, lifelong
learning and self-directedness (Chiappe & Adame 2018:223). In addition,
including OEP into teaching, learning and assessment practices enhances
self-confidence and a sense of achievement as students acts as co-constructors
of knowledge which can contribute to developing their own learning
experience (Zhang et al. 2020:9). Moreover, student involvement in the
learning process encourages students to become change agents within their
spheres of influence (Chiappe & Adame 2018:223).

    As above stated, actively engaging students in the knowledge generation
process improves student engagement with peers and the subject matter,
knowledge creation, CL, collaborative learning, increased satisfaction,
empowerment and the development of knowledge, skills and attributes
(Chiappe & Adame 2018:223; Cronin 2017:18; Ehlers & Conole 2010:4, 6; OPAL
Report 2011:11). Furthermore, including OE technologies in teaching and
learning supports the development of 21st-century digital literacy skills (Zhang
et al. 2020:2). Lastly, OEP scaffolds learning through the process of
understanding, applying, synthesising, evaluating and creating (Cronin &
MacLaren 2018:129).

    Despite the numerous advantages of OEP, it is noteworthy that moving
into the open domain poses challenges such as the evolving institutional
policy development on OEP, lack of clarity regarding concepts, as well as the
availability of context-specific and appropriate OERs. Additionally, it also
included the lack of knowledge and experience in using open education
pedagogy as the underpinning belief about using OEP in teaching, learning

                                                                                                                                           163

and assessment in higher learning (Chiappe & Adame 2018:219; Ehlers 2011:2;
Knox 2013:825; Nascimbeni & Ehlers 2020:2).

   Open educational practices to enhance
   self-directed learning

Self-regulation describes how engaged learners are in the learning process on
a metacognitive, motivational and behavioural level in collaborative learning
contexts (Shea & Bidjerano 2010:1727). This approach to education where
students take responsibility for their own learning process is called SDL (Bosch
2016:2; Knowles 1975:18).

    Three key principles, namely self-management, self-control and a willingness
to learn, can be used to categorise SDL. Self-management refers to aspects of
time management, organisation, methodical learning and problem-solving
abilities. The capacity to create learning objectives, accept responsibility for
one's own learning, and have a strong desire to comprehend the material at
hand are all examples of self-control (Fisher & King 2010:44).

    There are a number of teaching strategies that promote students to become
more self-directed. Cooperative learning is one of the teaching strategies that
empowers students to develop SDL skills (Mentz & Van Zyl 2018:484).
Additionally, CL allows for students to work collaboratively as part of a team
to solve a problem, complete a task or accomplish a common goal (Fisher &
King 2010:45).

    To develop and enhance SDL skills, it is important to create a CL environment
that is student-centred, allowing students to set their learning goals and
identify learning resources, which Mentz and Van Zyl (2018:485) describe as
typical SDL activities. The OEP practices applied in this module were
underpinned by SDL principles. Students had the opportunity to develop and
enhance their self-directedness by working cooperatively and collaborative to
design a learning artefact that could be used as an OER, a strategy typically
associated with SDL (cf. Chapter 3). To this end, this study proposed that OEP
be supportive of SDL. In the research design and methodology, the authors
discuss the research design and methodology followed in this research study.

  Research design and methodology

   Research design

This study is anchored in a constructivist-interpretivist paradigm. Students
perceive cooperative and collaborative learning differently. Students also have
different perceptions of OE and OEPs within the learning environment. Working
online in interprofessional teams, students get the opportunity to interact with
other students and within this social environment many constructed realities

164
                                                                                                                                 Chapter 8

(McMillan & Schumacher 2006:12). This paradigm is relevant as students have
constructed their own reality from lived experiences. The authors seek to
capture and interpret second-year health and social-care students' perceptions,
feelings and behaviours regarding the use of OEP as part of their teaching,
learning and assessment from their subjective frames of reference.

    The researchers conducted a scoping review using specific keywords to
establish a sound theoretical foundation. Empirical data were collected using
a qualitative approach. Adopting a qualitative approach allowed the
researchers to explore and gain insight into students' perceptions of using
OEP in teaching. The researchers used interpretive description as a suitable
method for finding practical solutions to the problems health educators face
in health professions education (Teodoro et al. 2018:2). Teodoro et al. (2018:2)
add that interpretive description enables researchers to investigate and learn
more about participants' individual views, subjective beliefs, viewpoints and
lived experiences related to health-related concerns.

   Population and sampling

The study population comprised all students registered for a compulsory,
second-year, interprofessional module in the Faculty of Health Sciences at a
comprehensive, multi-campus university in South Africa. The 1734 students
were representative of the university's three campuses, and the sample size
was calculated from the group as a whole and not per campus. The researchers
used non-probability sampling and voluntary sampling as the primary method.
Using voluntary sampling allowed for an equal opportunity to choose to
participate, and for this reason, participants did not need to be a representative
sample of any given campus, gender, age, ethnic background and profession.
The purpose was not to investigate the perceptions on OEP of specific health
professions but the students in general. Participation in this study was
voluntary, and 1145 students gave their willing consent by signing the informed
consent form. The vulnerability of the students as a captive and vulnerable
audience was reduced by research information sessions, the informed consent
process and the data collection process conducted by an independent, neutral
person who had no involvement with the teaching, learning and assessment
of students in the module.

   Data collection

Data collection commenced after approval by the Health Research Ethics
Committee in the faculty (NWU-00187-21-A1) and the Institutional Research
Data Gatekeepers Committee (NWU-GK-21-026). Data were collected using
an open-ended, online reflection questionnaire on OEP teaching and learning
practices in the module. QuestionPro, a web-based software programme for
administering online surveys, captured the students' responses.

                                                                                                                                           165
Second-year health students' perspectives on developing open educational resources

  Data analysis and trustworthiness
  of the data19

After the data collection period ended, the independent research administrator
removed the data of students who did not give informed consent or withdrew
from the research during the semester. The independent research administrator
anonymised and cleaned the data set by removing identifiable information to
ensure anonymity and confidentiality. The research administrator assigned a
unique code to each participant; however, this unique code cannot be linked
to any participant's identity. Data analysis was done using ATLAS.ti, a
qualitative data analysis software. Co-coding was used to enhance the validity
and trustworthiness of the research. The coder and co-coder coded the data
separately following the same coding process. They discussed the coding
and, where needed, made amendments to the initial coding list and recorded
the data.

    The steps of Creswell and Clark (2018:193-195) and the principles of Tesch
(1990:120-124) guided the data analysis process. First, the researcher prepared
the data by organising, sorting and arranging the data. After that, the
researchers explored the data by reading through the data to develop a
general sense of the data. The researchers also noted their initial and general
thoughts on the data. Understanding the data, the researchers started the
coding process using a deductive and inductive approach. Mindfully reading,
examining and scrutinising the participants' reflections, the researchers linked
the related text to a code that would later be linked to a sub-theme, theme
and pattern. Where text segments emerged that could not be linked to an
initial code, a new code (with possible sub-theme, theme and pattern) was
created (Tesch 1990:124). Next, repetitive codes, sub-themes, themes and
patterns were merged, and using the networking functionality in ATLAS.ti,
codes, sub-themes, themes and patterns were connected to show
interrelationships. Finally, the researchers interpreted and discussed the
findings to make meaning of the data. Findings were presented in themes,
and quotations served as evidence of the findings. The researchers summarised
the main findings and interpreted the results to understand how they address
the research question and relate to existing literature. The research team also
identified the study's limitations and implications for further studies.

    To ensure the validity and reliability of the results, the researchers used a
variety of data validation strategies. A clear research question guided the
research by adopting a rigorous approach to the research process. Data were
collected using an online, open-ended questionnaire and analysed until
data saturation was reached. Although the purpose of qualitative research is

not to generalise, transferability (the ability to apply the findings in a similar
environment) was ensured by providing a rich description of the participants,
the data collection method and instrument as well as the data analysis and
findings (Poggenpoel & Myburgh 2004:309; Shenton 2004:66). The context,
target population and participants were described without compromising
anonymity and confidentiality. The research methods and data analysis
process was well described to provide enough information to duplicate the
study.

    Dependability was ensured by having a clear and appropriate research
process (Shenton 2004:70). The researchers have a clear audit trail. They
used a co-coder during the data analysis process and analysed the data until
saturation and crystallisation were reached (Creswell & Clark 2018:186).
Confirmability when doing SoTL research with students is of special concern
as the lecturers were also the researchers in this study. The dual role may
influence objectivity (Shenton 2004:72; Toblin & Begley 2004:392). The
researchers used an independent research team for all the research-related
activities to mitigate risks associated with the dual roles. The researchers used
rigorous scientific methods during the data collection, analysis, and
interpretation phases to adhere to confirmability (Creswell & Clark 2018:202).
Lastly, the independent research administrator will share the research results
with the participants via a personalised email.

  Findings and discussion

In this study, a research question guided the data analysis process to identify
the themes and sub-themes. The research question posed was: How do
students from fifteen health care and social-care disciplines perceive the use
of OEP as part of an interprofessional collaborative learning opportunity?
During the inductive and deductive analysis of the qualitative data, two
distinct themes emerged, namely: (1) OEP as a way of learning and (2) learning
gains through the use of OEP. Within Theme 2, three sub-themes emerged,
namely, (1) knowledge to empower others and self; (2) development of
transferable skills and (3) learning can be enjoyable. Supporting quotations
have been included to elucidate the findings. Although identifiers were used
as a prerequisite by the publishers, none of these can be directly linked to any
participant. In the discussion to follow, the identifiers refer to P = user identity
and D = date of completion and time of completion.

   Theme 1: Open educational practice as a way of
   learning

The first theme considers the use of OEP as a way of learning in HE. Health
care and social-care students indicated that researching the selected

                                                                                                                                           167

topic allowed for deeper engagement with the content and their peers.
Students also felt that the approach allowed for the application of knowledge
and active collaboration as students from different backgrounds and
disciplines brought different perspectives to the learning environment.
Furthermore, as confirmed in the literature, respondents valued the opportunity
to apply knowledge and be actively engaged in the co-creation of knowledge
to help others. Based on the responses, the self-directedness of students is
evident. Using real-life scenarios as well as using the wellness wheel created a
desire for learning. Conducting research to gain more knowledge stimulates
the development and enhancement of SDL skills such as taking self-control.
Additionally, students showed motivation as they were curious to learn and
explore even further on their own. These actions support the findings of Fisher
and King (2010:44). The fact that they were actively involved in the teaching-
learning process encouraged critical thinking and promoted deeper learning.

    Students took ownership of their learning when collecting, analysing,
synthesising and ultimately creating their OERs. These learning practices
mentioned above have also been confirmed in the literature (Cronin &
MacLaren 2018:133; Zhang et al. 2020:2, 9). This is illustrated in the following
excerpts from the data set:

    `The research that you had to do, and the fact that you can take one dimension
    of the wellness wheel and apply your discipline to create an OER, and that each
    student had a different perspective on the dimension.' (P130503550, D11/03/2021,
    01:03)

    `The dimension my group and I chose was environmental wellness. I enjoyed doing
    my research on this topic because I got to learn the importance and how to improve
    environmental wellness and putting ideas together as a group to create a learning
    resource for others.' (P130795053, D11/06/2021, 02:15)

It is obvious that students' comprehension of their subject field was improved
by exposure to various disciplinary information and views. Students were able
to see how various health-related fields are connected to one another and
how they may collaborate and learn from one another to solve challenges and
accomplish a common objective. These actions can be linked to self-
management an essential concept of SDL (Fisher & King 2010).

    `When creating the wellness wheel and the infographic I have realised that we, as a
    team with all different disciplinary inputs, can actually give a valid input on how to
    improve a person's wellness. We all had an input in the answers we wrote and the
    ideas were very creative and unique. This is where I have realised that our work can
    help others that don't have the necessary information to improve their wellness.'
    (P130406391, D11/02/2021, 00:11) (p. 44)

In addition, the data suggested that OEP as part of interprofessional learning
activities can enhance interprofessional collaboration, communication and
peer learning. The majority of participants felt strongly that working in
assigned and predetermined interprofessional teams to create an OER
provided the ideal opportunity for students from different disciplines to learn

about, from and with each other in cooperative and collaborative learning
environment. The following excerpts reveal how they felt learning about, from,
and with each other. Excerpts include:

    `Because in tertiary different students from different faculties gather their input
    in order to come up with an OER. Therefore, different ideas are incorporated.'
    (P130366808, D11/01/2021, 10:01)

    `It helped me realise how different people from different disciplines can work
    together and combine their work, to create a more successful and open solution,
    thus giving me the ability to one day elicit better group performance skills in the
    workplace.' (P131096052, D11/09/2021, 11:48)

    `The most fascinating part was gathering information according to my discipline.'
    (P130883879, D11/07/2021, 23:03)

    `I also enjoyed and felt proud to use my knowledge from my study discipline
    to add my point to the infographic that my group and I made.' (P130688388,
    D11/04/2021, 22:57)

   Theme 2: Learning gains through the use of open
   educational practice

Theme 2 explores the learning gains obtained by creating an OER as part of
OEP. A sense of acknowledgement dominates this theme that creating an
OER as part of a learning activity serves a bigger purpose than just obtaining
a mark to pass the module.

   Sub-theme 1: Knowledge to empower others and self

The transformational power of OEP and OERs to foster student agency,
lifelong learning and self-directedness are highlighted by Zhang et al. (2020:9)
and Chiappe and Adame (2018:223). From the data analysis, it is evident that
participants valued the development of a learning object (the infographic)
can be used to promote education equality. Participants also noted that
knowledge is power and felt empowered by creating an OER that can make a
difference beyond the classroom context. This confirms the notion of becoming
agents of change within their own community (Chiappe & Adame 2018:223).
Some reflections include:

    `Getting to create something that will benefit others was more beneficial than
    receiving marks that will only benefit me and not others.' (P130343036, D11/01/2021,
    06:46)

    `The work we put into the infographic can now be used to educate others.'
    (P129526501, D10/22/2021, 00:31)

    `I now see how many people around me need help and need to be educated about
    life decisions and caring for the environment. I realised that we as students can make
    a huge difference in our community as long as we stick together.' (P130245316,
    D10/30/2021, 04:17)

                                                                                                                                           169
Second-year health students' perspectives on developing open educational resources

    `This is where I have realized that our work can help others that don't have the
    necessary information to improve their wellness.' (P130406391, D11/02/2021 00:11)

    `The gathering of information and realising how much power comes from being
    knowledgeable.' (P130756601, D11/05/2021, 12:56)

Students felt that they would be able to apply the knowledge they gained
through developing their OER to better their own well-being. Respondents
also indicated that the OER stimulated an awareness of self by discovering
new things about themselves, their strengths, weaknesses, growth
opportunities and how they can make an impact as emerging health
professionals. In addition, respondents indicated that the learning activity,
and ultimately the development of the OER, required them to reflect on their
own well-being. Some of these reflections include:

    `The wellness wheel made me realise where my wellness score within life is at and
    what I should focus on in order to improve my wellness wheel. I think that the
    purpose of these activities was not only to receive marks but also to make one
    realise where one's wellness is at, where improvements should be made and also to
    create awareness of the different wellness domains within one's life.' (P129727196,
    D10/25/2021, 03:10)

    `It made me realise that we don't just learn for the sake of learning, but we improve
    our knowledge, discover new things about ourselves.' (P130332262, D11/01/2021,
    04:01)

    `I had to teach myself how to design :) before the assignment I didn't know I could
    design something that beautiful.' (P130886047, D11/08/2021, 00:19)

   Sub-theme 2: Development of transferable skills

Based on the responses, it is clear that including OEP in undergraduate
teaching by asking students to develop an OER using open technology assists
in developing new skills. Additionally, respondents highlighted the
transferability of the skills they developed during the learning process. Finally,
respondents expressed positive views that they will be able to apply the skills
to their daily life, to other contexts and in the future when entering the
workplace as a health professional. These findings confirm the work of Brandt
(2020) who highlights SDL as one of the four critical 21st-century skills. In
agreement, Zhang et al. (2020:9) argue that teaching in the 21st-century
should include the use of OE technologies as it supports the development of
21st-century digital literacy skills:

    `I loved doing the infographic. I love that I now have this new skill that I know I
    definitely will use in the future.' (P130407573, D11/02/2021, 01:06)

    `I learned a lot from creating the OER and will be able to use programs such as Canva
    and Piktochart in the future to create more.' (P130407573, D11/02/2021, 01:06)

    `I enjoyed using a new platform like Piktochart to present information to others. It is
    a new technical and graphic skill that I learned, and it is a platform I will use again
    in the future.' (P130267511, D10/30/2021, 11:55)

    `The skill to create or work with this type of design can also be use in everyday life
    or any job. It gives students the opportunity to learn new things and be creative.'
    (P129526501, D10/22/2021, 00:31)

Open educational technologies were also mentioned as a skill that respondents
feel can benefit them when entering the workforce. Technology is an integral
part of the 21st-century learner. Including open technologies in teaching,
learning and assessment speaks to students' needs and strengths and allows
them to use the knowledge and skills gained about open technologies in their
everyday lives. Respondents noting the skills they developed through OEPs in
this module supported the findings from the literature (Chiappe & Adame
2018:223; Cronin 2017:18; Ehlers & Conole 2010:4, 6; OPAL Report 2011:11). It is
noteworthy to mention that respondents could see the use of these skills in
their personal lives and in the workplace in the future:

    `We are the future working class, and we grew up with another world of advanced
    technology than our parents did (who wrote the learning material).' (P130405725,
    D11/01/2021, 23:46)

    `This activity gives me the ability to one day elicit better group performance skills
    in the workplace.' (P131096052, D11/09/2021, 11:48)

   Sub-theme 3: Learning and enjoyment using open
   educational resource

In line with the findings by Olivier (2020:22, 25) and Lasfeto and Ulfa
(2020:35, 39) that the use of OEP provides students with an opportunity to
actively engage in the co-creation of knowledge within collaborative spaces of
learning, respondents highlighted that learning through researching and
collaborating with others to design their OER, was enjoyable. In addition,
students noted that the development of an OER stimulates creativity and makes
learning interesting and fun. The literature has also confirmed the stimulation of
creativity when using OEP as part of teaching, learning and assessment (Geser
2007:37). Furthermore, students valued having the creative freedom to
internalise knowledge and share their knowledge with others during the learning
process. This confirms the findings of Fisher and King (2010:45) which state
that self-control as a component of SDL provides students the opportunity to
gain a deeper understanding through sharing of knowledge during the
cooperative and collaborative learning process. Excerpts in this regard include:

    `I think OER's should be included because they allow creativity and make learning
    interesting and fun.' (P130433490, D11/02/2021, 08:03)

    `The creative freedom we had when creating the infographic. It was fun, and we got
    to share our knowledge with others. The work we put into the infographic can now
    be used to educate others.' (P129526501, D10/22/2021, 00:31)

    `I enjoyed researching the information knowing our infographic could help others.
    I enjoyed creating an attention-grabbing infographic knowing someone will see
    it and feel better informed. I had fun playing around with visuals and fonts and
    colours.' (P130645742, D11/04/2021, 10:46)

                                                                                                                                            171
Second-year health students' perspectives on developing open educational resources

   Sub-theme 4: Challenges in open educational resource

Despite the positive feedback on using an OER as a learning activity, a small
number of students stated that even though they enjoyed participating in the
design of the learning object, they felt engaged in the development of
the OER. In addition, some students did not enjoy participating in the
collaborative learning opportunities and did not view the development of the
learning object as an important skill to master as part of their learning. The
data analysis indicated that the challenges associated with group work can
hinder the enjoyment in cooperative and collaborative learning opportunities.
Additionally, it was also clear, lecturers need to be transparent in the use of
OEP, OER, open technologies and the inclusion of SDL in their teaching
practices. Excerpts include:

    `Though it is fun to do. It is not an important skill, and I think it would we wasting time
    for learning things that will matter in our field of study.' (P129144529, D10/18/2021,
    09:42)

    `I was ignorant regarding certain dimensions, I felt like they are not important. I did
    not see the impact they had in our lives as students.' (P130378290, D11/01/2021,
    12:43)

Additionally, a small number of students reported that they found the
assignment challenging but managed to complete it successfully through
hard work and interaction with team members:

    `It was a bit difficult but we managed to work together.' (P130343184, D11/01/2021,
    06:47)

    `It was difficult but we managed.' (P129092224, D10/17/2021, 22:43)

Regarding the introduction of OEP and OER as part of the teaching, learning
and assessment practices in the module, students highlighted the need for
more comprehensive and detailed information regarding the use and
development of OERs and what is expected of them. As indicated by various
scholars (Chiappe & Adame 2018:223; Knox 2013:825; Nascimbeni & Ehlers
2020:2), the researchers strongly believe that the lecturers' lack of knowledge
and experience in using an OEP may have contributed to students needing
more support and guidance in the development of OER as part of the teaching
and learning methodology in this module. Some excerpts include:

    `I would maybe suggest that there could be a video made where they explain the
    do's and don'ts of creating an OER. Many students are unsure of this method of
    teaching and would need direction.' (P130747493, D11/05/2021, 11:20)

  Limitations and recommendations

The lecturer-researcher dual role implied a power differential between the
lecturers and the students. Students are regarded as a vulnerable population
as they are a captive audience because they are registered for the module

172
                                                                                                                                 Chapter 8

and there is a power relation between them and the lecturer. As a result of
possible coercion, bias, undue influence and the conflict of interest because
of the dual role, the researchers could not engage with students on any
research-related activities or the students as research participants.
Participation was voluntary, and there was no incentive for participating in
the research. As a result, a small number of students did not participate in
the research. Only hearing the voices of students who volunteered might
create a bias as it may be the voices of the more positive and motivated
students on using an OEP in teaching, learning and assessment. The
researchers recommend using an all-inclusive sampling process to partially
address this bias. Introducing OEP into the module was a new experience for
many students. As a result, students needed more comprehensive and
detailed information regarding the use and development of OERs, open
technologies and what is expected of them.

    The authors recommend that lecturers who want to introduce OEP into
their modules should empower themselves in the use of OE pedagogy to
ensure optimal learning. Additionally, lecturers should clearly understand
what OEP entails, be transparent in the reason for including OEP as
pedagogy and how including OEP enhances knowledge, skills and
attributes. Lastly, the researchers recommend that lecturers provide
sufficient support to students during the module as the novelty of this
approach can be overwhelming.

  Conclusion

In this chapter, the authors aimed to establish a deeper understanding of the
use of OEP in HE teaching within a collaborative learning environment.
Furthermore, the study aims to provide specific direction for the use of OEP
to enhance undergraduate, IPE in Health Sciences. Several studies have
pointed out the gap in the body of knowledge regarding how OEP can be
implemented in HE for teaching purposes. Using a narrow `OEP' lens in this
study enabled a deep exploration into the use of OEP for teaching and learning
in HE. This chapter affirmed the hpotential of using OEP as a vehicle for
transformation to foster student agency, lifelong learning and self-directedness.
This study provides an empirical foundation for changing the advocacy
narrative supporting OEP in undergraduate, interprofessional teaching.
In addition, this study highlights the benefits of actively engaging students in
the knowledge generation process. These benefits include the development
and enhancement of SDL, student engagement with peers and the subject
matter, knowledge creation, collaborative learning, increased satisfaction,
empowerment and the development of knowledge, skills and attributes. This
study confirms the benefits of the literature and that OEP could act as a
catalyst for transformation in HE.

  Abstract

Despite advances in improving awareness, reducing stigma and improving the
accessibility of credible health information in recent years, many people still
do not understand the concepts relating to infection, disease and treatment.
The gap between information and understanding is particularly evident with
the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and acquired immunodeficiency
syndrome (AIDS) and tuberculosis (TB), and now the ongoing coronavirus
disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. An open educational resource (OER) in
the form of a game was created to allow participants to educate themselves
on the subject matter. Development of the OER involved video production
with associated audio, the creation of various animations or infographics, an
online information centre and an interactive question-and-answer game with
levels of increasing difficulty. An assessment of the OER was made via a short
survey (which also collected consented demographic information) that was
built into the game. Statistics relating to each player's experience and success
as per their survey responses in the game informed on knowledge acquisition.
The game was tested within the North-West University's (NWU) context and
will subsequently be improved and finally be made available as an OER. This
chapter therefore briefly discusses infectious diseases and the tools previously
used to create awareness around the subject matter. The concept of and the
role that OERs, specifically open education games (OEGs), could play in
creating awareness is also dissected. We finally report on the creation,
application and success of the pilot version of the developed OER.

  Introduction

Open educational practices (OEPs) have been defined over the years through
the findings of several projects to include a broad view of scholarship, the
creation, use and repurposing of OERs (cf. ch. 1). These projects have also
reworked the definition to recognise that OEPs extend beyond OERs. While
OERs may be a component of OEPs, they can also be decoupled from OEPs.
Contributions to the definition stemmed mainly from the Global North, but
researchers from the South have highlighted, as part of their work, the lack of
diverse perspectives as it pertains to academic knowledge. Of interest is that
the practices employed need to align with the context and or culture of where
the learning process needs to happen. For a summary of some of the most
frequently cited definitions of OEPs and how the definitions evolved, the
reader is directed to the review of Cronin and Maclaren (2018).

In recognising the benefit of OEPs, one has to consider previous and current
educational practices to effectively incorporate the shift to `open'.

    Teaching and learning practices in the past have mainly focused on the
teacher as the `encyclopaedia of information and knowledge'. There has,
however, been a shift to more learner-centred teaching and learning
approaches (Blaschke 2018:176), as well as self-directed learning, where an
individual, with or without the assistance of others, starts and continues to
work towards their goals (Knowles 1975:130). An agent, according to the
Merriam-Webster dictionary, is `one that acts or exerts power'. This is in line
with the learner agency definitions quoted by Blaschke (2018:172), which
centres around intentionally making things happen through one's actions. In
taking on the learner agency role, the student is placed at the centre of their
education process. They know and understand that the primary motivation
for success stems from within them; there is a choice to learn, and with choice
comes responsibility but also acceptance of the consequences linked to such
choices. The learner takes responsibility for the education process, measuring
their abilities that ultimately influence their learning behaviour (Blaschke
2018:176). Facilitating the learning process is the increased use of technologies
that enables openness. Although the learner controls their learning process,
instructors may still offer guidance. The shift in how teaching and learning are
envisioned speaks to the realisation that acquiring knowledge in this era is
very different from earlier times.

    Implementation of contextualised OEPs serves as platforms that help drive
learners to become agents of their own learning process and destiny. Not only
are they encouraged to create, share and repurpose educational material in all
forms, but collaboration and networking further drive openness and
accessibility. As part of the OER fellowship, we contribute to the development
of an OER focused on infectious diseases, drawing from the South African
context while still keeping global relevance and accessibility in mind. This was
motivated by the COVID-19 pandemic, which highlighted the gaps regarding
key health and infectious diseases concepts. We recognise that learning needs
to be fun and opted for a game-based OER in the hope that it would start a
conversation not only about the subject matter covered but also about how
this mode of teaching facilitated learners' learning (changing practices). Their
learning was encouraged through material and testing of this knowledge via
interactive games. As reported later, time (learning at one's own pace) is
essential to the learning process as opposed to being restricted to a specific
time window. The presentation and order in which information is presented
are also key.

    That the world is ill-prepared for disease outbreaks has been previously
reported (Smith et al. 2020:1) and is also evident in the management of the
current COVID-19 pandemic. Failing policies and guidelines as it pertains to
disease outbreaks are recognised, yet little is done concerning future preparedness

                                                                                                                                           177
An open educational resource as a tool to create awareness around infectious diseases

and response measures (Smith et al. 2020:1). During disease outbreaks, as
witnessed during the COVID-19 era, media coverage is prominent, although not
always accurate. Caught up in fear and uncertainty, sources of misinformation
originate amongst family, friends, public figures, the media, social media
influencers and even primary health care officials or providers (Galvão 2021:e114;
Nelson et al. 2020:510). In addition, the infectious disease field is vast, inundated
with concepts and information which are complex and not always understood by
all, nor are they easily retained (Castro-Sánchez et al. 2016:103; Parkes et al.
2005:259). Consequently, a knowledge gap exists as it relates to infection, the
immune system, disease treatment and prevention. Addressing the knowledge
gap through the dissemination of accurate, easy-to-understand health and
infectious disease information is thus a continuous public aspect that needs to
be addressed. In this regard, international public health agencies such as the
World Health Organization (WHO) and the United States of America's (USA's)
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) serve as primary sources to
consult on outbreak news, epidemiology and health (Barber & Stark 2015:1).

    Universities are often in the middle of such agencies and the media,
bridging how information is shared. The University of Minnesota's Center for
Infectious Disease Research and Policy (CIDRAP) website (University of
Minnesota 2022), for example, hosts an online newspaper that focuses on
emerging diseases and outbreaks. Besides news, supplemental resources and
time-stamped literature are also provided (Barber & Stark 2015:2). The open-
access, open-source website `Our World in Data' (Global Data Change Lab
2022) aims to address global problems such as poverty and climate change
by making research and data freely accessible so that existing data can be
used to its full potential. This site addresses various socio-economic issues
related to health and disease and hosts a sustainable development goals
(SDGs) tracker. Major media corporations (such as the New York Times, the
British Broadcasting Corporation [BBC] and the Wall Street Journal) and
universities (such as Harvard, Stanford and Oxford) endorse `Our World in
Data', reassuring one of its credibility. Many sources exist from which to
retrieve health information, but not all are as credible as the aforementioned.
While some online platforms, websites and games have been developed to
serve as trustworthy sources from which to acquire health-related information
and facilitate the retention thereof, these are not distinctly characterised as
OERs and are more than likely accessed via paid platforms. Therefore, an OEG
was created, which combined the accessibility and adaptability of an OER,
with the advantages of game-based learning and credible resources.

  Infectious diseases and the problems
  they pose

Infectious diseases have always been part of human existence. When referring
to an organism as having an `infectious disease', it is implied that a disposition

178
                                                                                                                                 Chapter 9

towards one or more disorders exists as a result of the invasion of the tissue
of the organism by a separate, pathogenic organism (Babcock et al. 2021:3).
Pathogens include viruses, bacteria and fungi, which are often referred to as
`microorganisms' because of their typically microscopic size. The mechanisms
and manifestations of disease differ amongst the different classes of pathogens
as well as between members of a class and, as such, the factors that influence
their emergence as threats to public health care differ (Church 2004:562).
Pathogen transmission may be human-to-human (as in the case of COVID-19),
vector-to-human (as in the case of malaria, where the mosquito acts as a
vector, transmitting the pathogen without developing the disease) (Barber &
Stark 2015:1) or animal-to-human (such as rabies). The term `epidemic' is used
to refer to an outbreak of the disease in a specific region or community at a
frequency higher than the typically observed incidence (O'Brien 2013:166).
When such an outbreak spreads to affect various areas worldwide, it is referred
to as a `pandemic' (Porta 2014:209).

    Factors that typically can contribute to the emergence of certain infectious
diseases include ecological changes, travel, economic condition, microbial
adaptation and change, technology and industry, the breakdown of certain
public health measures, as well as human demographic changes and behaviour
(Lashley 2003:258; Morse 1995:10). Even though advancement in technology
and industrialisation has made significant contributions to the fight against
infectious diseases - for instance, the recognition of new infectious agents
and the discovery of effective treatments (Church 2004:573; Lashley 2003:259;
Morse 1995:9) - human behaviour has been found to play a pivotal role in the
distribution or transmission of disease. For example, changes in behaviour
such as those resulting from the sexual revolution and intravenous drug use
have contributed to the emergence of HIV infection (Lashley 2003:259; Morse
1995:8). Another factor becoming increasingly pertinent is the evolution of
microorganisms leading, for instance, to the emergence of antibiotic-resistant
bacteria (Church 2004:575; Morse 1995:8), which limits treatment options for
some diseases.

    In the last few decades, TB and HIV and AIDS have emerged as serious
threats to public health in sub-Saharan Africa Africa and other developing
countries such as India (Roth et al. 2018:1772; WHO 2021). Tuberculosis is
caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), while AIDS is caused by HIV.
Tuberculosis has been the number one cause of death because of a single
pathogen since 2007, but it is now expected that COVID-19 will outrank it as
of 2020 (WHO 2021). During this period, amongst HIV-negative people, TB
still caused 1.3 million deaths, with a further 214000 amongst people living
with HIV and AIDS (PLWHA), accounting for a significant global HIV and TB
co-infection burden (WHO 2021). In 2019, South Africa had the second highest
mortality rate in terms of co-infections, only outranked by Lesotho, which
highlights the need to employ all possible measures to curb the spread of
these diseases (WHO 2020a). Although TB can be cured by rigorous antibiotic

                                                                                                                                           179
An open educational resource as a tool to create awareness around infectious diseases

courses, antibiotic resistance and the interaction of HIV and Mtb in the co-
infected host complicate this (Letang et al. 2020:447). In addition, various
factors cause non-adherence on the part of the patient (WHO 2003). No
widely applicable cure has yet been found for HIV, and although antiretroviral
therapy decreases viral load, and thereby minimises spread, it places a lifelong
burden of therapy on patients (Hokello et al. 2019:2).

    The difficulty of controlling infectious diseases, particularly in developing
countries, is to a great extent influenced by the available infrastructure,
resources and socio-economic conditions (Tosam, Ambe & Chi 2019:246).
However, even when these are in place for diagnosis and management, a key
factor determining the success of such investments is the perceptions and
resulting behaviour of the community. As such, it has been established that
knowledge, or health literacy (the ability to access and use information)
(Castro-Sánchez et al. 2016:103), in the hands of the public might be one of
the most effective tools to better prevent and manage infectious diseases.
Time would however be essential to allow for the intake and assimilation of
such information. Developing user-friendly, open resources which the public
can access in their own time may further encourage self-learning.

   Tools that have been used to address the
   information-knowledge gap: Successes and
   shortfalls

A vast array of strategies has been employed to educate students and the
public about infectious diseases. Awareness campaigns typically include
handing out brochures, verbal explanations, posters, radio and television
programmes, and more recently, the distribution of virtual posters or
infographics via social media (Alvarez et al. 2016:2; Madhumathi et al. 2021:15;
Yadav & Rawal 2016:2). This also sometimes includes community engagement
sessions through which information is explained during gatherings such as at
feasts, schools, churches and sports team gatherings (Alvarez et al. 2016:3;
Spruijt et al. 2020:2). This is done by local governments or non-profit
organisations, as well as at the international level by public health organisations,
such as the WHO, which organise massive campaigns such as the Stop TB
partnership. The Stop TB project aims to eliminate TB as a public health threat
while striving to make diagnosis, treatment and care available to all until that
can be achieved (Stop TB 2019). The establishment of dedicated
commemorative days such as World TB Day (24 March), International
Microorganism Day (17 September) and World AIDS Day (01 December) also
provides opportunities to create worldwide awareness about pathogens and
diseases and leads to the production of freely available educational resources.
Unfortunately, the periods in between these annual events are often sparsely
populated in terms of events aimed at raising awareness or improving

180

knowledge, allowing essential concepts around the prevention and
management of potentially deadly or life-altering diseases to fade into the
background of the public mind (Yadav & Rawal 2016:2).

    The accessibility of the Internet has made a plethora of information available
to nearly every individual. A natural consequence of this is that it has become
increasingly difficult, even for experts in a field, to distinguish credible
information from misinformation and to avoid logical fallacies resulting from
the non-systematic way that information is shared and consumed via social
media (Escandón et al. 2021:2). Thus, the problem today lies less in the
availability or accessibility of information but rather in the ability, firstly, to
identify credible information, secondly, to truly understand and assimilate it,
and lastly, to be bold enough to act on this understanding in environments or
cultures where stigma and myths are deeply ingrained (Chowdhury, Khalid &
Turin 2021:2). In short, there is what the WHO has termed an `infodemic' (WHO
2020b), resulting in an information-knowledge gap, which is particularly
evident with HIV and AIDS and TB, and now the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.

    Various factors contributing to this gap have come to light through the
performance assessments of previously employed awareness tools. People
typically obtain disease-related information from family, friends and co-
workers (Bashorun et al. 2020:115; Pengpid & Peltzer 2019:115). As such, many
researchers have employed, and based on their results, advised, community-
based strategies. However, a factor precluding the success of any knowledge-
based intervention is the educational level of those receiving the information
(Abebe et al. 2010; Adane et al. 2017:5; Bashorun et al. 2020:7; Luba et al.
2019:3; Tolossa, Medhin & Legesse 2014:5; Wang et al. 2018:4), as this affects
the ability to understand and assimilate diverse and complex information.
Unfortunately, the areas of highest burden and spread (especially in the case
of TB and HIV infection) are often resource-limited, rural communities with
limited educational and primary health care services (Glaziou et al. 2014; WHO
2020a). This implies that an intervention should have an inherent and active
educational aspect in the sense that participants use information during the
intervention instead of passively hearing or reading information. In this regard,
it has also been shown that presenting information in a tailored, culturally
appropriate manner improves the uptake and implementation of the
information (Alvarez et al. 2016:3). This entails that triggers and barriers need
to be identified. Thereafter, sensitive, specific and tailored messaging must be
developed that overcomes cultural and language barriers, while still considering
the heterogeneity in the audience (Madhumathi et al. 2021:20). Alvarez et al.
(2016) were able to tailor their awareness programme to be culturally
appropriate to Inuit youth. They saw success even when their developed
interventions were implemented in the absence of researchers. While this is
achievable in areas where cultures are still isolated - such as the Canadian
Inuit, where there is a significant burden of TB - this may be difficult in a

                                                                                                                                            181
An open educational resource as a tool to create awareness around infectious diseases

culturally diverse country such as South Africa (Matthews & Van Wyk 2018:1).
However, as such countries develop, a new, integrated culture emerges that is
built around diversity, which could be leveraged to bring across concepts in a
relatable manner.

    People need to be able to access and self-learn the material so that they
understand the information to such an extent as to recognise the disease in
themselves and others when it is there. They also need to recognise when it is not
there to avoid an unnecessary burden on the health care system. In this way, they
help themselves and do not shy away from helping others because of stigma. As
long as stigma prevails, which becomes ingrained in the culture, this would be
difficult to overcome. This is also reflected in people's responses when asked
about how they would expect to feel if they tested positive for TB (Bashorun et
al. 2020:7). Even those who scored high on TB knowledge and positive attitude
identified feelings of shame, anger, avoidance, surprise and sadness. For example,
a prevailing myth is that TB spreads through sharing cutlery and crockery. This
leads to extreme isolation, even within a household, as those with TB are given
separate utensils for fear of spread (Bashorun et al. 2020:9).

    The prevalence highlights the fact that infectious diseases, especially at the
epidemic or pandemic levels, are a social, as well as a medical and public
health problem, and they should be addressed as such (Yadav & Rawal 2016:1).
Although some attempts were made to address this social aspect during the
COVID-19 pandemic, a significant amount of stigma developed, even in areas
where outbreaks were well-controlled (Yuan et al. 2021:2). Although HIV
infection and TB largely affect certain demographic groups, the COVID-19
pandemic so painfully demonstrated that no segment of society is exempt
from infection and, as such, every segment must be involved to achieve true
disease awareness.

    Subsequently, every link in the disease management chain needs to be
strong to truly establish a knowledge base amongst the public. Another weak
spot that has been identified is the level and quality of knowledge amongst
health workers (including doctors, nurses and aides). Even if people's health-
seeking behaviours improve, the information they obtain from health workers
during testing, upon diagnosis and during management and monitoring of
disease may influence their behaviour and the information spread to others
(Bashorun et al. 2020:11). As such, the training and re-training of primary
health care workers have also been suggested as a necessary addition to
awareness programmes (Bashorun et al. 2020:11; Madhumathi et al. 2021:22).
Therefore, the development of tools that may be used and adapted to any
scenario (be it spreading understanding amongst the general public, or
training health workers in a more rigorous manner) would be ideal.

    Another consideration is the credibility of the information that is spread.
Credibility is typically high in awareness programmes organised by primary

182
                                                                                                                                 Chapter 9

health care facilities and public health organisations. However, social media is
finding increased application as an awareness tool, and with this, the consideration
of misinformation is imperative. The problem may not always lie in the quality of
the information itself but rather in the interpretation and response of people to
the information (Du et al. 2021:2). Thus, it is necessary to teach people how to
distinguish misinformation and myths from credible information in a generally
applicable manner. For this, effective educational programmes and high-quality
information must be combined such that people can appropriately and
effectively use and respond to infectious disease information.

    The advantage of online tools, such as social media, is that the limitation
that applies to physical campaigns is significantly reduced. Tools and
educational materials that are created often fail because of resources that are
inadequate, limitations on the availability of trainers, time, and the costs of
training sessions and related media campaigns. Social media circumvents
some of these issues and provides the flexibility necessary in creating and
spreading tailored information. As it can cater to those with very basic literacy
through audio-visuals and infographics, it has great potential in this regard
(Madhumathi et al. 2021:20) and has been found to have a positive impact on
awareness during the COVID-19 pandemic (Al-Dmour et al. 2020:1). However,
the effect that social media has on health behaviours and perceptions are not
fully understood as yet (Du et al. 2021:2), and the authors advise caution and
recognise that more research is necessary to validate the existing results (Al-
Dmour et al. 2020:1). In the case of a pandemic such as COVID-19, for instance,
there are different phases in the social media response, starting with an initial
influx of credible information from public health organisations; but after a
latent state, misinformation starts to spread and is intermingled with credible
information (Madhumathi et al. 2021:27). Hence, the public must be educated
on how to make judgements regarding the credibility of information.

    Thus, the development of tools that are just as freely accessible as social
media, tools that are educational, interactive and engaging without feeling
tedious and overly complex, and that are adaptable to the cultural
circumstances while originating from recognisably credible sources are
needed to bridge the information-knowledge gap regarding infectious
diseases. Open educational resources, and specifically OEGs, may serve such
a purpose.

   Open educational resources as an approach to
   addressing the infectious diseases knowledge gap:
   A focus on open education games

Open educational resources are materials, in any format, used in teaching or
learning that are available within the public domain or that have been released
under a license that would allow free use, changes or sharing (De Vries 2013:56).

                                                                                                                                           183
An open educational resource as a tool to create awareness around infectious diseases

This model of sharing educational material is transparent and allows academic
freedom and unrestricted access to information and knowledge. Several
repositories exist, comprising materials such as videos, lectures, textbooks and
various others in different languages in the infectious disease, health and medical
fields (Perifanou & Economides 2022:5).

    In addition to these repositories, there are also independent and often
dedicated online-based platforms where OERs may be accessed. The
International Society for Infectious Diseases shared its infection control guide
as an open resource to help prevent the acquisition and transmission of
infectious diseases. While many respondents have access to mobile technology,
allowing for revised and updated guides to be viewed and shared (Desai et al.
2019:56), the materials shared must still be adapted for under-resourced
settings. While such guides are useful, they contain a lot of text, requiring time
to read and process the information. Websites such as the `Microbe World'
(American Society for Microbiology 2013) typically contain more condensed,
relatable graphic information which is often more easily retained and recalled
(Guo et al. 2020:1). The Marian Koshland Science Museum of the National
Academy of Sciences hosts an online exhibition called `Infectious Disease:
Evolving Challenge to Human Health' (National Academy of Sciences 2021).
This resource provides introductory material on epidemiology, disease biology,
pathogen evolution and educator resources. The History of Vaccines (The
College of Physicians of Philadelphia 2022) is a website that contains
interactive material relating to how vaccines work, the types of vaccines
found, and how vaccines are created, while the CDC's `BAM! Body and Mind'
primarily covers information on pathogens, the immune system, and vaccines.
The resources discussed provide credible and accessible information; however,
websites and other online platforms are not always as fun, interactive, engaging
and competitive as games are. Although OEGs that relate to the life sciences
have been created, this concept has not been adequately explored in general,
nor with specific relation to infectious diseases.

   Games and game-based learning

Games have formed part of society and childhood development since ancient
times. Individuals play for fun and to pass the time, but very rarely do they
voluntarily play for educational purposes. Games generally comprise media
elements guided by a narrative, organised under a set of rules and game
mechanics (Silveira 2016:3). They also present different levels of structure and
complexity. Matrix games, for example, are semi-structured in that a scenario
plays out and multiple role players provide an action plan which is reviewed by
other participants. The facilitator or `gamemaster' calculates the feasibility of all
actions proposed and finally decides on the outcome (Smith et al. 2020:3).

    Games are often used in the teaching and learning process (Silveira &
Villalba-Condori 2018:19). When developed for education purposes - that is to

184
                                                                                                                                 Chapter 9

promote understanding, critical thinking and decision-making, and self-
directed leaning (Smith et al. 2020:2; Toh & Kirschner 2020:2) - a game is
classified as a subtype of `serious games'. The attractive elements and graphics
associated with games naturally spark an interest to play. Games are engaging
and allow for retention, active learning, communication and interaction (De
Ondarza 2018:16; Silveira & Villalba-Condori 2018:19). These simulated
environments often mirror how decisions or biases influence policy-making,
implementation and outcome (Silveira & Villalba-Condori 2018:19; Smith et al.
2020:2). The ludic setting of games serves as a `safe' space; therefore, games
are a useful learning tool that affords innovation, experiential learning, and
can inform and guide health policies, practice, and improved responses.
Participants learn at their own pace, obtain immediate feedback and transfer
scenarios to the real-world environment. This is exemplified in the use of war
games by militaries for training and analytical purposes. The use of games has
since expanded to other domains (Smith et al. 2020:2), although it remains
under-utilised in the teaching, learning and policymaking of global health
crises. This is in line with the limited literature on serious games and the
application of these to infectious diseases.

    Table 9.1 provides a summary of exemplary game-based learning approaches
that relate to biology and infectious diseases. Board games were presented as
a common format where infectious diseases or other health concepts were
covered. While `Survivor' was developed to assist the teaching process in a
medical microbiology class, games such as `Pandemic' (and its variations) are
commercially available for recreational play. `Pangea 2030' reflects real
interactions, decision-making, thinking on your feet, priority setting and, as
such, reflects the real-world scenario. Given that authorities generally disregard
the social determinants of health during crises, this game considered some
social aspects of health, specifically a gender-based analysis of disease
preparedness and response (Smith et al. 2020:3). Physical board games,
however, have an inherent associated cost, as the game elements must be
purchased or at least be printed. As there is a continual change in the role of
games and the advancement of technology, there has been a shift to more
online-based resources and games in the last few decades (Silveira 2016:7).

    The CDC's `Solve the Outbreak' provides links to learning material, and
badges are awarded to those who perform well. `Disease Defenders' and
`Animal Alert' mirror the CDC's game and these games are storyline-based
and incorporate educational gameplay focused on disease outbreaks but also
highlight career possibilities (Barber & Stark 2015:3). Although not an online
game, an `Escape Room'-based activity developed by Cotner et al. (2018)
highlights some important aspects regarding educational game development.
`Escape Room' was developed as a learning activity within a pharmacy elective
course on infectious diseases, and while the educational game was preferred
by participants, only 57.9% reported improved learning from gameplay (Cotner
et al. 2018:S401). This highlights that the effectiveness of a game must also be

                                                                                                                                           185
An open educational resource as a tool to create awareness around infectious diseases

assessed for retaining and understanding information, besides gauging
whether or not it improved the learning experience. India had one of the
highest infection rates in the world during the COVID-19 pandemic
(Singh, Anvikar & Sinha 2022:2), with vulnerable populations such as migrant
workers and domestic aids grossly affected. An Indian non-governmental
organisation subsequently assisted with the development of `Survive COVID' -
a game disseminated via smartphone to portray the realities faced by the
aforementioned vulnerable populations during a lockdown. While playing
games during the pandemic may seem more light-hearted, this game brings
the reality of life and death, science and politics, and hope and despair of
others during the pandemic to the minds of those who may be in more
fortunate situations (Balakrishnan 2020:792). However, this evokes so much
emotion that many quit for fear of losing their peace and sanity (Balakrishnan
2020:792). Hosted on the History of Vaccines site, `Illsville' combines concepts
relating to epidemiology, quarantine, vaccination and herd immunity with the
history of medicine. There is also literature on the challenges of vaccine design
as well as resources for educators (Barber & Stark 2015:4).

    Whether board-based or online, it is evident from Table 9.1 that each game
addresses a specific issue(s) or concept(s) linked to the field. The recent
COVID-19 pandemic has brought the need for health education to the forefront,
and its influence is strikingly reflected in the pool of available resources. Most
of the board games cited require payment to play, which limits the number of
people that these resources reach. However, all the online games are open,
although some are not available for play anymore. Thus, it is not enough to
simply develop educational games. Rather, the availability and adaptability of
the resource (using credible sources) as well as implementing fun, engaging
and interactive activities should be an integral part of the development
process so that as many people as possible can benefit from it. In this regard,
OEGs may serve as a much more powerful alternative.

   Why open education games for bridging
   the knowledge gap?

Educational games should be developed as OERs (Silveira 2016:1; Silveira &
Villalba-Condori 2018:18) where various stakeholders come together to
develop games in an open way to allow adaptability and optimisation of
specific needs; one can adapt the activity for another context (Silveira 2016:7).
This academic freedom to tailor and customise information so that it is relevant
to one's context is very useful, not to mention the cost-savings associated
with repurposing such materials. This is especially powerful when a modular
design is used because this allows only as many parts of the resource as is
necessary to be tailored to a new context when the resource is reused or
repurposed (Tseng & Wang 2014:769). Because the Internet is rich in infectious
disease material, although dispersed and not always `open', it serves as a

An open educational resource as a tool to create awareness around infectious diseases

useful tool with which to increase awareness, reduce stigma and improve the
accessibility of information relating to infectious diseases. To develop effective
OEGs, openness principles must be regarded in all phases of game
development - that is the sourcing of information and content (graphics and
sound), the creation of the source code and the collection of data for
assessment of the effectivity of the resource. Game design should also
incorporate clear learning objectives, content and the associated assessment.

    Given their advantages, one would think that educational games would be
highly impactful. Instead, the opposite holds, mainly because of failure to
adapt the design for different educational, language, cultural and social
contexts. The game, therefore, has limited use in other settings, especially
where source codes or other necessary components are unavailable or not
translatable. Many students also perceive educational games as boring as
compared to games developed for entertainment (Silveira 2016:1; Silveira &
Villalba-Condori 2018:19).

    Developing educational games, and OEGs at that, has many challenges, from
conception to development. Most of the challenges are technical, linked to the
inherent complexity of educational games (Silveira 2016:3). Other factors that
hinder the development and implementation of educational games include
curricula with limited flexibility, curricula that favour textbooks over games,
logistical drawbacks associated with implementing games in the class, time, the
ban of mobile devices, negative perceptions associated with incorporating
games and teachers who are not well-prepared to implement educational
games in the class (Silveira 2016:3; Silveira & Villalba-Condori 2018:19) when
they can actually serve as key agents to promote and support self-learning (Du
Toit-Brits 2019:1). There is also a lack in the availability of games that suit a
specific learning requirement, and when they do, they are difficult to sustain, as
learning requirements are limited to a specific time. In addition, game-related
assessments are not standardised. Some games are expensive to develop and
require high-end expertise, whereas others can be easily implemented (Smith
et al. 2020:7). The development of games requires the time and effort of a
multidisciplinary team. Technological changes also make the platforms on
which these games are hosted obsolete, impacting the openness thereof. While
there are advantages and disadvantages associated with the use of OEGs,
limited data on the subject hinders a true assessment of its impact.

   The rationale for the development of an open
   education game for the promotion of knowledge
   regarding infectious diseases

The infectious disease and health fields are inundated with information and
misinformation. There is a need to develop credible and engaging sources
which educate on basic principles linked to infectious diseases. The platforms

188
                                                                                                                                 Chapter 9

(board games, online sites or games), which offer semi-open or paid access to
material linked to infectious diseases, usually tend to address a specific
issue(s) or concept(s) linked to the field. The information is thus disjointed,
requiring individuals to collect the needed information in bits and pieces from
various source sites. Unlike the resources cited in Table 9.1, the created OER
addresses a wider variety of concepts in the infectious disease field, arranged
in a logical order (from the cause of disease to post-care and responsibility).
Its online nature allows for wide dissemination, as most people today either
own or have access to devices that can connect to the Internet. Its interactive
activities were also formulated to spark interest and encourage continued
participation while allowing for retention and learning which is primarily self-
owned.

   Objective

It was our objective to develop an educational game that places key concepts,
not just one, in a context that would facilitate an understanding of any
infectious agent, its infection cycle and associated concepts (despite us
highlighting three conditions that are of importance to sub-Saharan Africa).
We introduce first those agents which cause disease, their basic morphology
and characteristics, how transmission happens, the interaction of the pathogen
and its target cell, and the immune response elicited to understand why we
get sick. Then, symptoms are shown, which prompts testing and subsequent
management of the disease. Lastly, future responsibility (taking care to
prevent infection) is addressed through the example of vaccines. The learning
centre iterates the role of key role players in ensuring infection control.
Responses to scenarios are also highlighted in the learning material so that
participants can recognise the consequence of their actions or action plan
through gameplay - this game is thus more encompassing. Making this
available as an open resource would ensure the reach of a large target
audience. Through this, it is envisioned that individuals would make informed
health decisions following critical thinking of key concepts covered and, in
this way, we develop a society better prepared for future outbreaks and its
associated management, translating to saving lives and guiding policy change.
If anything, hopefully, it alerts individuals to keep thinking about the importance
of maintaining good hygiene, too.

   Materials and methods

This study was approved by the Research Ethics Committee of the Faculty of
Education of the North-West University (NWU-01014-21-A2). The NWU OER
researchers sourced instructional designers, multimedia designers and
developers and a programmer who could aid in the design and construction
of the game and related virtual constructs. Meetings were held every second

                                                                                                                                           189

week, during which the concept, design, content, video and audio production,
and preliminary dissemination plans were discussed and implemented. The
version of the game reported here is a pilot version. Several features have
already been built into the game and are therefore discussed here, but not all
were active during data collection.

    The game was created using Articulate 360 software, while the review of
the elements and content was done in Review 360. Other graphics were
created using Adobe Illustrator and Adobe Photoshop. While we could have
opted for open-source software we chose that which was freely available to
us. We also considered the scalability, security, technical support and
maintenance of the software to be used and opted for the stated one as the
designers who formed part of the study helped build it and are trained and
skilled in the licensed software. The use of free software had an additional
steep learning curve with support challenges and because of the time limit on
development, it was not a viable alternative.

    The game was hosted on the NWU's learning management system (eFundi).
This was to allow for the collection of feedback in the form of survey responses
for the pilot game within a closed cluster of respondents. Future hosting will
be done on a Linux-based server through Afrihost to ensure wider open-
access in future.

    The link to the game and its associated surveys were distributed
electronically to NWU students and staff via institutional platforms. Three
approved Google Forms surveys were embedded into the game at the start
(surveys 1 and 2) and end of the game (survey 3). The questions were structured
using a Likert scale to allow quantitative assessment of the participants'
responses, with one additional question that a participant could answer in
paragraph format in survey 1 to allow the conveyance of any additional or
specific information not covered in the surveys (this allowed for a qualitative
assessment as well). Survey 1 served to gain information regarding the
knowledge gap within society for application to future iterations of this game,
while surveys 2 and 3 provided the means by which informed consent was
obtained (for the collection of personal and demographical data) and
subjective user experience assessed, respectively.

    For future iterations of the game, which incorporate a story-based element,
some video and associated audio were also recorded. An invitation was sent
via e-mail to students of the biochemistry and student counselling and
development departments of the NWU to voluntarily participate in the
production of the video and audio. These students from the named
departments were chosen because of their background in infectious diseases,
immunology and community health science. As such, they would more easily
convey the needed information. In exchange for their time, these students

received mobile data. Informed consent was obtained to use this material as
part of an OER.

   The development process

The complexity and variety of elements needed for the creation of a game,
and specifically an OEG, meant that all elements would not be obtainable in a
pre-existing form. A story-based game would be more relatable, although
more difficult to execute. The story element conveyed through videos will be
incorporated in a future iteration of the game. The layout, graphics and flow
of information presented are based on the principles and guidelines from
various authors (Alessi & Trollip 2001; Clark & Lyons 2010; Gagne, Briggs &
Wager 1992; Lohr 2008; Mayer 2014). The theory developed by Mayer (2014),
`Cognitive Load for Multimedia Learning', is still the gold standard in instruction
where more than one media is combined in the presentation of learning
material. The theory of Gagne et al. (1992) includes nine instructional events
as well as corresponding cognitive processes that determine the relevant
conditions for learning and would serve as the foundation for designing
instruction and selection of relevant media. These nine events were included
in the design of this OEG: reception or gaining attention; expectancy or
informing learners of the objective; retrieval or also called stimulating recall of
prior learning; selective perception through presenting the stimulus; semantic
encoding in providing learning guidance; responding as eliciting performance;
reinforcement by providing feedback; retrieval by means of assessing
performance; and generalisation by enhancing retention and transfer.

    The front-end coding of the game elements consists of a combination of
HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The data capture section comprises a combination
of front-end and back-end coding consisting of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PhP
and SQL. The programmer created the coding from scratch and did not make
use of open-source code.

   Aesthetics

The multimedia designer created the `look and feel' of the game (Figure 9.1),
and all the developers made use of the same style sheet. Images sourced from
the creative commons (Wikimedia, Flickr and Creative Commons) were
adjusted to fit the aesthetics of the game and `bind' images from various
sources into a cohesive whole. Free fonts from Google Fonts with an open
license were used. The colours were chosen to be similar to the TB campaign
colours in South Africa, which is red and black. Red is the international ribbon
colour of TB. The colour scheme was also selected to suit an audience of aged
18-50 and to appear in line with the current design trends seen on websites
and social media platforms.

   Levels
The game comprises seven levels (Figure 9.1a), each representing a specific
infectious disease or health-related concept. The difficulty level progresses
from easy to hard. The story also plays out in seven scenes.

   The story
The story interlinked the various gaming elements and helped convey
difficult concepts with the intent to help the user master the content easier.

The game is set in South Africa and follows the story of a young male who
contracts TB, and the player follows his journey to recovery. Although set in
South Africa, where there is great cultural diversity, the concepts highlighted
are applicable globally. Within the story, there is a special focus on disease
agents of relevance to sub-Saharan Africa, particularly TB (given the minimal
media and public health attention directed to it) compared to COVID-19 and
HIV and AIDS. This allowed the opportunity for comparisons to be made
between bacteria and viruses as well as between viruses. The central theme
of the story was that there is hope after contracting TB, provided one is
armed with the necessary information. The story model followed the `Hero's
Journey' by Vogler (1998). The player of the game assists the main character
through his journey to overcome the myths and fears surrounding TB. The
player of the game is also on a path of discovery to dismantle their
preconceptions surrounding TB and other infectious diseases. Because the
target audience (in this pilot study) was mainly university students, the hero
(also the protagonist) character was a student, while the bacterium or
disease was the antagonist. There was also a grandfather as a mentor and a
girlfriend as an ally, both supporting the hero on his journey to recovery.
Main sites were selected to be familiar to a student and included a taxi next
to the road, social or family gathering, and a clinic.

   Play

Players could choose to read the learning materials and then play the activity,
or directly play the activities to challenge themselves. Afterwards, they could
return to the learning centre to improve their score the next time they play the
activity. There were a variety of activities throughout the game based on the
information in the learning material, some of which included working against
time. In most instances, feedback was provided to the player regarding their
achievement in the activity.

  Data collection, processing and
  statistical analyses

The pilot version of the game was open for play for 10 days on the NWU's
learning management system (eFundi). Responses were collected using
Google Forms and then exported as a comma-separated values file. The
statistical analyses were done using IBM® Statistical Package for the Social
Sciences (SPSS®) Version 24 software. Descriptive statistics were used to
summarise the collected data and determine the specific knowledge needs
and gains of different demographic groups. These statistics included
frequencies and means. All reported percentages represent valid
percentages (percentages calculated when missing responses were
excluded).

  Results and discussion

Surveys 1 and 2 were filled in before gameplay and received 57 responses
each, while survey 3, which was filled in after gameplay, received only 19
responses. This discrepancy may be explained by how survey 3 was built into
the game. It could be accessed from the landing page of the game but could
only be filled in after the game had been played, as it was designed to assess
the player's experience of the game. Although the player would receive a
prompt to complete survey 3 by clicking on the `quit' button, this was not the
only way the game could be exited. As the game is web-based, the player
could also exit by closing the Internet browser tab or the browser itself. As
such, this aspect of the game and its assessment will be reassessed for the
next iteration. The focus of this discussion is on survey 3, as its results allow
for an assessment of the reception of the OEG, while the results of survey 1 are
used to place respondents' perceived need for knowledge into context with
their experience of the game as per survey 3. Survey 2 only served to obtain
informed consent for gameplay and the collection of data after gameplay
and, as such, only allowed for the collection of the following optional
information: name, surname, student number and e-mail address.

   Surveys 2 and 3: Assessment of the experience with
   and efficacy of the open educational game

Of the nineteen respondents, the majority (n = 10; 52.6%) fell in between the
18-25 years age group, whereas people between the age group 35-50 years
represented the second largest proportion of respondents (n = 5; 26.3%)
(Figure 9.2). The percentages displayed here are based on the responses of
seventeen of the nineteen participants. This corresponds to the intended
target groups, which were university students and staff. When asked what the
main `take-home message' of the game was, the answer that `early responses
are advantageous to the management of diseases' was most frequently
selected (26.3%), followed by `vaccines are a safe and worthwhile option'
(15.8%) (Figure 9.2). The rest of the responses were spread across other
options (each having one to two responses). One of the main intentions during
content creation was to communicate that it is in the best interest of each
individual and for society as a whole to attend to symptoms early so that they
can be managed in a timely and effective manner. The above-mentioned
responses indicate that this was conveyed to players. This was considered a
key concept as the realisation that early diagnosis is imperative for the
outcome and would likely encourage the seeking of health care or the
prompting of others to do so. The realisation that vaccines are a safe and
worthwhile option speaks to an improved understanding of how vaccines
works and that diseases are caused by distinct and varying pathogens also
suggests that the content of the game addressed issues that lie at the core of

issues such as the misuse of antibiotics (i.e. using antibiotics for the treatment
of viral disease or indiscriminately for any infection). Being able to make the
distinction between pathogens would allow people to better understand the
health information they consume, which may contribute to better decision-
making. How these responses relate to behaviour requires more investigation,
which is outside the scope of this study.

    The gaming and perceived educational value of the game were assessed
using the previously mentioned Likert scale. The term `absolute positive' (AP)
is used to indicate the `I agree' option on the Likert scale as opposed to the
less positive `I partially agree'. The percentages stated are based on the total
number of respondents who answered for each particular question. In terms
of the gaming aspects, 82.4% of respondents were positive (Figure 9.3a)
about the idea that the game was easy to understand and play (with 47.1%,
Figure 9.3A), while 88.2% indicated that it was interesting (64.7%, Figure 9.3b)
81.3% that it was fun (35.3%, Figure 9.3c) and 75% that it was interactive
(43.8%). While most respondents were positive regarding the enjoyment of
the game, the answers were not all absolutely positive. This indicates that
some aspects of the game took away from the experience. This may be
explained by some remaining issues in the mechanics of navigation in the
game and that in some activities, the number of allowed attempts was not
made clear, which meant that players had to move on without being able to

improve their score. During development, it was decided to make the pilot
game nonlinear such that players could attempt an activity before working
through the related learning content. This was intended to provide a challenge
to the player, but in combination with the problems in navigation may have
detracted from the experience.

    All respondents (100%) felt that the game was educational to some extent
(76.3% AP, Figure 9.4a) and 94.1% (64.7% AP, Figure 9.4b) felt that they
acquired new or built on existing knowledge. When the answers relating to
whether the game was educational were stratified by age, older participants
(36-50 years, representing staff) all answered in the AP, while in the groups
representing younger staff or older students (26-35 years) and students
(18-25 years), two participants (Figure 9.4c) only agreed to some extent

FIGURE 9.4: Responses of participants regarding the educational value of the game, on a Likert scale, as
recorded in Survey 3. Participants were asked to what extent they agreed with the following statements: (a)
the game was educational, (b) I have acquired new or built on existing knowledge, (c) the game helped me
to understand concepts, (d) the learning centre was useful in the learning process, (e) the game helped me
to reflect and think critically about myths and misinformation and (f) I will be able to better review health
information obtained from social media. Numbers correspond to the number of participants.

understand concepts better. This may be related to the use of the word
`educational' rather than to the respondents' actual perceived learning in
that they may see the game more as learning material (i.e. boring, Silveira
[2016:1]) and less as a game. The mechanical problems (i.e. problems in
navigating between levels and activities) in the game may also have
contributed to the feeling that the understanding of concepts did not

                                                                                                                                           197

improve, as this improvement could not be clearly seen in the repeated play
of an activity. This may have been more pertinent in older players, who are
less familiar with navigating video games than younger players may be. The
mechanical problems may also be improved in future iterations of the game
by decreasing the technicality and text-heaviness of content where possible,
without compromising the depth of learning. This concept could also be
applied to the learning centre in future (88.2% found it helpful to some
extent; Figure 9.4d) in that the more accessible the learning content is, the
quicker a player can return to the game and improve their score. Despite
some issues remaining in the mechanics of the game, the resource
encouraged participants to reflect on concepts such as myths and
misinformation (52.9% responded in the AP that it prompted thought, Figure
9.4e) and 82.3% (58.8% AP) felt that they would be able to better review
health information obtained from social media. As discussed distinguishing
misinformation in the information age is becoming increasingly difficult, and
the ability to stop and question information before assimilating it is an
essential skill.

    To get a more practical indication of whether participants felt that their
knowledge had improved after gameplay, players were asked to rate their
knowledge before and after the game. Before the game, only 29.4% (n = 5)
of respondents felt that they knew the information to such an extent as to
teach it to others (Figure 9.5a), while after the game, 47.1% (n = 8) of
participants felt that level of confidence in their knowledge (Figure 9.5b).
Another 47.1% (n = 8) of respondents felt that they knew the information to
such an extent as to make informed decisions themselves, but not
necessarily enough to convey it to others (Figure 9.5b). Furthermore, 76.5%
(41.2% AP) indicated that they would be better prepared for future
pandemics (Figure 9.5c). This may indicate that players either did not fully
grasp how to apply the knowledge gained in the game or did not perceive
the game as giving practically applicable information.

    Despite the remaining mechanical problems in this pilot version of
the game, the content of the game can be improved, as indicated by the
data discussed here: 82.4% (47.1% AP, Figure 9.6a) of respondents reported
that they would recommend the game to others and all participants felt
that educational games are an effective learning tool (82.4% AP,
Figure 9.6b).

FIGURE 9.6: Responses of participants to questions intended to gauge their overall impression of the game
and educational games in general, on a Likert scale, as recorded in Survey 3. Participants were asked to
what extent they agreed with the following statements: (a) I would recommend this game to others and
(b) educational games are an effective learning tool. Numbers correspond to the number of participants.

   Survey 1: Collection of data for improvement of
   future iterations of the open educational game

Survey 1, which consisted of 23 questions, was used to assess in which areas
participants felt the greatest need for knowledge before engaging in the
game so that these may be addressed in future iterations. At first, the survey
(consisting of 18 questions) asked participants to what extent they would like
to learn more about general concepts regarding infectious diseases, such as
how the immune system works, what false positive and negative results mean,
what antibiotic resistance is, etc. More than 80% (46-54) of respondents were
positive about learning these concepts for all the questions in this section. For
all these questions, more than 80% of respondents were positive about
learning these concepts. When specifically asked (three questions)whether
they felt they needed more knowledge about TB, HIV and AIDS and COVID-19
specifically, to which only 60%-70% of respondents answered positively. This
may indicate that participants do not feel that this specific knowledge is
necessary or relevant to them, which possibly relates to the stereotypes
associated with people who are susceptible to or at risk for HIV and AIDS or
TB. Thus, the concept of susceptibility and responsibility (in the sense of
helping others to recognise disease) must be stressed in the content of the
game going forward. Participants were also asked how likely they were to
familiarise themselves with disease management and post-infection care
practices, to which 47 (82.5%, 21; 36.8% AP) participants answered positively.

    When asked what other concepts participants would like to learn more
about and which were not specifically covered in the survey, the following
were highlighted: origins of disease; the lifespan of various organisms on
surfaces; specifics regarding the prognosis of HIV (viral loads and CD4 counts
and their cut-offs) and the reasons why some diseases are incurable. One
respondent also indicated that the terminology used in the survey was

unknown to them. Most of these concepts were covered in the pilot game, but
this also stresses the importance of using language that is accessible to people
from all backgrounds. The nonlinear form of the game may also have led to
participants missing crucial background information. This will be especially
important to address in the next iteration, which will be available to the public
and not only to university students as the pilot game was.

    As regards the experience of the researchers in the creation of this
OEG, the main limiting factor was the time within which the game had to be
created, disseminated and assessed. The natural complexity of game
development, combined with the creation or sourcing of open content within
a multidisciplinary team resulted in some delays. Because the game developers
and the biochemistry researchers have radically different academic
backgrounds, many iterations of content revision were necessary, and some
miscommunications occurred. Some decisions, such as that the game could
be played in a nonlinear manner, also confused players. Going forward, these
issues should be less prominent, as adjustments can be made to the manner
of communication amongst contributors from different backgrounds, and
more time will be available to work out issues in presentation and navigation
as well as implement what was learned in the pilot study. Overall, the
communication skills of all parties were improved, in the sense that they are
now better able to anticipate and correct potential miscommunications with
people from different backgrounds. Furthermore, the ability to present
complex and specialised information to a non-scientific audience was also
improved.

  Conclusion

The surveys indicated that the OEG was generally well-received and enjoyed,
despite some problems in navigation and feedback within the pilot game. The
majority of respondents also indicated that the game improved their
knowledge and induced thought about their interaction with health
information. Most questions received some negative feedback, and
approximately half of the positive answers were only partially positive,
indicating that there is room for improvement. Although the problems with
the mechanics may have detracted from the experience of the game, the
overall positive response is encouraging for the efficacy that could be achieved
with a more polished product in future. In the process of developing the next
version of the OEG, attention will specifically be paid to improving the
presentation and flow of information, user-friendliness of the game interface
and allowing a longer period for the collection of responses. This should
encourage the self-directedness of the process, as learners will be able to
engage with the information with fewer impediments and be able to learn at
their own pace. Although the time allowed for responses was short, fewer

                                                                                                                                           201

mature people (representing staff, including lecturers) responded. This may
also indicate a need to promote the concepts of OEP and self-directed learning
amongst lecturers in general, which may increase their interest in supporting
or participating in the creation of OERs.

  Abstract

Since 2015 South African universities have been grappling with ideas of
decolonising the knowledge they produce. Students argued that their
curricula do not reflect their lived experiences as African students. This
chapter will deal with epistemic injustice as central to the idea of decolonising
the curriculum. Epistemic justice, access to open legal education will be
discussed, among other themes. The main aim of the chapter is to advance a
framework for an inclusive educational learning environment using a decolonial
approach. In the first part of the chapter, epistemic injustice is defined and
discussed with a view of using epistemic justice as an enabler of curriculum
development. The second part of the chapter concerns teaching and student
agency in the South African university. The third and final part of the chapter

discusses open educational resources (OERs) as tools for social justice and
how they can be used to develop open legal resources and pedagogy.

  Introduction

There are many questions that are central to the decolonial theory, chief
among them is the question: is it possible to decolonise a body of knowledge
that is inextricably linked to the colonial project? The term evokes
(Modiri 2020):

    Struggles to overcome colonial power and violence; seeking fundamental change
    through dismantling white supremacy; critically interrogating, provincialising and
    de-privileging Western epistemologies and concepts; seeking out alternative
    and new African and Global South knowledges and ways of being; excavating
    lost and silenced histories and centring African culture and experience; exposing
    neocolonial continuities; refusing assimilation into alien and oppressive orders and
    reclaiming liberation, dignity and sovereignty - and more. (p. 156)

Taking Modiri's definition of decolonisation as a guide, there may be instances
where we specify our own definition of decolonisation that is more in line with
our disciplines. Thus, as a legal scholar, I must define law from a `non-colonial'
position whilst being cognisant of alternative legal epistemologies (Himonga &
Diallo 2017:5). When dealing with decolonisation, we must not fall into the
trap of creating a utopia out of pre-colonial Africa. It is evident that three
elements seemed to be essential for the decolonisation of law and legal
education. This pertains to the inclusion of living customary law within legal
education, shifting the theoretical paradigm through which law is taught, as
well as the study of law in an interdisciplinary manner (Himonga & Diallo 2017).
When looking to decolonise law, legal scholars usually prefer an approach
which neglects the role of student agency. Student agency is a prominent
feature of open pedagogy. The use of open pedagogy in conjunction with
OERs within legal education will broaden access to alternative methods of
knowledge creation and dissemination.

    Self-directed learning (SDL) (cf. Chapter 3) can be described as an
approach to learning through which learners would assume the responsibility
for their own learning and are then involved actively in their learning whilst
taking control of the learning process (Bosch, Mentz & Goede 2019:2). This
enables students to choose their learning strategies, resources and outcomes
to reach their desired learning goals (Bosch et al. 2019). A combination of the
self-directed approach to learning and decolonial practices has the potential
to deliver a transformed decolonised curriculum, especially in the South
African context.

    Although decolonisation will be discussed, this chapter does not intend to
be the sole authority on the subject, as there are many definitions of the term
and contentions about its effectiveness.

  What is epistemic injustice?

In recent years, the knowledge produced in South African universities has
been interrogated for its lack of representation of African and South African
thought. The argument is that African knowledge systems must be treated
fairly and thought of on the same footing as knowledge systems from the
global north. According to Byskov (2021), epistemic injustice is regarded as:

    [...] the idea that we can be unfairly discriminated against in our capacity as a
    knower based on prejudices about the speaker, such as gender, social background,
    ethnicity, race, sexuality, tone of voice, accent, and so on. (p. 117)

In seeking to clarify and apply it to practical cases, many writers have grappled
with the concept of epistemic injustice (Byskov 2021:117). However, these
writers have focused on making an epistemic injustice an injustice (Byskov
2021:117). Adding on to the two conditions that Fricker (2007:1) argues make
an epistemic injustice an injustice, Byskov (2021:117) argues that there are five
of these conditions.

    In this context, Fricker is of the opinion that two distinct forms of epistemic
injustice can be identified: testimonial injustice and hermeneutical injustice.
Testimonial injustice occurs when credibility is attributed to a statement based
on preconceptions about the person making the statement, such as gender,
ethnicity, race, social background, accent, etc. (Fricker 2007). Importantly,
hermeneutical injustice might result from testimonial injustice (Fricker 2007).
That is, when testimonial injustices have a structural impact on what is included
in a communal pool of knowledge, the marginalised individuals and groups'
experiences are underrepresented, impairing their ability to make sense of
their experiences (Table 10.1: Byskov 2021:118).

How open educational resources can assist in developing open legal pedagogies

According to Fricker (2007:162), being deprived of making sense of our own
experiences is an injustice.

    It is necessary to recognise the conditions for epistemic injustice because
the concept of epistemic injustice can explain some aspects of socio-economic
injustice. It is essential in our understanding of the design of public institutions,
such as universities, schools, courts and primary health care, amongst others.
Through identifying conditions for epistemic injustice, it would then be
possible to identify and evaluate claims of possible harm against knowledge
bearers, which could have been committed by individuals or institutions, and
also show how individuals and institutions can avoid producing epistemic
(dis)advantages and duplicating prevailing socio-economic inequalities
(Byskov 2021:118). Now that we know a little about epistemic injustice, we
move to how epistemic justice can be used as a tool for curriculum change.

   Epistemic justice as a tool for curriculum change

The #RhodesMustFall movement which was spun from the #FeesMustFall
movement has inspired debate around the content of the curriculum in South
African universities. At the time, students were dissatisfied with the promises
of post-1994 South Africa. They believed that higher education (HE) was
meant to be free and reflect the realities of everyday South Africans. Through
the movement, students and academics advocated for free and decolonised
higher education. To the leaders of the `#RhodesMustFall' movement,
decoloniality was the practice that would enable the South African university
to reflect a much clearer African reality as opposed to the Western ideas that
South African universities were promoting. Students were advocating for an
Afrocentric curriculum. According to Kessi (2017:506), `a decolonial stance
advocates for epistemic justice as foundational to the activities of higher
education'.

    It must be kept in mind that universities are centres of knowledge production
that inevitably shape the societies that we live in. Kessi (2017:507) argues that
epistemic justice develops through praxis; praxis in this context `is the interface
between theory and practice'. Through praxis, the university becomes a vital
instrument in the conception of a decolonised society where academics can
participate in the type of critical knowledge that is essential for achieving
social justice (Kessi 2017:507). From a communal perspective, praxis
encourages participation in research projects by those people who are outside
the academy, but are nevertheless, affected by the fact that the knowledge
that is produced does not engage with their lived experiences or contexts
(Kessi 2017:508).

    The historical context of South Africa remains important in our understanding
of epistemic injustice. This means that history inevitably informs our
approaches to epistemic justice and any methods used to dismantle the

stronghold of Western thought in South African curricula (Kessi 2017:509).
In our quest to enact social change, we should not neglect theory. Because
theory guides and legitimises social systems, `in order to dismantle the social
systems we live in, which are characterised by inequality and oppression, we
need to advance our theories' (Kessi 2017:509). These theories should develop
from the relationship between our lived experiences and knowledge
production. Those from marginalised communities can inform research that is
undertaken to better their and our social contexts. Thus, any discourse relating
to the decolonisation of universities is considered in relation to society's lived
realities as well as the different institutional contexts from which they might
emerge (Kessi 2017:509). By treating people as research subjects and valuing
their experiences as central to the process of knowledge production,
researchers can develop theories that combat epistemic injustice. It is
imperative that universities, as centres of knowledge production, become
vessels of social change to enable the realities that decolonial scholars posit
(Kessi 2017:509).

    South Africa's educational apartheid legacy continues to haunt. From an
educational perspective, it left us with different types of universities, which
could be historically labelled as white-English (or liberal), historically white-
Afrikaans, as well as historically black universities. Although the racial divisions
have disappeared, historically black universities continue to suffer from the
perception that because they serve majority black students, the quality of the
education they offer is of an inferior quality to that of the historically white
universities. The decolonial project then must focus on dismantling these
prejudices as they are mainly based on Western-oriented curricula.

    When a person is marginalised or excluded as a knowledge bearer, their
dignity is affected. To enable students to gain a sense of dignity in their
studies, Walker (2020) suggests that students should make epistemic
contributions to aid in their learning. These contributions must be in line with
the five-R (5R) permissions characteristic of OERs and will relate to the course
the student is currently studying. These contributions would then be licensed
with appropriate copyright licenses that would provide permission to anyone
to participate in the 5R activities, which include: retain, reuse, revise, remix, as
well as redistribute (cf. ch. 1). Being allowed to contribute to a shared common
resource has always been central to human well-being (Walker 2020:270).
Universities must allow students to be able to make these epistemic
contributions as this would not only enable students to take in information,
but to make interpretive contributions to the knowledge that currently exists.
This will enable the knowledge to have a deeper social character as it will
encompass the student's lived reality. Students must not be deprived of an
opportunity of being agents for epistemic change (Walker 2020:271).

    Although many socio-economic injustices continue to be felt by black
people, Walker (2020:274) cautions against essentialising race in our pursuits

                                                                                                                                          207
How open educational resources can assist in developing open legal pedagogies

for equality in South African universities. The diversity in South Africa, of
language, ethnicity, social class, and so on produces its own epistemic
marginalisations. Thus, a rural university would be dealt with differently from
those in urban areas as the realities at these universities may be sui generis
and require more than just a general solution to epistemic injustice.

    There can be no epistemic justice without changing the curriculum
(Walker 2019:2). According to Walker (2019:2), there are four core dimensions
of the curriculum `knowledge (what we know and understand); skills (how
we exercise that knowledge); character (how we behave and interact with
others); and meta-learning (how we reflect and adapt)'. Furthermore, `[a]
university should enable the education of students who have acquired the
Six C's: think critically, communicate clearly, use connectivity, develop
creativity, work collaboratively and embrace culture' (Tawana Kupe quoted
in Walker 2019:2).

    To fully utilise the four dimensions Walker mentions, we must develop
epistemic justice capabilities. Epistemic justice capabilities involve the
knowledge bearer receiving and giving knowledge, gaining recognition as a
capable contributor to the shared knowledge pool. This entails developing an
open framework like working with OERs and using decolonial practices to
inform curriculum design (Walker 2019). Thus, adapting the curriculum as an
enabler of epistemic contributions ensures that justice is done to each
knowledge bearer and group of those seeking education.

    A transformed curriculum practice begins with acknowledgement by
teachers that they, too, are responsible for perpetuating epistemic injustices.
This is because epistemic wrongs do not take place without perpetrators
(Walker 2019:9). Curricula must be grounded in an ecology of knowledge,
which will differ depending on the subject, but social justice remains
foundational in these ecologies (Walker 2019:9). In addition to building and
enabling a transformed curriculum, pedagogies must also construct
transformative knowledge (Walker 2019:9).

   Towards a decolonised curriculum: Thoughts and ideas
   for the enactment of change

Having dealt with why epistemic justice is an important element of justice,
and how injustice could adversely affect those who may be subject to it and
taking Walker's quote as a foundation: `to be marginalized or excluded as a
knower affects dignity' (Walker 2020:269), we will trace the role of student
movements in the curriculum transformation debate focusing on three
universities: the University of the Witwatersrand (Wits), Rhodes University
and the University of Cape town (UCT). The discussion then moves to how
decolonial practices can aid in transforming the law school, broadly and the
law curriculum, specifically.

   Tracing the role of student movements in
   influencing legal pedagogy

Although protests about the high cost of education had been happening prior,
2015 was the year they reached historically white universities. The University
of the Witwatersrand is where the #FeesMustFall began before morphing into
#RhodesMustFall (#RMF), which began a few months later at another
historically white university, UCT. The #FeesMustFall movement represented
the climax of years-long dissatisfaction with excessive HE tuition fees and
insufficient state funding of HE. The Fallists were of the idea that the time had
come to deal with the race-based inequality that is characteristic of the
universities in South Africa (Malabela 2020). As part of the structural changes,
the Fallists demanded the hiring of more black academics as well as a more
Afrocentric curriculum. As part of their transformation push, the Fallists
collaborated with outsourced workers so that they, too, could air out their
grievances and contribute to the vision of the new university that would
emerge after their transformation demands were met. This collaboration
emerged because of the alienation that was felt by black lecturers, students
and outsourced workers (Malabela 2020:105).

    The `cosmopolitan' vision of Wits that was promoted by the then-vice-
chancellor of the University of Wits, Adam Habib, was contested as being too
idealistic and unclear (Malabela 2020:103). To emphasise their stance, the
Fallists brought forth their own definition of decolonisation (Chinguno et al.
2017):

    The rejection of white supremacy and hetero-patriarchal order along with other
    forms of prejudice that characterise the colonial project, as well as the quest to
    redress the socio-economic, political, and spiritual depredations of colonial history.
    (p. 18)

Following a senate meeting where the Fallists' grievances were disregarded,
the leadership decided that protest was the only way to go. The protests
lead to the peaceful disruption of university activities. The university responded
with violence and portrayed the Fallist movement as irrational and un-South
African.

   Free decolonised education

The transition to a democratic South Africa is seen by some to have left a few
issues unresolved (Malabela 2020). The content of the post-1994 curriculum
was never discussed; this lacuna meant reinforcing Eurocentric ideas rather
than being characteristic of the African experience. To fight the feeling of
alienation felt by the African student, African ideas need to be central to their
education. Centring African thought does not mean disregarding other forms
of knowledge but placing African knowledge systems on the same footing as
those of the Global North. This then led to having an African university, instead

                                                                                                                                          209
How open educational resources can assist in developing open legal pedagogies

of having a university in Africa (Ndlovu-Gatsheni 2013:11). The renaming of the
Wits administrative building `Senate House' to `Solomon Mahlangu House'
was a start in remaking the university space to reflect a so-called South African
flavour. Symbolism does have its limits, as the case of the removal of the Cecil
John Rhodes statue at UCT illustrates.

    Writing on the impact of student protests from a Rhodes University
perspective, Knowles states one of the ways to understand the emergence of
these protests is through the lens of re-centring (Knowles 2020:119). This
means using an African theory `which deals with the question of African
identity from the perspective of African people as centred, located, oriented
and grounded' (Knowles 2020:119). Many thinkers gravitate towards re-
centring, but few provide actionable ways in which the concept can work
practically. This can be because the university's neoliberal agenda is difficult
to shake and the student leadership that leads these movements have now
become part of large political parties whose views themselves are neoliberal.

    Ndelu cautions South African universities against chasing world rankings
as this pushes these universities to be in Africa by geography only whilst they
are ideologically located in the west (Ndelu 2020). The pushback against this
strategy led to the #RMF movement at UCT. #RMF's initial concern was
lobbying for the indefinite removal of a bronze statue of colonial-era British
businessman and politician Cecil John Rhodes from the university's main
campus. Like the protests at other universities, the list of demands by #RMF
included decolonising curricula. Once Rhodes' statue was removed, the #RMF
directed their energies to `the invisible statutes' that still exist within UCT's
ideology (Ndelu 2020:139).

    To frame their demands, the #RMF insisted on using the term #RMF insisted
on the term `decolonisation' rather than `transformation'. #RMF clarified its
position by stating (Ndelu 2020):

    [W]e have begun to understand the need for a new language that challenges the
    pacifying logic of liberalism. This logic presents itself to us in these ideas of `reform'
    and `transformation', which are legitimised by the Constitution - a document
    which violently preserves the status quo. Transformation is the maintenance and
    perpetuation of oppression, hidden within meaningless surface-level change. We
    have recognised that what is needed instead is the radical decolonisation of this
    institution, which is necessarily linked to the black condition, both nationally and
    internationally. Our existence as black people is defined by a violent system of
    power. The university's processes and language naturalise that colonial system.
    Therefore, if we wish to get rid of that system of power, we have to destroy the
    processes altogether. Decolonisation is this very destruction. (p. 140)

The #RMF's insistence on a decolonised rather than transformed curriculum
stems from the desire to determine a future built on self-determination
and self-reliance whilst being able to remember the past and engage with
the present (Omarjee quoted by Ndelu 2020). According to #RMF, when

implementing their idea of a decolonised curriculum, the university must
(Ndelu 2020):

    Implement a curriculum which critically centres Africa and the subaltern. By this we
    mean treating African discourses as the point of departure - through addressing
    not only content but languages and methodologies of education and learning -
    and only examining Western traditions in so far as they are relevant to our own
    experience. (p. 140)

It can be said that to the #RMF, the implementation of decolonised curricula
varies from subject to subject. To counter the emphasis placed on the
commercialisation of education by universities like UCT, the #RMF demanded
the elevation of a Freirean pedagogy that is (Omarjee quoted by Ndelu 2020):

    [A] teaching culture that destabilises the power disparity between the educator
    and learner, as well as placing equal value on formal and informal curricula, which
    may or may not be shared within the classroom. (p. 144)

Inside the classroom, the #RMF advocated for a relook at the language of
instruction. A move towards multilingualism in a country with eleven official
languages would surely benefit students. The public discourse on
multilingualism in South African universities has almost been strangled by the
debate around the continued use of Afrikaans as a language of instruction at
historically Afrikaans universities. This debate exists in a clash between
acknowledging the benefits of having students being taught in their home
language and the constitutional obligations to reverse apartheid-era patterns
of racial discrimination (Ndelu 2020:145). Indeed, whilst Afrikaans as a
language is being `fought' for as a language of instruction, not many are calling
for the other official languages to be at the forefront of pedagogy at South
African universities. They see the achievement of multilingualism as impractical
and time-consuming. But as we see with the development of Afrikaans, using
a language other than English for academic purposes will take time, but it is
doable. Thus, we cannot be seen to have decolonised until English is displaced
as a language of instruction.

    To move UCT away from the ideas of a `market university' that is geared
towards serving corporate interests, the #RMF challenged the university to
introduce a decolonised research agenda (Ndelu 2020:148). This could be
achieved by providing funding to academics who have Africa as a research
focus and by re-evaluating the standards by which research areas are decided
(Ndelu 2020:148). The representation of black lecturers across faculties was
also addressed, as it is believed that being thin on black faculty or having
black faculty who are disillusioned and unmotivated has an adverse effect on
the educational outcomes for both black and white students (Ndelu 2020:150).
A lack of representation results in black students' sense of exclusion and
alienation being amplified, whilst white students are deprived of the richness
of diverse teaching staff (Ndelu 2020:163).

                                                                                                                                            211
How open educational resources can assist in developing open legal pedagogies

The Fallist movement was instrumental in the founding of the Curriculum
Change Working Group (CCWG) at UCT. The group was a multi-sectoral group
of experts commissioned by the vice-chancellor to engage with faculties,
departments, academics and students in order to `initiate deep curriculum
conversations in relation to the challenges of transformation, as well as
opportunities and debates that the call for decolonisation brought to the
university' (Ndelu 2020:151). The aim of the CCWG was to ensure that the
entire university was working together to decolonise the curriculum and
pedagogies rather than in `patchy' silos (Ndelu 2020:151). The Curriculum
Change Framework came out of the CCWG and brought with guidelines as to
what direction the university would take to meet the demands of the #RMF
regarding a decolonised curriculum (Ndelu 2020:151). The framework did omit
a few issues as it does not deal with (Ndelu 2020):

    (1) whether it would be binding on all faculties, departments, and academics; (2)
    how the university plans on monitoring and enforcing compliance; and (3) how
    a binding framework might impact on the principle of academic freedom, which
    the university so jealously guards. Already, there are signs of cleavages within the
    university. (p. 151)

The fact that this framework is also subject to the approval of the university's
statutory bodies like the senate, which may be resistant to the changes it
seeks to bring forth, does not bring hope as it may end up gathering dust and
thus lack legitimacy. In sum, the decolonisation of the curriculum needs
constant refinement as it is likely to take a long time to achieve.

   An academic's response to the Fallist movement

One of the criticisms of the Fallist movement was that its leaders were not
sufficiently literate in the relevant radical social theories they were purportedly
representing. As Modiri (2016) suggests, we should not be shocked at the gaps
in knowledge that are shown by students, as this illustrates the shoddy work
that some academics are doing at South African universities (Modiri 2016).
Instead of questioning the students about where they got their knowledge, we
should rather be questioning their lecturers about where they studied. We
should also be kind in our critiques of the Fallists because (Modiri 2016):

    It is unfair to expect students to perfectly grapple with a deep historical and social
    conundrum (how to repair the irreparable) and also to master the voluminous
    literatures, discourses and theories that have been produced in that effort. (p. xx)

The Fallists may not have prominence with fully formed ideologies, but they
were vigorous in their call for the transformation of the South African university.

  On the universities' future

Perhaps the biggest challenge for practitioners of the decolonial school is
the moving from theory to practice. For Modiri (2020:157), the disconnect

212
                                                                                                                                Chapter 10

between theory and actualising decolonisation may be widening because
of the trend of some academics using the call to transform curricula for
commercial purposes. By doing this, these academics perpetuate the
commodification of knowledge that is promoted by the university of today.
Inevitably, it is the student who bears the brunt of this approach which in
turn increases the alienation the student might feel when studying these
commercially focused theories (Modiri 2020:158). Leaders or lecturers of a
decolonised curriculum must not think and act like contemporary market
subjects. This is because they will not always be discussing capital or the
market in their work. Thus, we cannot decolonise through neoliberal praxis
(Modiri 2020:159).

    As a starting point to actualising decolonised curricula, the university `must
continually account for its deeply entrenched epistemic violence, Eurocentrism
and racism' (Modiri 2020:171). This can be done by reconfiguring the symbolism
that is synonymous with post-1994 South Africa. The university, then, must
not be exempt from historical responsibility and must reckon with its role in
the `economy of conquest' that has led to the status quo. The centring of
African knowledge in South African universities requires that academics are
retrained to enable them to research and instruct in the radical tradition that
a decolonised curriculum calls for. It is not only the academic facet of the
university that must change but also the administrative side to ensure effective
implementation (Modiri 2020:171).

    It may seem that resisting the commodification of the university is
unrealistic because of the fact that students must leave the university and
participate in the job market. However, this does not mean that students
need only to learn the tools of their trade. The goal is to make the student
a well-grounded member of society whilst ensuring that they will be
equipped for the job market. Ultimately, the aim is to decentralise the
university as the only site of knowledge production. The tension between
Western knowledge production and African knowledge production, where
the former relies primarily on text and the latter on orality, is proof that we
should not overemphasise the university's primacy and run the risk of
repeating the mistakes of the past (Modiri 2020). Decolonisation
necessitates multiple sites of knowledge.

    Looking outside the university can also assist in the decolonial project,
as introducing forms of knowledge that are grounded in resistance (as
opposed to those grounded in commerce) allows for greater self-
reflection. In our development of a decolonised open curriculum, we must
not read blindly but must remain critical of even the decolonial texts which
we seek to introduce in our studies. The diverse student body should
always remain at the back of our minds as we continuously shape and
reshape curricula.

                                                                                                                                           213
How open educational resources can assist in developing open legal pedagogies

  Self-directed learning as an enabler of
  epistemic justice

   Open educational resources as a tool for
   social justice

In our zeal for the use and development of an open decolonised curriculum,
we must ensure that we link the economic value gained using OERs with
pedagogical and cultural advances (cf. Chapter 2). Account must also be
taken of the structural inequalities that are present when implementing OERs.
According to Fraser, social justice is `parity of participation', it is both a result
where `all the relevant social actors participate as peers in social life' and a
process in which procedural standards are followed `in fair and open processes
of deliberation' (Fraser 2005:73). Conversely, both these conclusions and
practises can be regarded as being socially unjust in three manners, which
according to Fraser could be: `(1) economic maldistribution; (2) cultural
misrecognition; and (3) political misframing' (Fraser 2005:87).

    Economic maldistribution is where economic structures prevent some
people from economic participation by denying them access to resources
they might need to interact with their peers (Fraser 2005). The use of OERs
can be a means of economic redistribution as their use can lead to cost-
savings (Hodgkinson-Williams & Trotter 2018:207). Economic restructuring,
on the other hand, refers to a `transformative' shift that speaks to the `root
causes of the maldistribution', an example of OERs as a `transformative
remedy' would constitute a change in the way educational materials such as
textbooks are created and adapted, and how their production is funded, etc.
(Hodgkinson-Williams & Trotter 2018:207).

    Cultural misrecognition refers to a situation where `people are prevented
from interacting on terms of participatory parity by institutionalized hierarchies
of cultural value that deny them the requisite standing' (Fraser 2005:73). As a
result of the current domination of Western epistemologies, educators and
students in the Global South can be disadvantaged because of a lack of
representation (Hodgkinson-Williams & Trotter 2018). This cultural
misrecognition is opposed through the creation, localisation and redistribution
of OERs in the languages of the marginalised and from transformative
epistemic perspectives (Hodgkinson-Williams & Trotter 2018:219).

    Political misframing `tells us who is included in, and who is excluded from,
the circle of those entitled to a just distribution and reciprocal recognition'
(Fraser 2005:73). To deal with this division, underrepresented groups must
have opportunities to participate in decision-making. From an OER perspective,
this refers to granting relevant stakeholders the ability to decide on what is
important from an educational perspective in order to avoid becoming some
`objects of charity or benevolence' (Hodgkinson-Williams & Trotter 2018:208).

214
                                                                                                                                Chapter 10

From Fraser's formulation of justice, we gain insight into why a social justice
framework is important in the development of open pedagogy.

   Self-directed learning and decolonising legal
   education

There are various models for SDL. The approach used by Oswalt (2003) is one
we can adapt to the teaching of law. Oswalt (2003) divides SDL concepts into
three major groups: the learning situation, the different components of
learning and the attributes of students.

    The learning situation relates to opportunity, support and collaboration
and specifically refers to the `extent to which the facilitator is dedicated to
nurturing SDL in the learning situation' (Bosch et al. 2019:11). To promote the
tenets of SDL, the facilitator must provide students with the opportunity and
support to direct their own learning. Support involves the provision of
expertise, guidance and materials for the learning situation by the facilitator.
Collaboration is also important to the learning situation because peer-to-peer
networks can potentially encourage SDL in formal or non-formal learning
situations (Bosch et al. 2019).

    Components of learning refer to cognitive, motivational and contextual
factors of learning (Bosch et al. 2019:17). Cognitive factors of learning include
`critical self-reflection on both the individual's learning process and the
knowledge and skill the student is attempting to master'. Motivational factors
incorporate both self-efficacy as well as volition. Self-efficacy refers to the
student's self-assurance (or lack thereof) in their ability to succeed or fail,
whilst volition relates to a student's ability to commit to tasks regardless of
external factors that compete for their attention. Moreover, contextual factors
relate to peers, resources, and other external factors in the learning environment
over which there may be no control (Bosch et al. 2019:17). Students have to
take responsibility for all these factors mentioned here in order to be regarded
as effective self-directed students (Bosch et al. 2019:17).

    The learning attributes incorporate content skill, SDL skill and some
willingness to direct their own learning. The skill level of students within a
content area has a direct impact on direction within that specific area. They
might also be more willing to assume responsibility for their learning if they
have developed a sufficient understanding of the basic concepts or mastered
the basic skills beforehand (Oswalt 2003).

    Like in all aspects of learning, the teacher's role is essential to the success
of an SDL approach. Students should be allowed more control over their
learning situations by intermittently providing them assistance in locating
resources or mastering alternative learning strategies. This allows students to
gain more practice at being agents in their learning (Bosch et al. 2019:19).

                                                                                                                                           215
How open educational resources can assist in developing open legal pedagogies

Certain teaching methods can be used in partnership with SDL (Bosch et al.
2019:19). Problem-based learning (PBL) is of interest to legal educators.
Problem-based learning is a teaching method in which students are taught
concepts and principles using challenging real-world issues rather than the
direct presentation of facts and concepts (Bosch et al. 2019:26). Problem-
based learning is a successful teaching method for encouraging student
autonomy, and it is impossible to use without SDL. The components of SDL
that problem-based learning shares are (Bosch et al. 2019):

    (1) reviewing the scenario and generating hypotheses, (2) identifying their learning
    issues, (3) confirming the resources they will access, (4) performing their own
    information seeking and (5) applying their new learning and reflecting on the
    content and process of learning. (p. 26)

From a content perspective, decolonisation assists the self-directed approach
by drawing from both traditional aspects of learning as well as alternative
methods that are championed by African knowledge systems. It is my view
that a link between the Fallist movement's call for a decolonised curriculum
and SDL exists. Because students have previously shown their willingness to
participate in their learning, and it is up to the educators to allow this to take
place meaningfully.

  Conclusion

Legal pedagogy is still stuck in traditional law teaching methods, like the case
law method and the Socratic method (Quinot 2012:411). Even with the use of
the problem-based method, the emphasis is placed on the learner reading
large amounts of text and regurgitating the content when it comes time for
exams (Bajpai & Kapoor 2019:95). The learning materials used for studies are
still statutes and casebooks that reflect current law. Legal scholars generally
do not engage with open pedagogy, although they do look at OERs and the
impact that intellectual property law has on open licensing.

    Though the term `open legal pedagogy' does not exist in a formal sense,
we can define it using Wiley and Hilton's (2018:133) definition of OER-enabled
pedagogy. According to Wiley and Hilton (2018):

    OER-enabled pedagogy can be defined as the set of teaching and learning practices
    that are only possible or practical in the context of the 5R permissions that are
    characteristic of OER. (p. 133)

In addition to what Wiley and Hilton (2018) envisage, open legal pedagogy
would incorporate the principles brought forth by SDL and the ideas of
decolonisation. The content used in open legal pedagogy would be guided by
the 5R activities (Wiley & Hilton 2018:135):

·· Retain - `the right to make, own and control copies of the content (e.g.
    download, duplicate, store and manage)'

216
                                                                                                                                Chapter 10

·· Reuse - `the right to use the content in a wide range of ways (e.g. in a class,
    in a study group, on a website and in a video)'

·· Revise - `the right to adapt, adjust, modify or alter the content itself
    (e.g. translate the content into another language)'

·· Remix - `the right to combine the original or revised content with other
    material to create something new (e.g. incorporate the content into a
    mashup)'

·· Redistribute - `the right to share copies of the original content, your
    revisions or your remixes with others (e.g. give a copy of the content to a
    friend)'.

OERs are generated by the students themselves (Wiley & Hilton 2018:135).
The use of the OERs by students requires them to be self-directed (Olivier
2019:168). In my view, the link between student protests and SDL can be drawn
when we look at the call for a decolonised curriculum in Free decolonised
education section and students' interest of being involved in their learning.
The protests were to have the effect that a curriculum more reflective of
students' views was to be drawn up post the protests. It is proposed that open
legal pedagogy will be an enabler of this decolonised curriculum, where OERs
will be used as learning materials in line with 5R activities.

                                                                                                                                           217

There is palpable urgency for South African higher education institutions (HEIs) to consider
blended and embedded learning strategies and offer teaching and learning resources to
equip students to take charge of their learning. In this light, this book goes a long way to
answering pertinent questions about how students can nurture self-directed learning with
support in the post-COVID-19 sphere, what roles open-learning resources and practice play in
enhancing students' self-directed learning, and lastly, how the use of open-learning resources
may be maximised in a South African higher education institution.

    This book tackles the issues of systematic reviews and empirical case studies and weaves
them together uniquely to create a practical and suited product for the South African higher
education context. Throughout this book, the authors present compelling arguments for the
adoption of open-education practices and demonstrate their use in different disciplines within
one institution of higher learning. It is a must-have for scholars interested in creating activities
to boost their students' self-directed learning competencies.

This book consists of a range of scholarly contributions which provide insightful elucidation
into the nexus of open-educational resources, student agency and self-directed learning. In
response to the need to embrace socially just pedagogy, the book highlights the profound
implications of the nexus of open-educational resources, student agency and self-directed
learning for praxis. It represents a timely and strategic intervention that can guide the
decolonisation project through the contextualisation of open-learning practices predicated on
the nexus of open-educational resources, student agency and coherent implementation of
self-directed learning.
