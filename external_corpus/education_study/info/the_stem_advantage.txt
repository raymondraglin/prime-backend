ACKNOWLEDGEMENT OF COUNTRY

At James Cook University we acknowledge with respect the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples
as the first peoples, educators and innovators of this country. We acknowledge that Country was never
ceded, and value the accumulation of knowledge and traditions that reflect the wisdom of ancestral lines
going back some 60,000 years, and recognise the significance of this in the ways that Aboriginal and Torres
Strait Islander peoples are custodians of Country. As a University, we will continue to learn ways to care for
and be responsible for Country, and we will collectively seek to build a future that is based on truth-telling,
mutual understanding, hope, empowerment, and self-determination.

ABOUT THIS BOOK

This book serves as your practical guide to navigating workplace experiences during your internship and
early career. Written specifically for students transitioning from university studies into professional
practice, it provides evidence-based strategies and actionable frameworks to help you develop essential
workplace capabilities.

The content draws from extensive research into intern experiences and organisational psychology,
combined with real-world examples that illustrate how to apply theoretical concepts in practice. Each
chapter builds your professional knowledge systematically, moving from foundational skills like resume
development through to advanced capabilities like managing artificial intelligence tools in the workplace.

Throughout the book, you'll find activities designed to help you reflect on your experiences and develop
practical approaches to common workplace challenges. These activities encourage you to think critically
about your professional development while building tangible skills you can apply immediately in your
internship.

The book maintains a strong focus on supporting linguistically diverse students entering Australian
workplaces. You'll find clear explanations of workplace communication norms, cultural expectations, and
professional practices that might differ from your previous experiences.

While aimed primarily at students undertaking workplace learning experiences as part of their degree
requirements, this book also serves as a valuable resource for anyone beginning their professional journey
in Australian workplaces. The frameworks and strategies provided will help you build positive workplace
relationships, navigate organisational cultures, and develop the professional capabilities needed for career
success.

Each chapter includes specific learning objectives, practical activities, and key takeaways that reinforce
important concepts. The book's structure allows you to either work through it sequentially or focus on
particular topics relevant to your current workplace challenges. Remember to engage actively with the
reflection activities and practical exercises. Your professional development benefits most when you apply
these concepts thoughtfully to your own experiences.

AI was used in the development of this book. I have taken a `centaur' approach (see Chapter 6), and
engaged with Claude.ai to break any writer's blocks and then rewritten the text in my own words.

1 | INTRODUCTION

INTRODUCTION

Transitioning from university studies into professional practice represents one of the most significant shifts
in your career journey. While your academic studies have equipped you with essential technical knowledge,
succeeding in the workplace requires developing a broader set of professional capabilities. I've designed this
book to serve as your guide through this crucial transition, helping you navigate workplace relationships,
understand organisational cultures, and build the professional skills needed for career success.

Your internship experience offers a unique opportunity to develop these workplace capabilities in a
supported environment. Rather than expecting you to figure everything out through trial and error, I
have given some evidence-based frameworks and practical strategies you can apply immediately in your
professional role. The content draws from extensive research into successful internship experiences,
incorporating insights from career development, organisational psychology, professional communication
studies, and workplace learning theory.

Throughout this book, you'll find practical activities designed to help you reflect on your experiences and
develop tangible workplace skills. These activities encourage you to think critically about your professional
development while building capabilities you can demonstrate to future employers. Each chapter includes
specific learning objectives that clearly outline what you'll learn, followed by detailed explanations, real-
world examples, and opportunities to practice these skills.

I've written this book with particular attention to supporting students from diverse linguistic and cultural
backgrounds entering Australian workplaces. You'll find clear explanations of workplace communication
norms, cultural expectations, and professional practices that might differ from your previous experiences.
Regular reflection points help you connect concepts to your own cultural background and professional
aspirations.

The book's structure follows the typical internship journey, beginning with securing your placement and
moving through to successfully transitioning into your early career. Early chapters focus on foundational
skills like developing your resume and preparing for interviews. Middle chapters address key workplace
capabilities such as building professional relationships, managing artificial intelligence tools, and
developing emotional intelligence. Later chapters help you document your achievements and plan your
next career steps.

While I designed this book primarily for students undertaking formal workplace learning experiences, it
serves as a valuable resource for anyone beginning their professional journey in Australian workplaces.
Whether you're starting an internship, entering graduate employment, or transitioning between careers,
the frameworks and strategies provided here will help you develop the professional capabilities needed for
workplace success.

I encourage you to engage actively with the reflection activities and practical exercises throughout this
book. Your professional development benefits most when you thoughtfully apply these concepts to your
own experiences. Remember that building professional capabilities takes time and practice, use this book
as an ongoing reference as you navigate your internship and early career journey.

I have drawn inspiration from the experiences of hundreds of students I've supported through their
internships over the past fifteen years. The stories you'll find in these pages come from real situations
that students have encountered during their placements, though I've changed names, settings, and specific
details, these experiences range from triumphs to challenges, from moments of insight to difficult lessons
learned. Through these stories, you'll see how other students have navigated similar situations to those you
might face during your own internship journey.

As you read the stories and examples, you might recognise situations similar to your own experiences.
Each story has been carefully chosen to illustrate important principles of professional development and
workplace success. The students whose experiences inspired these stories faced many of the same challenges
you might encounter, from navigating cultural differences to building professional relationships to
managing difficult workplace situations. Their journeys, though anonymised, offer valuable insights into
how to approach your own professional development.

Welcome to this important step in your professional development. Let's begin building the capabilities that
will support your career success.

1. GETTING THE INTERNSHIP

     Learning Objectives

     In this chapter, you will learn how to:
           develop a comprehensive professional portfolio, including your resume, LinkedIn profile,
             and introduction email that aligns with your career goals and aspirations
           create and execute a strategic plan for securing your internship, incorporating effective
             job search techniques and professional networking strategies.

     Imagine this Scenario

     You sit down at your desk, open your laptop, and type "internships near me" into Google. The
     search returns thousands of results. Your heart races a little faster. Where do you even begin?
     The internship unit seemed like such a good idea when you enrolled, but now the reality of
     finding a placement is setting in.
     You start methodically, creating a spreadsheet of potential companies. But after an hour of
     searching, you've only found three that seem promising. Anxiety creeps in. What if you can't
     find anything? What if no one responds?
     The methodical approach quickly unravels. You begin opening tab after tab of company
     websites, firing off emails to anyone with a listed contact address. Marketing firms, design
     studios, advertising agencies, at this point, you're casting the widest net possible. Your emails
     become increasingly desperate, less tailored to each company.
     Then you remember someone mentioning ChatGPT. Just to save time, you think, you ask it to
     draft a template email. You quickly modify it slightly and send it to thirty different companies in
     rapid succession.
                                                                                                                    1. GETTING THE INTERNSHIP | 4

     It's only when you're reviewing your sent folder that your stomach drops. There it is, in the last
     line of every single email: "Feel free to use this template to inquire about internship
     opportunities at other companies." Your face burns hot with embarrassment as you realise
     you've just revealed to every potential employer that you're sending out mass-produced, AI-
     generated emails. You slump in your chair, wondering how you're going to fix this mess.
     Does this sound familiar? Or perhaps you're worried about ending up in a similar situation?
     Don't worry, we've got you covered. In this chapter, we'll show you how to approach your
     internship search strategically and professionally, helping you avoid the common pitfalls that
     many students

From the Beginning...

Your resume serves as the cornerstone of your internship search and future career journey. Whether it's
called a curriculum vitae (CV), profile, or resume, this document is your primary professional marketing
tool. Throughout this book, we'll refer to it as a resume for consistency.
Think of your resume as a living document that grows and evolves alongside your professional
development. As you gain new experiences, develop new skills, and achieve new accomplishments, your
resume should reflect these changes. It's not something you create once and file away, it's a dynamic record
of your professional journey.
When employers receive your application, your resume is typically the first document they review, even
before reading your cover letter. This makes it your crucial first impression and your opportunity to
showcase your potential value to the organisation. A well-crafted resume can open doors to interviews and
opportunities, while a poorly constructed one might close them before you've had a chance to demonstrate
your capabilities.
A strong resume combines several key elements: clear structure, relevant content, professional
5 | 1. GETTING THE INTERNSHIP

presentation, and evidence of your achievements. Each component, from your educational background
to your work experience, from your technical skills to your extracurricular activities, plays a vital role
in painting a comprehensive picture of your professional potential. When these elements work together
effectively, your resume becomes a powerful tool for opening doors to professional opportunities.

Breaking Down Misconceptions

When creating your resume, you'll likely encounter various "rules" that may limit your ability to showcase
your potential effectively. Let's examine some common misconceptions about resumes.

                   An interactive H5P element has been excluded from this version of the text. You can view it
                   online here:
        https://jcu.pressbooks.pub/stem-advantage/?p=305#h5p-22

Rather than focusing on rigid rules, your energy is better spent on developing the key elements that
make a resume truly effective. What matters most is creating a clear structure, including relevant content,
maintaining a professional presentation, and providing evidence of your achievements. These components,
from showcasing your educational journey to highlighting your work experiences, from demonstrating
your technical capabilities to featuring your extracurricular involvement, work together to present a
comprehensive picture of your professional potential. When thoughtfully crafted, these elements combine
to create a powerful tool that opens doors to professional opportunities.

What Makes an Effective Resume?

The JCU Careers and Employability team offers sample graduate resumes for different study areas. These
examples help students and recent graduates create strong job applications. By looking at the sample
                                                                                                                   1. GETTING THE INTERNSHIP | 6

resumes for Engineering, Environmental Science, Information Technology, Marine Science and Science,
we can see what makes a resume effective.

All examples use clear, simple formatting that works well with employer application systems. They avoid
complex tables, fancy fonts or graphics that might cause problems. Each resume starts with professional
contact details: name, city/state location, professional email and LinkedIn profile.

Education appears near the start of each resume, which works well for recent graduates. Each one shows
academic achievements clearly, including course projects and strong results. When a student has a high
GPA (above 6.0 out of 7.0), they include this information. Putting education early helps show core
qualifications straight away.

All samples present practical experience well, whether from work placements, internships or part-time
work. They use strong action words and clear examples rather than vague descriptions. The examples also
show how to present useful skills from casual jobs, like showing how your customer service work built
communication skills.

Professional development and technical skills sections match each field of study. The IT resume focuses on
technical skills, while Environmental and Marine Science resumes highlight fieldwork and research abilities.
All include relevant training and professional memberships.

The resumes also include community work and volunteering that relates to their career goals. This shows
initiative beyond university requirements. Lastly, all resumes end with professional references from
academics and industry contacts, rather than personal references.

Getting Feedback on Your Resume

It is always beneficial to have someone else review your resume before submitting it to potential employers.
A fresh set of eyes can catch errors you may have missed and provide valuable suggestions for improvement.
Making an appointment with a Career Development Professional is highly recommended, as they can offer
expert guidance tailored to your field and career goals. Most universities, including JCU, have dedicated
careers services where you can connect with qualified professionals who understand both academic and
industry requirements.
7 | 1. GETTING THE INTERNSHIP

While there is no substitute for personalised feedback from a trained professional, JCU students also
have access to ResumeAI through the Big Interview platform. This AI-powered tool can provide quick,
actionable feedback on your resume's content, format, and overall presentation. ResumeAI analyses your
resume against industry standards and offers specific suggestions for enhancement. Though it should not
replace consultation with a Career Development Professional, it serves as a useful preliminary review tool
that you can access at any time during your resume development process.

     Activity 1.1: Creating a Resume

     JCU provides editable resume templates that you can access through the JCU Careers page.
     These templates offer different layouts while ensuring you include all essential information. You
     can download the template that best suits your needs and follow these steps to complete it:

           Download your preferred template from the JCU Careers Page.
           Open the template in Microsoft Word.

                          An interactive H5P element has been excluded from this version of the text. You can view it
                          online here:
              https://jcu.pressbooks.pub/stem-advantage/?p=305#h5p-20

     Take it a step further
                                                                                                                   1. GETTING THE INTERNSHIP | 8

     While these templates provide a solid foundation for your resume, getting professional
     feedback can make a significant difference in your job search success. Here's how you can take
     your resume to the next level:

              https://jcu.pressbooks.pub/stem-advantage/?p=305#h5p-21

     Remember

             Career Development Professionals work with resumes every day and understand what
             employers are looking for. Their expertise can help you present your experiences and skills in
             the most compelling way possible.

The Interview

Interview preparation is essential for making a strong impression on potential employers. Taking time
to research, practice, and prepare helps build your confidence and demonstrates professionalism to
interviewers. Before any interview, thoroughly research the organisation, understand the role requirements,
and practice your responses to common questions.
Interviews can feel like daunting experiences, with anxiety often building in the days leading up to them.
Your heart might race, your palms might sweat, and you might worry about forgetting everything you
wanted to say. These feelings are entirely normal, even the most seasoned professionals experience interview
nerves. However, it's worth remembering that an interview is fundamentally a professional conversation,
an opportunity to meet someone who could become an important mentor or connection in your career
journey. Rather than viewing your interviewer as an adversary, consider them a potential ally in your
professional development. They're not there to catch you out but to discover if there's a mutual fit
between you and their organisation. With thorough preparation, including researching the company,
practising your responses, and planning thoughtful questions, you can transform nervous energy into
genuine enthusiasm. This preparation helps shift your mindset from seeing the interview as an
interrogation to viewing it as your first professional conversation with someone who could become a
valuable part of your career network.
9 | 1. GETTING THE INTERNSHIP

Useful Resource: The Big Interview

JCU provides all students with free access to Big Interview, an online platform designed to help you master
interview techniques and build confidence. This comprehensive resource offers virtual mock interviews
across 20+ industries, thousands of practice questions with expert tips, and the ability to record and
share your responses for feedback. You can access Big Interview using your JCU email address to begin
strengthening your interview skills today.

When asked to "Tell us about yourself", consider this your opportunity to create a compelling narrative
that leads to your interest in this internship. Start by explaining what attracted you to this specific role
and company, then connect this to your current career aspirations. From there, work backwards to discuss
how your degree, major, and relevant coursework have prepared you for this opportunity. Include examples
from your part-time work, volunteering, or university projects that demonstrate relevant skills and
experiences. This approach helps the interviewer immediately understand your motivation and see the
logical progression of your journey towards their organisation.

Interviewers asking, "Why do you want to intern here?" are looking for evidence that you've done your
homework and have a genuine interest in their organisation. Before your interview, thoroughly research the
company's website, social media presence, and recent news. Make specific notes about projects, initiatives,
or achievements that genuinely excite you. Pay particular attention to the company's stated values and
culture. How do these align with your own principles? Reference their industry reputation and market
position, showing you understand their standing in the sector. Then, connect these observations directly
to your studies and career aspirations. For example, if the company emphasises innovation and you're
studying engineering, discuss how their cutting-edge projects would help you apply your theoretical
knowledge in real-world situations. This comprehensive approach demonstrates both your research effort
and your ability to see yourself contributing to their organisation.
                                                                                                                  1. GETTING THE INTERNSHIP | 10

When discussing what you want to learn during the internship, present a balanced view of both
professional growth and organisational contribution. Express your enthusiasm for experiencing teamwork
in a professional Australian workplace setting. This is particularly valuable as it differs significantly from
university group work. Emphasise your desire to gain industry-specific knowledge while contributing
meaningfully to team projects and organisational goals. Share your interest in developing essential
workplace capabilities such as professional communication, project management, and cross-functional
collaboration. Importantly, highlight how this internship would provide you with relevant experience in
an Australian business context, helping you understand workplace culture and professional expectations.
Show genuine excitement about the opportunity to both learn from experienced professionals and
contribute fresh perspectives to their teams. This demonstrates that you see the internship as a two-way
relationship where both you and the organisation can benefit from the experience.

When discussing technical skills, maintain honest transparency while showcasing your experience through
specific examples. Rather than simply listing software packages you've used, share brief stories about how
you've applied these tools in real situations. For instance, instead of just mentioning Excel proficiency,
describe how you used it to analyse data for a university project, creating pivot tables to identify key
trends. When discussing design software, reference specific assignments where you've applied these skills to
solve problems. Remember to describe your experience level accurately while highlighting your continuing
efforts to develop your technical capabilities.

If the interviewer asks about software packages you haven't used, don't let this shake your confidence.
Instead, emphasise your adaptability and enthusiasm for learning new technologies. You might say,

              While I haven't used that specific software, I've demonstrated my ability to quickly master
              new tools throughout my studies. For example, I learned AutoCAD in just two weeks to
              complete a major project. I'm confident I can apply this same dedicated learning approach to
              any new systems I need to use in this role.

Effective preparation extends beyond practising your responses: it includes preparing thoughtful questions
that help you evaluate if this organisation aligns with your career goals. Remember, an interview is a two-
way conversation; while the company assesses your fit, you should also determine if the workplace culture
and opportunities match your aspirations. Prepare questions that demonstrate your genuine interest while
gathering valuable insights. Consider questions such as:

   What makes this a great place to work?
   How do you support professional development in this organisation?
   How would my supervisor describe their management style?
   What makes someone successful in this role?
11 | 1. GETTING THE INTERNSHIP

Beyond these questions, thoroughly research the organisation's website and recent news, review the
internship description multiple times, and plan appropriate professional attire. Arrange to arrive early and
bring spare copies of your resume and a notepad for notes.

Your internship search is a significant step in your professional journey. By taking a strategic approach
to developing your resume, seeking feedback from Career Development Professionals, and preparing
thoroughly for interviews, you position yourself for success. Remember that both your resume and
interview preparation are ongoing processes and they require regular updates and refinement as you gain
new experiences and skills. The resources available through JCU, including resume templates, Career
Development Professionals, and the Big Interview platform, are valuable tools to support your professional
development journey.

Most importantly, approach your internship search with authenticity and professionalism. While it might
feel daunting at first, remember that employers are looking for enthusiastic learners who can contribute
fresh perspectives to their organisations. By presenting yourself professionally through a well-crafted
resume and demonstrating genuine interest and preparation during interviews, you create meaningful
opportunities for your future career development. The skills you develop during this process, from crafting
compelling professional documents to engaging in professional conversations, will serve you well
throughout your career.

     Learning Objectives

     In this chapter, you will learn how to:
           adapt to different internship environments and expectations across various STEM
             settings
           navigate workplace relationships and responsibilities to create a positive internship
             experience
           apply workplace health and safety principles to ensure a secure and enriching internship
             environment.

     Imagine this Scenario

     Your alarm blares at 06:00. You've barely slept, anxious about your first day at the
     environmental engineering firm where you'll complete your internship. After a quick shower,
     you put on the professional outfit you carefully selected last night. Everything feels stiff and
     formal compared to your usual university attire.
     Standing in front of the mirror, you triple-check your appearance while mechanically brushing
     your teeth. Your stomach churns too much for breakfast, but you force down some toast,
     remembering all those times your mother insisted it was the most important meal of the day.
     Google Maps suggests your journey should take 45 minutes. You decide to catch the 07:30 bus,
     giving yourself plenty of time to arrive before your 09:00 start. But as you step outside, you
     realise you forgot to account for the morning rain. The bus is running late.
     Finally arriving at what you think is the correct building, you check your phone: 08:45. Plenty of
     time, you assure yourself. The lobby directory lists dozens of research centres and departments,
                                                                                                                 2. STARTING THE INTERNSHIP | 14

     but you can't find the one you're looking for. You try calling your supervisor's number, but it
     goes straight to voicemail. Your hands begin to shake as you watch the minutes tick by.
     At 09:15, your phone rings. It's the internship coordinator from the university. Your supervisor
     contacted them, wondering if you're okay. You were supposed to meet them in the Science
     Building, not the Engineering Building where you're currently standing. You have 5 minutes to
     get to the correct location, or they'll need to cancel your internship.

     As you sprint across the campus, your professional shoes pinching with every step, you can't
     help but wonder: Could this chaos have been avoided? What if you had done a practice run to
     the office earlier in the week? What if you had asked for more specific directions about where
     to meet? What if you had arrived even earlier to account for potential confusion?
     Your heart races as you realise that thorough preparation might have prevented this stressful
     situation entirely.

What Is Expected of You

Preparation is essential for making a strong first impression and starting your internship smoothly. The
story above demonstrates how easily things can go wrong without proper planning. Here's how to ensure
your first day, and every day after, runs smoothly.

Making Initial Contact

Before your first day, speak directly with your supervisor over the phone to confirm the details of your
arrival. Important questions to ask include:

   the exact building and room/office location
   the best entrance to use
15 | 2. STARTING THE INTERNSHIP

   where to park (if driving) or which campus entrance is closest
   what time they expect you
   whether you need to bring any specific documents or equipment.
Always follow up this conversation with a brief email to confirm the details. This gives both you and your
supervisor a written record to refer to.
Remember our opening story? If they had made this initial contact, they would have known exactly which
building to go to and wouldn't have spent precious time searching the wrong location. A simple phone call
and follow-up email could have prevented their stressful sprint across campus.

Planning Your Journey

Transport planning is crucial for professional punctuality. Here are some key strategies:
   use at least two different transport apps to cross-check your travel time
   for public transport, check both the transport company's official app and an alternative like Google
      Maps
   allow extra time for unexpected delays, especially during peak hours or wet weather
   consider doing a practice run a few days before, at the same time you'll be travelling for your
      internship.

This careful planning is particularly important in major cities like Brisbane, Sydney, and Melbourne, where
transport disruptions are common. A single broken-down train can cause ripple effects across the entire
network, while a minor traffic accident can turn a 30-minute drive into a 90-minute ordeal. Even seemingly
small events like sports matches or concerts can significantly impact your journey time. Building in this
                                                                                                                2. STARTING THE INTERNSHIP | 16

buffer time might mean arriving a bit early occasionally, but it's far better than being late and appearing
unprofessional.
Remember to check for planned disruptions too. Major cities often schedule infrastructure maintenance
that can affect both public transport and road networks. Transport authorities usually announce these
changes in advance through their apps and websites, so checking these the night before your internship can
help you plan alternative routes if needed.

Timing Your Arrival

Professional workplaces have different expectations than university classes. Aim to arrive:
   5-10 minutes before your agreed start time
   not too early (more than 15 minutes) unless specifically arranged
   never late, this creates a poor first impression and can impact the whole team's schedule.

Unlike university, where you can quietly slip into the back of a lecture theatre, your supervisor and
colleagues may have scheduled their day around your arrival. They might have planned team meetings,
site visits, or training sessions that require your presence at specific times. Arriving too early can be just
as disruptive as being late. Your supervisor might be in another meeting or preparing for your arrival, and
having you wait in their office or workspace for an extended period could be uncomfortable for everyone.
The ideal 5-10 minute window allows you to:

   find your way to the correct location
   take a moment to compose yourself
   use the bathroom if needed
   review any materials you've brought
   appear eager but not overly anxious.
If you do find yourself running late due to circumstances beyond your control, contact your supervisor as
17 | 2. STARTING THE INTERNSHIP

soon as possible. A brief message explaining the situation and your estimated arrival time shows respect for
their time and demonstrates professional communication skills.

Understanding Expectations and Building
Proactive Career Behaviours

Your internship provides a unique opportunity to demonstrate your professional capabilities and learn
from experienced practitioners. Research shows that successful internships are characterised by two-way
dialogue between interns and supervisors, not just one-way instruction (Okolie et al., 2023). This
collaborative approach is especially prevalent in Australian workplaces.

From your first day, take the initiative to understand what is required of you and actively engage in
proactive career behaviours. Crockett and Preston (2004) emphasise that workplace participation and
engagement lead to better professional outcomes, particularly when employees demonstrate initiative
in their career development. Australian workplaces generally foster an egalitarian culture, where open
communication across all organisational levels is encouraged and valued. This means that thoughtful
questions and requests for clarification, even from senior staff members, are usually welcome. Ask for
clarification when tasks aren't clear. Don't hesitate to:

   ask for clarification when tasks aren't clear
   seek confirmation that you're on the right track
   request feedback on your work
   double-check deadlines and deliverables.

While hierarchies exist in Australian workplaces, the culture tends to be less formal than in many other
countries. Quality supervisor support during work placements is essential for enhancing students' career
interests and actions (Okolie et al., 2023). You might notice that managers and senior staff are often
addressed by their first names, and most encourage direct communication. This approachable atmosphere
means you shouldn't feel intimidated about:

   asking questions during team meetings
   seeking guidance from your supervisor
   requesting help when you need it
   sharing your ideas or concerns.
                                                                                                          2. STARTING THE INTERNSHIP | 18

Remember

  Your supervisor would rather answer questions early in a project than discover
  misunderstandings later. While it might feel uncomfortable at first, especially if you're from
  a culture with more formal workplace hierarchies, asking thoughtful questions
  demonstrates your engagement and desire to get things right. In fact, many Australian
  supervisors view the ability to ask appropriate questions as a sign of professional maturity
  and good judgment.

Case Study: A Matter of Professional Integrity

Marina Taylor was completing her environmental science placement as part of her Master's
degree with a regional council in the Northern Territory. Her role involved reviewing
environmental impact assessments for coastal developments, working under the supervision of
Dr Alan Chen and Environmental Director Sarah Thompson.
During her analysis of flora data for a significant beachfront development, Marina noticed an
unusual entry. The report identified a specimen as Quercus suber (Cork Oak), a Mediterranean
species she was familiar with from her home country. Having grown up in Greece and
completed her undergraduate degree there before moving to Australia for her Master's studies,
she knew this species could not possibly survive in the Northern Australian tropical climate.
Intrigued by this discrepancy, Marina conducted a site visit. Upon inspection, she discovered
that the tree in question was not a Cork Oak at all but rather appeared to be a protected native
species. If her identification was correct, this would have significant implications as the
development would either need to be cancelled or undergo substantial modifications costing
hundreds of thousands of dollars. It would also reveal a significant oversight in her supervisor's
original assessment.
Marina now faced a complex professional dilemma. Should she report her findings, and let her
supervisor know, or assume that her supervisor is correct and allow for a protected tree to be
cut down?
19 | 2. STARTING THE INTERNSHIP

     Activity 2.1: Difficult Conversations at Work

     Applying the research from Okolie et al. (2023) about work placement supervisor support,
     discuss how this situation challenges the typical supervisor-intern relationship. What factors
     should Marina consider when deciding how to proceed?
     Marina has discovered a significant error that could have major environmental and financial
     implications. Drawing on your understanding of professional integrity and workplace
     communication in Australian contexts:

           What are the potential consequences of each course of action available to Marina?
           How might different approaches to raising this issue affect her professional

             relationships?
           What documentation or evidence should she gather before proceeding?
     Consider the power dynamics at play in this situation. How might Marina's status as an
     international student and intern influence:

           Her approach to addressing this issue?
           How might her concerns be received?
           The level of confidence she needs to demonstrate when presenting her findings?
           What additional steps might she need to take to ensure her concerns are taken seriously?
     Role-play activity:
     Working in pairs, enact a professional conversation between Marina and Dr Chen about her
     findings.
     One person will play Marina, who needs to:

           present her concerns clearly and professionally
           demonstrate respect for her supervisor's position while standing firm on her findings
           navigate potential defensive responses.
     The other person will play Dr Chen, who might:

           feel threatened by the discovery of this error
           be concerned about their professional reputation
           need to balance multiple stakeholder interests.
                                                                                                                2. STARTING THE INTERNSHIP | 20

Taking Ownership of Your Experience

Professional workplaces expect interns to take responsibility for their learning and contribution to the
organisation. This means being proactive about your development and honest in your communication.
Here's how to demonstrate professional ownership:

Speaking Up When Things Aren't Right

Workplace safety and ethical conduct depend on everyone's willingness to raise concerns. This includes:
   identifying potential safety hazards in your work area
   reporting procedures that seem incorrect or inefficient
   discussing workload issues before they become overwhelming
   raising concerns about inappropriate workplace behaviour
   alerting your supervisor to potential errors in calculations or data.

Research highlights why speaking up is particularly important for interns and junior employees, even
though it may feel challenging. Oakman et al. (2024) identify that while many workers recognise common
workplace issues like stress, fatigue, and inadequate training, they often hesitate to report them. This
reluctance stems from several factors, as outlined in the table below adapted from Clarkson et al. (2018).

               Reasons why Junior Employees do not Report Workplace Issues

                   An interactive H5P element has been excluded from this version of the text. You can view it

                                       Percentage of Workers
21 | 2. STARTING THE INTERNSHIP

However, failing to report issues can perpetuate workplace hazards and contribute to poor organisational
outcomes. Clarkson et al. (2018) found that when young workers don't raise concerns:

   problems often go unaddressed until they become more serious
   other workers may face similar risks without warning
   important opportunities for workplace improvement are missed
   organisational learning is limited
   worker wellbeing and job satisfaction decrease.

In Australian workplaces, speaking up about problems is viewed as responsible behaviour, not
complaining. Top organisations actively encourage employees at all levels to raise concerns because:

   fresh perspectives from new employees often help identify issues that long-term staff may have
      overlooked or accepted as "normal"

   early reporting of potential issues is more cost-effective and safer than dealing with problems after
      they cause harm

   building a speak-up culture improves overall workplace safety outcomes and employee wellbeing
   organisations with strong reporting cultures tend to have better safety performance and lower

      incident rates.

When raising concerns:

   document specific examples of the issue you've observed
   frame your concern in terms of workplace safety and efficiency rather than complaints
   propose potential solutions when possible
   use established reporting channels (e.g., supervisors, Health and Safety Representatives, workplace

      safety systems)
   remember that you have a right and responsibility to raise legitimate concerns. For more

      information, view the Protections at work fact sheet by the Fair Work Commission.

If you feel uncomfortable raising an issue directly:

   consult with your workplace Health and Safety Representative (HSR)
   discuss with your supervisor or another trusted senior colleague
   seek advice from the placements team at your university
   consider using anonymous reporting systems if available.
                                                                                                                2. STARTING THE INTERNSHIP | 22

   Remember

       Your contribution to workplace safety matters. Research shows that organisations benefit
       from having multiple perspectives on safety issues, especially from those new to the
       workplace who may notice things that others have grown accustomed to.

Asking Questions When Uncertain

Uncertainty is natural in any new role. Professional conduct means seeking clarification rather than making
assumptions. Consider these approaches:

                   An interactive H5P element has been excluded from this version of the text. You can view it
                   online here:
                   https://jcu.pressbooks.pub/stem-advantage/?p=306#h5p-25

Frame your questions to show you've thought about the problem and are seeking guidance to perform
better. Research by Oakman et al. (2024) shows that young workers who actively seek clarification are more
likely to understand and implement safety procedures correctly. When asking questions:

   demonstrate preparation
   review available materials first
   note specific points that need clarification
   show what you already understand before asking about what you don't
   reference relevant procedures or past examples.

        https://jcu.pressbooks.pub/stem-advantage/?p=306#h5p-23
23 | 2. STARTING THE INTERNSHIP

Time Your Questions Appropriately

   ask during designated check-in times when possible
   for urgent matters, preface with "I have a time-sensitive question about..."
   consider whether the question needs immediate attention or can wait for a scheduled meeting
   be mindful of your supervisor's other commitments.

Follow Up Effectively

   take notes during the discussion
   summarise key points back to confirm understanding
   document the guidance for future reference
   share any relevant learnings with team members facing similar challenges.

Build Professional Confidence

Clarkson et al. (2018) reported that 61% of young workers lack confidence in raising workplace issues.
Combat this by:

   starting with questions about processes and procedures
   building up to more complex inquiries as your understanding grows
   using each interaction as an opportunity to demonstrate your professional development
   showing how you've applied previous guidance to new situations.

   Remember

       Questions that demonstrate thoughtful engagement with your work help build your
       professional reputation. Supervisors generally prefer answering clear, well-formed
       questions early in a project rather than having to address problems that arise from
       misunderstandings later.

Managing Mistakes Professionally

Everyone makes mistakes, even experienced professionals. What matters is how you handle them:

   acknowledge the mistake promptly
                                                    2. STARTING THE INTERNSHIP | 24

 take responsibility without making excuses.

Present the situation to your supervisor clearly:

 what happened
 any immediate consequences
 steps you've already taken to address it.

Ask for guidance on:

 how to fix the current situation
 how to prevent similar mistakes
 what you should learn from this experience.

Research suggests that proactively disclosing your mistakes, rather than waiting for others to discover
them, leads to better outcomes and builds trust. This approach, known as "stealing thunder," involves
taking the initiative to admit errors before someone else points them out (Guchait et al., 2023). When
owning up to a mistake, it's important to accept full responsibility rather than trying to blame others or
make excuses. The key is to acknowledge the error promptly, demonstrate genuine accountability, and
focus on solutions or lessons learned rather than dwelling on justifications. Mura et. al. (2013) show that
this upfront, honest approach helps maintain credibility and professional relationships, as it demonstrates
integrity and a commitment to improvement. While sharing mistakes can feel uncomfortable, doing so in
a transparent and accountable way strengthens trust and can lead to better workplace outcomes than if the
mistake had been concealed or revealed by someone else.

For example, instead of saying, "The spreadsheet got messed up," try this approach, "I noticed I made an
error in the calculations on yesterday's spreadsheet. I've identified where the mistake occurred and would
like your guidance on the best way to correct it."

Building Professional Resilience

Taking ownership also means:

   accepting constructive feedback professionally
   learning from challenges and setbacks
   adapting your approach based on experience
   supporting team members when they need help
   contributing to a positive workplace culture.
25 | 2. STARTING THE INTERNSHIP

   Remember

       Your internship is a learning experience. Taking ownership doesn't mean you need to be
       perfect, it means approaching your role with professionalism, honesty, and a willingness to
       learn and improve. Making mistakes is an inevitable part of professional growth and
       development. What matters most is how you handle those mistakes and what you learn
       from them. By demonstrating accountability and a genuine desire to improve, you show
       maturity and build trust with your colleagues. This approach not only helps you grow
       professionally but also contributes to creating an environment where others feel safe to
       acknowledge their own mistakes and seek support when needed. Strong professionals
       aren't those who never make mistakes, they're the ones who handle them with integrity
       and use them as opportunities for growth.

Managing Personal Issues

During your internship, you may encounter situations where personal matters impact your work. Many
people hesitate to discuss personal issues in professional settings, often due to concerns about career
implications or being perceived as less committed (van den Akker et al., 2017; Eldine, 2016; Lauzun et al.,
2010). These concerns are natural and understandable. Van den Akker et. al. (2017) found that employees
across all levels worry about maintaining professional boundaries while managing personal challenges.

However, it's important to understand that Australian workplaces typically foster a more supportive
environment than many other countries. The egalitarian culture common in Australian organisations
encourages open communication between supervisors and employees. This means that while maintaining
professional boundaries is important, there's generally greater acceptance of work-life balance needs and
more established support systems for managing personal challenges. This supportive workplace culture can
lead to better outcomes for both employees and organisations.

What makes your situation unique is that as an intern, you have access to additional layers of support that
regular employees don't have. Beyond your workplace supervisor, you can reach out to your university
internship coordinator, academic supervisors, and university support services. This network exists
specifically to help you navigate challenges during your internship experience and can provide guidance on
how to handle personal issues professionally.
                                                                                                                2. STARTING THE INTERNSHIP | 26

When personal matters do arise, the most effective approach is to communicate early and clearly with your
supervisor about any support you might need. Research indicates that supervisors are better able to provide
accommodation when they understand the situation and can plan accordingly (Okolie et al., 2023). Keep
your communication professional and focused on how you plan to maintain your work responsibilities
while managing personal challenges. This approach can lead to better outcomes than either avoiding
disclosure entirely or sharing too much personal information.
Remember that seeking support when needed is not a sign of weakness but a demonstration of professional
maturity. Your internship is a learning experience, and part of that learning involves developing the skills
to balance professional responsibilities with personal needs. Australian workplace laws and cultural norms
support this balance, and your university's support services are there to help you navigate this aspect of
professional life.
As your internship progresses, you'll develop your own understanding of appropriate boundaries and
communication strategies. The key is to remember that while personal issues can feel overwhelming, you
have multiple support channels available to help you manage these challenges professionally. This support
network, combined with Australia's generally supportive workplace culture, provides you with resources
that many regular employees don't have access to.

     Learning Objectives

     In this chapter, you will learn how to:
           take proactive steps when your internship role lacks meaningful work or development
             opportunities
           recognise and respond appropriately to workplace safety concerns, including physical
             hazards and psychosocial risks
           access appropriate interventions and support services when experiencing difficulties
             during your placement.

     Imagine this Scenario

     Ben slumps at his desk, staring at the mountainous pile of papers waiting to be photocopied.
     Five thousand pages need to be collated into staff handbooks, and he's only managed three
     hundred so far. The photocopier hums monotonously as he feeds in page after page, his spirits
     sinking with each mechanical whir.
     This isn't what he imagined when he secured an internship with the Department of Foreign
     Affairs and Trade. His morning routine has become predictable: arrive at 8:30, collect lunch
     orders from thirty staff members, spend two hours at the photocopier, then escort visitors from
     reception to the boardroom. Between these tasks, he reorganises the departmental library and
     filing system, work that feels far removed from international relations and diplomacy.
     One particularly challenging afternoon, while alphabetising folders in the invoice filing system,
     Ben considers emailing his university coordinator. Surely this isn't what an internship is
                                                                                           3. WORKPLACE RIGHTS ON INTERNSHIP | 30

supposed to be? He's spending more time with the photocopier than with any mentor. His
hands are paper-cut and ink-stained rather than shaking those of diplomats.

But Ben's father had always told him that every job, no matter how mundane, deserved his
best effort. So despite his frustration, Ben approaches each task with diligence. He develops an
efficient system for collecting lunch orders. He creates a colour-coding method for the filing
system that makes document retrieval significantly faster. His reorganisation of the library
introduces a logical cataloguing system that staff members begin to praise.

Then one morning, everything changes. The office is buzzing with energy: Jos Ramos-Horta,
the President of Timor-Leste, is visiting. Ben's supervisor, impressed by his reliable handling of
everyday tasks, assigns him to the motorcade team. Suddenly, Ben finds himself travelling
alongside a world leader, listening to diplomatic discussions he's only read about in textbooks.

This opportunity opens doors. His proven reliability leads to more significant responsibilities.
When Prime Minister Kevin Rudd visits the department, Ben's organisational skills earn him a
place in the preparation team. During the visit, he has the chance to meet the Prime Minister
himself, a moment that would have seemed impossible during those long hours at the
photocopier.

The turning point comes when Ben's supervisor, having witnessed his dedication to even the
smallest tasks, asks him to draft a ministerial brief on education aid in Vietnam. Ben applies the
same meticulous attention to detail that he used in reorganising the library. His research is
thorough, his analysis careful, and his recommendations well-reasoned. The brief is so well-
received that it influences a change in government policy.

Looking back, Ben realises that those seemingly mundane tasks taught him crucial lessons
about workplace dynamics, attention to detail, and professional persistence. His efficient
handling of basic responsibilities demonstrated his reliability and work ethic are qualities that
proved more valuable than any initial prestigious assignment could have been.

The photocopier, lunch orders, and filing systems had tested his character, showing his
supervisors that he could be trusted with gradually increasing responsibility. Each task, no
matter how small, had been an audition for bigger opportunities. His willingness to give his best
effort to every assignment, regardless of its perceived importance, had opened doors he never
expected to walk through.

Ben's experience demonstrates a fundamental truth about internships: they're as much about
proving your professional character as they are about gaining specific skills. Whether you're
reorganising a filing system or drafting policy documents, your approach to the work speaks
volumes about your potential. Sometimes, the path to diplomatic circles and policy influence
starts at the photocopier. It's not about where you begin, but how you handle each step of the
journey.
31 | 3. WORKPLACE RIGHTS ON INTERNSHIP

Expectations vs Reality

During your internship, you may find yourself scrolling through social media, seeing posts from friends
about their incredible placement experiences, presenting to executives, travelling internationally, or
working on groundbreaking projects. These glimpses into others' experiences can trigger feelings of
disappointment or inadequacy about your own internship. It's important to remember that social media
often shows only the highlights, not the day-to-day reality that likely includes many routine tasks like your
own. Everyone's professional journey unfolds differently, and comparing your beginning to someone else's
middle chapter rarely leads to productive insights.

The reality of many internships might differ significantly from your initial expectations. Perhaps you
envisioned yourself immersed in high-level strategic discussions or working directly on major projects, but
instead find yourself handling administrative tasks or basic operational duties. This disconnect between
expectation and reality can be disheartening and might even make you question whether you've made the
right choice. However, these feelings are a normal part of the professional learning experience, shared by
many interns across different industries and organisations.

The key to a successful internship lies not in the initial tasks you're given, but in how you approach
them and what you learn from each experience. Every assignment, no matter how mundane it might
seem, offers opportunities to demonstrate your work ethic, attention to detail, and ability to handle
responsibility professionally. These qualities, more than any specific technical skills, often determine which
interns receive increasingly challenging and rewarding opportunities. By maintaining a positive attitude
and approaching each task with dedication, you create possibilities for growth that might not be
immediately apparent. Remember, today's photocopying duty might be tomorrow's chance to prove
you're ready for bigger challenges. Opportunities often emerge in unexpected ways from seemingly routine
situations.

When embarking on your internship, you should reasonably expect your supervisor and organisation to
make genuine efforts to integrate you into the core functions of their business. This integration means
providing opportunities to observe, learn about, and participate in the fundamental activities that define
the organisation's purpose and success. For instance, if you're interning at an engineering firm, you should
have opportunities to engage with engineering projects, even if in a limited capacity. Similarly, a marketing
intern should be exposed to marketing strategy and campaign development, rather than being confined to
entirely unrelated tasks.

However, it's important to understand when apparent misalignment between your duties and your field of
study warrants contacting your internship coordinator. Consider the case of Sarah, a journalism student
who secured an internship at a major newspaper. Despite her aspirations to develop her reporting skills,
she found herself processing invoices in the accounts department. While basic administrative tasks can
be part of any role, Sarah's situation raised concerns because she had no exposure to the newsroom,
editorial meetings, or any aspect of journalism. This complete disconnection from the core function of
                                                                                                  3. WORKPLACE RIGHTS ON INTERNSHIP | 32

journalism represented a clear case where intervention from an internship coordinator was appropriate.
The placement wasn't providing the intended professional development opportunities in her field of study.

This example helps illustrate the difference between routine tasks that are part of professional life and
situations that require intervention. If you're spending the majority of your time on duties entirely
unrelated to your field of study, with no clear path to more relevant experiences, it's appropriate to seek
guidance from your internship coordinator. Your coordinator can help assess the situation objectively and,
if necessary, work with your workplace supervisor to ensure your internship aligns more closely with your
learning objectives. Remember, the goal isn't to avoid all administrative tasks, but rather to ensure you have
meaningful opportunities to learn about and contribute to your chosen field while developing professional
capabilities that will serve you in your future career.

Unwanted Interactions

Your internship should be a positive learning experience where you feel safe and respected. JCU takes
your wellbeing seriously and has established clear agreements with host organisations to protect you from
psychosocial hazards, that is, behaviours from others that could make you feel unsafe or uncomfortable in
your workplace.

Understanding Psychosocial Safety

Your psychological and emotional wellbeing at work deserves serious attention and protection. Research
indicates that workplace sexual harassment remains a persistent occupational health concern, with
substantial evidence linking it to serious outcomes including long-term sickness absence, depression, and
other mental health impacts. While many workplace interactions are professional, studies show that
33 | 3. WORKPLACE RIGHTS ON INTERNSHIP

inappropriate behaviours occur with concerning frequency, particularly affecting women, young workers,
and those in precarious work arrangements.

The tripartite model (Madsen & Nielsen, 2023) helps us understand three distinct but related types of
inappropriate workplace behaviours:

 1. Gender harassment: Actions that convey insulting, hostile or degrading attitudes about someone's
      gender, even without explicit sexual content.

 2. Unwanted sexual attention: Unwelcome verbal or physical sexual advances that are offensive and
      unreciprocated.

 3. Sexual coercion: Situations where work-related benefits are made contingent on sexual cooperation.

If you encounter any of these behaviours, it's important to understand that:

   this is not your fault
   you have clear legal rights protecting you from such conduct
   your workplace and university have a duty of care to ensure your psychological safety
   there are multiple channels of support available to help you.

Your university's placements team is trained to handle these situations with confidentiality and
professionalism. They can help you understand your options and access appropriate support services.

   Remember

       Speaking up about inappropriate behaviour helps maintain professional standards and
       ensures internships remain valuable learning experiences for all students.
                                                                                                  3. WORKPLACE RIGHTS ON INTERNSHIP | 34

If you experience any of these behaviours during your internship, it's crucial to act promptly:
   document the incident(s), including dates, times, and specific details
   contact your university's placements team immediately to discuss your concerns
   remember that reporting these issues is not only your right but helps protect future students.

You can contact the placements team confidentially to discuss any concerns, no matter how minor they
might seem. It's better to raise concerns early rather than wait for situations to escalate.
Your placements team is trained to handle these sensitive situations professionally and can:

   listen to your concerns without judgment
   help you understand your options
   work with the host organisation to address the situation
   arrange alternative placement options if necessary
   connect you with additional support services if needed.

   Remember

       Your safety and wellbeing are the top priority. Speaking up about inappropriate behaviour
       helps maintain professional standards and ensures internships remain valuable learning
       experiences for all students.

     Activity 3.1: An Uncomfortable Situation

     Simone has just completed her first week as an intern in a chemical engineering laboratory. The
     work itself has been exciting, she's already helped calibrate sophisticated testing equipment and
     participated in team discussions about upcoming research projects. However, a pattern of
     interactions with Brendon, the grants manager she met during orientation, has begun to make
     her uncomfortable.
     Throughout the week, Brendon has been finding reasons to visit her workstation, often with
     questions that seem to extend beyond professional interest. He asks about her weekend plans,
     comments on her clothing choices, and frequently mentions how "refreshing" it is to have
     "young energy" in the lab. When she focuses on her work rather than engaging in conversation,
     he tends to linger, sometimes pulling up a chair to "chat about the industry."
     On Friday afternoon, while she's carefully documenting her calibration results, Brendon
     approaches her workstation again. He mentions that the team usually goes for Friday drinks
     and asks if she'd like to join. This is the first Simone has heard about any after-work gathering,
     and she notices none of her immediate laboratory colleagues are around to confirm this
     tradition. She feels uncertain but doesn't want to seem unfriendly during her first week, so she
     asks where everyone is meeting. Brendon gives her the name of a nearby bar, mentioning that
     it's a quiet place where they can "get to know each other better."
     When Simone arrives at the bar later that evening, she finds only Brendon there. He explains
     that "everyone else cancelled" or "left early," though she hadn't seen any group emails or chat
     messages about the gathering. Brendon has already ordered her a wine, saying he
     "remembered she mentioned liking it", although Simone doesn't recall having this conversation.
     Applying the tripartite model of workplace harassment:

           identify examples of gender harassment in the scenario
           analyse how unwanted sexual attention manifests in the situation
           discuss whether any elements could potentially develop into sexual coercion
           examine how these different forms of harassment might interact and escalate.

     Drawing on research about power dynamics in workplace harassment:

           How do organisational hierarchies affect this situation?
           What role does Simone's status as a new intern play?
           How might the informal nature of after-work gatherings complicate professional

             boundaries?
                                                                                                 3. WORKPLACE RIGHTS ON INTERNSHIP | 36

           What organisational factors might enable or discourage such behaviours?
     Consider the preventive recommendations from current research:

           What workplace policies could help prevent such situations?
           How might clearer organisational communication channels help?
           What role should supervisors and HR play?
           What training might help both interns and managers understand appropriate

             boundaries?
     Role-play exercise: Professional response strategies
     Working in pairs, practice how Simone could respond to each type of harassment:

                          An interactive H5P element has been excluded from this version of the text. You can view it
                          online here:
              https://jcu.pressbooks.pub/stem-advantage/?p=307#h5p-26

      Remember

             The research shows that harassment often escalates gradually, making early recognition and
             response crucial. These skills are essential not only for your internship but throughout your
             professional career.

Harassment and Bullying

Research shows that workplace bullying and racial harassment remain significant challenges in Australian
workplaces, with certain groups being particularly vulnerable. According to comprehensive studies by
Attell et al. (2017) and McCord et al. (2018), racial minorities experience substantially more race-based
mistreatment than their colleagues, with the impact being even more pronounced when traditional
workplace support systems fail to provide adequate protection. While coworker support can help buffer
against some negative effects of workplace bullying, this protective factor often proves less effective for
racial minorities and women, highlighting the need for more robust institutional safeguards and support
mechanisms.
37 | 3. WORKPLACE RIGHTS ON INTERNSHIP

It is essential to understand that workplace bullying and racial harassment can take many forms, from
overt discrimination to more subtle microaggressions that may be difficult to identify or address. The
research indicates that while overall instances of workplace mistreatment have generally decreased over
time, certain types of targeted behaviour have actually increased in frequency. For those entering the
Australian workplace for the first time, it is crucial to know that all workers have legal protections against
bullying and racial harassment under the Fair Work Act 2009 and various anti-discrimination laws. These
laws require employers to provide a safe working environment free from harassment and discrimination,
and there are clear procedures for reporting and addressing such behaviour when it occurs.

If you experience bullying during your internship, remember that your university's placement team and
academic supervisors are there to support you. Unlike regular employees who might only have workplace
channels available, you have additional layers of support through your educational institution. Speaking
with your placement coordinator or academic supervisor is important for several reasons. First, they can
help you assess whether what you're experiencing constitutes bullying and advise you on appropriate
steps to take. Second, they can act as intermediaries with the workplace if needed, using their professional
relationships and experience to help resolve the situation. Third, they can help ensure that any workplace
issues don't unfairly impact your academic progress or professional development. Most importantly, they
can help protect your wellbeing while ensuring you still meet your learning objectives, whether that means
working with the placement site to resolve issues, arranging additional support, or, in serious cases, finding
an alternative placement. Remember to document specific instances of concerning behaviour and maintain
communication with your university contacts throughout the process.

     Activity 3.2: Understanding and Navigating Workplace Rights

     This research activity helps you understand the legal frameworks and support systems that
     protect workers in Australian workplaces. By working in pairs, you'll develop a comprehensive

Quality check
Before moving to Activity 3.3, ensure you can answer these questions:

      What constitutes a protected action under the Fair Work Act?
      How does Australian law define workplace harassment?
      What are the first three steps in reporting workplace concerns?

those in your home country. If you're unsure about cultural interpretations, note your questions
to discuss with your partner or tutor.

Activity 3.3: Creating Safer Workplace Scenarios

When facing workplace challenges, it's valuable to understand how different responses might
lead to different outcomes. This activity helps you explore various workplace situations and
develop appropriate response strategies.
Understanding Scenario Development
Think of scenario development like creating a "Choose Your Own Adventure" story, where each
choice leads to different consequences. Your scenarios should reflect realistic situations that
international students might encounter in Australian workplaces, while incorporating the legal
frameworks and support systems you researched in Activity 3.2.
Each scenario you create should include:

      an initial situation that could be interpreted in multiple ways
      cultural elements that might influence how different people view the situation
41 | 3. WORKPLACE RIGHTS ON INTERNSHIP

           at least three possible response options
           realistic outcomes for each response
           references to specific workplace rights and protections.

     Example Scenario Structure
     Let's examine how to build an effective scenario:
     Initial Situation:
     During a team meeting, your colleague consistently interrupts you and rephrases your technical
     suggestions in simpler terms, despite your expertise in the area. You notice this doesn't happen
     when other team members speak.
     Context to Consider:

           power dynamics in the workplace
           cultural differences in communication styles
           professional hierarchy in Australian workplaces
           impact on your work performance and wellbeing.

     Response Options:

           Direct Approach: schedule a private conversation with your colleague.
           Seek Support: discuss the situation with your supervisor.
           Document and Escalate: begin documenting instances and consult your university

             placement coordinator.

     For each response, you'll need to consider:

           immediate consequences
           long-term implications
           impact on workplace relationships
           alignment with Australian workplace culture
           professional development opportunities
           protection of your rights and wellbeing.

     Your Task
     Working with your partner:

           Create three different workplace scenarios that draw from your research in Part A.
           For each scenario, develop three distinct response options.
           Map out likely outcomes for each response.
           Identify relevant workplace rights and support services for each situation.
           Consider cultural factors that might influence how different people interpret the
                                                3. WORKPLACE RIGHTS ON INTERNSHIP | 42

        situation.

Think about scenarios involving:

      communication challenges
      professional boundaries
      work expectations
      team dynamics
      cultural misunderstandings
      professional development opportunities.

Physical Safety on Placement

Your physical safety at work is protected by Australian law. Both your host organisation and university have
legal obligations to ensure you have a safe working environment. Understanding these protections helps
you stay safe and know what to do if safety concerns arise.

Understanding Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)

Your host organisation must provide appropriate PPE when your work involves potential physical risks.
PPE might include:

   safety glasses or goggles for laboratory work
   steel-capped boots for construction or industrial sites
   high-visibility clothing for outdoor work
   hard hats in areas with overhead hazards
   protective gloves for handling chemicals or materials
   face masks for dusty environments or when working with particles.

   Remember

       Even if you see others not wearing the required PPE, you must always follow safety
       protocols. Your placement supervisor should demonstrate how to properly use and maintain
       any required safety equipment.
43 | 3. WORKPLACE RIGHTS ON INTERNSHIP

Emergency Procedures and Orientation

During your first days, your host organisation should provide a safety orientation covering:

   emergency exit locations and evacuation routes
   assembly points for emergency situations
   location of fire extinguishers and first aid kits
   emergency contact numbers and procedures
   names and locations of first aid officers
   specific hazards in your work area
   reporting procedures for safety concerns.

If you haven't received this information, politely request it from your supervisor. Understanding
emergency procedures before you need them is crucial for workplace safety.

Workplace Hazards and Risk Management

Your work area should be maintained to minimise physical risks. This includes:

   clear walkways free of trip hazards
   properly maintained equipment
   adequate lighting and ventilation
   ergonomic workstation setup
   clean and organised workspaces
   proper storage of dangerous materials.

If you notice potential hazards, report them to your supervisor immediately. This isn't complaining; it's
contributing to workplace safety.

Injury Reporting: Why Every Incident Matters

Even minor injuries must be reported to both your host organisation and the university placement team.
This requirement exists for several important reasons:

   your protection
   ensures you receive appropriate medical attention if needed
   creates a record if complications develop later
   protects your rights if you need time off to recover
   prevention of future incidents
                                                            3. WORKPLACE RIGHTS ON INTERNSHIP | 44

 helps identify workplace hazards
 allows organisations to improve safety measures
 protects other students and workers
 legal and insurance requirements
 maintains compliance with safety regulations
 ensures proper insurance coverage
 protects both you and the organisations involved.

For example, a seemingly minor sprained ankle might:

 develop into a more serious condition
 indicate a workplace hazard that needs addressing
 affect your ability to complete placement requirements.

If you experience any injury during your placement, follow these steps:

 immediate response
 seek first aid if needed
 inform your workplace supervisor
 remove yourself from any dangerous situation
 documentation
 record the incident details while fresh in your memory
 note the time, location, and circumstances
 list any witnesses present
 formal Reporting
 complete your host organisation's incident report form
 contact your university placement team (within 24 hours)
 keep copies of all documentation.

Remember

Reporting injuries isn't just about following rules, it's about maintaining your wellbeing and
helping create safer workplaces for everyone. Your university's placement team is there to
support you through this process while ensuring your placement requirements are
appropriately managed.

4. SETTING GOALS AND MAKING PLANS

     Learning Objectives

     In this chapter, you will learn how to:
           design a structured learning plan that aligns your professional development goals with
             workplace opportunities
           collaborate effectively with supervisors to create achievable learning objectives and
             success metrics
           develop strategies to track and demonstrate your growth across both technical and
             interpersonal competencies.

     Imagine this Scenario

     You sit in the sleek office, your recently pressed interview outfit still crisp despite the humid
     Brisbane morning. The interview has been going well. You've confidently discussed your
     technical skills, your understanding of the company's mission, and your eagerness to contribute
     to their upcoming projects. Then comes the question that makes your heart sink, "Tell us about
     the most important things you learned during your internship at Greentech Solutions." Your
     mind goes completely blank. Despite spending twelve weeks there just a few months ago, you
     can't articulate a single meaningful learning experience. You find yourself stumbling through a
     vague answer about "gaining industry experience" and "developing professional skills," knowing
     you sound disappointingly generic.
                                                                                                  4. SETTING GOALS AND MAKING PLANS | 48

     As you leave the interview, your polished shoes clicking against the marble lobby floor, the
     reality hits you hard. If only you had documented your learning experiences throughout your
     internship, you could have shared specific examples of challenges you overcame, skills you
     developed, and professional growth you achieved. Instead of impressing the interview panel
     with concrete examples of your capabilities, you left them with empty phrases that could have
     come from any graduate. The experience serves as a stark reminder that tracking your
     professional development isn't just about ticking boxes on a form, it's about building a narrative
     of your growth that you can draw upon throughout your career. A thoughtfully developed
     learning plan would have provided structure to your internship experience, helping you identify
     and document significant moments of learning and growth. More importantly, it would have
     given you a rich source of specific examples to draw upon in professional situations like job
     interviews, where the ability to articulate your development can make the difference between
     success and disappointment.

Why have a Learning Plan?

The journey from classroom to workplace brings exciting opportunities for professional growth, but
maximising these opportunities requires careful planning. A learning plan serves as your roadmap for
professional development, helping you navigate the transition from academic learning to workplace
application. While university courses provide you with theoretical knowledge and foundational skills, a
well-crafted learning plan helps you identify specific ways to apply and expand these capabilities in a
professional context.
Think of your learning plan as a GPS for your professional development journey. Just as a GPS helps
you navigate from your current location to your desired destination, a learning plan helps you move
from your current skill level toward your professional goals. Just like a GPS that recalculates when you
49 | 4. SETTING GOALS AND MAKING PLANS

encounter unexpected routes, your learning plan should be flexible enough to adapt to new opportunities
and challenges that arise during your placement.

Creating an effective learning plan involves more than simply listing what you hope to achieve. It requires
careful consideration of your current capabilities, thoughtful goal-setting, and strategic planning for how
you'll demonstrate your progress. Most importantly, it involves collaboration with your workplace
supervisor to ensure your goals align with available opportunities and organisational needs.

Developing Your Learning Plan

The first step in creating an effective learning plan is establishing a reliable system for documenting your
professional journey. Whether your university provides a formal template or not, maintaining detailed
records of your internship experience is invaluable for your professional development. Think of this
documentation as creating a professional memory bank that you can draw upon throughout your career.

If you haven't been provided with a specific template, a dedicated notebook or digital document can serve
as an excellent foundation for your learning plan. This doesn't need to be elaborate; even a simple notebook
can become a powerful tool when used consistently.

My personal favourite approach is the bullet journal method, which uses simple symbols and short phrases
to track tasks, events, and notes in a flexible, easy-to-maintain format. For example, you might use a dot ()
for tasks, a circle () for events, and a dash (-) for notes. This approach helps you quickly capture important
information without getting bogged down in long-form writing, while still maintaining a clear, organised
record of your experience.

For a how-to guide on setting up a bullet journal, please watch the video below [20:17]:

Consider setting aside the first few pages for basic but essential information about your placement: the
organisation's name and primary business focus, your supervisor's name and contact details, your start
date, and your working hours. While these details might seem obvious at the start of your internship,
having them readily available can prove surprisingly useful, particularly when updating your resume or
preparing for job interviews months later.

Your documentation system should also include space for ongoing notes about your role and
responsibilities. As you begin your placement, write down your initial tasks and projects, even if they
seem straightforward. Many interns are surprised by how quickly their responsibilities evolve, and having
                                                                                                  4. SETTING GOALS AND MAKING PLANS | 50

a record of where you started provides a valuable reference point for tracking your professional growth.
Remember to note down any specific systems, software, or equipment you're using. These details will be
particularly relevant when describing your technical skills to future employers.

Make it a habit to update your documentation regularly. Set aside a few minutes at the end of each
week to record significant experiences, challenges you've encountered, and solutions you've developed.
This practice not only helps you track your progress but also develops your professional reflection skills.
Consider creating separate sections in your notebook for different aspects of your experience: technical
skills, workplace relationships, challenges overcome, and key achievements. This organisation makes it
easier to locate specific examples when you need them, whether for assessment purposes, professional
development discussions, or future job applications.

     Activity 4.1: Setting Up Your Professional Documentation

     This activity helps you create a structured record of your placement details and initial
     responsibilities. Having this information readily available will help you track your professional
     journey and provide valuable reference points for future career opportunities.
     Instructions:
     Find a notebook or create a digital document that will serve as your professional journal. If
     using a notebook, dedicate the first few pages to this foundation information. Set aside 30
     minutes to thoroughly document the following details:

     Remember

             Keep this information up to date throughout your placement. If your responsibilities change or
             you begin using new systems, add these details to your documentation. This living record will
             become an invaluable resource for developing your learning objectives and tracking your
             professional growth.
51 | 4. SETTING GOALS AND MAKING PLANS

Planning for Technical Skill Development

Technical skills form a crucial component of professional competence, but research shows their
development requires structured approaches that go beyond simple workplace exposure. Chivers (2007)
examined postgraduate students' technical skill development. His research discovered that technical
competency development occurs most effectively when integrated with higher-order thinking capabilities,
particularly meta-competencies such as critical thinking and problem-solving.
Chivers' (2007) research can be used to create a framework for planning technical skill development. This
approach emphasises that learning outcomes, learning activities, and assessment must work together in a
coordinated way. When applied to technical skill development, this means carefully reflecting on learning
experiences so each element reinforces and builds upon the others.
For example, if your goal is to develop advanced data analysis capabilities, simply attending training sessions
isn't enough. The constructive alignment approach suggests you need clearly defined learning outcomes
(what specific analytical skills you need to master), aligned learning activities (practical exercises with
real data), and appropriate assessment methods (demonstrating your analytical capabilities in workplace
projects).

When students commence their internship, people tend to focus heavily on knowledge acquisition and
basic cognitive competencies. However, Chivers' (2007) findings show that true professional growth occurs
when technical skills are developed alongside meta-competencies. This suggests that effective technical skill
development should include opportunities to:

   apply technical knowledge to complex, real-world problems
   exercise professional judgment about when and how to use technical skills
   critically evaluate the results of technical work
                                                                                                  4. SETTING GOALS AND MAKING PLANS | 52

   communicate technical information effectively to different audiences.

Chivers' (2007) findings also reveal that while students may initially concentrate on mastering basic
technical procedures, their development of higher-order capabilities becomes increasingly important as
they progress. This suggests that technical skill development plans should evolve over time, gradually
incorporating more complex decision-making and professional judgment alongside technical mastery.
When measuring progress in technical skill development, the constructive alignment framework suggests
using assessment methods that authentically reflect workplace requirements. This might include
successfully completing workplace projects, teaching others new technical skills, or contributing to
technical documentation: activities that demonstrate not just technical knowledge but the ability to apply
it effectively in professional contexts.
This integrated approach aligns with Chivers' findings about how professionals develop advanced
competencies. His research shows that the most effective professional development occurs when technical
skills are learned as part of a broader development of professional capability, rather than in isolation.

     Activity 4.2: Building Your Technical Skills Development Plan

     Like the health and safety professionals in Chivers' (2007) research, you'll create a structured
     plan that aligns your technical skill development with broader professional capabilities. Using
     the constructive alignment principles, you'll map out how to develop both technical competence
     and meta-competencies.

                          An interactive H5P element has been excluded from this version of the text. You can view it
                          online here:
                          https://jcu.pressbooks.pub/stem-advantage/?p=308#h5p-28

     Share your completed plan with your supervisor or a trusted colleague. Just as the research
     shows the importance of workplace connection, getting feedback on your plan can help ensure
     it aligns with both your professional development needs and organisational opportunities.
53 | 4. SETTING GOALS AND MAKING PLANS

     Remember

             The evidence shows that technical skill development is most effective when integrated with
             broader professional growth. Your plan should reflect this holistic approach to building
             professional competence.

       A Note for JCU Students: Preparing your Learning Plan Assessment
       The activity above directly supports your first assessment task in this subject. Creating a
       learning plan that will guide your internship experience. Let's explore how you can use this
       framework to develop a strong learning plan that meets the assessment requirements.
       Your learning plan template asks you to consider specific competency areas: technical skills,
       self-awareness, self-regulation, empathy & social skills, and communication. The structured
       approach we've just worked through is particularly valuable for the technical skills section,
       but the principles of constructive alignment and integrated development can strengthen
       your entire learning plan.
       When completing your learning plan assessment, consider how your technical skill
       development connects with other competency areas. For instance, if you're developing
       advanced data analysis capabilities, think about how this might also involve self-awareness
       (understanding your current skill level), self-regulation (managing frustration when learning
       new techniques), and communication (explaining complex findings to different audiences).
       Remember that your learning plan needs to be discussed with your placement supervisor
       within your first two weeks. The detailed thinking you do through this activity will help you
       have a more productive conversation with your supervisor. You'll be able to clearly articulate
       not just what technical skills you want to develop, but how you plan to develop them and
       how you'll demonstrate your growth.
       The evidence of achievement section in this activity directly relates to the "Planned
       Evidence of Achievement/s (i.e. deliverables)" column in your learning plan template. The
       critical thinking you've done about how to demonstrate your developing capabilities will
       help you identify specific, measurable deliverables that satisfy the assessment requirements.
       By taking this evidence-based, structured approach to your learning plan, you're setting
                                                                                                  4. SETTING GOALS AND MAKING PLANS | 54

       yourself up for success not just in this assessment task, but throughout your placement
       experience. Your learning plan becomes more than just an academic exercise; it becomes a
       practical tool for guiding your professional development, just as the research shows it
       should be.

Building Your Self-Regulation on Internship

Self-awareness serves as a cornerstone for professional growth during internships, with research consistently
demonstrating its vital role in workplace success. Studies by both Sutton et al. (2015) and Wonda (2024)
show that self-aware interns are better equipped to navigate workplace relationships, understand diverse
perspectives, and contribute effectively to their organisations. This heightened self-awareness enables you
to process feedback constructively, recognise strengths and areas for development, and make thoughtful
decisions about your own professional trajectory. By developing a clearer understanding of your own
emotions, reactions, and impact on others, you can build stronger professional relationships and adapt
more effectively to workplace challenges.

Moreover, self-awareness is not a fixed trait but a skill that can be actively developed throughout the
internship experience. A systematic review undertaken by Carden et. al. (2022) demonstrates that people
can cultivate this crucial capability through targeted training. Enhanced self-awareness correlates directly
with improved job performance, increased confidence, and more effective workplace communication
(Carden et al., 2022; Sutton et al., 2015; Wonda, 2024). When you invest in developing their self-awareness,
you're better positioned to make meaningful contributions to their teams, navigate professional challenges
with resilience, and identify opportunities for career growth. The evidence suggests that self-aware interns
are more likely to transform their internship experiences into valuable stepping stones for long-term
career success, as they can better align their strengths and interests with professional opportunities while
maintaining productive relationships with colleagues and supervisors.

While it may be tempting to begin your internship by formally assessing your current level of self-
awareness, research suggests that a more productive approach is to focus directly on identifying meaningful
personal and professional goals. The key is understanding how your emotions and responses might
influence your internship experience. Consider, for example, how you typically react when receiving
constructive criticism. Do you feel defensive, or discouraged, or do you eagerly embrace the feedback as a
growth opportunity? These emotional patterns will likely surface during your placement.
55 | 4. SETTING GOALS AND MAKING PLANS

     Scenario: A Cavalcade of Emotions

     Davide sits at his desk, staring at his laptop screen where chapter 14 of Tropical Marine Species:
     A Comprehensive Guide (14th Edition) glows back at him. Three weeks ago, when he received
     the internship offer from Dr. Joo Oliveira, one of the world's leading marine biologists, Davide
     could hardly contain his excitement. This was the same Dr. Oliveira whose books had inspired
     Davide's passion for marine biology. He still remembers receiving the 10th edition for his
     thirteenth birthday and spending countless hours memorising every detail about coral reef
     ecosystems.
     Reality, however, has fallen short of his expectations. Instead of diving in crystal-clear waters or
     assisting with groundbreaking research, Davide finds himself hunched over his computer,
     methodically reformatting citations and standardising image captions. The work feels mundane
     and repetitive, nothing like the dynamic research experience he had imagined. Each morning, he
     forces himself to open another chapter, trying to maintain enthusiasm for what feels like an
     endless task.

     Today's email from Dr. Oliveira has sent Davide's anxiety spiralling. The message was brief but
     clear: upon returning from a three-week expedition to Mombasa Marine Park, exactly the kind
     of adventure Davide had hoped to experience, Dr. Oliveira expects both the book editing to be
     complete and Davide to be ready to begin processing approximately 5,000 new photographs.
     The magnitude of the task ahead feels overwhelming. Davide's fingers hover over the keyboard
     as he tries to calculate how many pages he needs to edit per day to meet this deadline, all while
     knowing another enormous task looms on the horizon. The excitement of working with his
     academic hero has transformed into a knot of stress in his stomach as he wonders how he will
     manage it all.
                                                                                                  4. SETTING GOALS AND MAKING PLANS | 56

Using Self-Awareness to Get Through Challenging
Situations

Being aware of and accepting our emotions is a crucial first step in managing challenging workplace
situations. For Davide, it's important to understand that his feelings of disappointment, boredom, and
now overwhelm are completely natural responses to his situation. Many interns experience similar
emotions when their expectations don't align with reality, particularly when working with someone they
deeply admire.

Let's examine why validating these emotions is important. When Davide acknowledges that it's normal
to feel disappointed about not participating in field research, he can move from questioning himself
("Why am I not more grateful for this opportunity?") to understanding his reaction ("Of course I feel
disappointed. This isn't what I expected"). This shift in perspective is powerful because it reduces the
additional stress that comes from trying to suppress or deny his feelings.

Similarly, recognising that boredom with repetitive tasks is a common experience helps Davide understand
that these feelings don't reflect poorly on his commitment to marine biology or his respect for Dr Oliveira's
work. Many professionals, even those passionate about their field, sometimes find certain aspects of their
work mundane. This understanding can help Davide separate his temporary feelings about specific tasks
from his broader career aspirations.

The feeling of being overwhelmed by the upcoming deadlines is particularly important to acknowledge.
When we try to ignore or push away feelings of stress, we often become more anxious and less capable of
thinking clearly about solutions. By accepting that he feels overwhelmed, Davide can begin to look at his
situation more objectively and start planning how to manage his workload effectively.

Remember, emotional awareness isn't about wallowing in negative feelings, it's about creating a
foundation for constructive action. Through our involvement with interns who did not complete their
placements, we discovered that most of them struggled with managing their emotional responses to
workplace challenges. These students often found it difficult to identify and articulate their feelings, which
led to increased stress and eventually contributed to their withdrawal or removal from their internships. By
contrast, interns who regularly took time to reflect on and name their emotions were better equipped to
address challenges constructively.
57 | 4. SETTING GOALS AND MAKING PLANS

This reflection might involve asking yourself, "Am I feeling disappointed because my expectations weren't
met? Anxious about the workload? Intimidated by working with someone I admire?" Understanding
these distinct emotional responses helps create clarity and opens pathways for addressing each concern
specifically. Once Davide can identify and accept how he feels, he can begin to use these emotions as
valuable information about his situation and what he needs to do to address it.

     Turning Self-Awareness into an Organisational Superpower

     After acknowledging his feelings, Davide realises that taking control of his situation begins with
     getting organised. Rather than letting the mounting pressure paralyse him, he decides to
     transform his self-awareness into actionable steps. Opening his bullet journal, a tool he
     previously used mainly for tracking marine biology terminology, he begins to break down the
     editing task into manageable chunks.
     First, Davide calculates the time available before Dr. Oliveira returns from Mombasa with the
     photographs. Three weeks translates to 21 days, but being realistic about his energy levels and
     the need for breaks, he decides to plan for 18 working days. He knows the remaining chapters
     total approximately 450 pages. A quick division shows him he needs to edit 25 pages per day to
     complete the book before the photographs arrive.
     The number feels more manageable now that it's clearly defined. Drawing on his understanding
     of his work patterns, another aspect of self-awareness, Davide knows he focuses best in the
     morning. He also recognises that his enthusiasm for marine biology, while tested by the
     mundane nature of editing, remains a valuable asset. Each chapter, after all, contains fascinating
     information about species he hopes to one day study in person.
     To support his planning, Davide invests in workflow management software. He chooses this
     tool deliberately, aware that his natural tendency to get overwhelmed by large projects means
                                                                                           4. SETTING GOALS AND MAKING PLANS | 58

he needs a system that can break tasks into smaller components and track his progress visually.
The software allows him to set up daily editing targets and create a timeline for the upcoming
photo processing task.
With a clear plan and daily targets in place, Davide finds that his initial feeling of being
overwhelmed has subsided significantly. Breaking down the large task into manageable pieces
has given him a sense of control and direction. The simple act of knowing exactly what he
needs to accomplish each day, 25 pages of editing, has transformed an intimidating project into
a series of achievable goals.
However, as Davide settles into his new routine, he notices that his disappointment about the
nature of the internship hasn't diminished. In fact, this feeling has grown stronger as he
processes his emotions more clearly. Each time he edits a passage about field research or
encounters a stunning photograph of marine life, he's reminded of the hands-on experience he
had hoped to gain. This self-awareness helps him recognise that while he can manage the
workload effectively, his deeper career aspirations still need to be addressed.
Rather than letting this disappointment fester, Davide decides to use it constructively. He plans
to raise his concerns with Dr. Oliveira when he returns from Kenya, recognising that the natural
opening of asking about the expedition provides an opportunity for a broader conversation. By
waiting for this moment, Davide can approach the discussion from a position of demonstrated
competence, having completed the editing task professionally despite his reservations. This
strategy shows emotional intelligence. He understands that timing and context matter when
raising concerns with a supervisor, especially one he deeply respects.
Davide realises that while self-awareness has helped him manage the immediate challenges of
his workload, it's also guiding him toward addressing the larger question of his professional
development. His ability to acknowledge both his practical achievements and his emotional
needs demonstrates growing maturity in his approach to workplace challenges.

  An Important Note About Workflow Software
  While the author of this textbook uses Nirvana for workflow management, it's essential to
  find the tool that best matches your working style and needs. The internet abounds with
  advertisements for workflow management software, each claiming to be the ultimate
  solution for productivity. However, what works well for one person may not suit another.
  Rather than immediately subscribing to the most advertised option, take time to research
  alternatives. A helpful starting point is AlternativeTo, a website that allows you to compare
59 | 4. SETTING GOALS AND MAKING PLANS

       different software solutions based on features, pricing, and user reviews. Consider factors
       such as your budget (many tools offer student discounts), whether you need mobile access,
       and how the software aligns with your existing organisational habits. Some people, for
       instance, work best with highly visual tools that emphasise calendar views, while others
       prefer simple task lists or kanban boards.
       Remember that the most expensive or feature-rich option isn't necessarily the best choice
       for your needs. Many free or low-cost alternatives provide excellent functionality without
       overwhelming you with unnecessary features. The key is finding software that enhances
       rather than complicates your workflow.

Developing Self-Regulation on Internship

In Davide's case, we've seen how self-awareness, recognising his feelings of disappointment, boredom, and
overwhelm, led naturally to self-regulation through practical action. By acknowledging his emotions and
understanding their source, he could step back from feeling overwhelmed and develop concrete strategies
to manage his work. This progression from awareness to regulation didn't make his disappointment
disappear, but it did allow him to channel his emotions productively rather than letting them control his
internship experience.

Your internship journey, while unique to you, will likely involve similar emotional challenges that require
both awareness and regulation. Like Davide, you might find yourself facing unexpected situations or
dealing with tasks that don't align with your initial expectations. The key is to recognise that these
emotional responses are not only normal but can serve as valuable signals helping you understand and
improve your professional experience.

Take a moment to envision yourself in various workplace scenarios. Perhaps you're asked to give an
impromptu presentation to senior staff, or maybe you make a significant error on an important project.
What emotions arise as you imagine these situations? Some common feelings that emerge for interns
include impostor syndrome (feeling like you don't belong or aren't qualified), anxiety about meeting
expectations, or frustration when tasks take longer than anticipated to master. By acknowledging these
potential emotional responses in advance, you can develop strategies to manage them effectively.
                                                                                                 4. SETTING GOALS AND MAKING PLANS | 60

For instance, if you know that you tend to become overwhelmed when juggling multiple deadlines, you
might set a goal to develop better time management skills during your internship. Or if you recognise
that you sometimes hesitate to ask questions for fear of appearing unknowledgeable, you could establish
a goal to practice seeking clarification at least once during each team meeting. The key is to use your
understanding of your emotional patterns to inform specific, actionable goals that will help you grow
professionally.

     Activity 4.4: Planning for Developing Self-Awareness on Internship

     Part 1: Emotional mapping
     Take a few quiet moments to imagine yourself in your upcoming internship. As you visualise
     the following scenarios, write down the emotions that surface for each:

           your supervisor asks you to present your work to the team
           a fellow intern points out an error in your work
           you're given a task but aren't sure how to begin. Your supervisor is away, and the

             workplace is very busy, and everyone seems too occupied to help
           you complete a project successfully.
     Part 2: Pattern recognition
     Review your emotional responses and answer these reflection questions:
           "When I look at my emotional responses across these scenarios, I notice..."
           "The situations that seem most challenging for me are..."
           "My typical response when feeling uncertain is..."
           "The type of support I find most helpful when stressed is..."
61 | 4. SETTING GOALS AND MAKING PLANS

     Part 3: Goal formation
     Based on your reflections, complete these sentences:

           "During my internship, I want to become more aware of..."
           "I will know I'm making progress when..."
           "To develop my self-awareness in this area, I will..."
           "When I face challenges, I plan to..."

     Remember

             Your goal should focus on developing awareness and understanding rather than just changing
             behaviour. For example, instead of "I will never get nervous during presentations," a better
             goal might be "I want to better understand what triggers my presentation anxiety and
             develop strategies to work with these feelings."

     Part 4: Evidence of achievement
     Professional development research tells us that the best way to track progress in self-
     awareness is through specific, observable indicators (Hughes et al., 2019). Think about how
     you'll know you're making progress toward your self-awareness goal by considering evidence
     across three domains:

                          An interactive H5P element has been excluded from this version of the text. You can view it
                          online here:
                          https://jcu.pressbooks.pub/stem-advantage/?p=308#h5p-29

     For example, if your goal is to become more aware of how you respond to constructive
     feedback, your evidence might look like this:
     Internal evidence: "I will notice myself pausing to reflect before responding to feedback rather
     than immediately feeling defensive."
     External evidence: "My supervisor will observe that I ask clarifying questions about feedback
     instead of becoming quiet or argumentative."
     Documentation evidence: "I will maintain a feedback log recording the feedback received, my
     initial emotional response, ow I chose to respond and what I learned from the interaction."
                                                                                                  4. SETTING GOALS AND MAKING PLANS | 62

     Remember

             The best evidence is specific and measurable. Instead of "I will be more confident," try "I will
             document three instances per week where I contributed ideas in team meetings despite
             feeling uncertain."

     Share your goal and evidence with a classmate and give each other feedback using these
     prompts:

           Is the goal focused on awareness rather than just behaviour change?
           Is it specific enough to track progress?
           Does it acknowledge both emotions and actions?
           Is the evidence tangible enough to verify?

Empathy and Social Skills: Essential Competencies
for Professional Success

In today's rapidly evolving workplace, technical skills alone are not enough to build a successful career. The
research consistently shows that empathy and social skills, often called social intelligence, are among the
most critical competencies for professional development. Ramos-Monge et. al. (2023) undertook a study
of university students entering the workforce. The findings demonstrated that interpersonal capabilities
rank among the top skills that employers seek, yet they are often the lowest skill scored among students who
commence in the workforce.

The type of skills employers look for include the ability to understand social situations effectively,
communicate clearly and appropriately with others, empathise with colleagues' emotions and perspectives,
and build and maintain positive professional relationships. Students who develop strong social intelligence
skills during their education and early work experiences are better positioned to succeed in their careers.

Why do these skills matter so much? The modern workplace is increasingly collaborative and relationship-
driven. Whether you are working remotely or in person, your ability to understand others' perspectives,
respond appropriately to social cues, and navigate complex interpersonal dynamics has a direct impact on
your professional effectiveness. This is particularly true in the digital employment market, where virtual
collaboration and cross-cultural communication are becoming the norm.
63 | 4. SETTING GOALS AND MAKING PLANS

The good news is that these skills can be developed through conscious effort and practice. As you begin
your internship, you have an ideal opportunity to strengthen your social intelligence capabilities in a
professional setting. The key is to approach this development intentionally, just as you would approach
building technical skills.
Consider these key findings from an entire university's graduating cohort in research undertaken by Rozell
et. al. (2002):

   A combination of self-regulation and social skills are significant predictors of career success.
      According to the first study's findings, students who scored higher in these two areas demonstrated
      significantly better career choice behaviours compared to those with lower scores.

   Social skills and group collaboration abilities are key differentiators in professional settings. Students
      with high scores in social skills in collaborative settings and self-awareness showed significantly better
      performance in professional settings than those with lower scores.

   Longevity of employment correlated strongly with empathy and social skills capabilities. Students
      who scored highly on both empathy and social skills measures demonstrated better performance in
      helping their employer achieve their organisational goals and scored higher customer satisfaction
      scores.

   Communication and social adaptability are increasingly critical in digital workplaces. The research
      indicates that international students who developed stronger empathy and social skill capabilities
      showed improved performance in cross-cultural professional settings.

Through conscious development of these capabilities, you can enhance your professional effectiveness and
create stronger working relationships. A structured learning plan that incorporates both technical and
social skill development will provide a solid foundation for your career growth.

     Activity 4.5: Self-Assessing Your Empathy and Social Skills
                                                                                                  4. SETTING GOALS AND MAKING PLANS | 64

     Most people tend to say that they have excellent empathy and social skills. But is this really the
     case? Try this activity out and put it to the test.
     Self-reflection:
     Think about your last team experience (work, university, or volunteer). Write brief notes about:

           one interaction where you built a strong professional connection
           one interaction where you wish you'd handled things differently
           What do these experiences tell you about your relationship-building strengths and areas

             for growth?
     Interactive practice:
     Find someone that you interact with, but don't know well. Your task is to learn three interesting
     things about their professional goals or experience. Practice active listening and asking follow-
     up questions. Take some time to reflect on that conversation:

           What techniques helped you build rapport quickly?
           How might these skills translate to your internship?
           What specific goals could you set for relationship building during your placement?

Goal Setting for Empathy and Social Skills

Consider how that brief conversation you just had revealed insights about relationship building. You
likely found that asking thoughtful questions and showing genuine interest helped create a connection
quickly. During your internship, this same principle applies, but you'll have more time to develop these
relationships meaningfully.

When writing your learning plan goals, translate these conversation insights into specific professional
actions. For example, if you found that asking about someone's professional journey helped build rapport,
you might write: "Schedule three one-to-one conversations with team members in my first month, focusing
on understanding their career paths and current roles." This goal is specific and measurable while building
on the skills you just practised.

Similarly, if you discovered that following up on details someone shared helped deepen the connection,
consider a goal like: "After each significant project collaboration, arrange a brief coffee chat to reflect on
what we learned and discuss future opportunities to work together." This demonstrates both initiative and
relationship-building awareness.

Remember that professional relationship building is an ongoing process. The brief conversation you
just had was a starting point. Your internship goals should reflect a gradual deepening of professional
65 | 4. SETTING GOALS AND MAKING PLANS

connections over time. Consider how you might progress from initial introductions to meaningful
professional relationships that could extend beyond your internship period.

When discussing these goals with your supervisor, explain how you plan to balance relationship building
with your other responsibilities. This shows maturity in understanding that workplace connections should
develop naturally alongside your primary duties, rather than detracting from them.

The Importance of Communication

Communication in professional settings forms the foundation of successful career development and
learning plan implementation. Effective workplace communication involves both sharing your own
thoughts and ideas clearly, as well as actively listening to and engaging with others. When discussing your
learning plans and professional development goals with supervisors and mentors, it's crucial to articulate
your aspirations clearly while remaining open to feedback and guidance.

In Australian workplaces, direct communication is generally preferred, though it should always remain
respectful and professional. This means being clear about your learning objectives and development needs,
while showing appreciation for the support and opportunities provided. For example, rather than saying
"I might like to learn more about project management," you might say "I would value the opportunity
to develop my project management skills through shadowing the team during the next project planning
cycle."

Understanding and adapting to your organisation's communication channels is equally important.
Whether your workplace prefers formal emails, scheduled meetings, or casual check-ins, aligning your
communication style with these norms helps ensure your learning and development needs are heard and
addressed effectively.

Navigating Australian English in the Workplace

Translation devices and software can serve as valuable tools during your academic journey and early career
development. They offer helpful support when encountering unfamiliar terminology or complex concepts.
However, it's essential to understand the distinction between using these tools as occasional aids versus
relying on them for basic communication.

Consider this scenario: You're in a team meeting where colleagues are discussing an urgent safety issue. The
conversation moves quickly, with multiple people contributing important information. In this situation,
you need to understand and respond immediately. There isn't time to use translation software. Your
ability to comprehend and communicate effectively in English could be crucial for workplace safety and
operational efficiency.
                                                                                                 4. SETTING GOALS AND MAKING PLANS | 66

       If you currently find yourself needing translation support for routine interactions, such as
       understanding lecture content, participating in tutorial discussions, or communicating with
       your lecturers, this signals a need to evaluate your readiness for Australian workplace
       integration. While academic environments often provide additional support and time for
       language processing, professional settings typically require more immediate and fluent
       communication.

Professional workplaces in Australia operate primarily in English, with expectations of:
   quick comprehension of verbal instructions and safety protocols
   active participation in team discussions and meetings
   clear communication with colleagues and stakeholders
   understanding of subtle language nuances that affect workplace relationships
   immediate response in emergency situations.

Rather than viewing this as a barrier, consider it an opportunity to strengthen your English language
skills before entering the workforce. Many universities offer additional English language support services,
conversation practice groups, and professional communication workshops. Engaging with these resources
while still studying can help build the language confidence needed for successful workplace integration.
67 | 4. SETTING GOALS AND MAKING PLANS

   Remember

       The goal isn't to eliminate translation tools from your professional toolkit entirely, but rather
       to develop sufficient English language proficiency so these tools serve as occasional
       references rather than essential communication aids. This approach helps ensure you can
       participate fully and safely in Australian workplace environments.

Written Communication

Many international students and professionals come from cultures where formal, hierarchical
communication is deeply embedded in professional interactions. For example, in some Asian cultures, it's
common to begin emails with elaborate honorifics and respectful phrases, particularly when writing to
someone in a senior position.

                   An interactive H5P element has been excluded from this version of the text. You can view it
                   online here:
                   https://jcu.pressbooks.pub/stem-advantage/?p=308#h5p-31

Here's what characterises effective email communication in Australian workplaces:

   Beginning emails: Use "Hi [first name]" for most professional communications. "Dear [first
      name]" is acceptable for more formal situations or initial contacts.

   Getting to the point: State your purpose in the first sentence or two. Australian professionals
      appreciate it when you communicate your main message early.

   Maintaining politeness: Use "please" and "thank you" appropriately, but avoid excessive formality
      or apologetic language. For example, instead of "I am terribly sorry to burden you with this request,"
      simply write "Could you please..."

   Closing emails: Keep it simple with "Thanks" or "Kind regards" followed by your name. Elaborate
      sign-offs aren't necessary.

   Length: Keep emails concise. If your message requires more than a few paragraphs, consider
      requesting a meeting instead.

Remember that adapting to this communication style might feel uncomfortably informal at first if you're
                                                                                                 4. SETTING GOALS AND MAKING PLANS | 68

from a more hierarchical culture. However, embracing this direct approach demonstrates your
understanding of Australian workplace culture and your ability to communicate effectively within it.
By the same token, when we're less confident in our English language skills, it's natural to try to
communicate in the simplest, most straightforward way possible. However, this approach can sometimes
come across as abrupt or demanding. Consider this example:

                   An interactive H5P element has been excluded from this version of the text. You can view it
                   online here:
        https://jcu.pressbooks.pub/stem-advantage/?p=308#h5p-32

This version is still clear and direct, but includes several important elements that make it more appropriate
for Australian workplace communication:

   a greeting that acknowledges the person
   the word "please" to make it a request rather than a demand
   context for why the report is needed
   a thank you to show appreciation
   a signature to close the message professionally.

Even when our vocabulary might be limited, we can use these simple structural elements to maintain
professional relationships. Here's another example:

                   An interactive H5P element has been excluded from this version of the text. You can view it
                   online here:
                   https://jcu.pressbooks.pub/stem-advantage/?p=308#h5p-33

This balanced approach becomes particularly important in workplace situations where we need ongoing
cooperation and support from our colleagues. By taking the time to include these small courtesies, we build
better working relationships while still getting our message across clearly.

     Activity 4.6: Checking Written Communication

     This activity helps you understand how cultural differences can affect written communication
     and how to adapt your writing style for Australian professional contexts.
     Part 1: Email analysis

                                                                                                                       An example of an
                                                                                                                       overly flamboyant
                                                                                                                       email

     Read the above email carefully. First, let's identify elements that don't align with Australian
     professional communication norms:

           Consider the subject line: "Formal Request for Special Consideration"
                   How does this set the tone for the email?
                   Is this level of formality typical in Australian professional settings?

           Examine the greeting: "Dear esteemed Professor Benjamin"
                   What assumptions about hierarchy does this reveal?
                   How might this make the recipient feel in an Australian context?

           Look at the first paragraph:
                   What purpose does the praise of the professor's research serve?
                   Is this level of deference common in Australian academic settings?

           Analyse the request section:
                   How many words does it take to make the actual request?
                   What language choices make this section feel overly formal or apologetic?

           Consider the closing statements:
                   What message does "forever be in your debt" send?
                   How might this affect the professional relationship?
                                                                                           4. SETTING GOALS AND MAKING PLANS | 70

Part 2: Rewriting exercise
Now, let's rewrite this email following Australian professional communication principles. Your
email should:

      be clear and direct while maintaining politeness
      respect the recipient's time
      present relevant information efficiently
      maintain appropriate professional boundaries.
Here's a structure to follow:
      brief, clear subject line
      professional but approachable greeting
      clear statement of purpose
      relevant supporting information
      specific request
      professional close.
Part 3: Reflection questions
After rewriting the email, consider:
      How does your version differ in length from the original?
      What cultural assumptions did you need to adjust?
      How does your version maintain professionalism while reducing formality?
      How might these changes affect how the request is received?
Part 4: Another analysis

                                                                                                                 An unintentionally
                                                                                                                 rude email
                                                                                                                 requesting an
                                                                                                                 extension

Let's examine the key elements of the above email that could be improved:
71 | 4. SETTING GOALS AND MAKING PLANS

     Subject line analysis:

           While "Extension" is direct, how could it be more informative?
           What context is missing that would help the recipient?

     Greeting issues:

           Notice the inconsistent capitalisation in "Dear dr archer".
           How might this greeting affect the recipient's first impression?
           What does this tell us about attention to detail in professional communications?

     Message structure:

           Observe how the email presents information in fragments rather than complete
             sentences.

           Notice the missing punctuation and inconsistent capitalisation.
           Consider how the final line reads as a demand rather than a request.

     Tone and professionalism:

           Examine how "i want extension so tell me new date" might be received.
           Consider what information is missing that would help the recipient make a decision.
           Think about how this could affect the professional relationship.

     Now, rewrite this email to achieve these goals:

           provide a clear, informative subject line
           use a proper professional greeting
           give complete context for the situation
           make a polite, specific request
           include all relevant details the recipient needs
           close professionally.

     Part 5: Discussion questions
     After rewriting both emails, consider:

           How would you feel receiving your versions versus the originals?
           What specific language choices make your versions more professional?
           How does providing context help the recipient assist you better?
           What cultural assumptions about workplace communication did you need to adjust?
                                                                                                  4. SETTING GOALS AND MAKING PLANS | 72

Understanding Conversational Dynamics

Australian workplace conversations tend to be remarkably informal and direct, which can initially feel
surprising if you're from a more formal culture. For example, during a team meeting, it's perfectly normal
to hear colleagues speaking casually about project challenges or sharing ideas without elaborate
introductions or formal language structures. This informality, however, doesn't indicate a lack of
professionalism; rather, it reflects the egalitarian nature of Australian workplace culture.

Denniston's (2019) research reveals that formal language is generally reserved for specific contexts, such
as delivering presentations or responding to them. In day-to-day interactions, whether you're chatting
with colleagues in the break room or participating in team meetings, the communication style remains
conversational and focused on the topic at hand.<

Giving and Receiving Feedback

The Australian approach to feedback has distinct characteristics worth understanding. When offering
positive feedback, comments are typically directed personally and specifically. Instead of saying:

"The presentation was good," an Australian colleague might say:

"Jim, your analysis of the market trends was really insightful."

This direct, personal approach to positive feedback helps build stronger professional relationships.

Negative feedback, however, follows different rules. Australians generally avoid public criticism of
individuals. If there's a need to address performance issues or concerns, these conversations happen
privately, unless there's a specific meeting designated for group feedback. This approach helps maintain
professional dignity and workplace harmony.

The Volume Factor

An interesting finding from Clark's (1997) research provides encouraging news for non-native English
speakers: Australians show remarkable ability to understand non-fluent English, possibly due to their own
frequent use of colloquialisms and slang. However, this comes with an important caveat: being audible is
crucial. While it might feel more comfortable to speak quietly when you're uncertain about your English,
this can create more communication barriers than occasional language mistakes.

Speaking with adequate volume shows confidence and engagement, even if your English isn't perfect.
Australian colleagues are generally patient with language learners who speak up clearly but may find it
frustrating when they have to constantly ask someone to repeat themselves because they're speaking too
softly.
73 | 4. SETTING GOALS AND MAKING PLANS

Building Confidence Through Practice

Research from both Denniston et. al. (2019) and Clark (1997) emphasises that practising conversational
English during your university years significantly impacts your workplace communication abilities. This
suggests that engaging actively in class discussions, group projects, and casual conversations with classmates
provides valuable preparation for professional contexts. Each interaction helps build the confidence and
skills needed for workplace communication.
Consider these practical strategies for developing your spoken communication skills:

   Participate actively in tutorial discussions, even if you're not completely confident about your
      English.

   Join university study groups or conversation clubs where you can practice informal English.
   Record yourself speaking to become aware of your volume level.
   Practice explaining complex ideas in simple terms, a skill valued in Australian workplaces.
   Pay attention to how Australian classmates and teachers phrase their ideas and feedback.

   Remember

       Perfection isn't the goal: effective communication is. Australian workplaces value clarity and
       engagement over grammatical perfection. By focusing on being clear and audible, while
       understanding the cultural norms around formal versus informal communication, you can
       develop the confidence needed for successful workplace interactions.

     Activity 4.7: Professional Communication Development Plan

     This activity helps you create a structured plan for improving your workplace communication
     skills. By identifying specific areas for growth and setting measurable goals, you'll develop a
     clearer path toward confident professional communication in Australian workplaces.
     Part 1: Self-assessment
     Begin by reflecting honestly on your current communication strengths and challenges. Rate
     your confidence level (1-5) in these areas:
                                                                                           4. SETTING GOALS AND MAKING PLANS | 74

Written communication:

      Think about your ability to:

              write clear, professional emails
              adapt your tone for different workplace situations
              use appropriate greetings and closings
              express requests politely but directly
              respond to workplace messages promptly.

Spoken communication:

      Consider how comfortable you feel:

              speaking up in group meetings
              having casual conversations with colleagues
              explaining technical concepts clearly
              using an appropriate speaking volume
              asking questions when you need clarification.

Part 2: Goal development
Now, let's create SMART goals for improving your communication skills. SMART goals are:

      Specific: clear and well-defined.
      Measurable: you can track your progress.
      Achievable: realistic within your current situation.
      Relevant: connected to your professional development.
      Time-bound: has a deadline or timeline.

Example:
Instead of writing:
"I want to speak better English," try:
"Over the next three months, I will participate in at least two class discussions each week,
focusing on speaking at a volume where everyone in the room can hear me clearly."
Write three SMART goals:

      a goal for written communication
      a goal for spoken communication
      a goal for cultural understanding.

Part 3: Action planning

      What specific steps will you take to achieve this goal?
75 | 4. SETTING GOALS AND MAKING PLANS

           What resources do you need?
           How will you measure progress?
           What potential obstacles might you face? (Consider your own confidence as an obstacle

             here as well.)
           How will you overcome these obstacles?
           Who can support you in achieving this goal?
     Part 4: Progress tracking
     Create a weekly check-in schedule to monitor your progress.
     Week 1-4:

           What communication situations did you encounter?
           How did you handle them?
           What worked well?
           What could you improve?
           What adjustments do you need to make to your goals?
     Sample Progress Entry:
     "This week I sent three professional emails to my tutors. I remembered to use appropriate
     greetings and keep my messages clear and direct. I noticed I still apologise too much in my
     writing. Next week, I'll focus on being more confident in my requests."
     Part 5: Regular review
     Schedule monthly reviews of your progress by asking:

           How am I progressing toward each goal?
           What successes have I achieved?
           What challenges am I still facing?
           Do I need to adjust any goals?
           What new goals should I set?

   Remember

       Communication development is an ongoing journey. Small, consistent improvements lead to
       significant long-term growth in your professional communication abilities.

5. REFLECTIVE WRITING FOR YOUR
PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT

     Learning Objectives

     In this chapter, you will learn how to:
           understand the value and importance of reflective writing in professional contexts
           apply the DIEP (Describe, Interpret, Evaluate, Plan) framework to create meaningful
             reflective writing pieces
           transform your reflective writing practice into a powerful tool for ongoing professional
             growth and development.

     A Tale of Two Interns

     James and Michael started their policy internships at the Department of Infrastructure on the
     same Monday morning in February. Both were assigned to analyse the impact of remote work
     on urban planning, a complex project requiring data analysis, stakeholder interviews, and policy
     recommendations. While their academic backgrounds were similar, their approaches to the
     internship experience proved markedly different.
     From day one, James maintained a detailed reflective journal. Each evening, he spent twenty
     minutes writing about his experiences, challenges, and insights. He documented his learning
     process, including his initial confusion about government procedures, breakthroughs in
     understanding departmental dynamics, and strategies that helped him navigate the
     organisational culture. When faced with challenges, James used his writing to explore different
     perspectives and potential solutions, often arriving at innovative approaches through this
     reflective process.
79 | 5. REFLECTIVE WRITING FOR YOUR PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT

     Michael, however, dove straight into the technical aspects of the project without taking time to
     process his experiences. While he worked diligently, he found himself increasingly frustrated by
     bureaucratic processes and overwhelmed by the project's complexity. His initial confidence gave
     way to anxiety as he struggled to connect different aspects of the research and translate them
     into actionable policy recommendations. By the sixth week, he had amassed considerable data
     but struggled to synthesise it into meaningful conclusions.

     Noting the diverging progress, their supervisor asked James to help Michael get the project back
     on track. James approached this delicately, sharing his own early struggles and the strategies
     he'd developed. He noticed that while Michael had strong analytical skills, he seemed stuck in
     the details, unable to see the broader implications of their research. Through their
     conversations, James began to understand how his reflective practice had helped him maintain
     perspective and adapt to challenges that had similarly stumped Michael.
     In their final week, as they prepared their presentation for the department executives, Michael
     asked James how he'd managed to maintain such clear direction throughout the project.
     "Actually," James replied, "I've been keeping a reflective journal. Each day, I write about what
     I've learnt, what's challenging me, and how it all connects to our project goals. It helps me
     process the experience and spot patterns I might have missed otherwise. It's not just about
     documenting what happened, it's about making sense of it all." Michael nodded thoughtfully,
     realising how this kind of structured reflection might have helped him avoid some of his
     struggles.
                                                          5. REFLECTIVE WRITING FOR YOUR PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT | 80

     The internship concluded with a successful presentation, thanks to their combined efforts.
     While both interns had developed valuable skills, James's reflective practice had given him
     additional insights into organisational dynamics, project management, and his own professional
     growth, insights that would prove invaluable in his future career. Michael left with not just
     project experience, but also a new appreciation for the role of reflection in professional
     development.

Why Bother with Reflective Writing?

The story of James and Michael illustrates a pattern that researchers have observed repeatedly in internship
settings: the transformative power of reflective writing on professional development. Dr. Reinekke
Lengelle's research provides robust evidence that structured reflective writing during internships
significantly enhances employment outcomes. In her 2014 study of bachelor's students, those who engaged
in reflective writing practices received notably higher workplace evaluations from their employers, with
84% of their assessments rated as "excellent" or "very satisfactory" compared to a more distributed range
of ratings for non-writing students (Lengelle et al., 2014). Beyond immediate performance metrics, the
research revealed that reflective writers developed stronger professional identities and were better equipped
to articulate their experiences to future employers. They demonstrated enhanced `luck readiness', the
ability to recognise and capitalise on career opportunities, and showed greater career adaptability, a crucial
skill in today's dynamic job market (Lengelle et al., 2016). Perhaps most significantly, these students
were more likely to receive offers of continued employment or professional referrals from their internship
supervisors, with employers noting their superior ability to integrate feedback and contribute meaningfully
to workplace discussions.
Lengelle's research delves deeply into the mechanisms by which reflective writing enhances skill
development during internships. Her studies reveal that students who engage in reflective writing develop
what she terms a "double-loop learning" process. They not only acquire technical skills but also develop
81 | 5. REFLECTIVE WRITING FOR YOUR PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT

a sophisticated understanding of how and why they are learning (2014, p. 79). In particular, her 2016
study found that reflective writers showed marked improvement in three crucial areas: cognitive processing,
emotional intelligence, and professional adaptability. These students demonstrated superior ability to
connect theoretical knowledge with practical application, showing what Lengelle calls "meta positions",
the capacity to step back and analyse their own learning journey (Lengelle et al., 2016, p. 40). For instance,
while non-reflective students might simply learn how to complete a task, reflective writers could articulate
why certain approaches worked better than others, identify patterns in their learning, and adapt these
insights to new situations. The research particularly highlighted how reflective writing helped students
develop what employers consistently rate as highly desirable soft skills, including improved communication
abilities, better emotional regulation in challenging situations, and enhanced capacity for professional
relationship building. This mirrors the experience of James in our story, who developed not only project
management skills but also the emotional intelligence to help his struggling peer.

Lengelle's research demonstrates that:

   Students who engage in reflective writing show significantly higher development of `luck readiness',
      the ability to recognise and seize career opportunities. (Lengelle et al., 2016).

   Reflective writers demonstrate an enhanced capacity for `meta-positions', the ability to observe and
      analyse their own learning experiences objectively. (Lengelle et al., 2014).

   Employers rate reflective writing students more positively, with 84% receiving `excellent' or `very
      satisfactory' evaluations compared to a broader range for non-writers. (Lengelle et al., 2014).

   Students who write reflectively show superior emotional regulation and professional resilience when
      faced with workplace challenges. (Lengelle et al., 2016).

   Reflective writing enhances students' ability to connect theoretical knowledge with practical
      workplace applications, leading to better professional competency development. (Lengelle et al.,
      2014).

Utilising the DIEP Model of Reflective Writing

While Lengelle's research provides compelling evidence for maintaining a reflective journal during your
internship, you might wonder about the practical process of reflection itself. Many students find themselves
unsure where to begin, after all, there's a significant difference between casually writing about your day and
engaging in purposeful professional reflection that enhances your career development.

The DIEP model offers a structured approach to reflection that helps transform your daily experiences
into meaningful professional insights. This model, widely used in professional development contexts,
breaks down the reflective process into four key components: Describe, Interpret, Evaluate, and Plan.
Each component builds upon the previous one, helping you move from simple observation to actionable
professional development.
                                                          5. REFLECTIVE WRITING FOR YOUR PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT | 82

Think of the DIEP model as similar to the scientific method you likely use in your technical work. Just as
you wouldn't jump straight to conclusions in a laboratory experiment without first gathering and analysing
data, effective reflection requires a systematic approach to processing your experiences. The DIEP model
provides this structure, ensuring you don't miss crucial insights that could enhance your professional
development.

Consider this example: Imagine you've just completed your first major presentation to your internship
team. Rather than simply noting "That went well" or "I was nervous," the DIEP model guides you through
a deeper analysis:

   Describe: What actually happened during the presentation? What did you do? How did others
      respond?

   Interpret: Why did things unfold this way? What factors contributed to the outcomes you observed?
   Evaluate: What worked well and what could be improved? How does this experience align with your

      professional goals?
   Plan: Based on these insights, what specific actions will you take to enhance your presentation skills

      for next time?

This structured approach transforms a single experience into a valuable learning opportunity that
contributes to your professional growth. Students who systematically documented their experiences were
significantly more likely to identify and articulate specific skill development in professional contexts
(Dunne, 2017). In addition, Dunne (2017) found that structured reflection helped students move from
simply describing events to explicitly recognising and naming the professional competencies they were
developing, a crucial skill for future job interviews and career advancement. For example, students using a
structured approach were more than twice as likely to explicitly name skills like 'emotional intelligence' or
`collaborative working' compared to those who reflected more casually.

The power of structured reflection lies in its ability to bridge the gap between experience and professional
development. When students follow a systematic approach to reflection, they develop an enhanced capacity
to recognise and name specific professional competencies in their experiences. Rather than simply
describing events, they can explicitly connect their experiences to professional skill development, making
their learning more concrete and articulate (Dunne, 2017). In the following sections, we'll explore each
component of the DIEP model in detail, providing practical examples and templates to help you
implement this evidence-based approach in your own reflective practice.

Describe

In reflective writing, the describe phase focuses on capturing the raw details of your learning experience
before diving into deeper analysis. This initial step creates a foundation for meaningful reflection by
83 | 5. REFLECTIVE WRITING FOR YOUR PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT

establishing what occurred and what you learned from it. The key is to identify a specific moment of insight
or learning that stands out as significant to your professional development.
When describing your experience, aim to be objective and precise about what happened. Rather than
jumping straight to your feelings or interpretations, focus on the concrete details: what was said, what you
observed, what you did, or what you read. Include relevant contextual information like when and where
the learning occurred, and what specifically triggered your insight. This helps create a clear picture of the
learning moment that you can then examine more deeply.
Your description should focus on a single, specific insight rather than trying to cover multiple learning
points at once. This insight should represent something new that you've learned or realised, a moment
where your understanding shifted or deepened. While the insight itself might seem simple, capturing it
clearly is essential for the deeper reflection that follows. Think of this step as creating a snapshot of your
learning moment that you can then examine from different angles.

The most effective descriptions strike a balance between being concise and providing sufficient detail.
Include enough context that someone else could understand the situation but avoid including irrelevant
information that doesn't contribute to understanding your key insight. Remember that this description
serves as the foundation for your subsequent interpretation, analysis, and future planning.

     Example

     During my third week of internship at the environmental engineering firm, I learned the
                                                          5. REFLECTIVE WRITING FOR YOUR PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT | 84

     importance of double-checking all calculations, even for seemingly simple tasks. This insight
     came while I was working on a routine water quality analysis report. I had completed the
     chemical concentration calculations, which I had done many times before, and was about to
     send them to my supervisor. However, something made me pause and review the numbers one
     more time. During this review, I discovered I had made a small error in unit conversion that
     would have significantly affected the final recommendations. Thanks to this final check, I was
     able to correct the error before submitting the report.

This description clearly identifies the specific insight (the importance of double-checking calculations),
provides relevant context (the timing and setting), and explains what triggered the learning (finding an
error during a final review). It's detailed enough to understand the situation but remains focused on the
key learning moment.

     Activity 5.1: Understanding How to Describe Your Learning Moments

     Think of the describe phase as taking a clear photograph of your learning experience. Just like a
     good photograph captures the important details while keeping the focus sharp, your
     description should provide the key information about your learning moment without getting
     blurred by opinions or analysis.
     Let's practice this skill together through a guided activity:
     Step 1: Identifying your learning moment
     First, reflect on your past week of professional experience. Think about a moment when you
     learned something new. Perhaps it was a realisation about how things work, a new skill you
     developed, or an insight into professional practice. Choose one specific moment that stands out.
     Step 2: Crafting your description
     Now, write a description of this learning moment using these guiding questions:

           What exactly did you learn or realise?
           When and where did this learning occur?
           What was happening when you gained this insight?
           What specifically triggered your learning?
     Remember to:

           focus on observable facts rather than feelings or interpretations
85 | 5. REFLECTIVE WRITING FOR YOUR PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT

           include relevant context but avoid unnecessary details
           keep your description clear and specific
           focus on a single learning moment rather than multiple insights.
     Step 3: Self-review
     After writing your description, check it against these criteria:
           Could someone else understand what happened based on your description?
           Have you included the what, when, where, and how of your learning?
           Have you avoided including your opinions or analysis of the situation?
           Is your description focused on a single, specific insight?

             Here's a template to help structure your description:
             "During [when], while [context], I learned [specific insight]. This learning occurred when
             [describe the trigger or specific situation]. [Add any other relevant details that help understand
             the learning moment]."

     Looking at your description, highlight any words or phrases that express opinions or analysis.
     These should be saved for later stages of reflection. Your description should focus purely on
     what happened and what you learned.

   Remember

       A good description creates a solid foundation for the deeper reflection that follows. Take
       time to get this step right, as it will make the subsequent stages of reflection more
       meaningful and insightful.

Interpret

Building on the foundational work done in the describe phase, the interpret section moves your reflection
into deeper analytical territory. While description focuses on capturing what happened, interpretation
explores what it means, transforming your raw observations into meaningful insights about your learning
and development.
                                                          5. REFLECTIVE WRITING FOR YOUR PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT | 86

When interpreting your experience, you'll examine your described insight from multiple angles,
considering its broader implications and connections. This is where you begin to unpack why this learning
moment matters, how it relates to your existing knowledge, and what questions it raises for your future
practice. Rather than simply stating what you learned, you'll analyse how this new understanding might
influence your thinking and actions going forward.
Think of interpretation as being like a detective examining evidence. Just as a detective looks beyond
surface-level observations to understand the deeper story, your interpretation should look beyond the
immediate details of your learning experience to understand its significance. What might this insight reveal
about your professional development? How does it connect to theories or concepts from your coursework?
What assumptions or previous understandings might it challenge? These questions help transform your
description from a simple account of what happened into a meaningful exploration of your learning
journey.

The key to effective interpretation is making connections between your insight and your previous
knowledge, between theory and practice, between your immediate experience and broader professional
contexts. While description asks "What happened?", interpretation asks "What does this mean for my
learning and development?" This deeper analysis sets the stage for the evaluation and planning that will
follow in subsequent stages of your reflection.
In reflective writing, the interpret section moves beyond describing what happened to explore the deeper
meaning and significance of your insight. Rather than simply restating events, you examine why your
learning experience matters and how it connects to your broader professional development.
Consider how an engineering student might interpret their insight about double-checking calculations:

     Example
87 | 5. REFLECTIVE WRITING FOR YOUR PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT

     This experience with unit conversion errors has revealed important truths about engineering
     practice that go far beyond simple calculation checking. While the immediate lesson about
     verifying work is valuable, the deeper significance lies in understanding how routine tasks can
     have serious real-world impacts. In environmental engineering, even a small calculation error
     could lead to incorrect water quality recommendations, potentially affecting community health.
     This realisation transforms what might seem like basic double-checking into an essential
     professional responsibility.
     The timing of this insight, during my third week of internship, is particularly meaningful. As I
     was beginning to feel more confident in my role, this experience served as a crucial reminder
     that expertise isn't about never making mistakes. It's about developing systematic approaches
     to prevent errors from affecting outcomes. This understanding connects directly to what we
     learned in Professional Practice about engineering ethics and public safety responsibilities. The
     experience has also sparked important questions about how to develop robust quality control
     habits early in my career, especially when dealing with time pressures and competing deadlines.
     Perhaps most significantly, this experience has highlighted how professional judgment
     develops. That internal prompt to pause and review the calculations, despite my initial
     confidence, represents an emerging sense of professional intuition. It suggests I'm beginning to
     develop the kind of reflective practice that experienced engineers rely on to maintain high
     standards of work.

Notice how this interpretation examines the broader implications of the experience, makes connections to
professional practice and learning, and considers how this insight might influence future behaviour.

     Activity 5.2: Moving from Description to Deeper Understanding

     Let's practice developing your interpretation skills through a guided activity that builds on your
     description of a learning moment.
     Step 1: Starting with your description
     Take the description you wrote in our previous activity or use this example:
                                                   5. REFLECTIVE WRITING FOR YOUR PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT | 88

       During my third week of internship at the environmental engineering firm, I learned the
       importance of double-checking all calculations, even for seemingly simple tasks. This insight
       came while I was working on a routine water quality analysis report. I had completed the
       chemical concentration calculations, which I had done many times before, and was about to
       send them to my supervisor. However, something made me pause and review the numbers
       one more time. During this review, I discovered I had made a small error in unit conversion that
       would have significantly affected the final recommendations. Thanks to this final check, I was
       able to correct the error before submitting the report.

Step 2: Exploring deeper meaning
Take your description and answer these guiding questions. Write at least two sentences for
each.
Why does this insight matter?

      Think about:

              How might this learning affect your future practice?
              What broader principles does this insight reveal?
              What might have happened if you hadn't gained this insight?
              What connections can you make?
      Consider how this links to:

              your previous knowledge or experiences
              theories or concepts from your studies
              professional standards or practices
              broader industry implications
              What questions does this raise?
      Reflect on:

              What else do you need to learn?
              What assumptions has this challenged?
              What might you do differently in the future?
              What broader issues does this highlight?
Step 3: Crafting your interpretation
Now, combine your answers into a coherent paragraph that explores the meaning of your
89 | 5. REFLECTIVE WRITING FOR YOUR PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT

     insight. Start with a sentence that connects to your description, then weave together your
     responses about significance, connections, and questions.
     Step 4: Self-review
     Check your interpretation against these criteria:

           Have you moved beyond describing what happened to explain why it matters?
           Have you made meaningful connections to your learning or professional practice?
           Have you identified questions or implications for future practice?
           Does your interpretation demonstrate deeper thinking about the experience?
     Step 5: Peer discussion
     Find a classmate and share your interpretations. Discuss:

           What aspects of each other's interpretations seem particularly insightful?
           What additional perspectives could be considered?
           How might these insights apply in different professional contexts?

   Remember

       Effective interpretation transforms a simple observation into meaningful professional
       learning by examining its broader significance and implications. Your goal is to demonstrate
       how this insight contributes to your developing professional understanding.

Evaluate

While interpretation helps us understand the meaning of our insights, evaluation takes our reflection
further by assessing the value of what we've learned. This phase asks us to make thoughtful judgments
about how our learning experiences contribute to our professional development and future practice. When
evaluating your insights, you examine not just what you learned and what it means, but how this learning
will benefit you going forward. This might include assessing how your new understanding will change your
approach to professional tasks, enhance your confidence in certain areas, or influence your future decision-
making.

Effective evaluation requires examining your learning experience from multiple angles. Beyond simply
stating that something was useful, you need to articulate specifically how and why this learning matters
for your professional development. You might consider how your new understanding changes your
                                                          5. REFLECTIVE WRITING FOR YOUR PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT | 90

capabilities, influences your professional confidence, or shapes your approach to future challenges. For
instance, you could assess how a new insight affects your technical skills, your professional judgment, or
your ability to work with others.

Making connections to your broader professional or academic context strengthens your evaluation.
Consider how your learning aligns with professional standards, industry best practices, or theoretical
frameworks from your studies. This might involve examining how your new understanding supports or
challenges existing theories, or how it contributes to your developing professional identity. By grounding
your evaluation in these broader contexts, you demonstrate a deeper understanding of your learning's
significance within your field.
When evaluating your learning, it's important to be specific about future applications. Rather than making
general statements about usefulness, describe concrete ways you plan to apply your new understanding.
Think about how this learning might influence your decision-making, change your work practices, or
enhance your professional relationships. Consider also any limitations or conditions that might affect how
you apply this learning, being realistic about both the benefits and potential challenges of implementing
your new understanding demonstrates mature professional judgment.
Let's examine how to evaluate the learning experience of double-checking calculations.

     Example

     This experience with catching a unit conversion error has proven invaluable for my
     development as an environmental engineer. While it might seem like a simple lesson about
     checking calculations, understanding its importance has fundamentally changed how I approach
     all technical work. Previously, I viewed double-checking as a time-consuming extra step that
     demonstrated a lack of confidence. Now, I recognise it as an essential professional practice that
91 | 5. REFLECTIVE WRITING FOR YOUR PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT

     reflects a mature understanding of engineering responsibility. This shift in perspective has
     already improved my work quality and professional confidence.
     The most significant value of this learning lies in how it has transformed my understanding of
     professional judgment. I now appreciate that engineering expertise isn't just about being able to
     perform calculations correctly. It's about developing systematic approaches to ensure accuracy
     and safety. This realisation has changed how I structure my work time, deliberately building in
     review periods rather than rushing to complete tasks. In team projects, I've started advocating
     for peer review processes, which has not only improved our collective work quality but has also
     helped me develop valuable leadership skills.
     Looking ahead, I can see how this understanding will benefit my future practice in several ways.
     First, it provides a foundation for developing more robust quality control processes in my work.
     Second, it has enhanced my ability to mentor others by helping me articulate why certain
     professional practices matter. Perhaps most importantly, it has given me a deeper appreciation
     for how seemingly small decisions in engineering work can have significant real-world impacts.
     This awareness will guide my professional decision-making throughout my career, helping me
     maintain the high standards that environmental engineering demands.

Notice how this evaluation:

   makes specific judgments about the learning's value
   describes concrete changes in professional practice
   connects the learning to broader professional development
   looks forward to future applications
   demonstrates growth in professional understanding.

     Activity 5.3: Developing Your Evaluation Skills

     This activity helps you move beyond describing and interpreting your learning to making
     thoughtful judgments about its value for your professional development. Through guided
     practice, you'll learn to evaluate how your insights contribute to your growth as a professional.
     Part 1: Examining value
                                                   5. REFLECTIVE WRITING FOR YOUR PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT | 92

Take the learning experience you've been working with (or use our engineering calculation
example) and answer these questions in detail.
Think about the immediate value of your learning:

      How has this insight already changed how you work or think?
      What specific improvements have you noticed in your practice?
      How has it affected your professional confidence?

Consider the broader professional value:

      How does this learning align with professional standards in your field?
      What aspects of professional practice does it help you understand better?
      How might it influence your interactions with colleagues or clients?

Part 2: Looking forward
Write two paragraphs exploring future applications.
First paragraph: Focus on specific ways you plan to apply this learning in your future practice

      What processes or approaches will you modify?
      How will you incorporate this understanding into your daily work?
      What specific situations will benefit from this new knowledge?

Second paragraph: Consider broader professional implications

      How might this learning influence your long-term career development?
      What additional skills or knowledge might you need to develop?
      How could this understanding help you contribute to your field?

Part 3: Testing your evaluation
Review your writing by asking:

      Have you moved beyond just saying something was "useful" to explaining specifically
        how and why?

      Have you identified concrete changes in your practice or thinking?
      Have you considered both immediate and long-term benefits?
      Have you demonstrated how this learning contributes to your professional development?

Part 4: Peer discussion
Find a partner and take turns sharing your evaluations. For each other's work, discuss:

      What specific benefits or applications did your partner identify that you hadn't
        considered?

      How might their learning be valuable in different professional contexts?
93 | 5. REFLECTIVE WRITING FOR YOUR PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT

           What additional opportunities for applying this learning can you suggest?
           How does their evaluation demonstrate professional growth?

   Remember

       Strong evaluation demonstrates mature professional judgment by examining both the
       immediate and long-term value of your learning. Your goal is to show how this
       understanding contributes to your development as a professional in your field.

Plan

After evaluating the value and impact of our learning experiences, the natural next step is to consider how
we can deliberately apply these insights in our future practice. While evaluation helps us understand how
our learning has changed us, planning transforms these reflections into concrete actions that will shape our
professional development. This forward-looking phase moves us from understanding the significance of
what we've learned to map out specific ways to implement and build upon these insights, ensuring our
reflective learning translates into tangible professional growth.
The planning phase bridges the gap between reflection and action, helping us identify specific
opportunities to apply our learning and areas where we need to develop further. By thoughtfully
considering how we'll use our insights in future situations, we transform our reflective learning from a
passive understanding into an active guide for professional development.

When writing the planning section of your reflection, begin by identifying specific contexts where your
                                                          5. REFLECTIVE WRITING FOR YOUR PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT | 94

insights could be valuable. These typically fall into three main categories: your current academic program,
your future professional practice, and your broader personal development. Consider how your learning
might be relevant in each of these areas, being as specific as possible about potential applications.

For example, rather than simply stating "I will use these communication skills in my future career," you
might write: "Understanding the importance of clear documentation will be particularly valuable when
I begin my engineering career, especially in project handovers and team collaborations. I plan to develop
templates for different types of technical documentation to ensure consistent and thorough information
sharing."

Time frames are crucial in planning. Consider both immediate applications within your current studies
and longer-term implementations in your future career. You might discuss how you'll apply your learning
in upcoming assignments or group projects, as well as how these skills will transfer to professional
situations you expect to encounter after graduation

It's also important to identify any additional learning or development needed to fully implement your
insights. This might include recognising gaps in your knowledge or skills that need to be addressed. For
instance, you might write: "To build on my understanding of sustainable design principles, I will need
to familiarise myself with current environmental regulations and certification requirements. I plan to
complete online modules in environmental compliance during the semester break."

When writing your plan, use future tense to emphasise the forward-looking nature of this section. Begin
sentences with phrases like "I will..." or "This learning will be applied..." to clearly indicate your intended
actions. Be specific about how you will implement your insights, including concrete steps or strategies you
plan to use

Remember to connect your plans back to your professional context. Consider how your intended actions
align with industry expectations and professional standards in your field. This helps demonstrate that
your reflective learning is grounded in practical, professional applications rather than remaining purely
theoretical.

Finally, consider potential challenges or obstacles you might face in implementing your plans, and outline
strategies to address these. This shows that you've thought critically about the feasibility of your plans and
are prepared to overcome potential difficulties.

     Example
95 | 5. REFLECTIVE WRITING FOR YOUR PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT

     This experience with calculation verification will be particularly valuable as I progress through
     my environmental engineering degree and into my professional career. In my remaining
     coursework, I will implement a structured verification process for all technical assignments,
     setting aside a specific portion of time (at least 15% of the total allocated time) for thorough
     review. This approach will help embed good practices before I take on professional
     responsibilities where the stakes are much higher.
     When I begin my career as an environmental engineer, I will develop a comprehensive quality
     control checklist for different types of calculations and analyses. This checklist will include
     common conversion factors, typical value ranges for various parameters, and key verification
     steps. I plan to share this resource with my future teams, contributing to a culture of rigorous
     verification while helping junior engineers avoid similar mistakes.
     To further strengthen this practice, I will seek out opportunities to learn about quality control
     systems used in environmental engineering firms. During my remaining internship time, I plan
     to discuss this topic with senior engineers, understanding how they've developed their
     verification processes over their careers. This knowledge will help me build more robust
     professional practices early in my career.
     In the broader context of professional development, I will use this insight to develop a more
     comprehensive approach to risk management in engineering work. This includes not only
     calculation verification but also understanding how different components of environmental
     analysis interconnect and influence final recommendations. I plan to maintain a log of near-miss
     incidents (like this unit conversion catch) to help identify patterns and develop more effective
     preventive measures.
     Beyond my individual practice, I anticipate using this experience when I eventually mentor
     junior engineers or interns. I will share not just the technical lesson about double-checking
     calculations, but also the deeper understanding about professional responsibility and the
     development of engineering judgment. This will help create a positive cycle of learning and
     improvement within the profession.

By following these guidelines, your planning section will effectively bridge the gap between reflection and
action, creating a clear roadmap for applying your learning in meaningful ways. This approach ensures that
your reflective practice contributes directly to your professional development and growth.

     Activity 5.4: Developing Professional Plans Through Research-Informed Reflection
                                                   5. REFLECTIVE WRITING FOR YOUR PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT | 96

This activity helps you transform personal insights into professional development plans by
connecting your experiences with industry standards and professional expectations. Through
research and reflection, you'll create a detailed plan that aligns your learning with professional
practice.
Part 1: Starting with experience
Begin with your descriptive reflection about a significant learning moment from your
placement. You can use your own reflection or this example:

       During my third week of internship at the environmental engineering firm, I learned the
       importance of double-checking all calculations, even for seemingly simple tasks. This insight
       came while I was working on a routine water quality analysis report. I had completed the
       chemical concentration calculations, which I had done many times before, and was about to
       send them to my supervisor. However, something made me pause and review the numbers
       one more time. During this review, I discovered I had made a small error in unit conversion that
       would have significantly affected the final recommendations. Thanks to this final check, I was
       able to correct the error before submitting the report.

Part 2: Professional context research
Before developing your plan, research the professional context of your insight:

      Professional Association Standards

              Identify the key professional associations in your field (e.g., Engineers Australia,
                Australian Institute of Environmental Engineers).

              Review their professional practice standards and guidelines.
              Find specific standards or guidelines related to your insight (e.g., quality control

                processes, verification procedures, ethics or code of conduct).
              Document how your insight connects to these professional standards.

      Industry Best Practices

              Research current best practices in your field related to your insight.
              Find at least two peer-reviewed articles or industry publications discussing these

                practices.
              Identify any emerging trends or developments in this area.
              Note how these practices might influence your future professional development.

Part 3: Development planning
97 | 5. REFLECTIVE WRITING FOR YOUR PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT

     Using your research and reflection, identify professional development related to your
     experience. Highlight:

           Immediate Applications (Current Studies)

                   How will you apply this learning in your remaining coursework?
                   What specific assignments or projects could benefit from this insight?
                   What additional skills do you need to develop?
           Early Career Implementation

                   How will you apply this learning in your first professional role?
                   What systems or processes will you develop?
                   How does this align with professional standards you've researched?
           Long-term Professional Growth

                   How might this insight influence your career trajectory?
                   What ongoing professional development will you need?
                   How will you contribute to your profession's development in this area?
     Part 4: Writing your plan reflection
     Using your research and reflections, write a detailed plan section that connects your personal
     insight to professional standards while outlining specific implementation strategies. Your plan
     reflection should move from immediate applications through to long-term professional
     development.
     Begin by identifying specific contexts where you'll apply this learning, referencing the
     professional standards and best practices you've researched. For example:

             The importance of systematic calculation verification, as emphasised in Engineers Australia's
             Standard 3.2, will inform both my remaining studies and future engineering practice. In my
             final year of coursework, I will implement a structured verification process aligned with
             industry best practices, allocating specific time for peer review and documentation. This
             approach aligns with the Australian Institute of Environmental Engineers' guidelines on quality
             control in environmental assessments.

     Then, describe specific strategies for implementing your learning, connecting these to your
     research findings. For example:
                                                   5. REFLECTIVE WRITING FOR YOUR PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT | 98

       Drawing on current industry practices identified in the Journal of Environmental Engineering, I
       will develop a comprehensive verification checklist incorporating both technical accuracy and
       contextual reasonableness checks. This system will evolve through my early career as I gain
       experience with different types of environmental assessments and their specific requirements.

Consider your longer-term professional development needs, using your research to identify
areas for growth:

       To further develop my professional capabilities in this area, I plan to pursue specialised training
       in quality management systems, particularly focusing on environmental monitoring and
       assessment. The Environmental Institute of Australia and New Zealand offers professional
       development courses in this area, which will help me build on my current understanding while
       staying current with evolving industry standards.

End by connecting your plans back to broader professional responsibility:

       By implementing these structured approaches to verification and continuing to develop my
       professional practices, I will contribute to maintaining the high standards our profession
       demands while helping to mentor future environmental engineers in developing similar
       rigorous approaches.

Remember to:
      reference specific professional standards and guidelines you've researched
      connect your personal learning to industry best practices
      outline concrete implementation steps
      consider both immediate and long-term applications
      show how your plans align with professional expectations
      use future tense to emphasise planned actions
      maintain a professional tone while showing personal commitment to growth.
99 | 5. REFLECTIVE WRITING FOR YOUR PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT

Your plan reflection should demonstrate thoughtful consideration of how your learning experience
connects to professional practice while providing clear pathways for implementation and development.

Maintaining Reflective Practice

Developing a consistent reflective practice during your internship helps build professional insight and
document your growth. Think of these weekly reflections as creating a professional learning journal that
you can draw upon throughout your career. Here's how to make the most of this practice:

                   An interactive H5P element has been excluded from this version of the text. You can view it
                   online here:
        https://jcu.pressbooks.pub/stem-advantage/?p=309#h5p-34

   Remember

       Reflective writing is itself a skill that develops over time. Your early reflections might feel
       basic or uncertain. This is completely normal. As you progress through your internship, you'll
       likely find your reflections becoming more nuanced and insightful. What matters most is
       maintaining the practice consistently and pushing yourself to think deeply about your
       learning each week.
                                                        5. REFLECTIVE WRITING FOR YOUR PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT | 100

By maintaining thoughtful weekly reflections, you're not just documenting your internship experience,
you're actively shaping your professional development and creating a valuable resource for your future
career. Each reflection builds upon previous insights, helping you develop the kind of thoughtful, reflective
practice that characterises successful professionals in your field.

     Key Takeaways

6. USING ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE IN
THE WORKPLACE

     Learning Objectives

     In this chapter, you will learn how to:
           develop personalised strategies for effectively integrating artificial intelligence tools into
             your professional workflow while maintaining authenticity in your work
           apply artificial intelligence tools ethically and productively to enhance your professional
             capabilities without compromising academic or workplace integrity
           evaluate different approaches to artificial intelligence use across various professional
             contexts to determine appropriate applications for your field.

     Imagine this Scenario

     Sarah, Wei, and Priya started their summer internships at Horizon Solutions on the same
     Monday in June. All three were assigned to the product strategy team, tasked with analysing
     market opportunities and developing recommendations for clients. Their supervisor, James,
     gave them similar projects to start. Each needed to research emerging trends in their assigned
     industry sectors and prepare detailed reports with actionable insights. James also arranged for
     the interns to be given access to the company's full suite of artificial intelligence tools and
     encouraged the students to use them.
     Sarah embraced artificial intelligence tools with unbridled enthusiasm but little strategy. She
     would paste entire research briefs into AI assistants and accept the outputs without
     verification. While she turned in assignments remarkably quickly, her work often contained
     subtle but significant errors: misquoted statistics, outdated market data, and occasionally
103 | 6. USING ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE IN THE WORKPLACE

     recommendations that didn't align with the client's actual capabilities. "I'm being efficient," she
     would say when questioned, but her team members began double-checking all her numbers,
     which ultimately created more work.
     Wei took the opposite approach. A self-proclaimed AI sceptic, he insisted on doing everything
     manually, from market research to data analysis to report writing. While his work was generally
     accurate, he consistently missed check-in deadlines and struggled to process the volume of
     information needed for comprehensive analysis. His productivity lagged notably behind his
     peers, and he often stayed late trying to catch up on work that could have been streamlined.
     Priya developed what she called a "partnership approach" with AI tools. She learned to identify
     which tasks benefited from AI assistance (like initial data sorting and identifying patterns in
     large datasets) and which required human judgment and verification (like understanding client
     context and making strategic recommendations). She would use AI to generate initial drafts but
     always enhanced them with her own analysis and industry knowledge. Her process led to
     consistently high-quality work delivered on time, with original insights that went beyond
     surface-level analysis.

     The differences became starkly apparent during their final report, a comprehensive analysis of
     the electric vehicle charging market. Sarah's report, completed in record time, contained several
     outdated statistics and failed to account for recent regulatory changes. Wei produced thorough
     research but missed key market opportunities because he couldn't process the vast amount of
     available data in time. Priya's report struck the perfect balance, leveraging AI to process vast
     amounts of market data while applying her own critical thinking to develop nuanced, actionable
     recommendations.
     By summer's end, Priya's balanced approach had not only improved her productivity
     significantly but also enhanced the quality of her analysis. Her integration of AI tools with
     human insight allowed her to take on additional projects while maintaining exceptional
     standards. She developed a reputation for delivering work that was both thorough and
     innovative, demonstrating that the future of professional work likely lies not in wholesale
                                                                        6. USING ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE IN THE WORKPLACE | 104

     adoption or rejection of AI, but in learning to become what some called a "centaur", combining
     the strengths of both human and machine intelligence.
     As the internship program concluded, James reflected that Priya's approach represented the
     future of professional work, neither blindly embracing nor rejecting new tools, but thoughtfully
     integrating them to enhance human capabilities. Her success showed that the key to effective
     AI use wasn't just about access to the technology, but about developing the wisdom to know
     when and how to use it.

Developing an Approach to Using AI

Research by Dell'Acqua et al. (2023) on AI integration in professional settings reveals a fascinating
phenomenon they call the "jagged technological frontier", where AI's capabilities vary dramatically across
different tasks in sometimes surprising ways. Their study of 758 consultants at Boston Consulting Group
demonstrated that thoughtful AI integration could increase productivity by 12.2% and improve work
quality by over 40%, while misapplied AI could decrease performance by 19%. These findings are
powerfully illustrated through the story of three interns, Sarah, Wei, and Priya, whose different approaches
to AI integration mirror the patterns observed in the research. Just as Priya discovered through careful
experimentation what the researchers would later quantify, the key to successful AI integration lies not in
wholesale adoption or rejection, but in developing the wisdom to understand which tasks benefit from AI
assistance and which require more direct human oversight. Like the high-performing consultants in the
study, Priya's "centaur" approach of strategically combining human and machine capabilities demonstrates
how the future of professional work will likely depend on our ability to thoughtfully navigate this new
technological frontier.

       tasks make their findings particularly valuable for understanding AI's impact on knowledge
       work.

       The researchers identified what they call a "jagged technological frontier" in AI capabilities, a
       key theoretical contribution to our understanding of AI integration in the workplace. This
       frontier isn't smooth or predictable; instead, AI might excel at tasks that seem complex while
       struggling with others that appear simple. The researchers demonstrated this through
       carefully designed experiments where consultants completed both tasks within AI's
       capabilities (like creative product development) and tasks just outside its frontier (like
       certain types of data analysis requiring subtle interpretation of qualitative information).

       The results were striking: when working on tasks within AI's capabilities, consultants using
       AI completed 12.2% more tasks and worked 25.1% faster than those without AI access. More
       importantly, the quality of their work improved dramatically, showing more than 40%
       higher quality compared to the control group. However, when tasks fell outside AI's
       capabilities, consultants using AI were 19 percentage points less likely to produce correct
       solutions than those working without AI. This finding highlights the critical importance of
       understanding where tasks fall relative to AI's capabilities.

       Perhaps most intriguingly, the researchers identified two distinct patterns of successful AI
       integration. Some professionals adopted what they termed a "Centaur" approach,
       strategically dividing tasks between human and AI capabilities, much like the mythical
       creature that is half-human and half-horse. Others became "Cyborgs," deeply integrating AI
       into their workflow with continuous interaction between human and machine. Both
       approaches proved effective when matched appropriately to the task at hand. The research
       also revealed that AI integration had the most dramatic impact on below-average
       performers, helping them improve by 43%, while top performers still saw a significant 17%
       improvement.

       The implications of this research extend far beyond the consulting industry. The study
       suggests that organisations need to develop new frameworks for understanding AI
       capabilities, train employees in effective AI integration, and potentially redesign workflows
       to optimise human-AI collaboration. The researchers' identification of the "jagged frontier"
       challenges simplistic notions about AI adoption and suggests that success with AI tools
       requires careful consideration of where and how they are deployed. This nuanced
       understanding of AI capabilities and limitations could help organisations avoid the pitfalls of
       both over-reliance and under-utilisation of AI tools while maximising their potential
       benefits.
                                                                        6. USING ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE IN THE WORKPLACE | 106

The concept of the "jagged technological frontier" provides a useful framework for understanding how to
integrate AI effectively in professional settings. As we know from the research, this uneven distribution of
AI capabilities across different task types creates both opportunities and challenges.
The Boston Consulting Group study's findings about the 40% quality improvement and 12.2%
productivity increase among consultants who used AI thoughtfully reinforce why strategic integration
matters. These metrics, combined with the concerning 19% decrease in performance when AI was
misapplied, highlight the importance of developing nuanced judgment about AI tool usage.
Consider how these findings manifest in our three interns' approaches. Sarah's indiscriminate AI use
exemplifies the pitfalls identified in the research when professionals operate beyond AI's capabilities. Wei's
complete avoidance of AI illustrates the opportunity cost of missing the documented productivity gains.
Priya's approach aligns with the successful integration patterns identified in the research, demonstrating
how understanding AI's capability boundaries leads to optimal outcomes.
The research's identification of "Centaur" and "Cyborg" patterns provides valuable models for
professional AI integration. Priya's strategic task division exemplifies the Centaur approach, while the
Cyborg model offers an alternative path for deeper AI integration. Both patterns, as we know, require
thoughtful consideration of AI's evolving capabilities.

The study's finding that below-average performers improved by 43% while top performers gained 17% has
significant implications for workforce development. This differential impact suggests that thoughtful AI
integration can serve as a powerful levelling mechanism while still benefiting high performers.
These insights fundamentally reshape our understanding of professional AI integration. Rather than
viewing AI adoption as a binary choice, the research demonstrates the importance of developing what we
might call "AI literacy" or, the ability to navigate this jagged frontier effectively. Success, as both the research
107 | 6. USING ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE IN THE WORKPLACE

and Priya's example show, comes from understanding AI as a tool for augmenting human capabilities
rather than replacing them.

The Three Types of AI Workers

Think of choosing your AI integration approach like choosing a transportation method. A non-user is
like someone who only walks everywhere. They maintain complete control and independence, but might
struggle to keep pace in situations where faster travel is expected. The research shows that while non-users
avoid certain ethical complications, they often fall behind productivity benchmarks that assume some level
of technological integration.
A Centaur approach is like someone who drives for specific trips but walks for others, making deliberate
choices about when each mode serves them best. The Harvard and Boston Consulting Group study
highlights both the benefits and risks here. While Centaurs can effectively leverage AI for specific tasks,
their confidence in their AI usage sometimes exceeds their actual skill, leading to that concerning 19% error
rate Dell'Acqua et. al. (2023) identified.

The Cyborg approach is like someone who uses various vehicles for every journey, a car, bike, scooter,
depending on the specific need. While this comprehensive integration can significantly boost efficiency, it
comes with higher stakes. Just as relying entirely on vehicles might leave you stranded if they break down,
Cyborgs can experience heightened stress when AI tools don't perform as expected.
To make this decision, consider asking yourself:

   What does your work primarily involve? Different fields may benefit more from different
      approaches.

   How comfortable are you with technological change? Cyborg approaches require constant
      adaptation.

   What are the consequences of errors in your work? The Harvard/BCG study's findings about
      Centaur error rates might be more concerning in some fields than others.

   How important is independent skill maintenance in your profession? Some fields require
                                                                 6. USING ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE IN THE WORKPLACE | 108

 maintaining strong non-AI capabilities.

     Part 3: Decision making and reflection (10 minutes)
     Based on your exploration, write a reflection addressing:

           Which approach best aligns with your:
                   professional requirements
                   personal work style
                   risk tolerance
                   learning preferences.

           What specific steps will you take to:
                   develop necessary skills for your chosen approach
                   mitigate identified risks
                   maintain professional effectiveness
                   adapt to changing technology.

           How might your approach need to evolve as:
                   your career progresses
                   AI capabilities change
                   industry standards shift.

           Share your reflection with your group, discussing:
                   How did others' perspectives influence your decision?
                   What concerns remain about your chosen approach?
                   What resources might you need to implement your approach effectively?

   Remember

       There's no universally "right" approach. The goal is to find the integration style that best
       serves your professional development and work requirements.

Using Artificial Intelligence Ethically in the
Workplace

In today's rapidly evolving workplace, the integration of artificial intelligence tools like ChatGPT has
                                                                        6. USING ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE IN THE WORKPLACE | 110

created both unprecedented opportunities and significant ethical challenges. While AI can dramatically
enhance your efficiency and innovation, the manner in which organisations choose to implement and use
these tools profoundly impacts their effectiveness and ethical implications. Their research identifies several
key workplace applications where AI tools can provide meaningful support, including:

   data mining and analysis for research and operational insights
   language editing and enhancement of written communications
   generation of preliminary ideas and content drafts
   technical calculations and problem-solving in fields like engineering
   administrative task automation and streamlining
   real-time translation and cross-cultural communication support
   personalised learning content development for workplace training.

However, Griszbacher (2024) emphasises that the decision of how to approach AI implementation extends
far beyond simply selecting appropriate software. It requires careful consideration of data privacy, bias
mitigation, transparency, and the maintenance of human agency in decision-making processes. As AI
becomes increasingly embedded in workplace operations, organisations must thoughtfully evaluate not
just what AI tools to adopt, but how to implement them in ways that uphold professional integrity, protect
employee wellbeing, and ensure responsible innovation. This makes the development of ethical AI usage
frameworks a crucial priority for modern workplaces seeking to harness AI's benefits while proactively
addressing its risks.

As an intern entering a workplace, you'll likely encounter various systems and policies governing the use
of AI. Understanding these frameworks within your workplace is crucial for navigating your early career
effectively. Most organisations now have structured approaches to AI implementation that directly affect
how you'll interact with these technologies in your daily work. For example, you might find that while AI
helps analyse data or generate initial reports, your supervisor will always review AI-generated outputs with
you, providing context and helping you understand how to interpret and use these insights effectively. This
human oversight isn't just a formality, it's part of a carefully designed system ensuring that AI remains a
tool to enhance your work rather than replace your professional judgment.
111 | 6. USING ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE IN THE WORKPLACE

You'll also discover that many organisations have what's known as "social contracts" regarding AI usage,
essentially, clear guidelines about how AI should and shouldn't be used in the workplace (Wright &
Schultz, 2018). These policies are particularly important to you because they protect your interests while
you're developing your professional expertise. For instance, if AI tools are used to track your early
performance or suggest training opportunities, you'll have the opportunity to discuss these assessments
with your managers and provide input. Most organisations will provide training about their AI systems
during your onboarding, explaining not just how to use these tools but also the ethical considerations
behind them. You might even be invited to participate in AI ethics committees or feedback sessions, giving
you a voice in how these technologies are implemented in your workplace. This involvement can be a
valuable opportunity to develop both your technical and leadership skills early in your career.

Not every organisation has embraced artificial intelligence with open arms, and many organisations
maintain restrictive policies around AI usage due to legitimate concerns about data security, privacy, and
regulatory compliance. For interns entering these environments, understanding that these restrictions
aren't merely bureaucratic obstacles but often reflect serious considerations about protecting sensitive
information, maintaining client confidentiality, and ensuring consistent quality control is crucial. Security
concerns are particularly relevant in fields handling personal, financial, or proprietary data, where even
                                                                         6. USING ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE IN THE WORKPLACE | 112

seemingly harmless AI tools could potentially expose the organisation to significant risks (Jackson &
Allen, 2024). Rather than viewing these policies as limitations, interns benefit from approaching them as
important guardrails that protect both the organisation and its stakeholders.

Within these constraints, interns can still engage with AI ethically and professionally by focusing on
approved tools and processes whilst maintaining transparent communication about their technology use.
This involves being upfront with supervisors about AI tool preferences, clearly documenting any approved
AI assistance usage, and ensuring all AI-supported work goes through appropriate review channels. For
example, if a workplace allows AI for specific tasks like data analysis but prohibits it for client
communications, respecting these boundaries absolutely whilst seeking opportunities to demonstrate the
value of permitted AI use through careful documentation and quality results is essential. When uncertainty
arises about whether an AI tool is appropriate for a particular task, seeking explicit guidance from
supervisors rather than making assumptions represents the best approach. This commitment to
transparency and respect for organisational policies helps build trust whilst positioning interns as
professionals who can thoughtfully balance innovation with security requirements.

     Activity 6.2: Navigating AI Implementation in Your Internship

     Read the following scenario carefully:
     Mateo has started his internship at TechnoCore Solutions, a medium-sized consulting firm.
     Throughout his university undergraduate studies, he frequently used AI tools to enhance his
     work and research projects. However, on his first day in Australia, he learns that TechnoCore
     has strict policies around AI usage: all AI-assisted work must be clearly documented, AI cannot
     be used for client communications, and all AI-generated content must undergo human review
     before being incorporated into any deliverables.
     In his second week, Mateo's supervisor assigns him a major data analysis project examining five
     years of client feedback to identify emerging trends and patterns. Looking at the sheer volume
     of data, Mateo realises this task would take several days of manual analysis, but he could
     complete it in just a few hours using AI tools he's familiar with from university. He wants to
     make a good impression with efficient work, but he's uncertain how to proceed under
     TechnoCore's AI policies.
     Later that week, after attending several project meetings, Mateo finds himself responsible for
     drafting the internal meeting summaries. He knows AI could help him create comprehensive
     summaries quickly, particularly useful since English is his second language. However, while
113 | 6. USING ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE IN THE WORKPLACE

     reviewing the company's AI policy documentation, he notices there's no clear guidance about
     using AI for internal communications, leaving him unsure about the appropriate approach.
     The situation becomes more complex when one of his colleagues, impressed by his data
     analysis work, suggests they use AI to help brainstorm solutions for a challenging client
     problem. "We don't need to tell anyone since it's just for initial ideas," his colleague says with a
     wink. Mateo feels uncomfortable with this suggestion, remembering the strict policy about AI
     use in client-related work, but he also doesn't want to damage this budding professional
     relationship.

     Part 1: Navigating the scenarios:
           Consider the data analysis project. How could Mateo propose using AI tools for this task
             in a way that demonstrates both efficiency and respect for TechnoCore's policies? Think
             about specific documentation and approval processes he might suggest to his supervisor.
           In the meeting summaries situation, where policy guidance is unclear, what principles
             should guide Mateo's decision-making about AI use? Consider how his role as an intern
             and a non-native English speaker might influence this decision.
           When his colleague suggests using undisclosed AI for client work, how might Mateo
             maintain positive professional relationships while upholding ethical standards and
             company policies? Consider suggesting an alternative approach that achieves both goals.
           Looking across all three situations, how do they reflect the broader challenge of
             balancing technological efficiency with professional responsibility and organisational
             requirements? What consistent principles could Mateo apply when facing AI-related
             decisions?
           How might Mateo's international background and previous experience with AI tools at
                                                                  6. USING ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE IN THE WORKPLACE | 114

        university both help and hinder his navigation of TechnoCore's AI policies? Consider how
        cultural differences in workplace norms and technology use might influence his approach.
Part 2: Professional email exercise
Task: Write a professional email from Mateo to his supervisor seeking clarification about AI
usage for the data analysis project. This task will help develop skills in professional
communication and ethical technology use.
Email writing guidelines:

      the email should demonstrate understanding of existing policies
      present a clear business case for AI usage in this specific context
      propose specific documentation and review processes
      maintain a professional yet collaborative tone
      show respect for organisational security considerations.
Here is a model email structure to guide your response:

       Subject Line: Clarification Request: AI-Assisted Data Analysis for Client Feedback Project
       Dear [Supervisor's name],
       First paragraph: Reference the assigned project and current status.
       Second paragraph: Present the proposed AI approach and its benefits.
       Third paragraph: Acknowledge company policies and suggest compliance measures.
       Fourth paragraph: Request guidance and propose next steps

Your email should be approximately 200-250 words. Consider how to balance efficiency gains
with policy compliance, and how to demonstrate professional judgment while seeking guidance
as an intern.
After writing your email:

      Review it from your supervisor's perspective. Have you provided all the information they
        need to make an informed decision?

      Consider what questions or concerns they might have and whether your email addresses
        these proactively.

      Evaluate whether your tone strikes the right balance between initiative and respect for
        organisational hierarchy.
115 | 6. USING ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE IN THE WORKPLACE

     Part 3: Reflecting on ethical AI usage
     Write a reflective piece (approximately 300-400 words) addressing the following prompt:
     Consider how your approach to using AI tools might evolve throughout your internship and
     early career. Drawing from Mateo's situation, explore how you would develop your own
     framework for making decisions about AI use in professional settings.

Don't forget the DIEP structure we encountered in Chapter 5. This may help you write your
reflection in greater detail and clarity:

Describe Describe the event factually

Interpret Interpret the event for its meaning and significance

Evaluate Evaluate its importance

Plan  Plan for future scenarios

Your reflection should consider:

Working with Artificial Intelligence on Internship

The story of Priya, Wei, and Sarah at the beginning of the chapter illustrates a key insight that aligns with
Industry 5.0's emphasis on human-machine collaboration. Just as Industry 5.0 seeks to create "symbiotic
relationships between humans and machines" (Gamberini & Pluchino, 2024, p. 6), successful interns need
to develop human-centric connected systems. During your internship, you will have a unique opportunity
to experiment with finding this balance in a supported environment. Gamberini & Pluchino emphasise
that Industry 5.0 focuses on "merging the creativity and expertise of human experts with efficient and
intelligent machines" (2024, p. 5) rather than replacing humans with automation. This is exactly what
Priya demonstrated in her approach. She didn't just use AI tools blindly like Sarah or reject them entirely
like Wei, but rather developed a nuanced understanding of how to leverage AI's strengths while applying
her own critical thinking and professional judgment.
                                                                         6. USING ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE IN THE WORKPLACE | 116

An internship provides an ideal testing ground for developing these crucial capabilities. When interns like
Priya experiment thoughtfully with AI tools, they aren't just learning to use specific technologies, they're
developing skills such as curiosity, resilience, flexibility, agility, and systems thinking. These are precisely
the attributes that are essential for adapting to changes brought about by automation and digitalisation.
By practising this balanced approach during your internships, you can begin building the professional
capabilities you'll need throughout your career in an increasingly AI-enabled workplace.

Selecting AI Platforms for Professional Development

When beginning your journey with AI tools, the first step is selecting appropriate platforms that align with
your professional needs. While numerous AI platforms exist, it's important to approach platform selection
strategically rather than attempting to master every available tool. Each platform has distinct strengths and
capabilities that make it suitable for different professional tasks.
Currently, several major platforms dominate the professional landscape. OpenAI's ChatGPT provides
broad capabilities in text generation and analysis. Microsoft's Copilot excels in both text and image
generation tasks, making it particularly valuable for creative and visual projects. Google's Bard offers strong
capabilities in current events analysis and data interpretation. Anthropic's Claude demonstrates strength in
detailed analysis and precise writing tasks, especially valuable for professional documentation and research.

Rather than attempting to become proficient with every available platform, consider developing expertise
with two or three that complement each other and align with your professional needs. For instance, you
might pair a platform strong in visual generation (like Microsoft Copilot) with one specialising in detailed
writing and analysis (like Claude). This approach allows you to develop deep proficiency with specific tools
rather than surface-level familiarity with many.
When selecting your platforms, consider these factors:

   the specific requirements of your professional field
   the types of tasks you most commonly need to accomplish
   the platform's reliability and accuracy for your use cases
117 | 6. USING ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE IN THE WORKPLACE

   the platform's ability to integrate with your existing workflow
   the platform's approach to data privacy and security.

Remember that platform selection is not a permanent decision. As you develop experience and as the
technology evolves, you may adjust your choices based on changing needs and capabilities. The goal is to
build a toolkit that enhances your professional capabilities while maintaining your judgment and expertise
as the guiding force in your work.

Bringing AI into Your Daily Professional Practice

Think of learning to work with AI like learning a new language. Immersion is key to developing fluency.
Instead of reserving AI tools only for complex or challenging tasks, incorporate them into your regular
workflow for routine activities. This approach serves two important purposes: it helps you develop comfort
and competency with the tools while also helping the AI learn to match your professional communication
style and standards.

Consider starting with straightforward professional communications. When booking travel for
conferences or meetings, use AI to draft your initial emails to hotels and airlines. While you could certainly
write these emails yourself, having AI generate a first draft gives you opportunities to refine its output and
teach it your preferred tone and style. For instance, if the AI's draft is too formal or casual, you can adjust
it and use similar prompts in the future with notes about your preferred formality level.

Professional documentation provides another excellent opportunity for AI collaboration. When working
with spreadsheets, instead of immediately searching online for formula solutions, engage with AI to
help construct them. This process not only helps you complete the immediate task but also builds your
understanding of formula logic through the AI's explanations. You might ask the AI to explain its thought
process or suggest alternative approaches, turning each interaction into a learning opportunity.
                                                                         6. USING ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE IN THE WORKPLACE | 118

Discussion forums and professional networking platforms offer particularly valuable opportunities to
develop your AI collaboration skills. Rather than simply using AI to generate responses, engage with it
as a thought partner. Share your initial ideas and ask the AI to help you refine them or consider different
perspectives. This approach helps you maintain your authentic voice while leveraging AI's ability to suggest
enhancements or identify areas that might benefit from clarification.

The key is to view these everyday interactions as training opportunities, both for yourself and the AI. Each
time you refine an AI-generated draft or adjust its tone to better match your professional style, you're
developing your ability to effectively collaborate with these tools while teaching them to better serve your
needs. Think of it as developing a professional partnership rather than simply using a tool.

Building an Effective Partnership with AI

The key to productive AI collaboration lies in understanding that these systems are designed to engage
in natural, conversational interactions. Just as clear communication and professional courtesy enhance
human workplace relationships, they also improve the quality of AI interactions. When we frame our
requests with clarity, context, and courtesy, we create conditions for more precise and useful AI responses.

Consider how you would approach a knowledgeable colleague for assistance. You wouldn't simply demand
information, you would provide context, explain your needs, and frame your request respectfully. The
same principle applies to AI interactions. Instead of issuing abrupt commands like "Write hotel email," take
a moment to set the stage with context and specific parameters. For example: "I need to write a professional
email to confirm my hotel booking for a business conference. The booking is for three nights starting
July 15th at the Marriott downtown. Could you help me draft an email that's courteous and includes all
essential details?" This approach gives the AI the context it needs to generate more relevant and useful
responses.
119 | 6. USING ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE IN THE WORKPLACE

This principle extends beyond simple task requests. When working on complex projects, treat the AI
as a collaborative partner by sharing your thought process and objectives. For example, when starting a
data analysis project, you might say: "I'm analysing customer feedback data to identify trends in product
satisfaction. Could you help me think through effective approaches to categorising this data? I'd
particularly like to focus on identifying recurring themes in the comments." By providing this level of
context and engaging in a more collaborative dialogue, you enable the AI to provide more targeted and
valuable assistance while maintaining your role as the decision-maker guiding the process.

Learning Together: The Feedback Loop in AI
Collaboration

Effective AI collaboration requires developing a two-way learning relationship where feedback plays a
crucial role in improving outcomes. Just as you would help a new colleague understand your preferences
and standards, providing constructive feedback to AI helps refine its responses to better match your
professional needs. This feedback process isn't just about correcting mistakes, it's about guiding the AI to
better understand the nuances of your requirements and professional context.

Consider how feedback works in professional mentoring relationships: specific, constructive comments
help people understand not just what to change, but why the change matters. The same principle applies
when working with AI. Instead of simply accepting or rejecting outputs, engage in a dialogue about
refinements. For example, if an AI generates a client report that's technically accurate but too informal,
you might say: "The analysis is thorough, but could you revise this using more professional language
appropriate for senior executives? In particular, I'd like to see more industry-specific terminology and
a more formal tone." This specific guidance helps the AI understand the professional standards you're
aiming to meet.
                                                                        6. USING ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE IN THE WORKPLACE | 120

Remember that feedback works best when it's:

   specific about what works and what needs improvement
   constructive rather than simply critical
   focused on the desired outcome
   clear about the professional context and standards
   building toward better future interactions.

For instance, you might say: "The structure of this analysis is excellent, particularly how you've organised
the key findings. However, could you enhance the recommendations section by including more specific,
actionable steps? Our clients typically expect detailed implementation guidance." This type of feedback not
only improves the current output but helps the AI better understand your professional needs for future
interactions.

By consistently providing thoughtful feedback, you help create a more effective working relationship with
AI tools while developing your own skills in professional communication and quality assessment. This
feedback loop becomes an integral part of your professional development, helping you refine both your use
of AI tools and your ability to articulate professional standards and expectations.

     Activity 6.3: Developing Your AI Partnership Strategy

     This activity helps you develop practical experience working with AI tools in a professional
     context, learning how to effectively integrate AI assistance into your workflow while
     maintaining professional judgment and standards.
     Part 1: Platform selection and setup
     Choose two AI platforms to work with during your internship. Write a brief paragraph
     explaining why you selected these platforms, considering:

           what specific professional tasks you plan to accomplish
           how these platforms complement each other
           any limitations or considerations that influenced your choice.
     Part 2: Initial experimentation
     Create three different versions of a professional email requesting information about potential
     internship opportunities in your field. This exercise helps you understand how different
     approaches to AI collaboration affect outcomes.
     Version 1: Write the email entirely by yourself, without AI assistance
121 | 6. USING ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE IN THE WORKPLACE

     Version 2: Use AI to generate the complete email
     Version 3: Use a collaborative approach where you:

           prime the AI with context about your background and goals
           request an initial draft
           provide feedback for improvements
           work together to refine the final version.
     Compare these three versions, analysing:
           the strengths and weaknesses of each approach
           how well each version reflects your professional voice
           the time invested in each method
           the quality of the final product.
     Part 3: Week-long implementation challenge
     Over the next week, maintain a "Partnership journal" documenting your AI interactions.
     For each day:

           Sample Journal Entry:

           Today I used Claude to help analyse client feedback data. I started by explaining the context:
           `We're looking for patterns in customer satisfaction with our new software interface.' The initial
           analysis missed some industry-specific nuances, so I provided feedback: `Could you consider how
           these feedback patterns align with standard UX principles in enterprise software?' The refined
           analysis was much more useful. Tomorrow, I'll start by providing more industry context upfront.

     Part 4: Peer discussion and analysis
     At the end of the week, share with someone else who completed this activity and discuss:

           What surprised you about working with AI?
           Which tasks benefited most from AI collaboration?
                                                                  6. USING ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE IN THE WORKPLACE | 122

      How did your approach to AI interaction evolve over the week?
      What best practices did you develop?
      How might these lessons apply to your future career?

Remember

  The goal isn't to maximise AI usage but to develop thoughtful, effective patterns of human-
  AI collaboration that enhance your professional capabilities while maintaining your
  judgment and expertise as the guiding force in your work.

Key Takeaways

In this chapter, we covered:
      how successful AI integration requires a balanced "partnership approach" where
        professionals strategically use AI tools while maintaining human judgment, as research
        demonstrates this can improve work quality by up to 40% while avoiding the
        performance decreases associated with over-reliance.
      how developing proficiency with AI requires systematic practice starting with everyday
        professional tasks, like language immersion, allowing professionals to build competence
        gradually before tackling more complex applications.
      how organisational AI policies serve as essential safeguards for data security, privacy and
        regulatory compliance, requiring professionals to understand and respect these
        guidelines while finding ways to innovate responsibly within established frameworks.
      how effective AI collaboration requires treating AI systems as professional partners by
        providing clear context, specific guidance, and constructive feedback, enabling more
        precise and valuable AI assistance while maintaining professional standards.
      how successful professionals in the AI era become "centaurs" by thoughtfully combining
        human and machine capabilities, developing both technical skills with AI tools and
        essential meta-competencies like critical thinking and professional judgment.

7. DEVELOPING POSITIVE WORKING
RELATIONSHIPS

     Learning Objectives

     In this chapter, you will learn how to:
           cultivate meaningful professional relationships across all levels of your organisation, from
             support staff to senior leadership, while understanding the unique value each
             relationship brings to your professional development
           analyse and adapt to workplace cultures by recognising both explicit and implicit
             organisational norms that influence professional relationships
           implement specific strategies for building and maintaining positive workplace
             relationships through effective communication, professional boundaries, and
             collaborative approaches.

     Imagine this Scenario

     Zhang stares at his computer screen, the Micro-Cap software displaying yet another error
     message. His shoulders tense as he reads the technical documentation for the third time, trying
     to understand why the circuit diagrams won't import correctly. After twenty minutes of
     unsuccessful troubleshooting, he finally gathers the courage to ask for help.
     "Excuse me, John," Zhang says, careful to pronounce each word clearly. "Could you help me with
     Micro-Cap? I cannot get these diagrams to import."
     John, or "Johnno" as everyone calls him, swivels in his chair, flashing a friendly smile and slides
     on over next to Zhang, looking at his screen. "What you got is pretty old hat, mate. Dunno how
125 | 7. DEVELOPING POSITIVE WORKING RELATIONSHIPS

     to get around it, Micro-Cap ain't my bowl of rice. Have a yarn with Sunil, that cobber will get
     you sorted lickety-split."
     Zhang blinks, understanding perhaps half of what Johnno has said. After three months of
     studying engineering in Australia, he thought his English was improving, but this conversation
     makes him feel like he's back on his first day. The words individually make sense. He knows
     what a bowl is, and rice, and yarn is something to do with string, but strung together, they
     might as well be another language entirely.
     In the open-plan office, Zhang feels acutely aware of being one of only three non-Caucasian
     employees in the fifty-person firm. The fluorescent lights seem suddenly brighter, the air
     conditioning a bit colder. He considers returning to his desk to spend another hour with the
     technical documentation, but remembers his supervisor's encouragement to ask questions
     when stuck.
     With careful steps, Zhang makes his way to the IT department, where he finds Sunil engrossed
     in what appears to be several lines of code across multiple monitors. Like Zhang, Sunil wasn't
     born in Australia, having moved from Bangalore five years ago.
     Zhang hovers uncertainly in the doorway of the IT department. Through the glass walls, he can
     see someone who must be Sunil working intently across multiple monitors. Zhang's hand
     tightens around the notebook where he's written his technical question in careful English. After
     several deep breaths, he gently knocks on the door frame.
     "Ex-excuse me," Zhang's voice comes out quieter than intended. "Are you Sunil? John, I mean,
     Johnno, said you might be able to help with Micro-Cap?"

     Sunil startles slightly at the interruption, taking a moment to transition his attention from the
     code on his screens. He turns in his chair, adjusting his glasses as he faces Zhang. "Yes, that's
     me," he responds, his voice carrying a hint of an Indian accent. "You must be the new intern?"
     "Yes, I am Zhang," he says, still standing in the doorway. "I'm sorry to interrupt your work..."
     "No, no, please come in," Sunil gestures to a spare chair, though his smile seems a bit reserved,
     perhaps remembering his own early days as the newcomer. "What seems to be the problem?"
                                                                               7. DEVELOPING POSITIVE WORKING RELATIONSHIPS | 126

     Zhang edges into the room, carefully pulling the chair to maintain a polite distance. He opens
     his notebook, pointing to his carefully written notes about the technical issue. As he explains
     the Micro-Cap problem and his confusion about Johnno's response, his voice grows steadier.
     Sunil's initial reserve begins to fade as he recognises the familiar struggle of navigating both
     technical challenges and Australian workplace culture. His smile becomes more genuine as he
     shares his own experience.
     After Zhang explains both his technical issue and his confusion about Johnno's response, Sunil
     chuckles knowingly. "Ah, welcome to Australian English. Let me translate, `old hat' means
     outdated or old-fashioned, `bowl of rice' is Johnno's attempt at being culturally relevant but
     missing the mark a bit, `have a yarn' means to have a chat, and `cobber' is mate or friend. As for
     `lickety-split,' that just means quickly."
     Seeing Zhang's overwhelmed expression, Sunil continues more gently. "Look, I know it's a lot to
     take in. When I first started here, I spent half my time confused by these expressions too. The
     good news is, most people here are like Johnno: they mean well, even if their attempts at
     cultural connection sometimes miss the mark."
     Whilst helping Zhang resolve the Micro-Cap issue, Sunil shares more insights about navigating
     the workplace culture. "The key is to remember that informal language here often signals
     friendliness, not disrespect. When Johnno calls you `mate' or uses casual expressions, he's trying
     to make you feel included, even if it has the opposite effect sometimes."
     Zhang nods slowly, beginning to understand. "So when they use these informal expressions..."
     "It means they see you as part of the team," Sunil finishes. "Though I did have to tell Johnno
     that `bowl of rice' wasn't the most culturally sensitive way to relate to Asian colleagues," he
     adds with a wry smile.
     The technical problem solved, Zhang returns to his desk with more than just a working circuit
     diagram. He has gained a valuable ally in Sunil and a better understanding of how to navigate
     the complex intersection of technical work and Australian workplace culture.

Working Relationships: The Key to
Person-Environment-Fit

Building positive working relationships in professional settings extends far beyond simple collegiality:
it fundamentally influences our sense of belonging, job satisfaction, and career success through what
organisational psychologists call "person-environment fit." This concept suggests that our professional
effectiveness and wellbeing depend not just on our technical capabilities, but on how well we align with
our workplace's social environment, values, and cultural norms. When we experience strong person-
127 | 7. DEVELOPING POSITIVE WORKING RELATIONSHIPS

environment fit, we're more likely to receive mentoring opportunities, be included in informal knowledge
sharing, and gain access to the kind of tacit organisational knowledge that proves invaluable for career
advancement.

For those who feel like cultural outsiders, whether due to linguistic differences, cultural background, or
being new to a profession, developing this fit might initially seem daunting. However, research consistently
shows that person-environment fit isn't static, it's something we can actively develop through intentional
relationship building, cultural learning, and open communication. Understanding this dynamic nature
of workplace fit helps us approach relationship building not as a fixed challenge to overcome, but as an
ongoing process of professional growth where each interaction, even those that feel awkward or uncertain,
contributes to our developing sense of workplace belonging and professional identity.

International students face unique challenges with person-environment fit as they enter university life,
particularly because they must navigate multiple types of alignment simultaneously. Unlike domestic
students who primarily focus on academic adjustment, international students must achieve fit across
academic, cultural, social, and physical dimensions, all while operating in a new language and cultural
context. Research shows this complex adjustment process significantly impacts their psychological
wellbeing, especially when there are misalignments between their goals and expectations and the university
environment.

These fit challenges materialise in various ways throughout their university experience. Academically,
students might struggle to adapt to different teaching styles or assessment expectations, while culturally,
they may find it difficult to understand unwritten social norms or classroom participation expectations.
For example, a student might be academically capable but find themselves struggling to engage in tutorial
discussions due to language barriers or cultural differences in classroom interaction styles. These challenges
are further complicated when students cannot easily access or effectively utilise university support services,
either because they don't understand how to navigate these systems or because the services themselves
don't align with their cultural expectations of support. Understanding these multiple dimensions of fit
helps explain why some highly capable international students still struggle to thrive in their new university
environment, even when they possess strong academic abilities.
                                                                               7. DEVELOPING POSITIVE WORKING RELATIONSHIPS | 128

        Shared dimensions of university and workplace cultural fits

Person-environment fit forms the foundation of workplace satisfaction and success, with working
relationships serving as the crucial bridge between individual characteristics and organisational culture.
Even when someone's skills and values align perfectly with their organisation's mission and requirements,
the quality of their daily interactions with colleagues, supervisors, and stakeholders ultimately determines
whether they thrive in that environment. These relationships act as the practical manifestation of
organisational culture, translating abstract concepts like "collaborative environment" or "innovation-
focused culture" into tangible experiences through everyday interactions, shared problem-solving, and
mutual support. When professionals develop positive working relationships, they create informal networks
that help them navigate organisational complexities, access resources and opportunities, and receive the
emotional and practical support needed to overcome workplace challenges. These relationships become
particularly vital during periods of change or stress, as they provide the psychological safety necessary for
individuals to take risks, share ideas, and maintain resilience in the face of setbacks.
Research by Rose et al. (2021) reveals fascinating insights about how workplace relationships influence
intern-to-employee conversion through person-environment fit. The path analysis demonstrates that while
both supervisor and coworker relationships matter, coworker relationships have a stronger influence on
whether interns are ultimately offered permanent positions.
Let's break down the key findings from their path analysis: The research showed that coworker
relationships had a path coefficient of 0.48 to person-environment fit, whilst supervisor relationships
had a lower coefficient of 0.29. This means that positive relationships with colleagues were almost twice
as influential in determining how well interns felt they "fitted" within the organisation compared to
relationships with supervisors.
This makes intuitive sense when considering the daily reality of internships. While supervisors provide
129 | 7. DEVELOPING POSITIVE WORKING RELATIONSHIPS

important guidance and feedback, it's often colleagues who give interns the most complete picture of
organisational culture, unwritten norms, and what it's truly like to work there. Coworkers tend to have
more frequent, informal interactions with interns and often feel more approachable for questions about
day-to-day work life. These regular interactions help interns determine whether they can envision
themselves as permanent members of the organisation.
The research also revealed that person-environment fit strongly predicted conversion intentions, with a
path coefficient of 0.52. This suggests that when interns develop positive relationships with colleagues and
come to feel they belong in the organisational culture, they become much more likely to accept permanent
positions if offered. The effect is compounded: strong coworker relationships enhance person-environment
fit, which in turn increases the likelihood of conversion to ongoing employment.

For interns, these findings emphasise that while impressing their supervisor is important, investing time
in building authentic connections with colleagues may be even more crucial for long-term career success.
Simple actions like joining colleagues for lunch, participating in informal team discussions, and seeking
advice from coworkers can significantly impact whether interns feel "at home" in an organisation and
ultimately transition from intern to employee.
The research provides strong empirical support for treating internships not just as extended job interviews
with supervisors, but as opportunities to become genuinely integrated into the organisational community
through peer relationships. For organisations, it suggests that fostering strong intern-coworker bonds may
be one of the most effective strategies for converting high-performing interns into valuable permanent
employees.

     Activity 7.1: Mapping Your Workplace Network

     This activity helps interns understand and strengthen their workplace relationships, drawing on
                                                                        7. DEVELOPING POSITIVE WORKING RELATIONSHIPS | 130

Rose et al.'s (2021) research about the crucial role of colleague interactions in person-
environment fit.
Part 1: Network reflection
Create a detailed map of your workplace relationships. Draw yourself in the centre of a page,
then add:

                   An interactive H5P element has been excluded from this version of the text. You can view it
                   online here:
        https://jcu.pressbooks.pub/stem-advantage/?p=311#h5p-38

Part 2: Relationship analysis
Review your network map and write brief notes addressing:

      Balance assessment
              What is the ratio between supervisor and colleague interactions?
              Are your strongest connections mainly with other interns or with experienced
                staff?
              Which departments or teams are represented in your network?

      Quality evaluation
              Which relationships help you understand the organisation's values?
              Who gives you insight into the workplace culture?
              Which connections make you feel more integrated into the team?

Part 3: Strategic development
Based on Rose et al.'s (2021) findings about the importance of colleague relationships, create an
action plan to strengthen your workplace network:
Identify three colleagues you'd like to develop stronger professional relationships with.

      For each person, plan:
              a work-related topic you could discuss with them
              a specific question about their role or experience
              an opportunity for natural interaction (e.g., shared projects, lunch breaks).

      Set specific, measurable goals such as:
              having two meaningful professional conversations each week
131 | 7. DEVELOPING POSITIVE WORKING RELATIONSHIPS

                   learning about a different department each month
                   contributing to team discussions in meetings.
     Part 4: Reflection questions
     Consider how your planned interactions might influence your person-environment fit:
           How might stronger colleague relationships help you understand:
                   the organisation's unwritten rules?
                   team dynamics and communication styles?
                   career development opportunities?
     What aspects of organisational culture would you like to learn more about through these
     relationships?
           How could expanded workplace connections influence your:
                   professional development?
                   understanding of the organisation?
                   likelihood of seeking permanent employment?

   Remember

       Rose et al.'s (2021) research demonstrates that colleague relationships have nearly twice the
       impact on person-environment fit compared to supervisor relationships. This activity helps
       interns develop the professional networks that research shows are crucial for successful
       intern-to-employee conversion.

Professional Duality: Creating a Work Persona

The concept of professional duality, how we develop and maintain distinct personal and professional
identities, plays a crucial role in workplace success. Understanding how to navigate this duality helps
interns develop authentic yet professionally appropriate workplace behaviours that align with
organisational expectations whilst remaining true to their core values.
Having a slightly different personality at work, what we call a "work persona", is a normal and helpful
way to adapt to the professional environment. Research by Chung et al. (2023) looked at 300 employees
                                                                               7. DEVELOPING POSITIVE WORKING RELATIONSHIPS | 132

and found that people naturally develop a work style that combines their organisation's values with the
informal social rules of their workplace. This helps them fit in while still being themselves.

The study shows that we tend to act somewhat differently depending on who we're talking to at work.
With managers and supervisors, we often show a more formal, professional side that matches what the
organisation expects. But with our colleagues at the same level, we usually blend our professional and
personal sides more naturally. This isn't about being fake, it's about knowing how to communicate
effectively in different work situations. When people can adjust their style this way, they usually feel more
connected to their organisation and more satisfied with their job.

It's important to understand that having a work persona doesn't mean you're pretending to be someone
else. Instead, think of it like choosing appropriate clothes for work, you're still yourself, just dressed for the
professional environment. The research found that people who develop a comfortable work style tend to
build better relationships at work and do better in their careers. Just as we might act differently at a family
dinner compared to a night out with friends, it's natural and healthy to have a slightly different way of
presenting ourselves at work.

The relationship between our work persona and person-environment fit helps us understand how we
become part of an organisation's culture. When we join a workplace, we naturally begin to absorb both
the written and unwritten rules of how things work. These unwritten rules, like how people communicate,
how they handle disagreements, or what behaviour gets rewarded, often matter more than the official
values posted on office walls.

As we develop our work persona, we start to incorporate these organisational values into how we act
at work. For example, if an organisation values open communication but expects people to challenge
ideas privately rather than in meetings, we learn to adapt our communication style accordingly. This isn't
about changing who we are fundamentally, it's about understanding and working effectively within the
organisation's culture. The research by Chung et al. (2023) shows that this adaptation helps us form
stronger connections with both colleagues and supervisors.

These workplace relationships then reinforce our understanding of the organisation's values and help us
fit in better. Through daily interactions with colleagues and feedback from supervisors, we continuously
refine our work persona to better align with the workplace culture. What makes this process particularly
interesting is how it creates a cycle: our work persona helps us build relationships, and these relationships
in turn help us better understand and adapt to the organisation's culture. This cycle explains why people
often feel more comfortable and natural in their work persona over time, as they develop a deeper
understanding of their workplace's unwritten rules and values.

     Activity 7.2: Mapping Your Work Values
133 | 7. DEVELOPING POSITIVE WORKING RELATIONSHIPS

     This short reflective activity helps interns understand how their work persona develops in
     response to organisational values and culture.
     Think about your workplace and note down your observations about:
     The Written Rules
     Write down two or three official organisational values or rules from your workplace. For
     example, these might be values displayed on walls or mentioned in company materials.
     The Unwritten Rules
     Now think about how people actually work together. Write down two or three unwritten rules
     you've noticed. For example:

           How do people typically handle disagreements?
           When do people tend to speak up in meetings?
           How do colleagues communicate with supervisors?
     Your Adaptation
     Reflect on how you've adjusted your behaviour to fit these unwritten rules. Write down:

           one way you act differently at work compared to outside work
           how this adjustment has helped you build workplace relationships
           whether this change feels natural or forced.

     Remember

             There are no right or wrong answers. The goal is to understand how you naturally adapt to
             your workplace culture while maintaining your authentic self. This awareness can help you
             develop more effective workplace relationships.

Trust, Enjoyment and Unspoken Boundaries in
Workplace Relationships

The relationship between duality and trust in professional settings represents one of the most nuanced
aspects of workplace dynamics. While we naturally seek genuine connections with our colleagues, we
must simultaneously maintain appropriate professional boundaries, a balance that directly impacts the
development of trust. This duality manifests in how we share personal information while preserving
privacy, how we build friendships while maintaining professional objectivity, and how we navigate the
complex territory between being approachable and maintaining authority. Understanding this delicate
                                                                               7. DEVELOPING POSITIVE WORKING RELATIONSHIPS | 134

balance proves crucial because trust emerges not from completely removing these boundaries, but from
managing them thoughtfully and consistently. When we demonstrate both genuine care for our colleagues
and respect for professional limitations, we create an environment where trust can flourish naturally. This
careful navigation of personal and professional spaces allows us to build authentic workplace relationships
while maintaining the structure and boundaries necessary for effective professional collaboration.

Trust in professional settings emerges from a complex interplay of individual, organisational, and cultural
factors that shape how we perceive and evaluate trustworthiness. Research across multiple societies reveals
that professional trust operates through two fundamental dimensions, warmth and competence, which
manifest differently depending on organisational roles and cultural contexts (Kwantes & Kartolo, 2021;
Whrle et al., 2015). When colleagues demonstrate both technical capability and genuine concern for
others' wellbeing, they create the foundations for trust to develop. However, this trust must be carefully
cultivated within the established norms and expectations that govern professional relationships.

The development of professional trust requires a sophisticated understanding of how different workplace
roles shape trust dynamics. Supervisors and colleagues face distinct expectations regarding how they should
demonstrate trustworthiness, with most cultures placing greater emphasis on competence for those in
leadership positions (Whrle et al., 2015). Yet this competence must be balanced with appropriate displays
of warmth and concern for others, what researchers term "benevolence", to build sustainable trust. The
challenge lies in calibrating these demonstrations of capability and care to align with both organisational
needs and cultural expectations about professional behaviour.

Modern workplace relationships have grown increasingly complex as organisations become more globally
connected and culturally diverse. Trust must now be built and maintained across cultural boundaries,
often in virtual or hybrid environments where traditional trust-building mechanisms may be limited. This
evolution demands a more nuanced approach to professional trust, one that acknowledges how cultural
values and practices influence perceptions of trustworthiness while remaining sensitive to the universal
human need for both competence and warmth in professional relationships (Kwantes & Kartolo, 2021).
Success in this environment requires developing what researchers call "swift trust", the ability to quickly
establish functional trust based on role expectations while remaining open to deeper trust development
over time.
135 | 7. DEVELOPING POSITIVE WORKING RELATIONSHIPS

       The Notion of "Swift Trust"
       During your internship, you'll need to quickly establish working relationships with
       supervisors and colleagues despite having limited time to build trust naturally. This is where
       `swift trust' becomes crucial. It's a practical form of professional trust that develops rapidly
       based on roles and initial impressions rather than long-term experience. When you first join
       your workplace, people will form swift trust assessments of your trustworthiness based on
       how well you demonstrate both competence in your role and warmth in your interactions.
       Similarly, you'll need to make quick judgments about trusting your new colleagues based on
       their professional roles and early interactions. Understanding swift trust can help you
       navigate these early workplace relationships more effectively. You can actively demonstrate
       your reliability through consistent performance while also showing appropriate warmth and
       collegiality in your interactions. Remember that while swift trust helps establish initial
       working relationships, it serves as a foundation for developing deeper professional trust
       over the course of your internship through continued positive interactions and
       demonstrated reliability. By being mindful of how you present both your capabilities and
       your interpersonal approach from day one, you can help foster the swift trust necessary for
       productive workplace relationships.

Trust and enjoyment in the workplace share a fascinating reciprocal relationship. When employees feel
they can trust their colleagues and supervisors, they experience greater psychological safety, which allows
them to relax and express themselves more authentically at work. This emotional security creates space
for spontaneous moments of connection, shared laughter, and genuine camaraderie. Conversely, in
environments where trust is lacking, people tend to maintain rigid professional personas, carefully
monitoring their words and actions, which inhibits the natural development of enjoyable workplace
relationships. Research consistently shows that teams with high levels of trust not only perform better
but also report higher job satisfaction and engagement, largely because they feel comfortable enough to
share jokes, celebrate successes together, and support each other through challenges. This comfortable
atmosphere, built on a foundation of trust, transforms daily work interactions from mere professional
obligations into opportunities for meaningful connection and enjoyment.
                                                                               7. DEVELOPING POSITIVE WORKING RELATIONSHIPS | 136

Research from Mak et al. (2012) shows that workplace relationships and psychological safety are deeply
intertwined with the appropriate use of humour, particularly during internships and early career
transitions. Just as social bonds often form through shared laughter and jokes, professional relationships
tend to develop when colleagues can relax and engage in appropriate workplace banter. However,
navigating humour as a new employee requires careful attention to workplace norms and power dynamics.
For interns and new employees, understanding the role of humour in workplace culture presents both
opportunities and potential pitfalls. While established employees may engage in more casual or edgy
humour based on their longstanding relationships, interns should maintain a more conservative approach
until they better understand the specific workplace culture. The most successful interns typically focus first
on demonstrating competence and reliability while carefully observing how humour is used by others in
the organisation.

Rather than trying to match the joking style of longtime employees, you can build positive relationships
by appreciating others' appropriate humour and occasionally contributing light, professionally safe
comments. This measured approach allows you to participate in workplace camaraderie while avoiding
potential missteps that could damage their professional reputation. As relationships develop naturally over
time, the boundaries of appropriate humour may expand, but this should happen gradually and organically
rather than being forced.

       A crucial reminder: While humour and playful banter can build positive workplace
       relationships, jokes should never come at your expense or make you feel targeted,
       uncomfortable, or unsafe. Professional humour builds people up rather than tears them
       down. If you experience bullying, harassment, or discriminatory behaviour disguised as
137 | 7. DEVELOPING POSITIVE WORKING RELATIONSHIPS

       "jokes," this is unacceptable in any workplace. Your university's placement coordinator is
       there to support you. Don't hesitate to reach out to them if you feel unsafe or singled out.
       You can also access support through your university's counselling services and student
       advocacy teams. Remember that reporting inappropriate behaviour helps protect both
       yourself and future interns who might face similar situations. Your wellbeing and
       professional development should always be the priority during your internship experience.

     Activity 7.3: Understanding Trust and Humour in Professional Setting

     Part 1: Reflection exercise
     Using the DIEP (Describe, Interpret, Evaluate, Plan) model, reflect on a time when you were
     new to a professional or academic group and had to navigate social dynamics, particularly
     around humour and trust.

                          An interactive H5P element has been excluded from this version of the text. You can view it
                          online here:
                          https://jcu.pressbooks.pub/stem-advantage/?p=311#h5p-39

     Remember

             The goal of this reflection is not just to recall past experiences, but to develop a thoughtful,
             professional approach to workplace relationships that will serve you throughout your career.
             Consider sharing your insights with your peers to learn from their experiences as well.

     Part 2: Scenario analysis
     Read the following scenario carefully:
                                                                               7. DEVELOPING POSITIVE WORKING RELATIONSHIPS | 138

             Sarah has been interning at an engineering firm for three weeks. She notices that her team
             often makes playful jokes about their manager Tom's intense coffee addiction, and he good-
             naturedly joins in these jokes himself. During a team meeting, Sarah attempts to participate by
             commenting, "Watch out, everyone, Tom hasn't had his hourly coffee yet!" However, the room
             falls silent, and several colleagues look uncomfortable. Later, a senior colleague explains that
             while the team does joke about Tom's coffee habits, only his direct reports who've known him
             for years participate in this banter.

     Working with a partner, discuss:

           What assumptions did Sarah make about workplace relationships?
           How could she have better understood the unwritten rules about humour in this

             workplace?
           What would be more appropriate ways for Sarah to begin building rapport with her

             team?
           How might Sarah recover professionally from this misstep?
     Remember to consider both trust and humour when analysing this scenario. The goal isn't to
     discourage participation in workplace camaraderie, but to understand how to navigate it
     appropriately as a newcomer.

When Trust Is Broken

Despite our best efforts to build positive workplace relationships, sometimes interactions can sour or trust
can be damaged. Even the most carefully navigated professional relationships may encounter difficulties,
whether through misunderstandings, cultural differences, or genuine conflicts. The skills required to repair
workplace relationships draw on many of the same fundamentals we've discussed, emotional intelligence,
cultural awareness, and professional judgment, but require us to apply them in more challenging
circumstances. What matters most isn't that we never experience conflict, but rather how we handle these
situations when they arise. The mark of a true professional isn't avoiding all interpersonal challenges, but
addressing them with maturity, self-awareness, and a commitment to positive resolution.

Workplace friendships, while potentially valuable for both job satisfaction and professional development,
can be particularly fragile and subject to various forms of deterioration. Research by Sias et. al. (2004)
identified several key triggers that commonly lead to the breakdown of workplace relationships, including
betrayals of trust, violations of organisational values, and changes in professional status through
139 | 7. DEVELOPING POSITIVE WORKING RELATIONSHIPS

promotion. These deterioration factors are especially impactful because they challenge the delicate balance
between professional obligations and personal connections that workplace friendships must maintain.
The complexity of workplace friendship deterioration lies in its often unavoidable nature, particularly
when organisational changes occur. For instance, when one friend is promoted to a supervisory position
over another, the fundamental dynamics of their relationship must shift to accommodate new power
structures and professional responsibilities. This transition can create tension between maintaining
personal rapport and upholding professional boundaries. Similarly, extended absences from work, whether
through leave, transfers, or other circumstances, can strain these relationships as the regular contact and
shared experiences that help maintain workplace friendships are disrupted.

What makes workplace friendship deterioration particularly challenging is that traditional friendship repair
strategies often prove ineffective in the professional context. Unlike personal friendships outside of work,
workplace relationships must continue to function at some level even after deterioration occurs, as
colleagues typically need to maintain professional interactions. Sias et. al's (2004) research demonstrated
that attempts to resolve these friendship breakdowns were largely unsuccessful, suggesting that once certain
professional boundaries or trust levels are breached, the unique combination of personal and professional
expectations that characterise workplace friendships becomes difficult to rebuild. This understanding
highlights the importance of maintaining clear boundaries and managing expectations in workplace
friendships from the outset.

     Activity 7.4: A Tricky Situation
                                                                        7. DEVELOPING POSITIVE WORKING RELATIONSHIPS | 140

Jenna is coordinating environmental impact assessments for Blue Ocean Dive, a well-
established diving operator in the Cairns region. The company is considering expanding their
operations to include Cowboys Reef, a more remote and pristine area of the Great Barrier Reef.
While this expansion could significantly boost profits, it also raises important environmental
considerations given the reef's relatively untouched state.

Following the weekly operations meeting, Marcus approaches Jenna privately. He expresses
serious concerns about Isabella, one of the marine scientists conducting the environmental
impact studies. Marcus claims that Isabella seems to be downplaying the potential
environmental risks in her preliminary reports, particularly regarding the impact of increased
boat traffic on the reef's delicate ecosystem. He tells Jenna that during a recent site visit, he
overheard Isabella telling another staff member that "more cancelled trips due to weather
would mean more paid days off for the dive masters." Marcus couldn't provide concrete
evidence but insists that Isabella's personal benefit might be influencing her scientific
assessment.

That same afternoon, Jenna and Isabella are having coffee together, as they often do. During
their conversation, Isabella appears visibly upset and confides in Jenna about a recent personal
situation. She had gone on several dates with Marcus, but their last encounter ended terribly.
Isabella mentions that Marcus accused her of being "too stuck up" and not "open-minded
enough".

The situation presents Jenna with a complex dilemma. The environmental impact assessment is
crucial for both the company's future and the reef's protection. Should she take Marcus's
allegations seriously and launch a formal investigation into Isabella's methodology and data
analysis? This could potentially damage both professional relationships and the project's
timeline. Alternatively, should she interpret Marcus's claims as potentially biased by their failed
romantic connection? Yet ignoring his concerns entirely could mean overlooking genuine issues
with the assessment's integrity.

What steps should Jenna take to handle this situation professionally while ensuring both the
integrity of the environmental assessment and the maintenance of a healthy workplace
environment?

Part 1: Individual reflection
After reading the scenario carefully, consider the following questions:

      What are the key professional and personal relationships at play in this situation?
      How might different types of workplace trust (professional, emotional, ethical) be

        affected?
      If you were Jenna, what aspects of this situation would concern you most from:
141 | 7. DEVELOPING POSITIVE WORKING RELATIONSHIPS

                   a project integrity perspective
                   a team dynamics perspective
                   a professional ethics perspective.

     Write a brief reflection addressing these points, considering how the concepts of workplace
     trust and relationship boundaries we've discussed apply to this scenario.
     Part 2: Small group discussion
     In groups of 3-4, discuss the potential consequences of each possible course of action Jenna
     might take:

           investigating Isabella's work formally
           dismissing Marcus's concerns
           seeking a middle-ground approach
           how might this situation affect:
           the team's professional dynamics
           future workplace relationships
           the credibility of the environmental assessment.

     Develop a specific action plan for Jenna that addresses both the professional and interpersonal
     aspects of this situation.
     Part 3: Professional communication exercise
     Draft two professional emails that Jenna might need to write:

           a follow-up email to Marcus acknowledging his concerns while maintaining professional
             boundaries

           an email to her supervisor explaining the situation and her proposed course of action.

     Remember to consider:

           appropriate professional tone
           clear documentation of concerns
           protection of all parties' professional integrity
           maintenance of appropriate confidentiality.

     Part 4: Discussion and debrief
     Share key insights from your group discussions, focusing on:

           how workplace relationships can affect professional judgment
           strategies for maintaining professional boundaries
           best practices for handling conflicts between personal and professional relationships
           ways to protect project integrity while managing interpersonal dynamics.
                                                                        7. DEVELOPING POSITIVE WORKING RELATIONSHIPS | 142

Extension activity
Consider how this situation might be different if:

      the relationship breakdown had occurred after the allegations
      multiple team members had raised similar concerns
      the environmental assessment had already been completed.
How would these variations affect the appropriate professional response?

   Remember

       The goal is not to judge the personal choices of any party involved, but to understand how to
       maintain professional integrity and workplace trust when personal and professional
       boundaries become blurred.

Key Takeaways

In this chapter, we covered:
      the crucial role of person-environment fit in workplace success, with research showing
        that positive coworker relationships have nearly twice the impact on successful
        internship outcomes compared to supervisor relationships, highlighting the importance of
        building authentic connections with colleagues at all levels
      how developing an effective professional work persona allows us to adapt to workplace
        culture while maintaining authenticity, enabling us to build trust and navigate
        organisational dynamics successfully without compromising our core values
      the intricate balance between trust and professional boundaries in workplace
        relationships, including how to develop "swift trust" early in internships while
        maintaining appropriate professional distance and navigating cultural differences
      the complex role of workplace humour and enjoyment in building positive professional
        relationships, with research demonstrating that successful interns carefully observe
        existing workplace dynamics before participating in casual banter or jokes
      strategic approaches for handling workplace relationship challenges, including how to
143 | 7. DEVELOPING POSITIVE WORKING RELATIONSHIPS

             maintain professionalism when trust is damaged, navigate conflict between personal and
             professional relationships, and rebuild productive working relationships after difficulties
             arise.

     Imagine this Scenario

     Marley sat in her university's cafe, barely touching her lunch as she stared at the email on her
     phone, a job offer from the prestigious Anderson Marine Research Centre. The position would
     place her directly under Dr Bernice Guest, whose groundbreaking work on endangered marine
     species had featured in multiple documentaries. Dr Guest's recent discovery of what might be
     the last colony of Java stingrays had made international headlines, and her lab consistently
     secured major government research grants.
     "I got the job!" Marley announced to Professor Chen during their next project meeting. Rather
     than sharing her excitement, Professor Chen's smile seemed strained. She congratulated Marley
     politely but quickly changed the subject. The same thing happened with Professor Roberts,
     another oddly muted response to what Marley considered incredible news.
     Later that week, over coffee with her friend Jade, Marley mentioned these puzzling reactions.
                                                                                                        8. DEVELOPING A PORTFOLIO | 146

Jade's face fell. "Oh Marley Dr Guest has a terrible reputation as a supervisor. Everyone in
marine biology knows about it."
Concerned, Marley sought out her professors again, this time asking directly about Dr Guest.
Professor Chen hesitated before speaking. "I've never met her personally, but I've heard
concerning stories from multiple colleagues. Her students and staff often leave within months,
usually quite distressed." Professor Roberts nodded in agreement, adding that while Dr Guest's
research output was impressive, her lab had an unusually high turnover rate.
Looking at Dr Guest's professional profile, Marley saw an impressive list of achievements,
numerous publications in top journals, successful grant applications, groundbreaking
discoveries. Surely the opportunity to work with someone so accomplished outweighed any
potential workplace challenges? Despite the warnings, Marley accepted the position.

Six months later, Marley barely recognised herself. The enthusiastic graduate who had eagerly
joined the lab had been replaced by someone who struggled to get out of bed each morning. Dr
Guest's demanding and erratic management style meant Marley never knew when she would
be praised or berated. Weekends became meaningless as she was expected to be available at all
hours. The constant stress led to panic attacks, and Marley found herself experiencing severe
anxiety about even routine workplace interactions.
The irony wasn't lost on Marley, she had focused entirely on Dr Guest's documented
achievements while dismissing the undocumented but crucial evidence about her reputation as
an employer. This painful experience taught her that professional portfolios tell only part of the
story, and that reputation and workplace relationships matter just as much as technical
achievements.
147 | 8. DEVELOPING A PORTFOLIO

Building a Reputation

Professional reputation develops through three interconnected channels that each provide different
perspectives on someone's capabilities and character.

Public Profiles

Include published work, social media presence, and formal achievements, and offer a curated view of
professional accomplishments that can be easily verified. For instance, Dr Guest's impressive publication
record and research discoveries represented the public face of her reputation.

Private Experiences

These reveal how someone actually operates in day-to-day professional settings, their management style,
communication approach, and treatment of colleagues. These experiences often remain hidden from
public view but profoundly impact workplace relationships and team dynamics, as Marley discovered
through her distressing time in Dr Guest's lab.

Word of Mouth

This serves as a crucial bridge between public and private spheres, with informal networks sharing insights
about working styles and professional behaviour that might never appear in a formal portfolio. In Marley's
case, her professors' hesitance and colleagues' warnings represented this vital oral history of Dr Guest's
reputation as a supervisor. Understanding how these three channels interact helps professionals make more
informed career decisions and manage their own reputational development more effectively.
                                                                                                               8. DEVELOPING A PORTFOLIO | 148

Just as a tree needs both visible branches and hidden roots to thrive, a strong professional reputation
requires alignment between public achievements, private conduct, and the stories others tell about our
work.

As you begin your internship, developing a positive professional reputation requires understanding both
the explicit and implicit norms of your workplace. Zinko et al. (2017)'s research highlights that reputation
forms when your actions deviate from these organisational norms in consistent, noticeable ways. For
instance, if you consistently submit work ahead of deadlines in an environment where most people just
meet them, you may develop a reputation as a high performer. However, it's crucial to first observe and
understand your organisation's culture, as the same behaviours that build a positive reputation in one
workplace might be viewed neutrally or even negatively in another.

Your reputation develops through three interconnected channels: public profiles, private experiences, and
word of mouth. While public profiles showcase your formal achievements, private experiences, how you
actually operate in day-to-day professional settings, form the foundation of your workplace reputation
(Zinko et al., 2017). These private experiences include your management style, communication approach,
and treatment of colleagues. Crucially, these experiences become known to others through word of mouth,
which the researchers identify as a vital mechanism for reputation building. What's interesting is,
workplace gossip, while often viewed negatively, accounts for two-thirds of all organisational
communication and plays an essential role in spreading information about your consistent behaviours
throughout the organisation.

Building a reputation takes time and must be approached strategically. You should focus first on developing
expertise in specific areas that your organisation values, as this provides the foundation for positive
reputation development. You need what researchers call "willing promoters" (Zinko et al., 2017, p. 92),
colleagues who will vouch for your capabilities and share stories about your achievements through word
of mouth. These promoters help bridge the gap between your private experiences and your broader
organisational reputation by sharing their firsthand knowledge of your work with others. However,
remember that small, consistent positive deviations from norms often build stronger reputations than
single dramatic achievements. Your goal should be to become known for reliable excellence in specific areas
rather than sporadic moments of brilliance.
149 | 8. DEVELOPING A PORTFOLIO

       According to Zhao (2021), LinkedIn serves as a critical platform for professional reputation
       development through two key mechanisms: strategic personal branding and differentiated
       positioning.
       The first crucial outcome from the research shows that effective personal branding on
       LinkedIn requires a strategic approach focused on consistent, professional communication.
       This means regularly updating your profile with multimedia content like presentations and
       articles, maintaining active connections with at least 50 relevant professionals in your field,
       and engaging meaningfully in industry group discussions. The study emphasises that it's not
       enough to simply list your experiences, you need to communicate them in a way that
       demonstrates clear value, for instance by describing not just what you did, but how well you
       did it and who benefited from your work.
       The second key finding highlights the importance of differentiation through authentic
       personal narrative. The research demonstrates that successful LinkedIn profiles go beyond
       standard professional accomplishments to showcase unique qualifications, skills, and
       experiences that set you apart. For example, rather than just listing "strong communication
       skills," you might highlight specific language abilities, volunteer experiences, or professional
       certifications that make your profile distinct. This differentiation needs to be complemented
       by artifactual elements, personalised written and visual communications that reflect your
       authentic professional personality while maintaining appropriate workplace boundaries.
       In essence, the research suggests that LinkedIn serves as much more than just a digital CV,
       it's a platform for strategic reputation building that requires careful attention to both
       consistent professional communication and authentic personal differentiation. This
       combined approach helps create a recognisable professional identity that can significantly
       impact career opportunities and advancement.

     Activity 8.1: Enhancing Your LinkedIn Profile

     This activity helps you evaluate and improve your LinkedIn profile using evidence-based criteria
     for effective personal branding. You should plan to spend about 45 minutes on this reflective
     exercise.
     Part 1: Strategic assessment
                                                                                                        8. DEVELOPING A PORTFOLIO | 150

Begin by examining the strategic elements of your profile. Score yourself from 1 (strongly
disagree) to 5 (strongly agree) on these key areas:

      Profile Completeness: Review your profile's multimedia elements. Have you included a
        professional photo, relevant presentations, articles, or project work? If you need help on
        deciding what to include, check the JCU LinkedIn guide.

      Network Development: Check your connection count. While quality matters more than
        quantity, aim for at least 50 relevant professional connections in your field. How many
        industry-relevant connections do you currently have?

      Professional Engagement: Look at your last month of activity. Have you joined and
        participated in discussions in groups relevant to your field? Have you shared any industry
        insights or articles?

Part 2: Positive impact analysis
Examine how effectively you communicate value in your profile.
Review one of your work experience entries and enhance it using this formula:

      What did you do? (Specific task or responsibility)
      How well did you do it? (Quantifiable results where possible)
      Who did it impact? (Beneficiaries of your work)

For example, instead of "Managed social media", write: "Managed company social media
accounts, increasing engagement by 25% and helping local small businesses reach new
customers."
Part 3: Differentiation check
Identify what makes you unique:

      List three specific qualifications, skills, or experiences that differentiate you from others in
        your field.

      Review your profile summary. Does it clearly communicate these differentiating factors?
      Check the JCU Career Snapshots for your discipline to identify industry-specific keywords

        you should include.

Part 4: Reflection
Based on this assessment, write a brief action plan identifying:

      three immediate improvements you can make to your profile
      two longer-term goals for developing your professional presence
      one area where you need to gather more evidence or experience.
151 | 8. DEVELOPING A PORTFOLIO

     Remember

             Your LinkedIn profile is a living document that should evolve with your professional
             development. Schedule monthly reviews to keep your content fresh and aligned with your
             career goals.

Recording Your Work in a Portfolio

A well-curated portfolio provides tangible evidence of the reputation you're building. While word of
mouth and daily interactions shape how colleagues perceive you within your organisation, your portfolio
serves as a permanent record of your achievements and capabilities. Think of your portfolio as the
professional equivalent of a museum curator's collection, each piece should be carefully selected to tell a
specific story about your expertise and demonstrate the consistent excellence we discussed earlier.

However, portfolio development requires more than simply collecting evidence of your work. You need
to thoughtfully consider how each item connects to and reinforces your desired professional reputation.
For instance, if you're building a reputation as an innovative problem-solver, your portfolio should include
examples that demonstrate not just successful outcomes, but also your unique approach to challenging
situations. The key is to create alignment between your daily workplace behaviours, the reputation you're
developing, and the evidence presented in your portfolio.

Your portfolio should strategically highlight experiences that demonstrate key employability skills valued
across industries. According to De Vos et. al. (2009), employers particularly value behaviours that show
initiative and the ability to plan and network effectively. This maps directly to core competencies like
adaptability, communication skills, and self-initiative that consistently appear in job descriptions. When
selecting what to include in your portfolio, prioritise examples that showcase your flexibility in handling
change, your capacity to communicate effectively across different contexts, and your ability to take initiative
in solving problems. For instance, if you led a team project that required adjusting to unexpected
challenges, this would demonstrate multiple valued skills: leadership, adaptability, and critical thinking.
The key is not just collecting evidence of your capabilities, but thoughtfully curating examples that align
with what research shows employers seek in candidates.

How to Record Your Portfolio

Building an effective portfolio requires a thoughtful approach to capturing and documenting your
achievements. Just as a skilled photographer carefully considers lighting, composition, and timing to
capture the perfect shot, you need to be strategic about recording evidence of your professional capabilities.
Let's explore four key methods of documenting your accomplishments: artefacts (physical or digital items
you've created), public displays (such as presentations or exhibitions of your work), visual records
(photographs, videos, or screenshots that capture your achievements in action), and written records
(documentation like feedback, testimonials, or reflective pieces). By understanding these different
documentation methods and planning ahead to capture evidence as it happens, you'll avoid that all-too-
common scenario of trying to reconstruct past achievements from memory. Think of it as creating a
professional highlight reel, you want to be ready to capture those standout moments when they occur,
rather than attempting to recreate them after the fact.

Artefacts

Artefacts form the foundation of your professional portfolio, serving as tangible evidence of your
capabilities and achievements. These are the actual items you've created or contributed to in your
professional role, whether they're detailed technical documents, polished presentations, or physical
products you've developed. Think of artefacts as the concrete proof of your skills in action, much like how
an artist's portfolio contains actual examples of their work rather than just descriptions of what they can
do. It's essential to maintain copies of these professional outputs whenever possible, as they provide the
most direct and compelling evidence of your capabilities.

However, it's crucial to navigate this collection process ethically and within workplace guidelines. Many
organisations have specific policies about retaining copies of work products, particularly those containing
sensitive or proprietary information. If your employer has restrictions on keeping copies of work artefacts,
don't let this discourage you, there are alternative ways to document your achievements. For example,
you might create a detailed description of the project while omitting confidential details, obtain written
testimonials about your contribution, or capture the process and outcomes through approved photographs
153 | 8. DEVELOPING A PORTFOLIO

or screenshots. The key is to be proactive in thinking about documentation while respecting organisational
boundaries and intellectual property rights. Here are some examples of common professional artefacts:

   business reports and analyses
   marketing materials you've designed
   project plans and documentation
   presentation slides and speaking notes
   process improvement documents
   training materials you've developed
   software code or technical specifications
   research papers or white papers
   newsletters or communications you've written
   design mock-ups or prototypes.

Public Displays

Public displays of your work represent powerful portfolio evidence, as they've already been vetted and
deemed worthy of public consumption. These are particularly valuable because they demonstrate that your
work has met professional standards and contributed meaningfully to your field or organisation. Think of
public displays as your work's "greatest hits", they've already proven their worth by surviving scrutiny and
earning a place in the public domain. Whether it's a presentation at an industry conference, a published
article, or a successful project implementation, these achievements deserve careful documentation.

In today's digital age, there are numerous ways to capture and showcase these public accomplishments.
Professional networking platforms like LinkedIn serve as a living portfolio, allowing you to document your
achievements in real time and connect them to the broader professional narrative. Your own professional
website can provide a more detailed and personalised space to showcase these public works, giving you
                                                                                                               8. DEVELOPING A PORTFOLIO | 154

control over how they're presented and contextualised. However, don't wait until after the fact to
document these achievements. Taking photographs or screenshots during the development process
provides valuable evidence of your contribution and methodology. For instance, if you're leading a major
project, regular documentation of key milestones can tell a compelling story about your leadership and
project management capabilities.

Maintaining records of public recognition extends beyond your own documentation efforts. Professional
registers, industry publications, and organisational announcements that mention your contributions serve
as independent validation of your achievements. Consider maintaining a digital archive of links to these
references, as they provide external confirmation of your impact. This might include links to professional
association websites where you're listed as a contributor, news articles mentioning your work, or public
records of successful projects you've led. Remember to regularly update these records, as links can change
or become inactive over time. By systematically documenting public displays of your work, you create
a robust portfolio that showcases not just what you can do, but what you have already achieved in the
professional arena.

Here are examples of public displays that you should consider documenting for your portfolio:

                   online here:
                   https://jcu.pressbooks.pub/stem-advantage/?p=312#h5p-40

   Remember

       Capture these in real time whenever possible, as reconstructing evidence later can be
       challenging and important details may be missed.

Visual Records

Visual records provide compelling evidence of your professional accomplishments, capturing moments
and achievements in a way that written descriptions alone cannot convey. In our increasingly visual world,
high-quality photographs and images can instantly communicate the scope, complexity, and impact of
your work to potential employers or clients. Think of these visual records as professional snapshots that
tell the story of your career journey, from the planning stages of a major project through to its successful
155 | 8. DEVELOPING A PORTFOLIO

completion, or from your first presentation at a small team meeting to delivering keynotes at industry
conferences.
When capturing visual records, maintaining professional integrity is paramount. Your images should meet
three essential criteria: clarity, uniqueness, and authenticity. Clear images ensure that viewers can easily
understand what they're seeing without explanation. For visual records of public events or digital work
such as website designs or social media campaigns, it's crucial that your photographs or screenshots clearly
demonstrate your specific involvement. For instance, if documenting a conference presentation, ensure
the image shows you actually presenting rather than just the conference banner. When capturing digital
work, include elements that verify your role, such as your login credentials visible in the corner of a content
management system, or your name listed as the author of a social media campaign. These details help
establish the authenticity of your contribution and protect you from any accusations of misrepresenting
your work. Remember, in professional settings, the consequences of appearing to take credit for others'
work can be severe and long-lasting, potentially damaging both your reputation and career prospects.

Securing and managing your visual records requires the same level of professionalism as any other
confidential business document. Consider these images as valuable professional assets that document your
career progression. Establish a secure backup system that protects these resources while keeping them
accessible to you alone. This might involve using encrypted cloud storage, maintaining multiple backups
across secure devices, or utilising professional photo management software that includes security features.
Remember that these images might contain sensitive information about projects, clients, or workplace
environments, so treating them with appropriate confidentiality is essential to maintaining professional
trust and reputation.

Written Records

Written records form a crucial component of your professional portfolio, providing a narrative thread that
connects your various achievements and experiences. One of the most powerful platforms for maintaining
these written records is LinkedIn, which serves as both a professional journal and a public showcase of
your career journey. Through regular LinkedIn posts, you can document your professional growth in real
time, sharing insights from projects, reflecting on learning experiences, and demonstrating your expertise
                                                                                                               8. DEVELOPING A PORTFOLIO | 156

to a broader professional audience. The platform's endorsement and recommendation features also allow
you to collect written testimonials from colleagues and supervisors, adding external validation to your own
documentation of achievements.

Beyond LinkedIn, maintaining a personal professional journal provides a more private space for detailed
reflection and documentation. This journal, whether maintained as a traditional notebook, a series of
digital documents, or posts on your professional website, allows you to capture the nuanced details of your
professional experiences that might not be appropriate for public sharing but are valuable for your own
development and future reference. For instance, you might record specific challenges you've overcome,
lessons learned from projects, or detailed notes about your contributions to team initiatives. The key is
to establish a regular practice of documentation that works for you. Some professionals find success with
daily quick notes, while others prefer weekly or monthly detailed reflections. Whatever format you choose,
consistent documentation helps you build a rich repository of professional experiences that you can draw
upon when updating your portfolio or preparing for career advancement opportunities.

How to Store Your Portfolio

Creating an effective portfolio requires careful consideration of not just what evidence to include, but
how to present and share it. While collecting evidence of your professional development is crucial, equally
important is deciding whether to keep this information private or make it publicly accessible. This decision
significantly impacts both your career opportunities and professional security.

Private Portfolios

Private portfolios function like a professional vault, you control exactly when and with whom you share
your information. This approach offers several important advantages for early-career professionals.

Consider your resume as an example. While it might seem counterintuitive in our connected world,
keeping your detailed work history private often proves more beneficial than making it publicly available.
When you maintain private control over your resume, you can:

   customise it for specific opportunities without revealing your application strategy to current
      employers

   protect yourself from unauthorised use of your professional information
   prevent recruitment agencies from submitting your profile without your knowledge
   maintain greater control over your professional narrative.

Private portfolios typically take the form of carefully organised digital files or password-protected
ePortfolios. Think of these as your professional toolkit, always ready but only deployed when you choose.
The key is maintaining comprehensive records while keeping them secure until needed.
157 | 8. DEVELOPING A PORTFOLIO

Strategic Use of Public Portfolios

Public portfolios serve a different purpose, they act as your professional showcase, continuously visible
to potential employers and industry connections. However, successful public portfolios require careful
curation. Rather than sharing everything, consider making information public when:

   you want to establish yourself as a thought leader in your field
   you need to demonstrate ownership of original work or ideas
   you're actively seeking to engage with recruitment agencies
   you're building a professional brand in your industry.
For instance, a software engineer might maintain a public GitHub profile showcasing coding projects,
while keeping their detailed work history and references in a private portfolio. This balanced approach
allows them to demonstrate technical capabilities without exposing sensitive career information.

Making the Decision: Public or Private

When deciding whether to make specific portfolio elements public or private, ask yourself:

                   An interactive H5P element has been excluded from this version of the text. You can view it
                   online here:
        https://jcu.pressbooks.pub/stem-advantage/?p=312#h5p-41

For example, while you might share project outcomes or technical achievements publicly, keep
                                                                                                               8. DEVELOPING A PORTFOLIO | 158

documentation like performance reviews, reference letters, and detailed work histories private. This
approach allows you to maintain professional visibility while protecting sensitive information.

Implementing Your Portfolio Strategy

Once you've decided on your approach, implement it systematically:

For Private Portfolios

   create a secure digital filing system for your evidence
   maintain updated but separate versions of your resume for different purposes
   use password-protected cloud storage for sensitive documents
   keep a master list of what evidence you have available to share.

For Public Elements

   develop a professional social media presence that aligns with your career goals
   create focused content that demonstrates your expertise without revealing sensitive details
   regularly review and update public information to ensure it remains current and appropriate
   monitor how your public information appears in search results.

   Remember

       Your portfolio strategy can and should evolve as your career develops. What works during
       your internship might need adjustment as you move into more senior roles. The key is
       maintaining control over your professional narrative while strategically sharing information
       that advances your career goals.

       Living documents
       Think of your resume as a living story of your professional journey, one that needs regular
       care and updating to stay vibrant and relevant. Just as you wouldn't rely on an outdated
       map to navigate a changing city, your resume should evolve monthly to capture your
       growing experiences and achievements. Each role or project becomes a chapter in this story,
       with clear descriptions of your responsibilities forming the foundation and specific
159 | 8. DEVELOPING A PORTFOLIO

       achievements highlighting the most compelling moments. Consider LinkedIn as your
       professional showcase window, where you can display the public elements of your career
       story to a broader audience. Unlike a traditional resume, LinkedIn offers opportunities to
       demonstrate your professional currency through thoughtful posts about industry trends,
       innovative ideas, or lessons learned. This platform allows you to build a narrative that goes
       beyond your formal experiences, showcasing your engagement with your field and your
       potential for future contributions.

Managing Professional References

The art of maintaining professional references extends beyond simply collecting names and contact details.
It requires thoughtful curation of professional relationships that can speak meaningfully about different
aspects of your capabilities and character.

Building Your Reference Network

Think of your professional references as a carefully selected team of advocates for your career development.
Aim to maintain relationships with at least three supervisors or senior colleagues who can speak to different
aspects of your professional capabilities

A technical supervisor can verify your practical skills and knowledge, speaking to your ability to apply
theoretical understanding to real-world challenges. For instance, a senior engineer who supervised your
project work can discuss specific technical challenges you've overcome and your approach to problem-
solving.

A team leader or project manager can address your interpersonal effectiveness, including your
communication skills and ability to work collaboratively. They can provide concrete examples of how you
interact with colleagues, handle conflicts, or contribute to team dynamics.

A direct supervisor or manager can validate your professional behaviours and work ethic. Their
observations of your day-to-day conduct, from punctuality to initiative, carry particular weight with
potential employers as indicators of your reliability and professionalism.

Modern Reference Practices

The landscape of professional references has evolved significantly with digital transformation. While
LinkedIn recommendations and written reference letters once played central roles in professional
                                                                                                               8. DEVELOPING A PORTFOLIO | 160

validation, today's employers typically prefer direct communication through email or digital forms. This
shift reflects both the need for efficiency and the desire for more candid feedback about candidates.
Rather than collecting static testimonials, focus on maintaining active professional relationships with your
references. Keep them updated about your career progress and notify them when you're applying for
positions where they might be contacted. This ongoing communication ensures they can provide current,
relevant insights about your capabilities when asked.

   Remember

       The strength of a reference often lies not in their title or position, but in their ability to speak
       specifically about your work and professional growth. When selecting references, prioritise
       those who can provide detailed examples of your contributions and capabilities over those
       with impressive titles but limited direct experience working with you. Keep your reference
       list current, ensuring contact details are up to date and that each reference remains willing
       and able to speak on your behalf.

     Activity 8.2: Developing Your Portfolio Strategy

     This three-part activity helps you create a structured approach to managing your professional
     portfolio, references, and online presence. Each part builds upon the previous one, helping you
     develop a comprehensive portfolio strategy that aligns with your career goals.
     Part 1: Portfolio audit and planning
     Begin by taking stock of your current professional evidence and planning your portfolio
     strategy:

           Create three columns in a document or spreadsheet:
                   evidence I currently have
                   evidence I need to collect
                   public/private classification.

           For each piece of evidence you list, note:
                   where it's currently stored
161 | 8. DEVELOPING A PORTFOLIO

                   when it was last updated
                   who has access to it
                   whether it should be public or private.

           Reflect on your findings by answering:

                   What gaps do you notice in your current evidence collection?
                   Which items might be better served by changing their public/private status?
                   How could you better organise your existing evidence?

     Part 2: Reference network development
     Create a strategic plan for building and maintaining your professional references:

           First, list potential references who could speak to your:

                   technical capabilities
                   interpersonal skills
                   professional behaviours.

           For each potential reference:

                   write a brief summary of your professional relationship
                   note specific projects or achievements they witnessed
                   identify what aspects of your capabilities they could best validate.

           Then, develop a communication plan:

                   How will you maintain contact with each reference?
                   What updates will you share with them?
                   How will you approach them when you need a reference?

     Part 3: Digital presence review
     Conduct a thorough review of your digital professional presence:

           Google yourself and document what appears on the first two pages of results.
           Review your LinkedIn profile, noting:

                   which experiences need updating
                   what achievements could be better highlighted
                   whether your profile presents a cohesive professional narrative.

           Create a content calendar for the next three months, planning:

                   professional updates you'll share
                   industry insights you could post
                                                                                                         8. DEVELOPING A PORTFOLIO | 162

              connections you want to make.
Part 4: Reflection

      How well does your digital presence align with your career goals?
      What adjustments would make your online presence more effective?
      How can you better balance privacy and visibility in your professional portfolio?

   Remember

       This activity isn't a one-time exercise. Return to it regularly, particularly after significant
       professional experiences or when preparing for career transitions.

Key Takeaways

In this chapter, we covered:
      how professional reputation develops through three interconnected channels, public
        profiles, private experiences, and word of mouth, with research showing that alignment
        between these channels creates the strongest professional credibility and career
        opportunities
      the importance of strategically curating portfolio evidence through multiple
        documentation methods including artefacts, public displays, visual records, and written
        documentation, while maintaining appropriate professional boundaries and intellectual
        property considerations
      how to make informed decisions about keeping portfolio elements private versus public,
        based on careful evaluation of purpose, control needs, currency of information, and
        security considerations rather than defaulting to complete transparency
      the crucial role of maintaining active, strategically selected professional references who
        can speak to different aspects of your capabilities, with emphasis on keeping these
        relationships current and communication channels open rather than relying on static
        testimonials
163 | 8. DEVELOPING A PORTFOLIO

     Imagine this Scenario

     Michael sat on his childhood bed, staring at the university degree hanging on his wall. Three
     months had passed since completing his environmental engineering internship at Brisbane
     Water, and four months since graduating. The initial euphoria of finishing university with
     distinction had faded into an uncomfortable reality and he had no job prospects and mounting
     anxiety about his future.
     During his final semester, while his classmates attended career fairs and networked with
     industry professionals, Michael had buried himself in textbooks and assignment submissions. "I
     need a perfect GPA to get into a top PhD program," he'd repeatedly assured himself. He'd
     turned down invitations to industry networking events, reasoning that those hours were better
     spent perfecting assignments. His dream of pursuing groundbreaking research in environmental
165 | 9. COMPLETING YOUR INTERNSHIP AND PLANNING NEXT STEPS

     remediation technologies had driven every decision, including treating his internship primarily
     as a way to impress potential PhD supervisors with his technical capabilities.
     His internship supervisor had hinted at potential opportunities within the organisation, but
     Michael had politely deflected these conversations, explaining his academic aspirations. He'd
     assumed his excellent performance reviews and impressive grade point average would naturally
     lead to PhD offers. Now, scrolling through his phone, he could see his former intern colleagues
     sharing LinkedIn updates about their new roles at engineering firms, while his own PhD
     applications remained unanswered. Several universities had responded that they wanted to see
     more research experience and industry engagement, things he'd overlooked in his singular focus
     on grades.
     The rejection email from his fifth PhD application this week glowed mockingly on his screen.
     "While your academic achievements are impressive, we are seeking candidates with
     demonstrated research experience and project management capabilities..." The words struck
     him like a physical blow. His stellar academic record and completed internship somehow weren't
     translating into research opportunities. He realised now that he had missed valuable
     opportunities to engage in research projects, build relationships with potential supervisors, and
     develop his research network.

     Tomorrow, he would start another shift at the local shopping centre, a "temporary" retail
     position that was starting to feel uncomfortably permanent. The irony wasn't lost on him, he
     had a degree in environmental engineering and dreams of a PhD, yet spent his days explaining
     return policies and restocking shelves. His manager had already offered him a supervisor
     position, seeing his capability for more responsibility. While the promotion was flattering, it felt
     like stepping further away from his academic aspirations.
     "At least I'm earning money," he told himself, trying to ignore the growing pit in his stomach.

     But each time a customer asked about his studies or career plans, he felt a sharp pang of regret.
     He had let the crucial transition period between graduation and further study slip away, and
     now faced the challenging task of trying to enter academia as an outsider rather than making a
     smooth progression from coursework to PhD program.
     The task of restarting his academic journey felt overwhelming. His internship experience was
     becoming increasingly distant, his professional connections were fading, and his technical
     knowledge needed refreshing. What had seemed like a logical decision, focusing on grades
     above all else, had created a significant hurdle in his academic progression. He now understood
     that academic excellence alone doesn't guarantee research opportunities, and that professional
     relationships, research experience, and industry engagement carry just as much weight as
     grades in PhD applications.

Documenting Your Impact: Final Achievements
and Project Handovers

As your internship draws to a close, thorough documentation of your achievements and careful
preparation of handover materials become crucial tasks that impact both your future career opportunities
and your professional reputation. Think of this documentation as creating a professional legacy, it
demonstrates your contributions while ensuring your work continues to benefit the organisation after your
departure.

Capturing Final Achievements

Recording your achievements requires more than simply listing completed tasks. Consider the story of
James, a chemical engineering intern who initially struggled to document his contributions effectively. In
his first draft achievement list, he wrote "Helped with laboratory testing procedures." While accurate, this
description failed to capture the scope and impact of his work. After receiving feedback from his supervisor,
he revised this to: "Optimised laboratory testing procedures for polymer degradation analysis, reducing
processing time by 35% while maintaining 99.9% accuracy rates. This improvement allowed the team to
increase weekly sample processing from 50 to 75 specimens without requiring additional resources."

Notice how the revised version includes:

   the specific technical area (polymer degradation analysis)
   quantifiable improvements (35% time reduction)
   quality metrics (99.9% accuracy)
167 | 9. COMPLETING YOUR INTERNSHIP AND PLANNING NEXT STEPS

   business impact (increased processing capacity)
   resource implications (no additional resources required).
This detailed approach to documenting achievements serves multiple purposes. It helps your organisation
understand your contributions, provides concrete examples for your portfolio, and gives future employers
specific evidence of your capabilities. When documenting your achievements, consider structuring each
entry around these elements:

Creating Effective Handover Documentation

Professional handover documentation ensures your work continues to benefit the organisation after your
departure. Think of it as creating a detailed map that allows others to navigate and build upon your
contributions effectively.

     Example

     Consider the experience of Sarah, a software development intern who initially created handover
     notes consisting mainly of code comments and basic user instructions. When a critical bug
     emerged two weeks after her departure, the team struggled to resolve it because they lacked
     context about her design decisions and implementation approach. This situation taught her the
                                                            9. COMPLETING YOUR INTERNSHIP AND PLANNING NEXT STEPS | 168

     importance of comprehensive handover documentation that includes not just what was done,
     but why certain approaches were chosen.

Effective handover documentation should include:

   project overview
   clear description of project objectives
   current status of deliverables
   key stakeholders and their roles
   important deadlines and milestones
   technical Documentation
   detailed procedures and workflows
   access credentials and permissions (appropriately secured)
   known issues or limitations
   future improvement opportunities
   location of relevant files and resources
   contact Information
   key team members and their responsibilities
   subject matter experts consulted
   external vendors or contractors involved
   decision context
   reasoning behind major technical decisions
   attempted approaches that weren't successful
   potential future challenges to consider
   lessons learned during implementation.

When preparing handover documentation, imagine you're creating instructions for someone who has your
technical skills but lacks any context about your specific projects. What information would they need to
continue your work effectively? What potential questions or challenges might they face?

   Remember

       Maintain appropriate confidentiality in your documentation. Work with your supervisor to
       understand what information can be included in your personal portfolio versus what should
       remain solely in internal handover documents. This distinction helps protect both your
       organisation's interests and your professional reputation.

Maintaining Professional Connections Post-Internship

Earlier in this book, we explored how to build professional relationships during your internship, including
the strategic use of LinkedIn and the development of workplace connections. As your internship
concludes, these foundational elements become crucial for maintaining long-term professional
relationships. Let's examine how to effectively leverage these established connections during your transition
from intern to professional.
Your LinkedIn profile serves as a living bridge between your internship experience and future
opportunities. When documenting your internship achievements on LinkedIn, consider how your updates
can nurture professional relationships. For example, rather than simply listing technical accomplishments,
acknowledge the collaborative nature of your work. Perhaps instead of writing an update or note that
states:

       Contributed to the development of a predictive maintenance system that reduced downtime
       by 25%, working closely with the engineering team to integrate machine learning
       algorithms with existing maintenance protocols.

Perhaps write:

       Proud to have collaborated with @Sarah Chen and @David Thompson on developing our
       new predictive maintenance system. By combining Sarah's expertise in signal processing
       with David's deep knowledge of our maintenance protocols, we achieved a 25% reduction in
       equipment downtime. Special thanks to our mentor @James Liu for guiding our integration
       of machine learning algorithms into the existing framework. Excited to see how the team
       continues to build on this foundation!

This approach accomplishes several goals:

   documents your technical achievement
   acknowledges team contributions, highlighting the contributions of specific individuals
   creates opportunities for colleagues to engage with your update
   demonstrates your understanding of both technical and collaborative aspects of professional work.
                                                             9. COMPLETING YOUR INTERNSHIP AND PLANNING NEXT STEPS | 170

Remember our earlier discussion about workplace relationships and person-environment fit? Those
relationships you've cultivated during your internship require careful attention during the transition
period. Consider developing a systematic approach to maintaining these connections:

   document key professional relationships
   note specific projects you worked on together
   record unique insights each colleague shared
   identify areas of mutual professional interest
   track preferred communication styles and methods
   create a Communication Calendar
   schedule regular check-ins with key mentors
   set reminders to engage with colleagues' LinkedIn updates
   plan periodic emails sharing relevant industry insights
   maintain awareness of important organisational milestones
   develop value-adding Interactions
   share articles relevant to ongoing projects
   offer insights from your new experiences
   maintain interest in project outcomes
   connect colleagues with useful resources or contacts.

Let's examine how these principles played out differently for Sarah, James, and Michael.

     Michael's Story Continued

     Six months into his retail position, Michael received a LinkedIn notification, James had tagged
     him in a post about their shared environmental engineering internship project. The post
     celebrated the one-year anniversary of their stormwater management system implementation,
     acknowledging everyone who had contributed to its success. This unexpected connection
     prompted Michael to reflect on the relationships he had let slip away.
     Rather than continuing to focus solely on PhD applications, Michael began reaching out to his
     former colleagues. He started with a thoughtful message to Sarah, who had recently shared her
     success implementing environmental monitoring systems at her new firm. Instead of leading
     with his own situation, he genuinely congratulated her on her achievements and asked
     thoughtful questions about her work. This authentic interest in her professional journey opened
     the door to rebuilding their connection.
171 | 9. COMPLETING YOUR INTERNSHIP AND PLANNING NEXT STEPS

     Through these renewed connections, Michael gained valuable insights about combining
     academic and industry aspirations. Sarah shared how she maintained research connections
     while working in industry, even co-authoring papers with university partners. James described
     his involvement in industry-funded research projects that aligned academic rigor with practical
     applications. These conversations helped Michael understand that pursuing a PhD and
     maintaining industry connections weren't mutually exclusive goals.
     These rekindled relationships proved transformative. When a research position opened at
     Sarah's firm focusing on environmental remediation technologies, perfectly aligned with
     Michael's PhD interests, she immediately thought of him. The role offered the opportunity to
     conduct industry-based research while maintaining connections with academic institutions.
     James, who served on the company's research advisory board, provided a strong reference
     highlighting Michael's technical capabilities and collaborative potential.

Michael's story demonstrates that while early career transitions benefit from maintaining consistent
professional connections, it's never too late to rebuild these relationships authentically. His experience also
highlights how professional networks can help bridge the gap between academic and industry aspirations,
creating opportunities that serve both goals.
This experience taught Michael valuable lessons about maintaining professional relationships:

   professional connections thrive on genuine interest in others' success
   industry and academic pursuits can complement rather than compete
   authentic relationship building matters more than perfect timing
   former colleagues can provide unique perspectives on career possibilities
   professional networks often reveal unexpected opportunities aligning multiple career goals.

The path from internship to career rarely follows a straight line. As Michael's journey illustrates, our
professional relationships often serve as the bridges that connect different aspects of our career aspirations.
Whether pursuing academic excellence, industry recognition, or a combination of both, maintaining
                                                             9. COMPLETING YOUR INTERNSHIP AND PLANNING NEXT STEPS | 172

authentic professional connections provides opportunities we might never discover in isolation. His initial
focus on academic achievements at the expense of professional relationships could have permanently
limited his career options. However, by reconnecting authentically with former colleagues like Sarah and
James, Michael discovered possibilities that aligned his research interests with industry innovation. This
experience demonstrates that professional networks are not just about career advancement, they're about
creating a community of peers who understand and support our professional growth. When we maintain
genuine interest in our colleagues' successes, remain open to different career pathways, and actively nurture
professional relationships, we create an environment where opportunities can find us. As you conclude
your own internship, remember that the connections you've built are not just entries in your contact
list, they're the foundation of your professional community, capable of revealing pathways that might
otherwise remain hidden. By maintaining these relationships authentically and remaining genuinely
interested in others' successes, you build a professional network that supports not just your immediate
career goals, but your long-term professional development. The time invested in nurturing these
connections, as Michael discovered, often leads to opportunities that perfectly align our professional
aspirations with practical possibilities.

     Draft three different versions of a LinkedIn update about a significant project from your
     internship:

           Version 1: Technical focus

                   Write a purely technical description of the project and its outcomes.

           Version 2: Relationship focus

                   Create an update that emphasises collaboration and team achievements.

           Version 3: Integrated approach

                   combine technical achievements with relationship acknowledgments
                   include specific colleague tags
                   highlight both measurable outcomes and collaborative success.
                                                             9. COMPLETING YOUR INTERNSHIP AND PLANNING NEXT STEPS | 174

           Share these drafts with a classmate and discuss:
                   Which version feels most engaging?
                   How might each version impact professional relationships?
                   What opportunities for future interaction does each create?

     Part 4: Transition timeline
     Create a 3-month timeline spanning your final month of internship and two months following,
     including:

              https://jcu.pressbooks.pub/stem-advantage/?p=313#h5p-44

     Remember

             The goal isn't just to create a plan, but to develop sustainable practices for maintaining
             professional relationships throughout your career. Consider how each element of your plan
             supports both your immediate transition and long-term professional growth.

     Share your completed transition plan with a peer, discussing:
                   How does your plan balance technical documentation with relationship
                      maintenance?
                   What challenges do you anticipate in implementing your plan?
                   How might your plan adapt to different career scenarios?
                   What opportunities for mutual support can you identify?

This structured approach helps ensure you maintain valuable professional connections while creating
comprehensive documentation of your achievements, setting the foundation for continued career growth.
