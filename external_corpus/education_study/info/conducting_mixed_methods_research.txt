This book is designed to provide principles, strategies, and guidance on how to conduct
mixed-methods research. It is intended to guide social science researchers through the
mixed-methods research process by describing the steps to be taken, along with examples and
suggestions. In recent years, we have observed a significant increase in interest in mixed-methods
research. The popularity of this method can be seen from a growing number of publications using
this method in various social science disciplines of fields (hereinafter fields), such as psychology,
management, marketing, and information systems. In the early development of mixed-methods
research, people who were unfamiliar with this approach would argue about philosophical issues
associated with the paradigms debate and whether it is appropriate to mix methods housed in
different research paradigms. Today, this approach to scientific inquiry and methods is more
widely accepted, with funding agencies and journals encouraging researchers to enhance the rigor
of their work and the consequent contributions by using a mixed-methods research approach.
However, we observed that, although the interest in mixed-methods research continues to grow,
conducting the research and then writing and publishing a mixed-methods paper are fraught with
significant challenges. To aid in combating these challenges, this book seeks to assist researchers
in various fields to use mixed-methods research effectively.

The target audience for this book includes scholars in various social science fields who are
interested in using mixed-methods research. This especially includes graduate/PhD students
seeking to develop and use mixed-methods research in theses/dissertations. Instructors teaching a
mixed-methods research course can use this book, exercises, and associated slides to teach
mixed-methods courses to various audiences. We hope that researchers will find this book useful
in guiding them through the research process, from defining research questions to writing articles
using a mixed-methods research approach. For researchers who are well trained in either the
qualitative and/or quantitative methods, we hope this book will bridge the gap between the two
types of research methods by guiding researchers on how to think about the purposes of mixed-
methods research, design mixed-methods studies, and develop meta-inferences by integrating
findings from both types of methods. We illustrate different approaches of conducting
mixed-methods research by providing many examples of published mixed-methods empirical
articles from various fields.

This book uses a step-by-step approach for conducting mixed-methods research and we offer
several paper templates that will help structure different types of a mixed-methods articles based
on the purpose of the study. By doing so, we hope that researchers can effectively communicate
the objectives and contributions of their research to their intended audiences.

This book is divided into three sections:

Section 1. Introduction to Mixed-Methods Research
Section 2. Designing and Conducting Mixed-Methods Research
Section 3. Making Contributions and Publishing Papers Using Mixed-Methods Research

      INTRODUCTION TO MIXED-METHODS RESEARCH

In the first part of the book, we highlight the distinctions between mixed-methods research and
other research methods. It consists of three chapters. In Chapter 1. Mixed-Methods Research as
the Third Research Approach, we discuss the characteristics of mixed-methods research. We also
discuss the strengths and weaknesses of qualitative and quantitative research, and highlight the
value of mixed-methods research. In Chapter 2. Philosophical Foundations of Mixed-Methods
Research, we discuss the philosophical foundations of mixed-methods research, including
pragmatism, critical realism, transformative emancipatory, and dialectic stance. For each paradigm
discussed, we provide an approach to knowledge creation using mixed-methods research. In
Chapter 3. Nature of Theory in Mixed-Methods Research, we focus on the role of theory in
mixed-methods research. This chapter will help researchers in using mixed-methods research to
develop and test theory in the same research inquiry.

                                                                                                              Section 1. Introduction | 1

                   MIXED-METHODS RESEARCH AS
                  THE THIRD RESEARCH APPROACH

Mixed-methods research, an approach to research in which researchers mix or combine
quantitative and qualitative research techniques, methods, concepts, and languages into a single
study or a series of studies (Johnson & Onwuegbuzie, 2004), has been recognized as the third
research approach beyond traditional qualitative and quantitative approaches. It has developed a
platform of ideas and practices that is credible and distinctive, making the approach a viable
alternative to a single method approach (i.e., quantitative or qualitative research approach)
(Denscombe, 2008). Its popularity can be observed from an increased number of mixed-methods
research articles in journals, conference proceedings, and books across a number of fields (e.g.,
Halcomb, 2019, published mixed-methods research guidelines in the nursing field; Greene, 2007,
Creswell, 2015, Plano Clark and Ivankova, 2015, each published a textbook on mixed-methods
research). Various funding agencies around the world, including the National Institutes of Health
(NIH) and the National Science Foundation (NSF) in the US, also encourage scholars to use mixed-
methods research in their work (Coyle et al., 2018; Guetterman et al., 2019). An NSF task force
noted that "evaluators should attempt to obtain the most useful information to answer the critical
questions about the project and, in so doing, rely on a mixed-methods approach whenever
possible" (National Science Foundation, 2010, p. 57). In 2010, NIH also provided guidelines for
investigators on how to properly develop and evaluate mixed-methods research proposals
(Creswell et al., 2011). Given an increased interest in this approach, it is imperative not only to
know qualitative or quantitative research procedures, but also how to properly use both methods
in a single inquiry, study or research program.

Although mixed-methods research has gained popularity in the social sciences, issues regarding
its differences from quantitative research (dominated by the positivist paradigm and its variants)
and qualitative research (dominated by the constructivist and interpretivist paradigm and its
variants) remain. Researchers who have aligned themselves with a particular approach, rooted in
a particular paradigm, struggle to accept the compatibility thesis, i.e., mixing of qualitative and
quantitative research methods. The two dominant research approaches have resulted in two
research cultures, leading to a belief that if one decides to use both qualitative and quantitative
methods in the same research project, each method should be executed independently because each
is based on different paradigmatic assumptions (e.g., Brewer & Hunter, 1989; Morse, 2003).

The lack of knowledge and skills necessary to conduct both quantitative and qualitative research
has also been an obstacle to mixed-methods research. Because scholars are commonly trained only
in one school of thought, conducting mixed-methods research can be difficult without
collaborating with scholars from other/different schools of thought. Even so, using a mixed-
methods research approach requires an understanding of not only two dominant research
paradigms, but also strategies to accommodate the differences between them and, perhaps more
importantly, strategies to leverage the complementarities between them. Due to the lack of training
in mixed-methods research, it is common to see little or no integration of findings from qualitative
and quantitative studies within a single inquiry. According to Venkatesh et al. (2013), such practice
not only leads to contribution shrinkage (i.e., missing the opportunity to discover, develop, or

                                                                                                                              Chapter 1 | 3
extend a theory using findings from different research approaches), but also communal disutility
(i.e., the entire community of researchers who are interested in the phenomenon under study fails
to learn intricacies of the phenomenon because an integrative view is not provided).

To provide clarity and consistency regarding what mixed-methods research is, in this first chapter,
we specifically discuss different definitions, characteristics, and value of mixed-methods research.
Teddlie and Tashakkori (2003) raised this issue and noted that the disagreement among scholars
on the definition of mixed-methods research is "a sign of strength in a field that is still in its
adolescence because it indicates that different authors disagree about exactly what a term means
but nevertheless think the term is important" (p. 8). In this chapter, we revisit this issue and discuss
the status of mixed-methods research as the third research approach. Further, to facilitate the
ongoing debate on the incompatibility of methods, we discuss the strengths and weaknesses of
each methodology and underscore the role of mixed-methods research in addressing the limitations
weaknesses associated with each method. Because this chapter is the foundation on which the
remainder of the book is built, we also present a detailed review of the evolution of mixed-methods
research over the years that will serve as background for those seeking to understand some of the
key debates and issues related to mixed-methods research. By identifying and reviewing the unique
aspects of mixed-methods research, this chapter will provide insights about the conduct of good
mixed-methods research.

                       1.1. Defining Mixed-Methods Research

Scholars have been conducting mixed-methods research for decades but referring to it by different
terms. Although mixed-methods research has been widely accepted as a legitimate research
approach, there have been inconsistencies in the definitions of terms (Teddlie & Tashakkori,
2003). Early articles on the application of mixed-methods research have used different terms, such
as multi-method, between or across method triangulation, integrated, hybrid, combined, and mixed
methodology, to refer to this type of research (Driscoll et al., 2007). Among these terms, the terms
multi-method research and mixed-methods research have often been confused with one another.
Across the literature, multi-method research designs have been used to describe the following
(Teddlie & Tashakkori, 2003):

· The use of two or more quantitative methods;
· The use of two or more qualitative methods;
· The use of relatively separate quantitative and qualitative methods; and
· The use of both qualitative and quantitative methods.

To address this inconsistency, Teddlie and Tashakkori (2003) proposed a typology of multiple
methods designs that incorporates both multi-method and mixed-methods designs in a consistent
manner. They defined multiple methods research as when "more than one method or more than
one worldview is used" (p. 11). From this definition, multiple methods research incorporates all
the various combinations of methods that include, in a substantive manner, more than one data
collection procedure. Both multi-method and mixed-methods research fall under this umbrella (see
Figure 1-1).

A multi-method approach allows researchers to use either "two or more qualitative methods" or
"two or more quantitative methods." These designs do not require a combination of qualitative and

4 | The Third Research Approach
quantitative methods (Teddlie & Tashakkori, 2003; Venkatesh et al., 2013). For example,
Fetvadjiev et al. (2018) used a multi-method qualitative design to study the differences and
similarities in the predictability and consistency of behavior in two distinct cultural groups/races
in South Africa. Their study 1 was a diary study that asked participants to record their behaviors
and the situations in which they had occurred. Their study 2 was a laboratory experiment where
participants were video-recorded in a laboratory and external observers scored their behaviors.

                                  Figure 1-1. Multiple Methods Designs
Mixed-methods designs refer to the use of qualitative and quantitative approaches in the same
inquiry or research project. For example, in their second study, Balasubramanian et al. (2018) used
data from four surveys and over twenty interviews to examine the effects of deadline-related time
pressures on workflows, task sorting, and work quality. The first survey was conducted to
understand the role of inventors in the patent application process; the second and third surveys
were conducted to understand the incentives and penalties faced by patent attorneys in the patent
filing and prosecution process; and the fourth survey included a cost-estimation exercise to
estimate the additional monetary costs of errors due to rushing. In-depth interviews with
practitioners were conducted to obtain detailed information on the patenting process inside firms,
as well as to gain insights on the observed clustering of patent applications.
Consistent with this discussion, we view mixed-methods designs as one category of multiple
methods designs. Teddlie and Tashakkori (2003) differentiated mixed-methods research from
mixed model research by suggesting that in mixed-methods research, researchers use qualitative
and quantitative data collection and analysis techniques, wherein mixing occurs in the method
section of the study, whereas in mixed model research, mixing occurs in many or all stages of the
study. However, to allow for mixing in various stages in mixed-methods research nomenclatures,
we categorize mixed model research as one of the mixing strategies of mixed-methods research,
i.e., fully mixed-methods research design, because the difference between these two designs is not
restricted to their worldviews, but to where the mixing takes place. We discuss this further in
Chapter 5.

                                                                                                                              Chapter 1 | 5
1.1.1. Mixed-Methods Research--Method Versus Methodology
An early discussion on mixed-methods research in social sciences can be traced to Campbell and
Fiske (1959) who developed the idea of multitrait-multimethod triangulation. They argued that
more than one method should be used in the validation process to ensure results from a study are
valid and not a methodological artifact. From this early work, some scholars (e.g., Denzin, 1978;
Jick, 1979) initiated the use of triangulation as a practice to combine methodologies in the same
study. The kind of triangulation involving the use of both qualitative and quantitative methods is
called between (or across) methods and more recently is known as mixed-methods research. The
focus in traditional, early mixed-methods research was on method selection as a tool used to
answer research questions. The basic assumption of this early perspective of mixed-methods
research is that the weaknesses of one method will be compensated by the strengths of another
method (Jick, 1979).

Grounded in the triangulation perspective, Greene et al. (1989) proposed a conceptual framework
for mixed-methods research designs by defining mixed-methods research designs as "those that
include at least one quantitative method (designed to collect numbers) and one qualitative method
(designed to collect words), where neither type of method is inherently linked to any particular
inquiry paradigm" (p. 256). Their definition placed greater emphasis on mixing methods for
various purposes and less emphasis on paradigms. They noted that "the notion of mixing
paradigms is problematic for designs with triangulation or complementarity purposes, acceptable
but still problematic for designs with a development or expansion intent, and actively encouraged
for designs with an initiation intent" (p. 271). This suggests that, whereas methods can be
combined as long as they are appropriate to answer the research questions, paradigms and their
assumptions can be ignored and should not be a researcher's focus in an inquiry (Maxwell &
Mittapalli, 2010).

After the initial work of Greene et al. (1989), the definition of mixed-methods research has
undergone considerable revision. To better understand the evolution of the definitions, we review
the definitions and characteristics of mixed-methods research over the years. Different definitions
of mixed-methods research from selected sources, sorted by year, are listed in Table 1-1.

As can be seen from Table 1-1, a number of scholars (e.g., Tashakkori & Teddlie, 1998; Teddlie
& Tashakkori, 2003) broadened the scope of mixed-methods research by shifting the focus from
"method" to "methodology" or research approach. Whereas method refers to specific strategies or
procedures for implementing mixed-methods research designs, including data collection, data
analysis, and sampling strategy, methodology involves a broad inquiry logic or general approach
to mixed-methods research that guides the selection of a specific method (Teddlie & Tashakkori,
2010). A well-known article, published by Johnson et al. (2007) in the Journal of Mixed-Methods
Research, is at the center of this discussion. They asked 21 researchers to define mixed-methods
research and obtained 19 definitions. Based on their review, they defined mixed-methods research
as "the type of research in which a researcher or a team of researchers combines elements of
qualitative and quantitative research approaches (e.g., use of qualitative and quantitative
viewpoints, data collection, analysis, inference techniques) for the broad purposes of breadth and
depth of understanding and corroboration" (p. 123). In addition to defining mixed-methods
research as a methodology, Johnson et al. and a few other researchers (e.g., Creswell et al., 2011;
Driscoll et al., 2007) elaborated on the purposes of mixed-methods research in their definition.

In response to the definition of mixed-methods research from a "methodology" perspective,
Creswell (2010) noted that "In my own work, I view mixed methods primarily as a method
approach . . . because of the difficulty of convincing many individuals that mixing of philosophical
foundations is possible . . . In my writings and workshops, I suggest that mixed methods is more
than simply the collection of two independent strands of quantitative (QUAN) and qualitative
(QUAL) data . . . mixed methods involves the connection, integration, or linking of these two
strands" (p. 51). Although Creswell was inclined to support mixed-methods research as a "third
methodological movement," Creswell acknowledged that scholars have entered the area of
mixed-methods research from different perspectives--i.e., some come from a method orientation
and others from a methodology orientation--and thus, differences should be expected. In an effort
to integrate these differences into the definition of mixed-methods research, Creswell and Plano

8 | The Third Research Approach
Clark (2018) viewed mixed-methods research as "multiple ways of seeing"--the definition should
combine a method, research design, and philosophical orientation viewed mixed-methods as
"multiple ways of seeing"--the definition should combine a method, research design, and
philosophical orientation.

1.1.2. Characteristics of Mixed-Methods Research
As shown in Table 1-1, Creswell and Plano Clark (2018) proposed four core characteristics of
mixed-methods research. In addition to these core characteristics, which focus on the
mixed-methods research process, new characteristics have been added over the years. We discuss
five characteristics that distinguish mixed-methods research from other research approaches.

          Use of Both Qualitative and Quantitative Methods
Mixed-methods research needs to employ at least one qualitative method and one quantitative
method in the same study or research project (Denscombe, 2008). However, mixed-methods
research is more than simply a collection of two types of data; it must clearly specify the
sequencing and priority that is given to the qualitative and quantitative elements of the study and
explicitly integrate the qualitative and quantitative results (Creswell, 2010; Venkatesh et al., 2013).
We argue that such an integration of findings is one of the core elements of mixed-methods
research. This integration, or identification of meta-inferences, is a key differentiator between
mixed-methods research and a single method approach. If researchers do not provide and explain
meta-inferences, the core objective of conducting mixed-methods research is not achieved
(Venkatesh et al., 2013).

          Methodological Eclecticism
The second characteristic of mixed-methods research is methodological eclecticism, defined as
"selecting and then synergistically integrating the most appropriate techniques from a myriad of
[qualitative], [quantitative], and mixed-methods to more thoroughly investigate a phenomenon of
interest" (Teddlie & Tashakkori, 2010, p. 8). This characteristic is drawn from a rejection of the
incompatibility of methods thesis, which states that qualitative and quantitative methods cannot be
mixed due to fundamental differences between the paradigms underlying those methods (Teddlie
& Tashakkori, 2010). Methodological eclecticism means that we are free to combine methods
when those methods are the best tools to answer research questions. Thus, the best method for any
given study in the social sciences may be purely qualitative or purely quantitative, rather than any
mixing. This leads to a characteristic of mixed-methods research, which we discuss in section
1.1.2.4: focus on both confirmatory and exploratory research questions.

          Paradigm Pluralism
The third characteristic of mixed-methods research is paradigm pluralism--"the belief that a
variety of paradigms may serve as the underlying philosophy for the use of mixed-methods"
(Teddlie & Tashakkori, 2010, p. 9). Unlike qualitative and quantitative research, mixed-methods
research allows the use of multiple paradigms in a single study or research program. Alternative
paradigms that can serve as an underlying philosophy for the use of mixed-methods research
include pragmatism, critical realism, and transformative emancipatory. We will discuss different
paradigms in Chapter 2. However, because each paradigm has its own assumptions that could be
problematic when combined (e.g., inconsistent), this practice should be approached carefully. As
noted by Denzin (2012), "it is one thing to endorse pluralism, or multiple frameworks, but it is
quite another to build a social science on what-works pragmatism" (p. 83). Although the

                                                                                                                              Chapter 1 | 9
incompatibility thesis will continue to resurface as long as there are philosophical debates in social
inquiry, scholars using a mixed-methods approach should be diligent and persistent in their defense
of the compatibility thesis (Teddlie & Tashakkori, 2012). We believe that if scholars embrace
pluralism within mixed-methods research, it will lead to stronger inferences and offer richer
insights into phenomena being studied compared to using a single philosophical perspective.

          Focus on Both Exploratory and Confirmatory Research Questions
Research questions are crucial in all research--and this is no different in mixed-methods research.
Mixed-methods research enables researchers to address exploratory and confirmatory research
questions simultaneously and, therefore, generate and evaluate theory at the same time (Venkatesh
et al., 2016). Exploratory questions are characteristically broad questions and have one or more of
the following purposes: to find out what is happening, to seek insights, and/or to assess phenomena
in a new light (Sim & Wright, 2000). In contrast, confirmatory research questions tend to be more
specific and serve to test a theory or hypothesis. In general, researchers can only address one type
of research question in a single method approach. A mixed-methods research approach is suitable
when researchers need to answer two types of questions--e.g., using a qualitative approach to
identify the main constructs and their relationships and using a quantitative approach to test the
significance of the relationships.

          Emphasis on Diversity at All Levels of the Research Enterprise
Diversity as a characteristic goes beyond methodological eclecticism and paradigm pluralism
discussed above (Teddlie & Tashakkori, 2010). A diversity emphasis highlights that
mixed-methods research can simultaneously address a diverse range of exploratory and
confirmatory questions, and it provides an opportunity for assortment of divergent findings due to
multiple data sources and analyses involved in research (Teddlie & Tashakkori, 2010).

1.1.3. Value of Mixed-Methods Research
Having discussed the definitions and characteristics of mixed-methods research, we now discuss
the differences between such an approach and qualitative and quantitative approaches. By
comparing relevant characteristics of qualitative and quantitative research, identifying strengths
and weaknesses of each approach, and discussing how mixed-methods research can address the
weaknesses associated with one method will help researchers justify the use of mixed-methods
research and choose a suitable design.

A good overview of the value of different research approaches is to compare them using a variables
and cases approach (Creswell & Plano Clark, 2018). Consider a researcher trying to predict
creative performance using the following set of predictors: task autonomy, managerial support,
feedback, and task complexity. In a quantitative study, the researcher could collect data using a
survey or experiment. The selected method or technique will generate numeric data through
standard data collection procedures and instruments with predetermined response categories. In
analyzing the data, the key dependent variable, namely creative performance, will be regressed on
the predictor variables. The results might show us that creative performance is influenced by one
or more of the independent variables. Although we can see how these variables predict creative
performance at the aggregate level, quantitative methods and associated analyses do not allow us
to observe the participants individually.

10 | The Third Research Approach
In a qualitative study, the researcher could look more closely into a particular case. For example,
the researcher could observe behaviors of a specific individual in an organization. The researcher
could observe employee A, who is male, has a graduate degree, has passion for his job, and so on.
The researcher could look into this employee's work environment--whether he receives sufficient
feedback and managerial support; how he responds to such feedback and support, and so on.
Document analysis could also be leveraged. The researcher could determine the level of task
complexity by analyzing the employee's tasks or job description. These data and other types of
data, which are usually text-based, could be analyzed to identify nuances related to how the four
predictors play roles in determining creative performance. Such a case-oriented approach looks at
each entity, digs deeper into each case, and subjects all cases to a comparative analysis (Creswell
& Plano Clark, 2018).

From this illustration, we can see that a variable-oriented analysis in quantitative research is ideal
for hypotheses testing, but it can be difficult when dealing with causal complexities, nuances or
subsamples, whereas a case-oriented analysis in qualitative research is ideal for finding specific,
concrete, directly observed patterns common to small sets of cases, but its findings remain
particularistic (Creswell & Plano Clark, 2018).Whereas quantitative research relies on numerical
measures, qualitative research typically views subjective descriptions of experiences as data. The
role of quantitative researchers in this study is quite different from that of qualitative researchers.
Qualitative researchers could be deeply engaged in the setting and among the participants (Ormond
et al., 2014), whereas quantitative researchers seek to remain as objective as possible (Mertler,
2016).

One caveat that is rooted in the differences in the ways quantitative researchers conduct studies is
that, although quantitative research is generally associated with confirmatory and deductive
reasoning, there are many quantitative studies that can be classified as exploratory and use
inductive reasoning. For that reason, we do not use these two characteristics to differentiate
quantitative research from qualitative research.

The summary of the characteristics, strengths, and weaknesses of each research approach from a
collection of sources (Carr, 1994; Creswell & Plano Clark, 2018; Johnson & Onwuegbuzie, 2004;
Levitt et al., 2018) is presented in Table 1-2.

Gaining an understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of each method puts a researcher in a
position to properly mix qualitative and quantitative methods (Johnson & Onwuegbuzie, 2004). A
major principle of using a mixed-methods research approach is that when researchers collect data
using different strategies, approaches, and methods, the mixture or combination will result in
complementary strengths and nonoverlapping weaknesses (Johnson & Turner, 2003). For
example, in studying knowledge management system use and job performance, Zhang (2017) used
a mixed-methods approach that included a survey among knowledge workers in an organization
and a follow-up interview in one business unit to cross-validate the findings and explain
unsupported findings. Although a survey enabled the researcher to test hypotheses, it did not allow
him to explain why some of the hypotheses were not supported. Because qualitative research is
useful for studying a limited number of cases in depth, it provided an opportunity for the researcher
to explain the relationships that were not supported in the quantitative study. If the findings are
consistent across different approaches, then the researcher can gain greater confidence in his
inferences; if the findings are inconsistent, then the researcher has greater knowledge and can
modify interpretations and conclusions accordingly (Johnson & Onwuegbuzie, 2004).

Against this backdrop, to aid in the decision to use or not to use mixed-methods research for a
given study, we discuss the specific advantages of mixed-methods research next. As we mentioned
earlier, the decision to use a mixed-methods research approach should be driven primarily by
research questions. If researchers decide to use a single method to address their research questions,
they can use Table 1-2 to determine whether any of the weaknesses associated with the selected
method are considered major concerns in their study. If so, they should consider using a
mixed-methods approach. Mixed-methods research is especially superior to a single method
approach in a few areas that we describe next.

          Researchers Can Use the Strengths of One Method to Overcome the Weaknesses of
          Another Method by Using Both Methods in the Same Study
As discussed previously, the effectiveness of mixed-methods research rests on the premise that the
weaknesses of one method can be compensated by the strengths of another method. Presumably,
each method does not share the same weaknesses or potential for bias (Jick, 1979).

                                                  Chapter 1 | 13
One combination, for example, is when quantitative data collected through a survey is combined
with qualitative data from interviews. A survey is relatively easy to administer and can reach a
larger number of respondents. However, survey questions using standardized scales and measures
could lead to unclear data because certain answer options can be interpreted differently by
respondents. These weaknesses can be minimized by conducting follow-up interviews with
respondents. Although information from an interview is subject to bias introduced by the
interaction between interviewers and participants, it allows respondents to elaborate on their
responses. Thus, an interview helps a researcher develop a rich(er) understanding. In this case, the
qualitative data from interviews help a researcher assess the credibility of the inferences obtained
from a quantitative study: e.g., survey (Venkatesh et al., 2013). Venkatesh et al. (2010) is one such
project where the initial quantitative study results were explained by interviews (qualitative study)
that were done concurrently, with the qualitative study being especially important because the
hypothesized model was not supported in the quantitative study.

          Both Quantitative and Qualitative Data Yield a More Complete Picture When They are
          Used in Combination
The underlying logic of this advantage is that neither quantitative nor qualitative methods are
sufficient in themselves to understand the phenomenon under investigation (Creswell et al., 2004).
Given mixed-methods research has the flexibility of employing a wider variety of data collection
strategies, the data collected are generally a combination of at least numerical and qualitative
(narrative) data. To analyze such types of data, researchers rely on multiple techniques (e.g., using
statistical and content analysis techniques). As a result, they yield a more complete picture, as the
data from the different methods complement each other.

In the field of health science, for example, Guetterman et al. (2017) argued that mixed-methods
data can augment a randomized clinical trial or intervention design by gathering exploratory data
before, during, and after trial. Collecting multiple types of data allows researchers to compare the
results and, if necessary, perform data transformation that lead to a complete set of findings. Once
again, we refer to Venkatesh et al. (2010), whose combination of quantitative and qualitative
studies and associated data, led to a more complete understanding of the phenomenon.

          Improves Data Accuracy and Provides Greater Confidence in Findings
The basic assumption of mixed-methods research is that the combined qualitative and quantitative
findings lead to additional insights that cannot emerge from qualitative and/or quantitative studies
and concomitant findings alone (Teddlie & Tashakkori, 2010). The integration of findings from
two different methods leads to greater insights from the data and produces a fuller understanding
of the phenomenon being studied (Levitt et al., 2018).

Vergne (2012), for example, conducted a mixed-methods study of the global arms industry from
1996 to 2007 to predict the amount of negative social evaluations received by organizations. In the
first stage of the study, the author conducted interviews with prominent industry players, such as
defense experts and industry professionals. The open-ended questions in the interviews sought to
identify the categorical structure of the arms industry. The key objective of this data collection was
to understand how industry stakeholders classify arms producers. However, the global arms
industry, which was the focus of the first study, had only a small number of integrated systems
providers. Thus, the author collected quantitative data at the firm level from several sources,
including extensive data about products, customers, contracts, performance, and corporate activity

14 | The Third Research Approach
from 1996 to 2007 from the 210 largest global weapon systems providers. With a mixed-methods
approach, the author could be more confident in the findings and specifically noted that "with a
mixed-methods approach, the justification to examine genre or country categories relies on an in-
depth knowledge of the industry rather than on the researcher's prior belief that category A matters
and category B does not matter (or matter less). Field research eases identification of sources of
cross-firm, within-category heterogeneity before quantitative data collection" (p. 1049). Complex
phenomena, such as the one in Vergne's study, require researchers to collect different types of data
from different sources and perform different appropriate analyses to fully understand multifaceted
realities. A mixed-methods research approach can facilitate such a pursuit.

          Can Be Used to Answer Research Questions that Other Methodologies Cannot
Teddlie and Tashakkori (2003, p. 15) noted that "a major advantage of mixed-methods research is
that it enables the researcher to simultaneously answer exploratory and confirmatory questions,
and therefore verify and generate theory in the same study." Many of the research projects in the
social sciences are usually intended to address two goals: (1) answer an exploratory question about
how a phenomenon under investigation occurs; and (2) demonstrate a relationship between two or
more variables. A single method approach can only address one of these goals in a single study.
However, a mixed-methods research approach enables researchers to achieve both goals in the
same study or a program of study.

One such example is Stewart et al. (2017). In this study, they used a mixed-methods approach to
explore barriers to the successful implementation of a team-based empowerment initiative within
the Veterans Health Administration. Using a longitudinal quasi-experiment design, they examined
whether higher-status physician leaders were less successful than lower-status non-physician
leaders in implementing team-based empowerment (i.e., confirmatory question). After they tested
and confirmed the hypothesis that teams with high-status leaders were less effective in
implementing team-based empowerment, they then analyzed qualitative data obtained through
interviews conducted during early months of the team-based empowerment initiative to identify
common themes for why and how leaders facilitated or obstructed implementation (exploratory
questions). In particular, they inductively developed theory about status and team leadership by
looking at team member perceptions of providers' reactions to team-based empowerment and
specific leaders implementing it. Such an inquiry could not have been conducted exclusively using
either a qualitative or quantitative method alone because only a mixed-methods approach leverages
the complementary strengths from each type of data. The quantitative data allowed the researchers
to test their hypotheses, whereas the qualitative data allowed them to examine the issues in depth
from the leaders' perspective. Studying leadership within an organization requires an appreciation
for the unique aspects of individual social settings that is best accomplished using a qualitative
method, whereas to compare behaviors of two different groups in those social settings a
quantitative method is especially suitable. The findings from both approaches provide an
understanding that cannot be obtained by either approach in isolation.

          Can Provide the Opportunity for Generating Divergent Findings
Another strength of mixed-methods research is that it allows researchers to generate divergent
findings. Convergence of empirical results from both qualitative and quantitative methods is
regarded as an indicator of their validity and strengthens the initial assumptions and theoretical
frameworks underlying the study (Erzberger & Kelle, 2003). However, divergent findings are an

                                                                                                                            Chapter 1 | 15
opportunity to re-examine the initial conceptual frameworks and theoretical assumptions
underlying the study (see Chapter 10 for details, including examples).

                                            Summary

· Mixed-methods research is where a researcher or a team of researchers combines elements of
    qualitative and quantitative research approaches in a single inquiry or program of study for the
    broad purposes of breadth and depth of understanding and corroboration.

· A major principle underlying the use of mixed-methods research is that when researchers
    collect multiple types of data using different strategies, approaches, and methods, the mixture
    or combination will result in complementary strengths and non-overlapping weaknesses.

· The characteristics of mixed-methods research are:
    o the use of both qualitative and quantitative methods;
    o methodological eclecticism;
    o paradigm pluralism;
    o focus on both exploratory and confirmatory research questions; and
    o emphasis on diversity at all levels of research enterprise.

· The value of mixed-methods research is:
    o researchers can use the strengths of one method to overcome the weaknesses of another
         method by using both methods in the same study;
    o both quantitative and qualitative data yield a more complete picture when they are used in
         combination;
    o it improves data accuracy and provides greater confidence in findings;
    o it can be used to answer research questions that is not possible with a single method; and
    o it can provide the opportunity for generating divergent findings.

                                            Exercises

1. Discuss the difference between multi-methods and mixed-methods research.
2. Identify an article in your topic your topic or field (or related field) that was a mixed-methods

    study and answer the following questions:
    a. What is (are) the research question(s) addressed in that study?
    b. What are the characteristics of the mixed-methods approach used in that study?
    c. What is the value of using a mixed-methods approach in that study?
3. Select a particular topic in your field. Identify a qualitative study in this topic and identify a
    quantitative study in this topic. What could they not accomplish? Discuss how and why a
    mixed-methods approach would help advance research on this topic (e.g., how can a mixed-
    methods approach extend the qualitative study or quantitative study).

                 PHILOSOPHICAL FOUNDATIONS OF
                      MIXED-METHODS RESEARCH

The purpose of this chapter is to review some of the most common philosophical foundations
underlying mixed-methods research. Any research, regardless of which method is used, has a
philosophical foundation, and researchers need to be familiar with the paradigmatic assumptions
they make throughout the research process (Creswell & Plano Clark, 2018). Mixed-methods
research is no different. Prior to using a mixed-methods approach, researchers need to understand
the assumptions that provide a foundation for their work. These assumptions shape the research
process and influence the research outcomes. The interested reader is referred to Kuhn (1970) for
a detailed discussion of paradigms and associated philosophies of science.

In this chapter, we discuss two different stances on mixing paradigms: an alternative paradigm
stance (i.e., pragmatism, critical realism, and transformative emancipatory) and a dialectic stance
for mixed-methods research. We then bring these elements together to evaluate the applicability
of these stances and paradigms in providing philosophical support for mixed-methods research.
This goal is achieved by providing an example of how to apply each stance and/or paradigm to
research in social sciences. Although the paradigmatic issues in mixed-methods research seem to
have generated the most discussion in the history of mixed-methods research--ranging from
paradigm wars to conceptual stances in mixed-methods research (see Johnson & Onwuegbuzie,
2004; Teddlie & Tashakkori, 2003), a discussion of the practical orientation focused on applying
the paradigmatic assumptions to research and using those assumptions to guide the research
process is limited. Thus, rather than discussing and reviewing the development and evolution of
role of paradigms, we discuss an approach to knowledge creation within the boundaries set by each
paradigm, translating the theoretical terms used to define that paradigm to real-world applications
that are compatible with one's research objective, and drawing conclusions on whether the
paradigm offers an alternative, flexible approach to mixed-methods research designs.

        2.1. Stances on Mixing Paradigms in Mixed-Methods Research

Unlike qualitative and quantitative research, one of the major characteristics of mixed-methods
research is paradigm pluralism--"the belief that a variety of paradigms may serve as the
underlying philosophy for the use of mixed methods" (Teddlie & Tashakkori, 2010, p. 9). With
this belief, researchers using a mixed-methods approach embrace the diversity of philosophical
and theoretical stances when conducting their research. Although prior studies have proposed a
variety of conceptual orientations associated with mixed-methods research, we focus on the two
most common conceptual orientations: an alternative paradigm stance (i.e., use a single paradigm
to provide a philosophical underpinning for mixed-methods research) and a dialectic stance (i.e.,
researchers think dialectically and use multiple paradigms in a single inquiry) (Greene & Hall,
2010; Teddlie & Tashakkori, 2010).

An alternative paradigm stance differs from a dialectic stance in several important respects (Greene
& Hall, 2010). First, whereas the alternative paradigm stance presents a coherent system of thought
with its own philosophical assumptions, the dialectic stance believes that assumptions from
different traditions can be respectfully and dialectically engaged in a dialog to enhance our thinking

                                                                                                                            Chapter 2 | 21
and produce new understanding of a phenomenon. Second, context and practicality (not
philosophical frameworks) are useful guides for practice in the alternative paradigm stance,
whereas more than one philosophical, theoretical, and/or mental model framework intentionally
guides the study in the dialectic stance. Third, according to the alternative paradigm stance,
meta-inferences represent actionable knowledge--"knowledge that can be acted upon" or
"knowledge that is directly actionable for improving the important practical problem being
studied" (Greene & Hall, 2010, p. 139). In contrast, according to the dialectic stance,
meta-inferences represent a respectful integration of diverse lenses on the phenomenon being
studied, and they represent insightful understanding that could not be obtained using one
framework/method alone.

2.1.1. An Alternative Paradigmatic Stance
The philosophical issues surrounding mixed-methods research have received and continue to
receive considerable attention (Creswell, 2010). A paradigm is not only a worldview, but also
"shared belief systems that influence the kinds of knowledge researchers seek and how they
interpret the evidence they collect" (Morgan, 2007, p. 50; see also Kuhn, 1970). Although an
in-depth review of these issues is beyond the scope here, some key methodological implications
are worth noting, particularly how they influence the actual practice of mixed-methods research.
We begin our discussion by focusing on four philosophical elements of a paradigm: ontology--
i.e., how we view the existence of the world and society (reality); epistemology--i.e., what we
believe about knowledge; methodology--i.e., what systematic or theoretical approaches can we
use to conduct a research study; and axiology--i.e., what role do values and ethics play in research
(Creswell, 2010; Lincoln & Guba, 2013; Mertens, 2014).

Generally speaking, quantitative research is commonly associated with the philosophical paradigm
of positivism and qualitative research is commonly associated with the philosophical paradigm of
constructivism or interpretivism (Johnson & Gray, 2010). According to positivists, reality is
separate from the individual who observes it (Lee, 1991; Weber, 2004). They believe that human
experience of the world reflects an objective, independent reality and that this reality provides a
foundation for human knowledge. To achieve a research objective, positivists often use
experiments and surveys because these methods allow them to collect numerical (sometimes even
objective) data that can be analyzed statistically. At the other end of the continuum, constructivism
focuses on relativism. According to constructivists, entities are matters of definition and
conversation; they only exist in the minds of the persons contemplating them (Lincoln & Guba,
2013). Based on this ontological assumption, the understanding or meaning of phenomena is
highly subjective, mediated by participants' subjective views and knowledge. As noted by Lincoln
and Guba (2013), "knowledge is not `discovered' but rather created; it exists only in the time/space
framework in which it is generated" (p. 40). In this form of inquiry, research is conducted by
having participants work together with the researchers as equals and by sharing and pursuing the
topic in question together.

From an alternative paradigmatic stance, mixed-methods research is commonly associated with
pragmatism (Johnson & Onwuegbuzie, 2004), critical realism (Zachariadis et al., 2013), and
transformative emancipatory (Mertens, 2007; Mertens et al., 2010). A comparison of these
different paradigms is presented in Table 2-1.

2.1.1.1. Pragmatism
Pragmatism is the most popular paradigm used in mixed-methods research. Scholars advocating
pragmatism for mixed-methods research include Biesta (2010), Howe (1988), Johnson and
Onwuegbuzie (2004), Patton (1988), Tashakkori and Teddlie (1998), and Teddlie and Tashakkori
(2003). According to pragmatism, the only way we can acquire knowledge is through "the
combination of action and reflection" (Biesta, 2010, p. 112). Specifically, knowledge is always
about the relationship between action and consequences, and objects of knowledge are not isolated
entities; the construction of knowledge takes place during the interaction between individuals and
the environment (Biesta, 2010; Biesta & Burbules, 2003). Further, according to the pragmatist
perspective, different knowledge is simply the result of different ways in which we engage with
the world. As noted by Biesta (2010), "different approaches generate different outcomes, different
connections between doing and undergoing, between actions and consequences, so that we always
need to judge our knowledge claims pragmatically, that is in relation to the processes and
procedures through which the knowledge has been generated so as not to make any assertions that
cannot be warranted on the basis of the particular methods and methodologies used." (p. 113).
Thus, pragmatism places central importance on research questions being asked rather than on the
methods and methodologies being used.
The knowledge creation process in pragmatism based on the actions-consequences relationship is
illustrated in Figure 2-1. In this process, pragmatism is a problem-solving, action-focused inquiry
(Greene & Hall, 2010). Both individuals and social responses to the environment represent
experiences from which knowledge is acquired and refined (Greene & Hall, 2010; Johnson &
Onwuegbuzie, 2004). Pragmatism accepts that there are singular and multiple realities that are
open to empirical inquiry and orients itself toward solving practical problems in the real world
(Creswell & Plano Clark, 2018; Feilzer, 2010). In other words, pragmatism allows researchers "to
be free of mental and practical constraints imposed by the `forced choice dichotomy between
postpositivism and constructivism'" (Feilzer, 2010, p. 8).

                                                                                                                            Chapter 2 | 25
               Figure 2-1. Knowledge Creation Process According to Pragmatism

To provide readers with a better understanding of pragmatism, the following are some
characteristics of pragmatism (see Feilzer, 2010; Johnson & Onwuegbuzie, 2004; Tashakkori &
Teddlie, 1998; Teddlie & Tashakkori, 2003):

· Pragmatism rejects the incompatibility thesis and supports the use of both qualitative and
    quantitative research methods in the same research study or research program (Tashakkori &
    Teddlie, 1998; Teddlie & Tashakkori, 2003). Pragmatism is anti-dualist, questioning the
    dichotomy of positivism and constructivism and calling for a convergence of qualitative and
    quantitative research approaches, suggesting that they are not different at epistemological and
    ontological levels, and they share many similarities in their approaches to inquiry (Feilzer,
    2010).

· Pragmatists see research questions as more important than methods or methodologies--i.e.,
    dictatorship of the research questions (Teddlie & Tashakkori, 2003). In some situations, a
    qualitative approach will be more appropriate. In other situations, a quantitative approach will
    be preferable. In many cases, researchers can put together insights and procedures from both
    approaches to produce a more complete understanding of the phenomenon under study
    (Johnson & Onwuegbuzie, 2004). This decision regarding a research approach should depend
    on the research questions.

· Pragmatism avoids the use of metaphysical concepts, such as truth and reality, that have caused
    endless discussion and debate (Teddlie & Tashakkori, 2003). Pragmatists thus believe in an
    "antirepresentational view of knowledge," arguing that research should "no longer aim to most
    accurately represent reality" but to be useful and to "aim at utility for us" (Feilzer, 2010, p. 8).

26 | Philosophical Foundations
· Pragmatism presents a very practical and applied research philosophy (Teddlie & Tashakkori,
    2003). Teddlie and Tashakkori (2003, p. 21) recommend researchers "study what interests and
    is of value to you, study it in the different ways that you deem appropriate and utilize the results
    in ways that can bring about positive consequences within your value system" (see also
    Tashakkori and Teddlie, 1998, p. 30). Pragmatism thus allows researchers to select the best
    methodologies as long as they help in addressing research questions (Morgan, 2007).

2.1.1.1.1. Applying Pragmatism to Mixed-Methods Research
We use a published study on knowledge management system (KMS) use (Zhang & Venkatesh,
2017) to illustrate how pragmatism can be leveraged in mixed-methods research. The objective of
that study was to identify key KMS features and build a holistic nomological network around the
use of those features. The authors addressed two research questions: (1) "what are the key KMS
features that enhance job outcomes?"; and (2) "what are the drivers and consequences of use of
the key KMS features?" (pp. 1276-1277). To identify the key drivers of the use of KMS features,
they turned to the prior literature on KMS implementations. However, prior research had not fully
considered the richness of social interactions in explaining KMS use. They argued that "to help
employees overcome knowledge barriers to learning the numerous features of large-scale and
complex systems, informal social networks that represent social interactions among employees
become a potential solution for employees to overcome barriers to use in general . . . and, more
specifically, KMS" (p. 1276). Given informal social networks (i.e., peer support networks) are
crucial in facilitating KMS use, they identified such networks as a driver of the use of the key
KMS features.

They used a sequential mixed-methods approach--specifically, a qualitative study followed by a
quantitative study--to address their research questions. They conducted a qualitative study to
identify the key KMS features and then examined the effects of these KMS features using a
quantitative study. They noted that "given that there is no strong theoretical foundation for
identifying key KMS features that facilitate job outcomes and there is a lack of research on what
these features are, a qualitative study for feature validation, followed by a quantitative study for
model validation was deemed to be appropriate" (p. 1277). The selection of this study design is
consistent with one of the pragmatism assumptions--research questions should drive method
selection.

In their qualitative study, they conducted interviews with 35 employees. In the first part of the
interview, participants were asked questions about the KMS features. In the second part, the
interviewees filled out a survey to rate the extent to which they agreed that each of the KMS
features on the list helped them fulfill work-related purposes. The questions asked in the interview
sessions were based on their literature review to focus on features that helped employees fulfill
work-related purposes. Thus, any features that were identified by the interviewees were based on
the list provided by the authors. Although these key features were based on the authors' literature
review, they argued that the qualitative study was still necessary to help them identify four key
KMS system features--i.e., post, search, comment, and rate. When conducting the qualitative
study, the researchers embraced and promoted the mixing of methods. They relied on prior
literature and used Miles and Huberman's (1994) approach to code and analyze the interview data.
This practice is consistent with a pragmatist principle--reject the forced choice between
(post)positivism and constructivism and embrace both points of view (Teddlie & Tashakkori,

                                                                                                                            Chapter 2 | 27
2003). Pragmatically, the researchers used their selected methods to attend to a specific problem
and to collect and analyze data that helps answer their research questions.

Using the results of their qualitative study, they developed the nomological network around the
use of the four key KMS features that were identified in the qualitative strand of the study. They
hypothesized that two forms of peer support: help-seeking ties and help-providing ties will have a
positive effect on KMS feature use, and in turn KMS feature use will have a positive effect on job
outcomes. They collected longitudinal data from the same organization where they conducted the
qualitative study. They used both online and paper surveys, and collected 1,441 usable responses.
They also collected network data from each business unit within the organization. Using a partial
least squares structural equation modeling technique (PLS-SEM), they found that help-seeking
and help-providing ties were positively related to use of the key KMS features, and use of the key
KMS features were positively related to two key job outcomes except that post and search were
not significantly related to job performance, whereas comment and rate were not significantly
related to job performance. They turned to the literature to seek alternative explanations for their
unsupported hypotheses. Consistent with pragmatism, the researchers established the credibility
of findings by questioning their theoretical assumptions and hypothesizing about consequences
(Hall, 2013). They also allowed mixing to occur among participants' perceptions by collecting
data from multiple sources.

Overall, this study used a mixed-methods approach by applying some of the principles from the
philosophy of pragmatism. They selected their research methods based on their appropriateness to
the situation at hand. A mix of methods, a mix of perspectives from multiple data sources, and a
mixing/integration of findings lent greater validity to their model and concomitant findings than
what they would have obtained from using either a quantitative or a qualitative approach alone.
As a result, overall, they were able to enhance and modify prior knowledge on KMS
implementations and offer practical solutions to problems associated with KMS implementations.

2.1.1.2. Critical Realism
Critical realism, based on the work of Bhaskar (1975, 1978) and others (e.g., Archer et al., 1998),
embraces various methodological approaches from different philosophical positions (Zachariadis
et al., 2013). Critical realism is highly pluralist in terms of both ontology and epistemology by
recognizing the existence of different types of objects of knowledge: e.g., material objects and
forces; social structures and practices; conceptual systems: e.g., reality, knowledge, beliefs, and
reasons (Mingers, 2014; Mingers et al., 2013). Critical realism can therefore "accept a wide range
of research methods without recognizing the primacy of any particular type or approach" (Mingers,
2014, p. 189). Because a phenomenon being investigated may well have different characteristics,
a mixed-methods approach will likely be necessary and critical realism supports this (Mingers et
al., 2013).

Unlike pragmatists who argue that "methods can be combined on the basis of their practical utility,
and that paradigmatic conflicts can be ignored" (Maxwell & Mittapalli, 2010, p. 146), critical
realists recognize assumptions and limitations of both positivism and interpretivism but maintain
a strong realist and critical core (Mingers, 2014). Ontologically, critical realism supports the idea
of a reality--i.e., intransitive object of knowledge--that exists independent of our knowledge or
perception of it. However, the generation of new knowledge is the work of humans and depends
on the specific details and processes of its production--i.e., transitive object of knowledge--that

28 | Philosophical Foundations
can be established facts, theories, models, methodologies, and methods (Zachariadis et al., 2013).
In this sense, critical realists must pay attention to both the object/problem they study and the
place/context of the study. Critical realism also accepts a variety of methodological approaches by
recognizing three forms of knowledge based on three underlying human interests--the real--i.e.,
represents a reality that may or may not be observable--the actual--i.e., a subset of the real--and
the empirical--i.e., a subclass of observable, experienced events and change (Bhaskar, 1975, 1978;
Zachariadis et al., 2013). Empirical events, which can be observed or experienced, should facilitate
the relationship between transitive and intransitive objects of knowledge.

Critical realists recognize that our access to this world is limited and always mediated by our
perceptual and theoretical lenses (Mingers et al., 2013). Critical realists allow for a degree of
epistemological relativism (Zachariadis et al., 2013, p. 857) by accepting the possibility of
alternative explanations to any phenomenon and argue that "all theories about the world are
grounded in a particular perspective and worldview, and all knowledge is partial, incomplete, and
fallible" (Maxwell & Mittapalli, 2010, p. 150). Whereas positivism focuses on the use of
quantitative methods and statistical data analysis, and constructivism generally embraces
qualitative methods and text analysis, critical realists use either type of method but adopt particular
positions on issues such as the role of values in research (Mingers, 2014).

The main scientific methodology of critical realists is called retroduction, which is essentially the
same as abduction (Mingers, 2014). With retroduction, critical realists look for underlying
generative mechanisms--"the ways of acting of a thing," "the causal powers and liabilities of
objects or relations," "capacities of behavior," and "tendencies of structures" (Volkoff & Strong,
2013, p. 821). Mingers et al. (2013) noted that the essential methodological step in critical realism
studies is "to move from descriptions of empirical events or regularities to potential causal
mechanisms, of a variety of kinds, some of which may be nonphysical and nonobservable, the
interaction of which could potentially have generated events" (p. 3). Causality in the form of a
generative mechanism is a core and defining feature of critical realism (Bhaskar, 2002). In contrast
with a general understanding of causality in social science ("A causes B"), causality as a generative
mechanism can be reformulated as "A generates B in context C." Thus, for a critical realist,
causality is "a process of how causal powers are actualized in some particular context, a process
in which the generative mechanisms of that context (C) shape (modulate, dampen, etc.) the
particular outcomes" (Walsh, 2014, p. 154). This retroductive approach allows researchers to use
a wide variety of methods where qualitative and quantitative approaches can be integrated in order
to hypothesize and identify the generative mechanisms that cause the events we experience
(Zachariadis et al., 2013). This process of knowledge creation in critical realism is illustrated in
Figure 2-2 (reproduced from Zachariadis et al., 2013).

                                                                                                                            Chapter 2 | 29
    Figure 2-2. The Retroductive Approach of Critical Realism for Knowledge Creation

In addition to the retroductive approach to knowledge creation, Maxwell and Mittapalli (2010)
identified several aspects of critical realism that are relevant to mixed-methods research:
· A process approach to causality. Critical realism views causality as "fundamentally referring

    to the actual causal mechanisms and processes that are involved in particular events and
    situations" (p. 155). To explain the actual causal mechanisms, critical realists rely on a
    retroductive approach, as discussed previously, which allows them to move between the
    knowledge of empirical phenomena, as expressed through events to the creation of
    explanations (or hypothesizing) in ways that hold ontological depth (Zachariadis et al., 2013).
· Seeing mind as part of reality. Critical realism recognizes different aspects of entities,
    including mental concepts, events, and processes. Critical realists argue that mental events and
    processes are real phenomena that can be causes of behavior, rather than simply abstractions
    from behavior or constructions of the observer (Maxwell & Mittapalli, 2010). It also supports
    the idea that individuals' social and physical contexts have a causal influence on their beliefs
    and perspectives. Thus, critical realism can provide a framework for better understanding the
    relationship between individuals' perspectives and their actual situations.
· Validity and inference quality. According to critical realism, validity is not a matter of
    procedures, but of "the relationship between the claim and the phenomena that the claim is
    about" and thus, it must be assessed in the specific context of a particular study (p. 158). This
    suggests that rather than focusing on whether correlated empirical phenomena are causally
    linked, critical realists focus on establishing whether the generative mechanism hypothesized

30 | Philosophical Foundations
    or uncovered is involved in the observed events in the field (Johnston & Smith, 2010;
    Zachariadis et al., 2013). This principle also allows researchers to identify plausible threats to
    the conclusions drawn in a given study, which depend on the context and purposes of the study
    as well as the methods used.
· Diversity as a real phenomenon. Critical realists believe that diversity is, in itself, a real
    phenomenon. Qualitative and quantitative research have tendencies, theoretical as well as
    methodological, to ignore or suppress diversity in their goal of seeking general accounts
    (Maxwell & Mittapalli, 2010). Mixed-methods research with a critical realism perspective,
    however, provides one way to help overcome this diversity limitation by requiring researchers
    to examine different levels of abstraction of a multi-layered world using different methods
    (Zachariadis et al., 2013).

2.1.1.2.1. Applying Critical Realism to Mixed-Methods Research
Our literature review suggests that the application of critical realism to mixed-methods research is
still limited. It could be due to a lack of training on this paradigm as well as an insufficient number
of practical examples on which researchers can rely. To provide a better idea of how critical
realism can be applied to mixed-methods research, we offer two different examples: one from the
information systems field (Walsh, 2014) and one from the health science field (Smirthwaite &
Swahnberg, 2016).

The first example is a published article by Walsh (2014) on a strategic path to study information
technology (IT) use through users' IT culture and IT needs perspectives. The author used a mixed-
methods approach to address the following research question: how do users' IT culture and IT
needs influence IT use? A mixed-methods approach was appropriate to address this research
question because "there has been an essential impetus in the IS research community in recent years
to unfold the features of different IT designs and to investigate their related specific properties that
influence people's perceptions and use" (p. 147). Using theories from the fields of information
systems (IS), psychology, and sociology, the author specifically adopted a critical realist stance
with an exploratory (grounded theory) mixed-methods approach.

The author investigated the use of an open-source e-learning software platform called Moodle in
a European business school, where this software was mostly used as an exchange platform for
professors and students. The author used both secondary data from the existing literature and
primary data consisting of quantitative and qualitative data. The quantitative data were collected
through surveys and were analyzed using partial least squares (PLS), a structural equation
modeling (SEM) technique. The qualitative data were collected through interviews and the
transcripts of these data were hand-coded and presented in parallel with the quantitative results.
All the data collected (i.e., data from the literature, primary data collected for the study) were
analyzed together with the secondary data. Consistent with a critical realist view, the author opted
for the relationships between concepts that appeared to best fit the whole dataset. Because
qualitative and quantitative data analyses were done simultaneously, while taking into account all
data as one set, and constantly comparing and analyzing all data as they were collected, the author
justified the models by drawing from literature and/or quotations from interviews and/or
quantitative reports. The author openly remained in an exploratory stance and iterated across all
data throughout the research process, thus letting the data speak and guide the emerging theory (p.
153). Consistent with the critical realism perspective, the author assumed that the reality is multi-
faceted and may be perceived differently by different individuals and in different contexts.

                                                                                                                            Chapter 2 | 31
Given that the author used a critical realist stance, the focus was on establishing causality. The
author integrated qualitative and quantitative data analyses to generate theoretical propositions that
emerged through iterations between the quantitative and qualitative data. The author was able to
propose new relationships among users' individual IT culture, their utilization of the e-learning
platform, and the relationship of various constructs to their perceived IT needs (global, contextual,
and situational). For example, one of the relationships that emerged from both qualitative and
quantitative data was "individual IT culture mostly has a positive influence on the individual's
global IT needs" (p. 155). To arrive at this proposition, the qualitative data from the interviews
were analyzed and then each respondent's level of IT acculturation were quantitatively assessed
using the individual's IT culture (IITC) score. Based on the results, the author concluded that a
causal relationship exists in the "substantive area and investigated context." The author noted that
"using quantitative data and methods does not forcibly confer a hypothesis-testing positivist
stance. Being clear and open about the way we conducted our mixed-method research helped us
remain true to our own paradigm/worldview--i.e., critical realism" (p. 163).

Another example of a mixed-methods study with a critical realism paradigm focused on the
(in)equity in healthcare conducted by Smirthwaite and Swahnberg (2016). They conducted two
empirical studies, a quantitative study (Smirthwaite et al., 2014) and a qualitative study
(Smirthwaite et al., 2017) in the context of cataract extraction. From a critical realist perspective,
they noted that "[it would be] more interesting to identify the mechanism(s) causing medical
gender bias than it would be to focus on how the concept of medical gender bias itself is
constructed . . . Since critical realism builds on the claim that there exist causal mechanisms that
have consequences in the real world it is better able to make sense of the physical mechanisms
endangering women's health, the shortening of women's lives when erroneous surgery is
performed on their bodies, and the social/cultural mechanisms that prevent surgeons from
performing the right operations" (p. 485). They discussed three forms of knowledge, i.e., real,
actual, and empirical domain, from the critical realist perspective--real: "the generative
mechanisms affecting waiting times for cataract extraction emerge from intersecting power
structures related to gender, ethnicity, class, and age"; actual: "care seeking behavior shaped by
intersecting gender norms, class norms, and norms related to ethnicity and age interact with the
notions, values and assumptions of health care staff concerning men and women's need for care";
and empirical: "analyses of focus group interviews show, for example, how assertive behavior
tends to be legitimized for male patients, and how men's need for cataract extraction is constructed
as being more important/urgent than women's" (p. 487). They were also interested in feminist and
gender research in the field of health and caring science. Thus, some elements of the use of a
transformative emancipatory paradigm (discussed next) were also identified in their study.

In their quantitative study, they analyzed waiting times. The data were collected from
database/register data of 102,532 patients who had cataract extraction performed in 2010-2011.
They found that the existence of longer waiting times correlated with patients having good visual
acuity and being female, as well as with being older, retired, born outside of Nordic countries,
having a low income, and lacking education at a university level. From a critical realist perspective,
they considered this study unsatisfactory because they were not able to conclude anything about
what causes these differences in waiting times from these data alone. Also from a critical realist
perspective, this study alone was unable to inform us about the primary object of science, causal
mechanisms.

32 | Philosophical Foundations
In their qualitative study, they sought to identify factors that contributed to the existence of longer
waiting times for women having cataract extraction. Two clinics (one with a larger gender gap and
one with a marginal gender gap) participated in the study. They selected two research sites with
different gender gaps in order to identify attitudes and gender constructions of relevance for
understanding why men have shorter waiting times than women do, and why there was a difference
in the gender gap between the clinics. One focus group interview was conducted at each site. The
authors noted that "if we assume that the opinions/notions/prejudices/experiences about women
and men that the doctors expressed in the focus groups reflected their ordinary opinions, and that
they were not something that we created by interviewing them, furthermore, then we--
underpinned by critical realism--could claim that we discovered rather than caused or constructed
them" (p. 489). They found that at the clinic with a larger gender difference, jokes with misogynist
and racist connotations were not considered sensitive issues. At the clinic with smaller gender
differences, however, they found that prominent persons at the clinic expressed an interest in and
were aware of gender inequality. The majority of the findings were described as causal
mechanisms that hinder equity in waiting times.

Overall, this research differentiates three forms of knowledge (real, actual, and empirical
domain)--consistent with the critical realist perspective. For example, from the real domain, the
authors hypothesized that "the generative mechanisms affecting waiting times for cataract
extraction emerge from intersection power structures related to gender, ethnicity, class, and age"
(p. 487). From the actual domain, they found that the care seeking behavior was shaped by
intersecting gender norms; class norms and norms related to ethnicity and age interacted with the
notions, values and assumptions of health care staff concerting men and women's need for care.
From the empirical domain, they demonstrated that the statistical analyses and calculations of the
mean value showed that women in general spent a longer time on the waiting list than men did;
and the analyses of the focus group interviews showed, for example, how assertive behavior tended
to be legitimized for male patients. The strength of critical realism was clearly demonstrated,
producing truth-like knowledge about reality.

2.1.1.3. Transformative Emancipatory
The transformative emancipatory paradigm reflects "explicit recognition of values and knowledge
of self and community that form a basis for methodological decisions" (Mertens et al., 2010, p.
195). This paradigm is driven by the dissatisfaction of researchers and members of marginalized
communities with the dominant research paradigms and practices because those paradigms fail to
serve the needs of those who have traditionally been excluded from positions of power in the
research world (Mertens, 2007; Mertens et al., 2010; Sweetman et al., 2010). The transformative
emancipatory paradigm's axiological assumption rests on the recognition of power differences and
ethical implications that derive from those differences in terms of discrimination, oppression, and
being made to feel marginalized (Mertens et al., 2010). The transformative emancipatory
paradigm's ontological assumption rejects cultural relativism and recognizes the influence of
privilege in determining what is accepted as "real" and the consequences of accepting one version
of reality over another (Mertens et al., 2010). In this sense, reality is socially constructed and
shaped by a variety of factors, including social, political, ethnic, and cultural lenses (Mertens et
al., 2010).

                                                                                                                            Chapter 2 | 33
The transformative emancipatory paradigm's ontological assumption leads to the epistemological
assumption that "understanding the culture and building trust are deemed to be paramount"
(Mertens, 2009, p. 57). Accordingly, knowledge is not neutral and is influenced by human
interests. Knowledge reflects the power and social relationships within society, and the purpose of
knowledge construction is to aid people to improve society (Sweetman et al., 2010). A researcher,
according to this paradigm, is someone who recognizes "inequalities and injustices in society and
strives to challenge the status quo, who is a bit of a provocateur with overtones of humility, and
who possesses a shared sense of responsibility" (Mertens, 2007, p. 212). Therefore, the
relationship between researchers and participants is a critical determinant in achieving an
understanding of valid knowledge from the perspective of the transformative emancipatory
paradigm.
In transformative emancipatory mixed-methods research, a researcher might make use of a variety
of quantitative and qualitative methods to determine the focus of research, with a specific concern
for power issues (Mertens, 2007). A transformative emancipatory mixed-methods research inquiry
has "the need for community involvement, as well as the cyclical use of data to inform decisions
for next steps, whether those steps are related to additional research or program changes" (Mertens
et al., 2010, p. 199) and the cyclical model for transformative emancipatory research is presented
in Figure 2-3. As illustrated in this Figure, community participation is needed at the beginning,
throughout, and at the end of each research study (Mertens, 2007; Mertens et al., 2010). The goal
is to have research that "serve[s] the ends of creating a more just and democratic society that
permeates the entire research process, from the problem formulation to the drawing of conclusions
and the use of results" (Mertens, 2003, p. 159), hence the need to have a cyclical and mixed-
methods research approach (Mertens, 2007).

34 | Philosophical Foundations
 Figure 2-3. Cyclical Model for Research Using a Transformative Emancipatory Paradigm

2.1.1.3.1. Applying Transformative Emancipatory Paradigm to Mixed-Methods Research
We use a study of women's social capital conducted in a regional city in Australia by Hodgkin
(2008) to illustrate the application of the transformative emancipatory paradigm in mixed-methods
research. This article demonstrates how qualitative and quantitative methods can be integrated in
feminist research. The objectives of the study were to draw attention to the lack of gender focus in
studies of social capital and to make more visible women's contributions to society. There were
two research questions driving the study: (1) do men and women have different social capital
profiles?; and (2) why do women participate more in social and community activities than in civic
activities? In order to address these research questions, the author first mapped the different
patterns of participation based on gender and then explored how the role of "mother" alters the
activities in which women become involved and the reasons for this.

The study used an explanatory sequential mixed-methods design. The purpose of mixed-methods
research in this study was complementarity--the author sought elaboration, enhancement, and
clarification from the results of one method with those of the other. In the first stage of the study,
the researcher used a survey method. This method enabled the researcher to describe, explore, and
to some extent, explain aspects of the differences between men and women on social, community,

                                                                                                                            Chapter 2 | 35
and civic participation within the sample. In the second stage of the study, the author conducted
in-depth, one-on-one interviews with 12 women who had been involved in the first stage of the
study. The goal of this second stage was to explore women's social interaction processes. The
author was interested in describing aspects of their lives, which was based on their narration of
their experiences.

The findings from the quantitative study showed a difference between men and women in social
and community participation and, to a limited extent, civic participation. Women were more
involved in social participation in group activities than men were. Although the quantitative data
gave a broad snapshot of women's and men's participation in social and community activities,
they did not tell the readers what the underlying motivation for such participation was, the
experience of this, and the feelings associated with giving up other types of activities. A closed
interaction between the author and the participants in the second stage of the study enabled the
author to understand why women became involved in such activities. The findings revealed that
the experience of motherhood, more than anything else, influenced their decision to get involved
in social and community activities.

In this study, members of the community (i.e., local residents) were involved throughout the
research process. This involvement allowed for a much richer understanding of gender and social
capital. A pattern of differences between men and women was observed at different levels of
social, community groups, and civic participation. A cyclical use of data is evident--the results
from the quantitative stage of the study pointed the researcher to gather qualitative data in order to
understand how women construct meaning around their involvement in social, civic, and
community settings.

2.1.2. Dialectic Stance
The dialectic stance in mixed-methods research involves using multiple paradigmatic traditions
and mental models, along with more than one methodology and type of method within the same
study (e.g., Greene, 2007; Greene & Caracelli, 2003). A dialectic stance aims to generate an
important understanding of a phenomenon being studied through the juxtaposition of different
lenses, perspectives, and stances (Greene, 2005). Thus, this stance provides "a meaningful
engagement with difference, an engagement intended to be fundamentally generative of insight
and understanding that are of conceptual and practical consequence" (Greene & Hall, 2010, p.
124). Two major characteristics of the dialectic stance are:

· It recognizes the legitimacy of multiple paradigmatic traditions (Greene & Hall, 2010). A
    dialectic stance represents "multiple ways of seeing and hearing" (Greene, 2007, p. 20). This
    stance embraces paradigmatic and methodological differences, and seeks to integrate them in
    a dialogic manner (Greene & Caracelli, 1997). It also emphasizes the importance of different
    people with different mental models contributing ideas to research and practice (Greene, 2007;
    Johnson, 2017). For example, one can address the same research question using two different
    methods, each rooted in a distinct paradigm. One can then make multiple inferences
    corresponding to different worldviews and compare the results.

· It involves the use of data from one approach to directly inform the other in an iterative way.
    In practice, a researcher who adopts this stance would examine the results of a particular
    method and consider how the paradigm underlying the study impacted the results. Then, the

36 | Philosophical Foundations
    researcher would analyze how the results from one method corresponded to the results from
    other methods, each with their own philosophical assumptions (Betzner, 2008).

A mixed-methods way of thinking offers opportunities to engage meaningfully with differences
that we encounter in our study context--e.g., differences in ethnicity, gender, religion, country,
culture (Greene & Hall, 2010). Because the dialectic stance invites multiple ways of seeing and
ways of knowing, a multiplicity of different perspectives is engaged, as are diversity and variation
in the substance of what is being studied (Greene & Hall, 2010).

Building on this dialectic stance, Johnson (2009) proposed a dialectical pragmatism stance as an
alternative philosophical stance for mixed-methods research. This paradigm is a combination of a
dialectic approach and pragmatism. By integrating the dialectic perspective and pragmatism,
Johnson (2009) noted that dialectical pragmatism is especially tailored to mixed-methods research.
Whereas pragmatism embraces the use of multiple methods to meaningfully generate information
to address research questions (Morgan, 2007), the dialectic stance suggests researchers using a
mixed-methods approach should carefully listen to and consider the opposing viewpoints when
developing a workable solution for a mixed-methods research study. This new mixed-methods
research perspective can, therefore, provide ways for researchers to understand and properly
integrate multiple paradigms, values, and methodologies to produce more complete knowledge
about the phenomenon under study.

                                            Summary

· Mixed-methods research is characterized by paradigm pluralism--i.e., the belief that a variety
    of paradigms may serve as the underlying philosophy for mixed-methods research.

· One of the major assumptions of pragmatism is that different actions or approaches generate
    different outcomes or consequences. Pragmatism places central importance on the research
    questions rather than on methodologies or methods.

· Critical realism recognizes assumptions and limitations of different paradigms. It embraces
    epistemological relativism by accepting the possibility of alternative explanations for any
    phenomenon. The main scientific methodology of critical realists is retroduction.

· The transformative emancipatory paradigm reflects explicit recognition of values and
    knowledge of self and community that form a basis for a methodological decision. A
    transformative emancipatory paradigm for mixed-methods research suggests the need for
    community involvement, as well as the cyclical use of data to inform decisions on what the
    next step is in the research process.

· A mixed-methods researcher can also use a dialectic stance. This stance recognizes the
    legitimacy of multiple paradigmatic traditions and involves the use of data from one approach
    to directly inform the other in an iterative way.

   NATURE OF THEORY IN MIXED-METHODS RESEARCH

Having considered paradigmatic stances in mixed-methods research in the previous chapter, in this
chapter, we focus on the role of theory in mixed-methods research. Theory is defined as "a
statement of relations among concepts within a set of boundary assumptions and constraints"
(Bacharach, 1989, p. 496). Theory allows researchers to understand and predict outcomes of
interest and also allows them to describe and explain a process and sequence of events (Colquitt
& Zapata-Phelan, 2007). According to Bacharach (1989), the goal of theory is to "organize
(parsimoniously) and to communicate (clearly)" (p. 496). Bacharach also argued "if [theory] is not
testable, no matter how profound or aesthetically pleasing it may be, it is not a theory" (p. 512).
Theory should help us organize our thoughts, generate coherent explanations, and improve our
predictions, which in turn helps us achieve a better understanding of the phenomenon of interest
(Hambrick, 2007).

Although quantitative and qualitative researchers have long histories of inquiry into the nature of
theory (e.g., Cook & Campbell, 1979; Eisenhardt & Graebner, 2007; Kerlinger & Lee, 2000;
Suddaby, 2006), this topic has received limited attention in mixed-methods research. For example,
in a handbook on mixed-methods research (Teddlie & Tashakkori, 2010), theory is only discussed
briefly in the introductory discussion about the philosophical assumptions and theoretical lenses
used in mixed-methods research. Creswell (2010) noted that "neither Tashakkori and Teddlie
(2003) nor Greene (2008)1 addressed directly the theoretical perspectives discussion that has
developed in the mixed-methods field in recent years" (p. 55). Although theory is more specific
and less general than worldviews or paradigms (Creswell & Plano Clark, 2018), we believe that a
detailed discussion about the role of theory in mixed-methods research is crucial because theory
can serve as an educational device that can raise awareness about a specific set of concepts in
research (Colquitt & Zapata-Phelan, 2007), particularly in mixed-methods research where multiple
perspectives are commonly employed to investigate the phenomenon of interest.

It is well known that the relationship between theory and research is reciprocal; theory
development relies on research and research relies on theory (Fawcett & Downs, 1986). Brown
(1979), as cited by Fawcett and Downs (1986), characterized the relationship between theory and
research as a dialectic--a transaction whereby theory determines what data are to be collected and
research findings provide challenges to accepted theory. Meleis (2007, p. 188) noted that
"completing isolated research projects that are not cumulative or that do not lead to the
development or corroboration of theories has limited usefulness." Thus, theory and scientific
research exist in a close and interactive relationship (Koh, 2013). Given the importance of theory
in research, we argue that researchers using a mixed-methods approach should understand the role
of theory in research and consciously use theory to explain, predict, and understand the meaning,
nature, and challenges associated with the phenomenon under study.

1 These two articles are considered primary references for the discussion about the philosophical and theoretical
foundations of mixed-methods research.

                                                                                                                            Chapter 3 | 41
                        3.1. Theory in Quantitative Research

Theory is a core component of both quantitative and qualitative research. Theory building or theory
development is "the degree to which an empirical article clarifies or supplements existing theory
or introduces relationships and constructs that serve as the foundation for new theory," and theory
testing is "the degree to which existing theory is applied in an empirical study as a means of
grounding a specific set of a priori hypotheses" (Colquitt & Zapata-Phelan, 2007, p 1284). One
perspective holds that qualitative research has exploratory research objectives (i.e., focus on theory
initiation and theory building) and quantitative research has confirmatory objectives (i.e., focus on
theory testing and theory modification). However, others argue that both exploratory (i.e., theory
building) and confirmatory objectives (i.e., theory testing) can be achieved using either qualitative
or qualitative research methods (e.g., Bendassolli, 2013; Colquitt & Zapata-Phelan, 2007; Dubin,
1978; Lynham, 2002).

Theory in quantitative research explains what researchers expect to find (Creswell, 2015). In this
context, theory is used to explain, predict, generalize, and inform research questions and
hypotheses tested in the study (Creswell, 2015). From a quantitative research perspective, theory
is defined in terms of the relationships between independent and dependent variables (Colquitt &
Zapata-Phelan, 2007). As noted by Kerlinger (1979), theory is "a set of interrelated constructs
(variables), definitions, and propositions that presents a systematic view of phenomenon by
specifying relations among variables, with the purpose of explaining natural phenomenon" (p. 64).
Theory is also associated with conclusions that can be drawn based on hypotheses. For example,
Honderich (1995) viewed theory as "a general statement (or hypotheses) from which particular
inferences may be deducted" and "observations can then be seen as confirming or falsifying
hypotheses" (p. 385). Thus, theory in quantitative research is primarily evaluated by its ability to
explain variance in a criterion variable of interest (Bacharach, 1989).

The process of theory building and theory testing in quantitative research is illustrated in Figure
3-1. A research objective is exploratory (i.e., theory building) if the goal of the study is to examine
patterns from data collected by the researchers. Building a theory using a quantitative approach is
typically conducted in a different fashion from how it is done in qualitative research (Colquitt &
Zapata-Phelan, 2007). The most common method of theory building in quantitative research is to
use a hypothetico-deductive approach (Dubin, 1978). In the early stage of theory development, the
goal is to create a conceptual framework of the theory (Dubin, 1978). Researchers can start with
either a pre-existing theory that is relevant to the research questions (when prior theory exists) or
preliminary review of relevant literature (when prior theory is limited or does not exist). Theory
building, by relying heavily on data and less on pre-existing theory, is possible and strongly
encouraged in quantitative research. Kaplan (1964) described this approach as "the most widely
accepted reconstruction of science" (p. 9) in which "the scientist, by a combination of careful
observation, shrewd guesses, and scientific intuition arrives at a set of postulates governing the
phenomena in which he is interested" (pp. 9-10; see also Lynham, 2002, pp. 243-244). After
establishing or building a conceptual model, researchers aim to establish the validity of the theory's
propositions. In subsequent tests, researchers can examine mediators and moderators that explain
those core relationships. Eventually, in still further tests, they can expand the theory by adding
antecedents or consequences that are not part of the original formulation. Over time, a stream of
such studies can provide input for a more comprehensive theory (Colquitt & Zapata-Phelan, 2007).
For example, goal setting theory of motivation by Locke and Latham (1990) was based on 22 years
of empirical research (Colquitt & Zapata-Phelan, 2007; Locke & Latham, 2004).

           Figure 3-1. Theory Building and Theory Testing in Quantitative Research

Conversely, a quantitative research objective is confirmatory if the goal of the study is to use data
to test hypotheses. An example of a quantitative study for theory testing is Müller-Stewens et al.
(2017) in marketing. This paper found, with a series of seven quantitative studies (i.e.,
multi-methods research), support for their key hypotheses. Specifically, they examined the effect

                                                                                                                            Chapter 3 | 43
of gamified information presentation (i.e., conveying information about a product innovation in
the form of a game) on consumer adoption of that innovation. Drawing on several theories,
including computer-mediated communication (Hoffman & Novak, 1996) and the theory of flow
(Csikszentmihalyi, 1990), they hypothesized that gamified information presentation promotes
consumer innovation adoption and that it does so through two parallel psychological processes:
(1) by increasing consumer playfulness; and (2) by enhancing the perceived vividness of
information presentation. To test these hypotheses, they conducted seven studies, including two
field experiments. The results showed that for gamified information presentation to increase
innovation adoption, information should be integrated into the game. They noted that the research
contributed to the literature on information presentation formats. It also contributed to the domain
of experiential marketing by demonstrating how playful experiences govern individual buying
behavior.

                         3.2. Theory in Qualitative Research

Theory in qualitative research is typically used as an explanation as well as a lens that informs
different phases of the research (Creswell, 2015). A process for theory building in qualitative
research has been proposed by several scholars. For example, Glaser and Strauss (1967) detailed
a comparative method for developing grounded theory; Yin (1984) described designs of case study
research; and Eisenhardt (1989) described the process of inductive theory development using case
studies. These authors have detailed their approach for developing theory using qualitative
methods. In general, this approach relies on continuous comparison of data and theory beginning
with data collection (Eisenhardt, 1989). Figure 3-2 illustrates the process of theory building and
testing in qualitative research.

As illustrated in Figure 3-2, theory building in qualitative research can either start with a priori
theory/specification of constructs or with only some reference to extant literature. A priori theory
provides researchers with a firm empirical grounding for the emergent theory (Eisenhardt, 1989).
Sarker et al. (2013) emphasized the importance of theoretical engagement in qualitative research
by suggesting that authors should adopt and integrate up-front theory into the study, despite the
possible (mis)conception that qualitative researchers should not be too theoretically
pre-determined when conducting inductively oriented qualitative research (e.g., Glaser & Strauss,
1967). Proponents of the use of a priori theory in qualitative research believe that unspecified
theoretical expectations or a lack of pre-existing theory may lead researchers to replicate existing
findings, adding little to existing theoretical knowledge, or to produce a massive amount of data
without any clarity on how these data could lead to novel insights (Andersen & Kragh, 2010). An
example of a qualitative study that uses a priori theory is Nielsen et al. (2014). Using a case study
technique, Nielsen et al. drew on institutionalization theory to propose a new conceptualization of
information technology (IT) institutionalization based on the "traveling of ideas" metaphor that
distinguishes between theorization of ideas about IT use across an organizational field and
translation of such ideas into practical use of IT within particular organizations. They used a priori
theory and identified what was lacking from the existing literature--how "field-level dynamics
and organizational processes coevolve" (p. 180).

44 | Nature of Theory
            Figure 3-2. Theory Building and Theory Testing in Qualitative Research

Nonetheless, it is also common in qualitative research to start with only some or no theory because
a priori theory is believed to bias or limit the findings (Eisenhardt, 1989; Glaser & Strauss, 1967).
Eisenhardt (1989) noted that "although early identification of the research question and possible
constructs is helpful, it is equally important to recognize that both are tentative in this type of

                                                                                                                            Chapter 3 | 45
research. No construct is guaranteed a place in the resultant theory, no matter how well it is
measured. Also, the research question may shift during the research" (p. 536). This approach
allows researchers to switch their research focus as the study advances and in turn enables them to
generate new concepts or themes from open-ended, qualitative data (Onwuegbuzie & Leech,
2005).

Although confirmatory questions are not commonly associated with qualitative research, many
researchers, particularly mixed-methods scholars (e.g., Onwuegbuzie & Leech, 2005; Patton,
1990; Tashakkori & Teddlie, 1998), suggest that qualitative research can be used for theory testing.
For example, Cometto et al. (2016) used questionnaires and follow-up confirmatory interviews to
examine the implementation of innovation projects in six different countries over a period of three
years. They used qualitative interview results to validate the findings from a quantitative study.

The consensus that both quantitative and qualitative studies can be used for either theory building
or theory testing is consistent with one of the characteristics of mixed-methods research--the
compatibility thesis (see Chapter 1 for more details). As noted by Tashakkori and Teddlie (2003),
"in practice, confirmatory qualitative research is not an impossibility . . . neither is exploratory
quantitative research. Naturalistic observation can be used to explore causal relationships . . . and
focus group might be considered a type of experiment" (p. 71). Next, we discuss the role of theory
in mixed-methods research and suggest how one can use mixed-methods research to develop and
test theory in the same study or a series of studies.

                      3.3. Theory in Mixed-Methods Research

Building and testing theory play an important role in integrating quantitative and qualitative
approaches. Philosophical perspectives of mixed-methods research, discussed in Chapter 2, should
guide the theoretical orientations used in a research study (Newman et al., 2003) because theories
and paradigms are commensurate, i.e., theory is nested within and under paradigms (Mertens et
al., 2010). Kuhn (1970) indicated that through the theories they embody, paradigms prove to be
constitutive of all normal science activities, including underlying assumptions made, problem
definitions, areas of investigation, questions posed, data interpretations, and conclusions drawn at
the end of the research process. When paradigms change, there are usually significant shifts in the
criteria used to determine the legitimacy of problems and proposed solutions because all theories,
as well as the methods generated by them, are established based on paradigms (Kuhn, 1970;
Ratcliffe, 1983). This relationship between theory and paradigms is known as the Kuhn Cycle (see
Figure 3-3). From a paradigm perspective, theory resides at the epistemological level, and it helps
inform the choice of methodology and methods (Creswell, 2010). This relationship implies that
using a mixed-methods approach should take a theoretical position that is consistent with their
paradigm.

46 | Nature of Theory
                                         Figure 3-3. The Kuhn Cycle

A pragmatic view of mixed-methods research suggests that both quantitative and qualitative
studies can have either exploratory or confirmatory research objectives and both objectives are
linked by a theory (Onwuegbuzie & Leech, 2005). Theory in mixed-methods research offers a
conceptual framework and implicit/explicit assumptions that guide researchers in achieving a
common goal and de-emphasizing differences and incompatibilities between quantitative and
qualitative methods (Chen, 2006). Thus, mixed-methods research provides opportunities for the
integration of a variety of theoretical perspectives, such as structuration theory and social network
theory, and it allows researchers to generate and test theory in the same research inquiry (Teddlie
& Tashakkori, 2006). For example, one can develop a theory using a case study approach by
creating theoretical constructs and propositions (Eisenhardt, 1989), and test the theory using
hypothetico-deductive approaches, such as surveys and experiments. Using qualitative method
before a quantitative one allows researchers to develop or extend theory, identify specific
dependent and independent variables, develop a measurement instrument, determine the adequate
level of analysis, or give more attention to process research (Molina-Azorin, 2012).

The process of conducting mixed-methods research is "an iterative, cyclical approach to research"
that includes both deductive and inductive logic in the same research inquiry (Teddlie &
Tashakkori, 2012, p. 781). This cyclical approach to research may also be conceptualized in terms
of the distinction between building theory and testing theory that involves creative insights that
may lead to the creation of new knowledge (Teddlie & Tashakkori, 2010). One way for this cycle
of research to move is from specific observations to general inferences, then from those general
inferences to tentative hypotheses (Teddlie & Tashakkori, 2010). Using this cyclical approach,
researchers may start at any point in the cycle--either from theories or abstract generalization or
from observations or other data points (Teddlie & Tashakkori, 2012).

Figure 3-4 illustrates how theories are used, informed, refined, and created using a mixed-methods
research approach. One can use mixed-methods research to test a theory--i.e., an arrow from

                                                                                                                            Chapter 3 | 47
mixed-methods research designs to the existing theory--and develop a theory--i.e., an arrow from
mixed-methods research designs to the new theory. To achieve the goal of building and testing
theory in the same research inquiry, researchers can start from an existing theory to more specific
predictions or from observations collected using mixed-methods research designs to more general
inferences. The relationship between the existing theory and the new theory suggests that the new
theory with certain properties may be influenced by the existing theory--i.e., what are other
possible answers in the current literature--and that the new theory can be used as an alternative
answer to the same phenomenon under investigation.

                   Figure 3-4. A Cyclical Approach to Mixed-Methods Research
Theory building requires an ongoing comparison of data and theory and the continuous refinement
between theory and practice. Mixed-methods research has the ability to embrace quantitative and
qualitative data and embrace multiple paradigms. New theory does not emerge immediately but
will be developed over time, as research is extended using a different method and as more data are
collected and analyzed. Only after researchers have observed similar phenomena using different
methods will confirmation or disconfirmation of the new theory begin to emerge. Through this
iterative process, mixed-methods research can holistically contribute to all phases of theory
development. Thus, using a mixed-methods approach, one can make strong contributions by
building and testing theory.
3.3.1. Evaluating Theory Using Mixed-Methods Research
Having discussed the process of building and testing theory in mixed-methods research, we now
focus on how to evaluate theory that is developed using mixed-methods research. Based on
previous work (e.g., Bacharach, 1989; Weick, 1979), we recommend five primary criteria using
which theory may be evaluated. These include (1) simplicity: i.e., ease of understanding; (2)
accuracy: i.e., conformity to the truth; (3) generalizability: i.e., extension to the other domain; (4)
falsifiability: i.e., refutation is possible; and (5) utility: i.e., usefulness of theoretical systems.
Although researchers usually have to make trade-offs among these criteria (Weick, 1979), we
argue that mixed-methods research enables researchers to combine these theory elements by using

48 | Nature of Theory
different methods to compensate for the weaknesses associated with another method. For example,
qualitative research is often accurate but potentially not generalizable and often lacking in
simplicity (Shah & Corley, 2006). On the contrary, large-sample quantitative studies might be
categorized as being simple and generalizable (Shah & Corley, 2006) but they fail to provide
richness and/or insights into the participants' personal experiences. Hence, the meaning
participants ascribe to the phenomenon studied is largely ignored (Yilmaz, 2013). In summary,
"any single method of data collection results in trade-offs in the resulting theory's simplicity,
generalizability, and accuracy" (Suls et al., 2010, p. 24).

A mixed-methods approach is one solution to build theory that is rich and testable. For example,
researchers can start with qualitative methods to build an initial theoretical framework and then
use quantitative methods to simplify the complexity of the framework and test the framework.
Such an approach will enable researchers to build theory that is accurate, simple, generalizable,
falsifiable, and useful. Next, we provide two examples of how theory is built, tested, and refined
using mixed-methods research.

3.3.2. Theory in Mixed-Methods Research Practice
We provide two exemplars from previous research to illustrate how theory is developed, tested,
and refined using mixed-methods research. The first paper, by Sarker et al. (2018), published in
Information Systems Research, used border theory as a metatheoretical framework to develop and
empirically test a model of organization-related and globally distributed software development
(GDSD)-related antecedents of work-life conflict (WLC). The second paper by Stewart et al.
(2017), published in Academy of Management Journal, explored barriers to the successful
implementation of a team-based empowerment initiative within the Veterans Health
Administration.

3.3.2.1. Sarker et al. (2018)
The research objective was "to identify the key organization-related and distributed software
development-related factors that affect the [work-life conflict] WLC of IT workers involved in
GDSD" (p. 104). The authors used a combination of the health and wellness perspective and the
talent management perspective. To achieve their research objective, they used the metatheoretical
lens of border theory (see Clark, 2000). This theory suggests that individuals often switch borders
within their "lifespace" daily--they move back and forth from their "work region" to their "family
and life region." They also drew on the general and information systems-specific literature on
work-life balance (WLB) for identifying WLB-related constructs.

They used a mixed-methods research approach--a qualitative study followed by a quantitative
study--to empirically examine the phenomenon of WLC. The purpose of using mixed-methods
research in this work was developmental--the qualitative study informed the identification of
appropriate variables and the development of hypotheses. As a part of the design, in phase 1, they
used an exploratory case study to elicit key factors to be included in their research models, noting
that "comprehensiveness of the model needed to be balanced with considerations of parsimony"
(p. 105). In phase 2, they tested the model using a survey of GDSD professionals from three
countries--the United States, the United Kingdom, and India. To justify their mixed-methods
research design, they noted that "in the absence of a significant body of knowledge on the
antecedents of WLB/WLC in the GDSD setting, it is not only appropriate but also necessary for

                                                                                                                            Chapter 3 | 49
us to incorporate elements unearthed through the exploratory case study or interviews from the
field into the model, prior to empirically testing it through a survey" (p. 105).

In the first stage of their study, they used a layered approach to develop their theoretical model.
First, they used border theory as a metatheoretical lens to identify and organize the broad categories
of variables that help explain WLC and to articulate the definitions of those categories. Second,
they drew on the general WLB/WLC literature to identify certain key constructs specified by
border theory. Third, they used interviews as part of an exploratory case study to interpretively
generate the key context-related constructs within each category specified by border theory.
Finally, they used microlevel theories to justify the proposed relationships and to develop
hypotheses related to the factors identified in the previous steps. Their qualitative data analysis
revealed a number of relevant categories (e.g., extent of physical border, extent of temporal border,
flexibility of border, permeable of border) and factors (e.g., location dispersion, time difference
with remote members, flexibility of work schedule) that played a role in determining the level of
WLC in the context of GDSD. Using border theory, in conjunction with the findings from the case
study, they identified the GDSD-specific factors affecting WLC and the effect of WLC on
important outcome variables. They developed a theoretical model and proposed hypotheses to be
tested in the second phase of the study.

In the second phase of the study, they conducted a survey of IT professionals involved in GDSD
in the United States, the United Kingdom, and India. The survey was administered by an external
organization and the sampling technique might be considered "purposive random sampling." To
measure the constructs identified in the first phase, they used established scales, whenever
possible. They used structural equation modeling to analyze their survey data. The results indicated
that most of their hypotheses were supported.

In sum, this article shows how theory is developed and tested using a mixed-methods approach.
Using border theory as a metatheoretical framework, they developed and empirically tested a
theoretical model related to the WLC of employees working in GDSD environments. They
identified key antecedents and consequences of WLC within GDSD settings and thus contributed
to the WLC literature. They also validated border theory and demonstrated how it could be adapted
and empirically tested in a different context.

3.3.2.2. Stewart et al. (2017)
Stewart et al. (2017) used a parallel mixed-methods approach, i.e., quantitative and qualitative data
were collected independently but simultaneously, to explore barriers to the successful
implementation of a team-based empowerment initiative within the Veterans Health
Administration. They sought to develop and test a theory about status and team leadership. Based
on a review of the existing literature, they first developed a hypothesis that teams with high-status
leaders, i.e., leaders who are physicians, were less effective in implementing team-based
empowerment than were teams with low-status leaders. They then tested this hypothesis using a
longitudinal quasi-experimental design by obtaining a performance outcome measure from VHA
administrative records for all providers in one of twenty-one geographical divisions for a period
spanning seven months before and thirty-seven months following the introduction of team-based
empowerment. This resulted in the collection of pre- and post-intervention data for a sample of
224 providers. They analyzed the quantitative data using discontinuous growth modeling analyses.
The results provided support for their hypothesis that teams led by higher-status physician leaders

would be less effective in implementing team-based empowerment compared to teams led by
lower-status non-physician leaders.

To further understand the process that underlies resistance from "high-status leaders", i.e.,
equivalent to the moderating effect of "team leader status", they adopted a qualitative approach.
They collected the qualitative data in parallel with the quantitative data. Semi-structured interviews
were conducted prior to the quantitative analysis. During the interviews, they focused broadly on
identifying facilitators and barriers associated with the implementation of team-based
empowerment. The qualitative data were analyzed using the procedures described by Miles and
Huberman (1994). After they identified themes and categories within themes, they looked for
patterns between categories. They identified the patterns in which high-status leaders had difficulty
embracing the new identity of an empowering leader that in turn corresponded with ineffective
delegation. This was a possible explanation for why teams with high-status leaders were less
effective in implementing team-based empowerment than were teams with low-status leaders.

Their study is an example on how mixed-methods research can be used to test and refine a theory.
They used a quantitative approach to validate and test the relationships they hypothesized in their
conceptual model. To further investigate why their hypothesized relationships were significant,
they conducted a qualitative study. Their qualitative analyses not only illustrated why some leaders
facilitate while others resist team-based empowerment, but also uncovered specific patterns of
leader behaviors. Using the findings from quantitative and qualitative approaches, they were able
to refine the theory and provide evidence of "why" and "how" team leader status influenced the
relationship between team-based empowerment and team effectiveness. For example, they noted
that "combining specific identity responses that we observed with theoretical concepts expressed
by other researchers allows for further refinement of our theoretical explanation underlying the
status-empowerment link" (p. 2280).

                                            Summary

· Theory in quantitative research is used to explain, predict, generalize, and inform research
    questions and hypotheses tested in the study, whereas theory in qualitative research is used as
    an explanation as well as a lens that informs different phases of the research process.

· Although there is a view that qualitative research focuses typically on exploratory research
    objectives and quantitative research focuses on confirmatory objectives, both research
    objectives (theory building and theory testing) can be achieved using either quantitative or
    qualitative research methods.

· Mixed-methods research provides opportunities for the integration of a variety of theoretical
    perspectives and enables researchers to build and test theory in the same research inquiry.

· Theory building and testing in mixed-methods research is considered "an iterative, cyclical
    approach to research" (Teddlie & Tashakkori, 2012, p. 781) that includes both deductive and
    inductive logic in the same research inquiry.

· Theory in mixed-methods research can be evaluated using five primary criteria: simplicity,
    accuracy, generalizability, falsifiability, and utility.

             DESIGNING MIXED-METHODS RESEARCH

In the second section of the book, we focus on how to conduct mixed-methods research. This
section consists of five chapters. In Chapter 4. Appropriateness of Using a Mixed-Methods
Research Approach, we focus on the importance of research questions and purposes of
mixed-methods research. In Chapter 5. Basic Strategies for Mixed-Methods Research, we discuss
six aspects of mixed-methods design: design investigation strategies, strands of the study, mixing
strategies, time orientation, priority of methodological approach, and sampling design strategies.
We also discuss the relationships between mixed-methods purposes and mixed-methods design.
In Chapter 6. Mixed-Methods Data Collection Strategies, we focus on mixed-methods data
collection strategies, including mixed-methods sampling strategies. In Chapter 7. Qualitative and
Quantitative Data Analysis Strategies, we discuss qualitative and quantitative data analysis
strategies as well as potential threats to validity in qualitative and quantitative research. In Chapter
8. Mixed-Methods Data Analysis Strategies, we discuss various data analysis strategies for
mixed-methods research as well as the quality criteria in mixed-methods research.

                    APPROPRIATENESS OF USING A
             MIXED-METHODS RESEARCH APPROACH

From the discussion of worldviews and theory in mixed-methods research in the previous chapters,
it should be apparent that mixed-methods research encourages diversity in all aspects of the
research enterprise. This perspective embraces the compatibility thesis that focuses on research
questions for conducting mixed-methods research. Researchers are free to combine different
methodologies that are most appropriate to address their research questions (Teddlie & Tashakkori,
2009). In other words, the choice of methodology depends on the capability and complementarity
of different methods to generate different kinds of knowledge and value (Zachariadis et al., 2013).

When determining whether mixed-methods research suits a particular set of research objectives,
the researcher needs to make a set of decisions associated with research questions and the purpose
of mixed-methods research (Venkatesh et al., 2013, 2016). These two elements, together with
theoretical perspectives and paradigms, make up the foundation of design decisions that
researchers need to make (Venkatesh et al., 2016). Research questions are shaped by the purpose
of a study and in turn form the methods and design of the investigation (Tashakkori & Creswell,
2007). Obviously, when researchers examine mixed-methods research questions with
interconnected qualitative and quantitative research approaches, the end product of the study will
also include outcomes from both approaches (Tashakkori & Creswell, 2007). Given the
importance of both research questions and purposes for determining the appropriateness of
mixed-methods research, we discuss different types of research questions and purposes of
mixed-methods research that can be used as a foundation for the design and conduct of pursue
mixed-methods research.

                                 4.1. Research Questions

Research questions are important in mixed-methods research because researchers often make use
of the paradigm of pragmatism in which research questions drive the methods used in a study
(Onwuegbuzie & Leech, 2006; Tashakkori & Teddlie, 1998). Research questions in mixed-
methods research not only determine the type of research design, but also the sampling design and
data collection and analysis techniques (Onwuegbuzie & Leech, 2006). Research using a mixed-
methods approach should demonstrate the need for such an approach to answer research questions
that clearly include the interconnected qualitative and quantitative components in the study
(Tashakkori & Creswell, 2007). Agee (2009) suggested that good research questions do not
necessarily produce good research, but poorly constructed questions will likely create problems
that affect all subsequent stages of a study. Good research questions form the basis for good
research because they allow researchers to identify what they want to know by creating a research
boundary and focusing on finding answers in a coherent way (Kinmond, 2012).

In mixed-methods research, researchers typically must develop at least one qualitative research
question and one quantitative research question. A qualitative research question is generally
"open-ended, evolving, and non-directional" (Onwuegbuzie & Leech, 2006, p. 482), and it
involves asking the kinds of questions that focus on the why and how of human interactions (Agee,
2009). As an open-ended and evolving question, a qualitative question can change during the

                                                                                                                            Chapter 4 | 57
process of research to reflect an evolving understanding of the problem (Creswell & Plano Clark,
2018). To develop qualitative research questions, Agee (2009) suggested that researchers adopt an
iterative approach to questioning--i.e., researchers start with a broad question and then narrow
down this question into several sub-questions that can be used during data collection. In the first
iteration, a research question is generally tentative and exploratory to give researchers a tool for
articulating the primary focus of the study. This question should be an overarching question to
allow researchers to capture the basic goals of the study in one or two major questions (Creswell
& Creswell, 2018).

Unlike a qualitative research question, a quantitative research question focuses on the relationships
among variables (Creswell & Creswell, 2018). Most quantitative research questions are descriptive
(e.g., what is the perception of task complexity among managers?), comparative (e.g., what is the
difference in skill acquisition processes between men and women?), or associative (e.g., what is
the relationship between autonomy and job satisfaction?) (Onwuegbuzie & Leech, 2006;
Venkatesh et al., 2016). Quantitative research questions can be written in the form of questions
and/or hypotheses (Creswell & Creswell, 2018). Although the most common way of writing a
quantitative research question relies on a theory, i.e., research questions logically follow the
relationships among variables in the theory, we argue that quantitative research questions can also
emerge from identifying a gap in the literature in which a priori theory may be insufficient to
explain the phenomenon of interest. This method of identifying a research question can be found
in exploratory quantitative research. Specifically, researchers create their research questions based
on a conceptual framework (i.e., researchers' understanding of how a research problem will be
best explored, the specific direction the study will have to take, and the relationship among
different variables in the study) (Grant & Osanloo, 2014). This is best summarized by Miles et al.
(2020) who defined a conceptual framework as consisting of the key factors, constructs or
variables, and relationships among them.

A mixed-methods research question is somewhat different from qualitative and quantitative
research questions. Onwuegbuzie and Leech (2006) defined mixed-methods research questions as
those "that embed both a quantitative research question and a qualitative research question within
the same question" (p. 483). Mixed-methods research questions also necessitate that both
qualitative and quantitative data be collected and analyzed either concurrently, sequentially, or
iteratively before the question is addressed (Onwuegbuzie & Leech, 2006). Creswell and Creswell
(2018) indicated that a strong mixed-methods research study should have a mixed-methods
research question in addition to qualitative and quantitative research questions.

According to Plano Clark and Badiee (2010), when researchers write research questions in their
mixed-methods study, they should consider four dimensions to describe their research questions
(see Table 4-1). The first dimension is the rhetorical style--question format. One can state a
research question using three different formats: (1) question; (2) aim or objective statement; or (3)
hypothesis. The second dimension is rhetorical style--level of integration. Based on the level of
integration, research questions can be presented in three different ways: (1) one can independently
write qualitative and quantitative questions; (2) one can write separate qualitative and quantitative
research questions and supplement them with a mixed-methods research question that focuses on
the nature of integration; or (3) one can write an overarching mixed-methods research question
that can be broken down into separate quantitative and qualitative sub-questions (Tashakkori &
Creswell, 2007; Venkatesh et al., 2016). The third dimension is the relationship between one

58 | Appropriateness
research question and another. According to Plano Clark and Badiee (2010), if researchers have
multiple research questions in a study, the research questions may be independent of each other
(e.g., the qualitative research question is "how are social networks used for business activity?" and
the quantitative research question is "does position in the social network impact job satisfaction?")
or dependent on each other (e.g., the qualitative research question is "how do employees come up
with creative ideas?" and the quantitative research question asks "is there a positive relationship
between factors that determine creativity and job performance?"). The last dimension focuses on
the relationship between the questions and the research process. This relationship may be either
pre-determined or emergent. Research questions are pre-determined when a theory or prior
literature is used to guide the research questions, whereas research questions are emergent when
they evolve throughout the phases of the research process. A summary of the elements of research
questions including their examples is presented in Table 4-1.

Rhetorical style-- Question       Kim et al. (2014) used mixed-methods research to

question format                   address the following research questions: (1) "How

                                  their classroom?"; (2) "What are the students'

                                  perceptions of the value of the flipped classroom?";

                                  and (3) "What are suggestions for the design of the

                                          Using a mixed-methods research approach, Wisler
                                          (2018) examined the moral philosophy difference
                                          between the ethical decision-making process of

                                          units (SBUs) of luxury goods organizations. The
                                          overarching research question was "to what extent,
                                          if any, does a difference exist in ethical decision-

                                          467). Some of the specific research questions asked
                                          were "Does a difference exist in economic egoism

                                          In the illustrative study reported in Venkatesh et al.
                                          (2016), the quantitative research question depended
                                          on the results of the qualitative research question.

                                   The relationships among these research questions
                                   are independent because each of the questions
                                   focuses on a different aspect of the same research
                                   inquiry and thus each question can be answered
                                   concurrently.
                                   In the illustrative study reported in Venkatesh et al.
                                   (2016), the relationship between the research
                                   questions and the research process is pre-
                                   determined--the research questions are based on the
                                   authors' understanding of the literature.
                                   Sonenshein et al. (2014) used a mixed-methods
                                   design to examine the role of self-evaluations in
                                   influencing support for environmental issues. They
                                   proposed an emergent research question: "How do

                                   their self-evaluations?" (p. 9). After unpacking issue

                                   grounded theory, they conducted a quantitative
                                   study using an observational method to answer the
                                   second research question: "How do patterns of self-

                                   behaviors?" (p. 9).

                     4.2. Purposes of Mixed-Methods Research

The major purpose for conducting research is to answer research questions (Newman et al., 2003).
However, research questions do not provide the reason for addressing them. Only when a research
study has a purpose is there a reason for conducting the study. Newman et al. (2003, p. 173) noted
that "the purpose is not the question. Purpose is not design. Purpose is not methodology. Purpose
is not data collection or analysis. Purpose is not categories of research questions. . . Purpose is
focus on the reasons why the researcher is undertaking the study. And purpose should not be kept
disconnected from the research question and the methods." Given such a definition, purposes of
mixed-methods research should provide the rationale for conducting mixed-methods research
(Greene et al., 1989).

There are seven possible purposes of mixed-methods research: (1) compensation; (2)
corroboration;1 (3) diversity; (4) developmental; (5) complementarity; (6) completeness; and (7)
expansion (Greene et al., 1989; Tashakkori & Teddlie, 2008; Venkatesh et al., 2013, 2016).
Although each purpose is important and valuable in its own right, we have listed them in what we

1 The literature uses the terms corroboration and confirmation interchangeably. In this book, we only use
corroboration, as the term confirmation is used in a different context (expectation-confirmation theory).

                                   Chapter 4 | 61
view to be an increasing order of value from the perspective of research endeavors. For instance,
although compensation is useful, its added value is methodological in nature, whereas, at the other
end, expansion can provide richness in the form of an intervention. The summary of these purposes
is presented in Table 4-2. The quality of a mixed-methods study is directly associated with the
purpose of mixed-methods research--whether the purpose is accomplished by the end of the study
(Teddlie & Tashakkori, 2009). Mixed-methods research can serve multiple purposes and thus can
provide implications to various audiences (Newman et al., 2003). An explicit recognition of these
purposes by mixed-methods researchers may also help readers to understand the goals and
outcomes of a mixed-methods research article (Venkatesh et al., 2013). Thus, the explication of
the purposes for conducting mixed-methods research is considered mandatory in mixed-methods
research practice (Venkatesh et al., 2013). Next, we discuss each purpose, drawn from Venkatesh
et al. (2013), in more detail.

                      other method, where development is broadly construed to include
                      sampling and implementation, as well as measurement decisions" (Greene
                      et al., 1989, p. 259).
                      Different methods are used to assess different facets of a phenomenon,
                      yielding an enriched, elaborated understanding of that phenomenon
                      (Greene et al., 1989).
                      Used to provide a holistic view of the phenomenon that cannot be achieved
                      by one approach only because the full picture is more meaningful than the
                      findings from either a qualitative or quantitative method alone (Teddlie &
                      Tashakkori, 2009).
                      Used to extend the breadth and range of the phenomenon by using
                      different methods for different components of the phenomenon (Greene et
                      al., 1989).

4.2.1. Compensation Purpose
The goal of mixed-methods research with a compensation purpose is to offset the weaknesses of
one type of method by using the other type of method (Tashakkori & Teddlie, 2008; Venkatesh et
al., 2013). For example, if researchers encounter errors in one type of data, such errors can be
reduced by using another method (Tashakkori & Teddlie, 2008). Unlike the corroboration purpose,
which we discuss next, the compensation purpose does not require qualitative and quantitative
methods be implemented equally (Greene et al., 1989). Instead, when the purpose of the study is
compensation, one is likely to use a sequential mixed-methods approach in which the second strand
of the study is conducted after the findings from the previous strand of the study are known, and

62 | Appropriateness
the second study is explicitly used due to the weaknesses associated with the method used or data
collected in the first study.
To illustrate a mixed-methods research study with a compensation purpose, we use the study
reported in Wisler (2018). The goal of the study was to focus on leaders' ethical decision-making
process within the luxury goods industry. The research purpose was to determine if there was a
difference between two leaders (CEOs) types: CEOs leading U.S. strategic business units (SBUs)
and CEOs leading non-U.S. SBUs of luxury goods organizations in ethical decision-making
processes. Factors associated with the decision-making processes include economic egotism,
reputation egoism, rule utilitarianism, act utilitarianism, virtue of self, virtue of others, act
deontology, and rule deontology. The author used an online survey to collect the quantitative data
followed by a series of phenomenological interviews with key survey participants. The relationship
between the qualitative study and quantitative study is shown in Figure 4-1. The author
acknowledged that there was a challenge in gathering a large sample size to satisfy the minimum
number of participants required for the quantitative phase of the study. To compensate for this
small sample size, the author gathered qualitative data. The qualitative data not only compensated
for the small sample size in the quantitative study, but also enabled the researcher to gain an in-
depth understanding of the problem. By comparing the results from both methods, the researcher
was more confident in generating valid inferences.

               Figure 4-1. Mixed-Methods Research with a Compensation Purpose
4.2.2. Corroboration Purpose
A mixed-methods study with a corroboration purpose aims to assess the credibility of inferences
obtained from one approach of the study using another approach of the study (Tashakkori &
Teddlie, 2008; Venkatesh et al., 2013). To achieve this purpose, it is important for researchers to
counteract or maximize the heterogeneity of irrelevant sources of variance attributable to different
types of bias, such as method bias, inquirer bias, and theory bias (Greene et al., 1989). A
corroboration purpose differs from a complementarity purpose, which we discuss in section 4.2.5,
in that the logic of the corroboration purpose requires different methods to assess the same
conceptual phenomenon (Greene et al., 1989). In a classic sense, a corroboration purpose seeks

                                                                                                                            Chapter 4 | 63
convergence, triangulation, and correspondence of findings across different methods (Caracelli &
Greene, 1993; Greene et al., 1989). A mixed-methods study with a corroboration purpose usually
consists of both exploratory and explanatory/confirmatory questions (Tashakkori & Teddlie,
2008).
The idea of a corroboration purpose can be traced back to the idea of triangulation proposed by
Campbell and Fiske (1959) in which more than one method is used in the validation process to
ensure that the explained variance in quantitative analysis is the result of the underlying
phenomenon and not the method (Johnson et al., 2007; Teddlie & Tashakkori, 2003). Although
the use of multiple qualitative or quantitative approaches is considered triangulation by Campbell
and Fiske, their type of triangulation has limited value here because essentially only one paradigm
is used in the study and any inherent weaknesses associated with that single paradigm and
concomitant methods cannot be addressed by using multiple approaches within the same
methodological paradigm (Johnson et al., 2007). The idea of corroboration in mixed-methods
research is intended to address this methodological limitation of one type of method by
intentionally using both quantitative and qualitative approaches to study a phenomenon and be
implemented independently and concurrently to preserve their counteracting biases (Greene et al.,
1989). Thus, a concurrent mixed-methods design is well suited for a study with this purpose.
To illustrate, we use the study reported in Brickson (2005). The author used a mixed-methods
approach to understand the relationship between organizational identity and how organizations
relate to their stakeholders. The author introduced a new construct called "identity orientation."
To assess the construct's viability, explore its properties, and analyze its predictors at multiple
levels of analysis, the author collected data using both qualitative and quantitative methods in a
field study. The qualitative measures were implicit (e.g., the author used the Troubling-event
question, resting on the assumption that organizational identities determine what aspects of issues
are threatening) and elicited general perceptions of the organization's identity, whereas the
quantitative measures explicitly assessed identity orientation. The relationship between the
qualitative study and quantitative study is shown in Figure 4-2. By using both methods in the same
study, the author was able to triangulate the findings and identify properties and predictors of
organizational identity orientation.

4.2.3. Diversity Purpose
A mixed-methods study with a diversity purpose serves to obtain divergent views of the same
phenomenon (Venkatesh et al., 2013). A study with this purpose is used to find "new and better
explanations for the phenomena under investigation" (Erzberger & Kelle, 2003, p. 475). The
divergent findings will ideally be compared and contrasted to generate stronger (or better)
inferences, and the balance in results can be achieved when differences between the qualitative
and quantitative findings are properly reconciled (Tashakkori & Teddlie, 2008). Pluye et al. (2009)
suggested four strategies that can be used to take into account divergence in mixed-methods
research: reconciliation, initiation, bracketing, and exclusion. Reconciliation may occur when the
divergent results can be interpreted in a sense-making plausible manner, which may lead
researchers to reanalyze existing data. This strategy may also lead to a new perspective or a new
framework but does not lead researchers to ask a new research question. Initiation takes place
when new frameworks or perspectives that emerge from conflicting results lead to two additional
steps: (1) asking new research questions; and (2) collecting and analyzing new data to further
examine the new perspective or framework (Caracelli & Greene, 1993). Bracketing is appropriate
when qualitative and quantitative findings are irreconcilable and suggest extreme results (e.g.,
best-case versus worst-case scenarios). Lastly, exclusion may occur when (1) qualitative inferences
contradict quantitative inferences; (2) the results of mixed-methods research are incomplete; and
(3) one type of data or results lacks validity.

                                                                                                                            Chapter 4 | 65
One can use either a sequential or a concurrent mixed-methods research design when diversity is
the purpose. This decision depends on the research questions being addressed. If the time order is
considered a critical variable (e.g., how does trust influence brand loyalty among different groups
of customers in different stages of product lifecycle?), researchers should use a sequential
mixed-methods design. In contrast, if researchers are interested in investigating differences among
populations in the same period of time, they can use a concurrent mixed-methods design.
To illustrate mixed-methods research with a diversity purpose, we use the study reported in Chang
(2006). This study compared information systems (IS) integration in high-tech organizations from
the technology and general management perspectives. Specifically, the author compared the IT
and management perceptions of the enterprise resource planning (ERP) system scope, importance,
benefits, and implementation success factors. The author gathered both qualitative and quantitative
data using interviews from multiple case studies and a survey, respectively. The relationship
between the qualitative study and quantitative study is shown in Figure 4-3. The interview results
from the case studies were used to develop a questionnaire to compare IT and general management
perceptions. In the qualitative phase of the study, there was some evidence of divergence in views
between IT and general management. However, in the quantitative phase of the study, where the
author focused more narrowly on specific aspects of IS functionality, implementation and benefits
showed very similar perceptions by IT and general management staff, with only a small degree of
inconsistency between these two groups. For example, IT management's overall assessments of
business functions were more strongly correlated with their overall level of implementation and
they tended to rate system benefits and system reliability more highly than that of general
management. Taken together, the mixed-methods research results allowed the researcher to obtain
divergent views of the same phenomenon by comparing perceptions across different types of
participants.

4.2.4. Developmental Purpose
In a mixed-methods study with a developmental purpose, the results from one method are used to
help develop or inform the design and development of the subsequent study using the other type
of method, where development is broadly construed to include sampling designs as well as
measurement decisions (Greene et al., 1989; Tashakkori & Teddlie, 2008). The goal of a
mixed-methods study with a developmental purpose is to increase the validity of constructs and
inquiries by combining both qualitative and quantitative methods so that researchers can
compensate the weaknesses of one method with the strengths of another method (Greene et al.,
1989; Venkatesh et al., 2013).2 All studies with a developmental purpose involve the sequential
use of qualitative and quantitative methods, where the first method/study (could be a qualitative
or quantitative method) is used to help inform the design and development of the second
method/study (Greene et al., 1989).

2 Here, compensation refers to more than just addressing methodological weaknesses.

                                                                                     Chapter 4 | 67
To illustrate a mixed-methods research with a developmental purpose, we use the study reported
in Koh et al. (2004). In this study, they addressed two research questions: (1) what are the critical
customer-supplier obligations in an IT outsourcing relationship?; and (2) what is the impact of
fulfilling these obligations on success? They used a qualitative study to develop and identify the
critical customer-supplier obligations in an IT outsourcing relationship and then used a quantitative
study to test the impact of these obligations on success. The relationship between qualitative and
quantitative studies is shown in Figure 4-4. In the qualitative part of the study, they conducted
in-depth interviews. The results of content analysis of the interview transcripts showed that both
customers and suppliers identified six obligations that are critical to success. In the quantitative
part of the study, they tested their hypotheses using a survey of 370 managers. In this example,
qualitative data were used to develop the focal constructs and quantitative data were used to
empirically test the effects of these focal constructs on the dependent variable. Researchers have
also been inspired by the developmental purpose to generate more complete, cohesive and accurate
set of predictors that complement literature reviews, even though the purpose (developmental) has
not been stated as such--for examples, see Venkatesh et al. (2023) and Zhang and Venkatesh
(2017).

              Figure 4-4. Mixed-Methods Research with a Developmental Purpose

4.2.5. Complementarity Purpose
Mixed-methods research with a complementarity purpose seeks elaboration, enhancement,
illustration, and clarification of the findings from one method with the results from the other
method (Collins et al., 2006), especially by focusing on related by distinct aspects of the same
phenomenon or relationship (Greene, 2008). When the purpose in a mixed-methods study is
complementarity, qualitative and quantitative methods are used to measure "overlapping but also
different facets of a phenomenon, yielding an enriched, elaborated understanding of that
phenomenon" (Greene et al., 1989, p. 258). Thus, research questions for the qualitative and
quantitative components of a mixed-methods study with complementarity as the purpose should
address related aspects of the same phenomenon (Tashakkori & Teddlie, 2008; Venkatesh et al.,
2013). Because the qualitative and quantitative methods are used to determine the degree to which
each method yields complementary results regarding the same phenomenon, complementarity is
generally pursued using a concurrent mixed-methods design--i.e., qualitative and quantitative

68 | Appropriateness
studies are conducted simultaneously (Teddlie & Tashakkori, 2009). However, a sequential mixed-
methods design--i.e., qualitative and quantitative studies are conducted one after another--is also
possible (e.g., Tiwana & Bush, 2007).
To illustrate mixed-methods research with a complementarity purpose, we use the study reported
in Sonenshein et al. (2014). The goal of their study was to understand the role of self-evaluations
in explaining the support for environmental issues. The relationship between the qualitative study
and quantitative study is shown in Figure 4-5. They started with a qualitative study followed by a
quantitative, observational study. The goal of the qualitative study (study 1) was to develop theory
about how environmental issue supporters evaluated themselves in a mixed fashion, positively
around having assets (self-assets) and negatively around questioning their performance (self-
doubts). They explained how these ongoing self-evaluations (labeled, situated self-work) were
shaped by cognitive, relational, and organizational challenges individuals interpreted about an
issue from a variety of life domains (work, home, or school). In the quantitative study (study 2),
they derived three main profiles of environmental issue supporters (i.e., self-affirmers, self-critics,
and self-equivocators) and showed how these profiles related to real issue-supportive behaviors.
A mixed-methods approach allowed them to investigate two different but complementary aspects
of the same phenomenon--examine how social issue supporters' everyday experiences influenced
their self-evaluations (study 1) and why these self-evaluations mattered through their ability to
predict issue-related actions (study 2).

             Figure 4-5. Mixed-Methods Research with a Complementarity Purpose
4.2.6. Completeness Purpose
The notion of completeness has been discussed by researchers using both qualitative and
quantitative approaches (Teddlie & Tashakkori, 2009). For example, Tobin and Begley (2004)
suggested that "completeness is important to qualitative inquiries, as it allows for recognition of
multiple realities" (p. 393). Completeness is viewed as "a process whereby different theoretical
and substantive components come together to ensure that all aspects of the phenomenon being
researched are examined" (Twinn, 2003, p. 546). In this case, a mixed-methods approach is not
used to confirm existing data but to make sure a complete picture of the phenomenon is obtained
(Tashakkori & Teddlie, 2008; Teddlie & Tashakkori, 2003). A study with a completeness purpose

                                                                                                                            Chapter 4 | 69
provides a holistic view of the phenomenon that cannot be achieved by one approach only, and the
picture is more meaningful than the findings from either a qualitative or quantitative method alone
(Teddlie & Tashakkori, 2009). Given the goal of mixed-methods research is to use different
theoretical views to study all aspects of a phenomenon, a study with a completeness purpose is
generally conducted using a concurrent mixed-methods approach. Conducting both qualitative and
quantitative studies simultaneously enables researchers to discover different aspects of the same
phenomenon and integrate these aspects to gain a complete picture. Researchers can think of this
process using a metaphor of putting a puzzle together--solving the puzzle is best achieved when
different pieces of the puzzle are presented at the same time.
To illustrate mixed-methods research with a completeness purpose, we use the study reported in
Stewart et al. (2017). As discussed in Chapter 3, the goal of their study was to explore barriers to
the successful implementation of a team-based empowerment initiative within the Veterans Health
Administration (VHA). They used a concurrent mixed-methods approach to explore the paradox
of why leaders resist the implementation of team-based empowerment although such
implementation holds promise for improving both personal and organizational outcomes. The
relationship between the qualitative and quantitative studies is shown in Figure 4-6. Quantitative
and qualitative data were collected independently but simultaneously in the VHA setting during
the period or transition. In the quantitative study, they analyzed longitudinal data to test the
hypothesis that teams with high-status leaders (i.e., physicians) were less effective in implementing
team-based empowerment than were teams with lower-status leaders (e.g., nursing practitioner,
physician assistants). However, this quantitative study alone did not allow them to explain the
processes that underlie the moderating effect of team leader status (i.e., high-status vs. low status).
They complemented the quantitative data with the qualitative data. They used interviews to gather
qualitative data. The goal of their qualitative study was to develop theory related to the processes
of why high-status leaders resist the implementation of team-based empowerment.

4.2.7. Expansion Purpose
A mixed-methods study with an expansion purpose seeks to extend the breadth and range of the
phenomenon by using different methods for different components of the phenomenon. The goal
of a mixed-methods study with an expansion purpose is to enrich the understanding obtained in a
previous strand of the study with the findings obtained in the next strand of the study (Teddlie &
Tashakkori, 2009; Venkatesh et al., 2013). For example, in an evaluation study, quantitative
methods frequently play a leading role in assessing program outcomes, whereas qualitative
methods are used to assess program processes (Caracelli & Greene, 1993; Greene et al., 1989).
One is likely to use a sequential mixed-methods design in a study with an expansion purpose
because the qualitative study will expand on the initial findings resulting from the quantitative
study or vice versa (Teddlie & Tashakkori, 2009).

To illustrate mixed-methods research with an expansion purpose, we use the study reported in
Battilana et al. (2015). In this study, they examined the factors that influence social performance
of hybrid organizations that pursue a social mission and sustain their operations through
commercial activities by studying work integration social enterprises (WISEs). They predicted that
both social imprinting, i.e., a founding team's early emphasis on accomplishing the organization's
social mission, and economic productivity were important drivers of a WISE's social performance.
However, there was a paradox inherent in the social imprinting of WISEs. Although it directly
enhanced a WISE's social performance, it also indirectly weakened social performance by
negatively influencing economic productivity. To test their predictions regarding the paradoxical
nature of the relationship between social imprinting and social performance in WISEs, they used
data from surveys administered annually between 2003 and 2007 to a large panel of WISEs
operating in France.

                                                                                                                            Chapter 4 | 71
In the second stage of the study, they explored a different aspect of the same phenomenon. Whereas
the first study focused on testing the paradoxical relationship between social imprinting and social
performance, the second study focused on exploring how socially imprinted WISEs might be able
to resolve the paradox tested in the first study. The relationship between the qualitative study and
quantitative study is shown in Figure 4-7. In the second study, they conducted an in-depth
longitudinal qualitative comparative case study of two WISEs: one that successfully attenuated
this relationship and one that was unsuccessful in addressing the paradox. The qualitative data
were from thirty-five interviews and a wide range of archival materials for each case. The results
suggested that a structural differentiation approach that assigns responsibility for social and
commercial activities to distinct groups may allow hybrid organizations to mitigate the negative
effect.

                Figure 4-7. Mixed-Methods Research with an Expansion Purpose
4.2.8. Summary
Researchers should clearly specify and/or acknowledge the rationale or justification for using a
mixed-methods approach (Newman et al., 2003; Teddlie & Tashakkori, 2009). Although the seven
purposes of mixed-methods research we discussed here are not exhaustive, they can be used as a
conceptual tool to systematically identify the most appropriate research design (Greene et al.,
1989). Identifying the research purpose also helps researchers refine their research question(s)--
e.g., if the research purpose is developmental, then the quantitative research question should be
conditional on the qualitative research question or vice versa (Onwuegbuzie & Leech, 2006).
Examining research questions from the perspective of the mixed-methods purpose may clarify the
need for using mixed-methods research. Thus, explicitly identifying the purpose(s) of a mixed-

72 | Appropriateness
methods research study will improve the likelihood of doing research that has greater meaning and
is more likely to lead to valuable implications (Newman et al., 2003).

                                            Summary

· Research questions and purposes of mixed-methods research, together with theoretical
    perspectives and paradigms, make up the foundation of design decisions that researchers need
    to make in the course of their mixed-methods studies.

· Mixed-methods research questions include a quantitative research question, a qualitative
    research question, and sometimes a mixed-methods research question.

· Four dimensions of mixed-methods research questions are: (1) rhetorical style--question
    format; (2) rhetorical style--level of integration; (3) relationships among research questions;
    and (4) relationships between research questions and the research process.

· Purposes of mixed-methods research should provide the rationale for conducting mixed-
    methods research. Seven possible purposes are: (1) compensation; (2) corroboration; (3)
    diversity; (4) developmental; (5) complementarity; (6) completeness; and (7) expansion.

   BASIC STRATEGIES FOR MIXED-METHODS RESEARCH

We reviewed and discussed the appropriateness of using mixed-methods research in the previous
chapter. In this chapter, we focus on mixed-methods research design strategies. Once researchers
specify the purpose for using a mixed-methods research approach and justify the value it will bring
to the study, they then need to decide which mixed-methods design to use. Before deciding which
strategy is the most suitable for their mixed-methods purpose, researchers should review and
consider various alternative design strategies. To help researchers understand how to select the
best design strategy for their study, we discuss five aspects of design: design investigation
strategies, strands of the study, time orientation, priority of methodological approach, and mixing
strategies. As researchers make their design decisions, the purpose of mixed-methods research
should be kept connected with the design strategies because it provides the key reason for
conducting mixed-methods research.

              5.1. General Properties of Mixed-Methods Research

As there are numerous design strategies and a variety of ways in which these strategies can be
implemented, the issue of mixed-methods design involves primarily asking the question of "how
do we determine the most appropriate design strategies to use?" We discuss a number of general
properties of mixed-methods research that researchers must consider and then demonstrate how
the purposes of mixed-methods research, discussed in Chapter 4, are linked to these design
decisions. The properties discussed in this chapter were drawn from existing typologies of
mixed-methods research from various fields. For example, based on the strands/phases of research,
Teddlie and Tashakkori (2006) proposed two types of mixed-methods research designs: (1)
monostrand; and (2) multistrand, which can be divided into four types of design: (1) concurrent;
(2) sequential; (3) conversion; and (4) fully integrated. Using a similar typology, but from a time
orientation perspective, Creswell et al. (2003) proposed two types of mixed-methods designs: (1)
concurrent; and (2) sequential. Each typology typically focuses on different features or aspects of
mixed-methods design, and these typologies do overlap with each other, depending on the field
orientation of the authors (e.g., an "equal status design" in Johnson et al. (2007) is the same as an
"equivalent status design" in Tashakkori & Teddlie, 1998). Thus, we argue that researchers need
to understand the similarities and differences across typologies, eliminate the redundancy, and
focus on key features of mixed-methods designs in order to design their mixed-methods research
study.

Design decisions, discussed in this chapter, are summarized in Table 5-1, which are adapted from
Venkatesh et al. (2016) and other sources noted above. These properties work in tandem rather
than independently in helping researchers address their research questions using the most
appropriate mixed-methods designs.

5.1.1. Design Investigation Strategies
From the design investigation perspective, mixed-methods research can be categorized into three
types of design: exploratory, confirmatory, or both (Tashakkori & Teddlie, 1998). In
mixed-methods research with an exploratory design, researchers seek to develop or generate a new
theory. Taking into account the discussion about research questions in the previous chapter,
research questions in a mixed-methods study with an exploratory design need not necessarily be
specified in advance and often unfold as researchers learn more about the phenomenon being
investigated (Nastasi et al., 2010). Although confirmatory questions are often associated with
quantitative research, there are confirmatory questions in qualitative research and exploratory
questions in quantitative research (Maxwell, 2004; Nastasi et al., 2010). Crede and Borrego (2013)
is an example of an exploratory mixed-methods study. A mixed-methods research approach was
used to "narrow the gap in the literature by addressing the relative lack of research focused on the
graduate engineering student experience in research groups, and including the influence of
international diversity" (p. 63). The purpose of their mixed-methods research was developmental.
The authors conducted ethnographically guided observations and interviews in their qualitative

78 | Basic Strategies
study and used the results to develop a survey that examined graduate engineering student retention
in their quantitative study.

In a confirmatory mixed-methods research design, researchers test an existing theory using
hypotheses established a priori (Venkatesh et al., 2016). Unlike exploratory mixed-methods
research, research questions in a confirmatory study are generally determined at the beginning of
the study. A confirmatory study largely follows a traditional scientific method where theory
informs hypotheses that in turn are tested using data analysis (Nastasi et al., 2010). For example,
Bhattacherjee and Premkumar (2004) conducted a confirmatory mixed-methods study to test a
hypothesis that a change in users' beliefs and attitudes toward a system over time could explain
why users form intentions to continue using that system. The primary purpose of their
mixed-methods research was corroboration in which they used the qualitative study to add further
credibility to the findings from the quantitative study. The qualitative data from the open-ended
section of the survey were used to test the same hypotheses as those tested using the quantitative
data.

The most common type of mixed-methods research from the design investigation perspective is
the integration of exploratory and confirmatory designs. One of the strengths of mixed-methods
research is the ability to address both exploratory and confirmatory research questions in the same
study or research program. The study reported in Stewart et al. (2017), discussed in Chapter 4, is
a good example of mixed-methods research that combines exploratory and confirmatory design
elements in the same research program. They tested the hypothesis that higher-status (physician)
leaders are less successful than lower-status (non-physician) leaders in implementing team-based
empowerment, and then sought to explain why and how leaders facilitated or obstructed the
implementation of team-based empowerment.

5.1.2. Strands of the Study
Following Teddlie and Tashakkori (2009), we define strands or phases as encompassing three
stages: (1) conceptualization (i.e., consisting of theoretical foundations, purposes, and research
methods); (2) experiential (i.e., consisting of data collection and analysis); and (3) inferential (i.e.,
consisting of data interpretation and application). From a research strand perspective,
mixed-methods research designs can be classified into two types: mixed-methods monostrand
designs and mixed-methods multistrand designs (Tashakkori & Teddlie, 2003; Teddlie &
Tashakkori, 2006; Venkatesh et al., 2016).

5.1.2.1. Monostrand Design
A monostrand design consists of a single phase of conceptualization-experiential-inferential
process, yet the study has both qualitative and quantitative components (Teddlie & Tashakkori,
2006; Venkatesh et al., 2016). This design is also called quasi-mixed design because only one type
of data is analyzed and only one type of inference is made (Teddlie & Tashakkori, 2006). An
example of this design is a monostrand conversion design. Figure 5-1 illustrates a mixed-methods
study with monostrand design (Teddlie & Tashakkori, 2006). Some of the characteristics of a
monostrand conversion design are discussed next.

Monostrand conversion designs are used in a single strand study in which research questions are
answered through an analysis of transformed data (i.e., quantitized or qualitized data). The mixing
of methods takes place in the experiential stage of the study, when data are transformed into

                                                                                                                            Chapter 5 | 79
another form and then analyzed accordingly. The conversion process of qualitative data to
quantitative data is called quantitizing. The quantitizing practice provides useful information by
obtaining the numerical values of observations in addition to researchers' narrative descriptions
(Onwuegbuzie & Johnson, 2006; Sandelowski, 2000; Venkatesh et al., 2016). The conversion
process of quantitative data to qualitative data is called qualitizing (Teddlie & Tashakkori, 2006).
This conversion process should only be conducted if researchers aim to extract more information
from quantitative data or to confirm interpretations of those data (Sandelowski, 2000; Venkatesh
et al., 2016; for an example, see Raman et al., 2022). In the experiential stage, data are converted
into another form and the transformed data are suitably analyzed. The results are then used to
develop inferences.
Monostrand conversion designs may be planned before the study actually occurs, but researchers
usually make the decision to transform their data when necessary as the study unfolds (Teddlie &
Tashakkori, 2006). For example, researchers may discover unexpected patterns in their interview
data and decide that the data should be converted into numerical form to allow for a more thorough
analysis of the data.

                               Figure 5-1. Monostrand Conversion Design
Although a monostrand conversion design offers several benefits, such as providing more insights
into the phenomenon under investigation, it also comes with some limitations including:
1. When converting qualitative data into quantitative data, the numerical data may not

    satisfactorily capture enough of the complexity of the qualitative data both to understand and
    communicate it (Sandelowski et al., 2009). Thus, it is recommended that researchers only
    perform quantitizing if it will add value.
2. Quantitizing may also cause the loss of depth and flexibility of the qualitative data (Driscoll et
    al., 2007). Whereas qualitative codes are generally multi-dimensional (i.e., they can and do
    provide insights into a host of interrelated conceptual themes during analysis), quantitative
    data are usually fixed and one-dimensional (i.e., they are composed of a single set of responses

80 | Basic Strategies
    representing a conceptual category that is predetermined prior to data collection).
    Dichotomizing qualitative data into a single dimension of quantitative data may reduce the
    richness of qualitative data (Driscoll et al., 2007).
3. When converting quantitative data into qualitative data, the results may represent an
    overgeneralization of the observed numeric data (Teddlie & Tashakkori, 2009; Venkatesh et
    al., 2016). It is also possible that profiles emerging from the qualitizing technique yield an
    unrealistic representation and thus could lead to incorrect inferences (Venkatesh et al., 2016).
4. Quantitized data are vulnerable to the problem of multicollinearity, wherein response
    categories are themselves linked as a consequence of the coding strategy (Driscoll et al., 2007).
    Further, the need to collect qualitative data may force researchers to reduce the sample size,
    which can lead to low statistical power (Driscoll et al., 2007).

An example of a study with a monostrand design is reported in Hahs-Vaughn and Onwuegbuzie
(2010). They gathered qualitative data (i.e., abstracts of empirical research articles published in
Research in the Schools journal) to study the quality of abstracts in empirical papers. All abstracts
were quantitized by assigning "1" to abstracts that were classified as being developed and "0" to
abstracts that were classified as being underdeveloped. They noted that this "dichotomization
allowed the researchers to correlate the quality of abstracts (originally representing qualitative data
that were converted to quantitative data) with selected nominal-level (i.e., decision made by the
editor regarding the manuscript, type of institution to which the first author belonged, and gender
of the first author) and ratio-level (i.e., number of authors of each article and length of article)
quantitative variables" (p. 56). Quantitized data can be subjected to statistical analyses and
associated interpretation (Onwuegbuzie & Teddlie, 2003).

Another example is the first stage of the illustrative study discussed in Venkatesh et al. (2016). In
that study, they converted the interview data into numerical data. When the investigators collected
the qualitative data, they asked respondents to identify factors that influenced their decision to
purchase a personal computer (PC), and then the interviewers asked them to indicate the degree to
which that factor was important in their decision to adopt or not to adopt a PC for household use
(see Venkatesh et al., 2016 for details). This technique provides not only the factors that the coders
derived from coding the qualitative data, but also the associated magnitude of importance
(Venkatesh et al., 2016). For an example that extracts sentiments from news articles, see Raman
et al. (2022).

5.1.2.2. Multistrand Design
Mixed-methods research with a multistrand design contains at least two research strands (Teddlie
& Tashakkori, 2006). In this design, one can mix the quantitative and qualitative components in
or across all stages of the study. Multistrand designs can also contain data conversion in which
data are transformed and analyzed both qualitatively and quantitatively. Most published
mixed-methods articles have adopted a multistrand design. For example, Sonenshein et al. (2014),
discussed in Chapter 4, gathered qualitative data using interviews in the first strand of their study
and gathered quantitative data using a survey in the second strand of their study; Koh et al. (2004)
gathered qualitative data in the first strand of their study and then tested their hypotheses using
quantitative data gathered in the second strand of their study; and Stewart et al. (2017) gathered
both qualitative and quantitative data concurrently. If a researcher adopts this design, decisions
must be made about other design properties, including time orientation, mixing strategies, and the
priority of methodology approaches (Venkatesh et al., 2016).

                                                                                                                            Chapter 5 | 81
5.1.3. Time Orientation
From a time orientation perspective, mixed-methods research can be categorized into two types:
concurrent and sequential mixed-methods designs.
5.1.3.1. Concurrent Mixed-Methods Design
A concurrent mixed-methods design is characterized by conducting the qualitative and quantitative
components of the study at the same time (Venkatesh et al., 2013, 2016). In this type of design,
researchers gather both qualitative and quantitative data, analyze them separately, and then
compare the results (Creswell & Creswell, 2018). This type of design has been used to validate
one form of data with the other form, to transform the data for comparison, and to address different
types of questions (Creswell & Plano Clark, 2018; Driscoll et al., 2007). In some cases, the same
individuals provide both qualitative and quantitative data so that the data can be easily compared
(Driscoll et al., 2007). There are three types of concurrent mixed-methods designs (Creswell et al.,
2003).
5.1.3.1.1. Concurrent Triangulation Design
In this design, both the qualitative and quantitative components of the study are conducted
concurrently in the same phase. Qualitative and quantitative strands of the study are usually given
equal weight in a concurrent triangulation design, although it is not always the case. A graphical
representation of a concurrent mixed-methods design is shown in Figure 5-2 (Teddlie &
Tashakkori, 2006).

                            Figure 5-2. Concurrent Mixed-Methods Design
For example, in a study of the implementation of a team-based empowerment initiative within the
Veterans Health Administration by Stewart et al. (2017), which is discussed in Chapters 3 and 4,
both qualitative and quantitative data were collected concurrently, and equal status was given to
both approaches. Specifically, at the conceptualization stage, the quantitative research questions

82 | Basic Strategies
and hypotheses were formulated independently from the qualitative research questions. However,
they were interrelated as the purpose of the study was completeness--it addressed different aspects
of the same phenomenon. In the quantitative strand of the study, they hypothesized that teams with
high-status leaders were less effective in implementing team-based empowerment than were teams
with lower-status leaders. In the qualitative strand of the study, they explored the moderating role
of team-status leader by identifying differences in identity as the underlying explanation for the
differing reactions between physicians and non-physicians. At the experiential stage, quantitative
data and qualitative data were analyzed separately, and the results were used to derive quantitative
and qualitative inferences at the inferential stage, respectively. Meta-inferences or the integration
of qualitative and quantitative inferences took place at the end of the study.

5.1.3.1.2. Concurrent Nested Design
In a concurrent nested design, both the qualitative and quantitative components of the study are
conducted at the same time, but one form of data is given more weight than the other (Creswell et
al., 2003). A study strand that receives less priority is embedded or nested in the research to provide
a supporting role. Mixing usually takes place during the analysis or experiential phase (Kroll &
Neri, 2009). An example of mixed-methods research with a concurrent nested design is the study
of psychological contract violation reported in Robinson and Rousseau (1994). At the
conceptualization stage of the quantitative strand, they formulated the research question (i.e., to
investigate the impact of violations on employee trust, satisfaction, and retention). At the
experiential stage, they conducted a two-stage survey. In the second stage survey, they also
gathered qualitative data via open-ended responses to identify how employees experienced
psychological contract violations. In their work, the qualitative data received less weight than the
quantitative data and was used to provide additional explanations for the hypotheses tested using
the quantitative analysis. A graphical representation of a concurrent nested design is shown in
Figure 5-3 (Teddlie & Tashakkori, 2006).

5.1.3.1.3. Concurrent Transformative Design
A concurrent transformative design combines the features of both concurrent triangulation and
concurrent nested designs (Creswell et al., 2003; Venkatesh et al., 2016). It may involve
triangulation of qualitative and quantitative components that are equally important. It may also
have a predominant method that guides the project (Creswell et al., 2003). In this design,
researchers use a specific theoretical perspective that can be based on certain ideologies, such as
critical theory, advocacy, and participatory research. This perspective reflects researchers'
personal stance toward the topic they are studying and is reflected in the purpose or research
questions of the study (Creswell et al., 2003). The choice of a concurrent transformative design is
made to facilitate the chosen theoretical perspective. For example, the design may be nested so
that diverse participants are given a voice in the change process of an organization that is studied
primarily quantitatively. The design may involve triangulation of quantitative and qualitative data
to provide evidence for an inequality of policies in an organization (Creswell et al., 2003). For
example, Doyle et al. (2013) examined the relationship between disability and successful transition
from sixth year of secondary school to higher education. Their study used a concurrent
transformative, triangulation design to address the research question. The transformative
emancipatory paradigm that they used was aimed at better understanding life experiences of
marginalized groups (i.e., disabled individuals) with the purpose of knowingly investigating and
analyzing social inequalities and imbalance (Doyle et al., 2013).

Although concurrent mixed-methods designs are powerful, they are challenging to conduct due to
the complexity of running multiple strands of research simultaneously (Teddlie & Tashakkori,
2006). Such a design not only requires considerable expertise to examine the same phenomenon
simultaneously and separately using two different approaches, but also involves the integration of
findings from simultaneous data analysis into a coherent set of inferences (Teddlie & Tashakkori,
2006). Given the challenges associated with a concurrent design, it is best achieved using a
collaborative team approach in which each team member can contribute to the complex,
simultaneously evolving research design (Teddlie & Tashakkori, 2006).

5.1.3.2. Sequential Mixed-Methods Design
Sequential mixed-methods designs are "designs in which there are at least two strands that occur
chronologically" (Teddlie & Tashakkori, 2006, p. 21). In this design, researchers first collect and
analyze one form of data, and then use the conclusions made on the basis of this data analysis to
formulate research questions used in the next strand of the study (Teddlie & Tashakkori, 2006;
Venkatesh et al., 2013). The final inferences are based on the results of both strands of the study.

Creswell et al. (2003) differentiated sequential mixed-methods designs into three types of designs:
(1) a sequential explanatory design (a quantitative followed by qualitative approach); (2) a
sequential exploratory design (a qualitative followed by a quantitative approach); and (3) a
sequential transformative design. However, as we mentioned in Chapter 1, although quantitative
research is generally associated with confirmatory or explanatory questions, there are many
quantitative studies that can be classified as exploratory. Similarly, there are many qualitative
studies that can be classified as explanatory or confirmatory. For that reason, we do not use the
term explanatory to define a quantitative-qualitative mixed-methods research design or the term
exploratory to define a qualitative-quantitative mixed-methods design. Instead, we simply refer to
the order of the study to describe the types of sequential mixed-methods designs.

84 | Basic Strategies
5.1.3.2.1. Sequential (Quantitative-Qualitative) Design
In this design, researchers first collect and analyze quantitative data, and then collect and analyze
qualitative data to help explain or elaborate the results obtained in the first strand (i.e., quantitative)
of the study (Creswell & Plano Clark, 2018). The rationale for this approach is that the quantitative
data and their subsequent analysis provide a general understanding of the research problem. The
qualitative data and their analysis refine and explain those quantitative findings by allowing
researchers to draw on participants' views in more depth (Ivankova et al., 2006). The advantages
of this design include being easy to implement (i.e., because all steps fall into clear separate stages)
and providing opportunities for the exploration of the quantitative results in more depth (Creswell
et al., 2003). However, the weaknesses of this design include the length of time involved in data
collection to complete two separate phases and the significant amount of resources required to
collect and analyze both types of data sequentially (Creswell et al., 2003; Ivankova et al., 2006).
A graphical representation of this type of design is illustrated in Figure 5-4 (Teddlie & Tashakkori,
2006).

                      Figure 5-4. Sequential (Quantitative-Qualitative) Design
As an example, in examining the factors that influence social performance of hybrid organizations
that pursue a social mission and sustain their operations through commercial activities by studying
work integration social enterprises (WISEs), Battilana et al. (2015) first gathered and analyzed
quantitative data. They conducted regression analyses to test the existence of the hypothesized
paradox--although social imprinting directly enhanced WISE's social performance, it also
indirectly weakened social performance by negatively influencing economic productivity. During
the inferential stage, the quantitative results led them to conclude that the paradoxical relationship
between social imprinting and social performance in WISEs was significant. Using this
quantitative inference, they developed the rationale for conducting a qualitative study during the

enhances a WISE's social performance by keeping it from neglecting its beneficiaries, social
imprinting also indirectly weakens social performance through the negative relationship that social
imprinting has with economic productivity" (p. 1670). They then gathered and analyzed qualitative
data to explore how socially imprinted WISEs may be able to resolve the paradox of social
imprinting by mitigating the negative relationship between social imprinting and economic
productivity.
5.1.3.2.2. Sequential (Qualitative-Quantitative) Design
This design begins with the collection and analysis of qualitative data in the first strand of the
study (Creswell & Plano Clark, 2018). Building on the findings from the qualitative strand of the
study, researchers conduct a developmental phase by designing quantitative features (e.g.,
generating new variables, designing instruments or scales, developing intervention plans). In the
inferential stage, researchers interpret how the quantitative results build on the initial qualitative
findings or how the quantitative findings provide a clear understanding because they are based on
the qualitative findings. A graphical representation of a sequential exploratory design is shown in
Figure 5-5 (Teddlie & Tashakkori, 2006).

                      Figure 5-5. Sequential (Qualitative-Quantitative) Design
An example of mixed-methods research with a sequential exploratory design is the study reported
in Koh et al. (2004), discussed in Chapter 4. They gathered and analyzed qualitative data (i.e.,
interview data) in the first strand of the study. This qualitative study was conducted to identify the
critical customer-supplier obligations in an IT outsourcing relationship. During the experiential
stage of their qualitative study, they used Miles and Huberman's (1994) approach to code and
analyze the interview data. The qualitative data analysis led them to identify six major components
of supplier obligations in an outsourcing project. They used these obligations to develop a research
model in the quantitative strand of the study. They then empirically tested the model using

86 | Basic Strategies
hierarchical regression analysis. Although they did not provide meta-inferences, they did follow
the sequential exploratory design, as shown in Figure 5-5. Another example of such a design
approach, which was not specifically termed as such (also noted in Chapter 4) is Zhang and
Venkatesh (2017).

5.1.3.2.3. Sequential Transformative Design
A sequential transformative design is similar to a concurrent transformative design. Researchers
can use either a qualitative or quantitative approach as the first strand for their study, but they must
use a theoretical perspective to guide the study (Creswell et al., 2003; Venkatesh et al., 2016). The
aim of this theoretical perspective, whether it be a conceptual framework, a specific ideology, or
advocacy, is more important in guiding the study than the use of methods alone. By using a
mixed-methods approach, a researcher may be able to amplify diverse perspectives, to better
advocate for participants, or to better understand a phenomenon or process that is changing as a
result of being studied (Creswell et al., 2003). For example, Ray-Bennett et al. (2010) studied the
meaning of health security for disaster resilience through people's perspectives in Bangladesh.
Mixed-methods research with a sequential transformative design was used to identify local
perspectives on how health affected vulnerability to disasters alongside local health security
indicators. They used two approaches: (1) the capability approach--an approach that considers
health as an integral part of good development; and (2) the dominant paradigm--a perspective that
considers health as a means to achieve development. To understand how the definitions and
explanations of health are socially, politically, economically, and culturally lived and constructed
by people in different societies, they also studied the phenomenon from a people perspective. In
this example, they used various qualitative and quantitative techniques, including focus group
discussions (FGD), household survey questionnaires, one-to-one and group interviews (formal and
informal), and household monitoring. A mixed-methods research approach allowed them to attend
to, consider, and incorporate different perspectives that guide the research process.

5.1.4. Priority of Methodological Approach
Based on the priority of the methodological approach, mixed-methods research can be categorized
into two types: (1) equivalent status or equal status designs (we use the term equal status designs
throughout this book for consistency); and (2) dominant-less dominant status designs.

5.1.4.1. Equal Status Design
In an equal status design, researchers placed equal weight on both the qualitative and quantitative
strands (Tashakkori & Teddlie, 1998). In a concurrent design, an equal status design has to be
implemented using a concurrent triangulation design, whereas in a sequential status design, equal
weight can be given to both qualitative and quantitative approaches, regardless of whether it is an
exploratory or explanatory study. For example, Battilana et al. (2015), discussed in Chapter 4,
emphasized the qualitative and quantitative strands of their study equally. In the first strand of the
study, they tested the hypothesized paradox (i.e., social imprinting had a positive effect on social
performance, but it could have a negative effect through the mediation of economic productivity).
They then analyzed their qualitative data by conducting an in-depth comparative case analysis to
explore how socially imprinted WISEs can resolve the paradox of social imprinting. By adopting
an equal status design, they were able to develop and validate their hypothesis that the relationship
between social imprinting and social performance was paradoxical, and that the paradox can be
resolved using a qualitative study.

                                                                                                                            Chapter 5 | 87
5.1.4.2. Dominant-Less Dominant Status Design
In a dominant-less dominant status design, researchers conduct a study in a single dominant strand
with a small component of the overall research project drawn from an alternative strand
(Tashakkori & Teddlie, 1998). There are two types of dominant-less dominant status designs: (1)
quantitative-dominant mixed-methods designs; and (2) qualitative-dominant mixed-methods
designs (Johnson et al., 2007). Such a strategy may also be preferable for those who are still
learning the other type of method (the one different from their core, general method expertise).

In a quantitative-dominant mixed-methods design, quantitative data are used to provide an
additional view that may benefit or fill a gap that exists in the entire research project. For example,
in the study by Robinson and Rousseau (1994) on psychological contract violation, which was
discussed previously, the quantitative study was the dominant strand. The quantitative data were
used to test the relationship between psychological contract violations and employee trust,
satisfaction, and retention, whereas the qualitative data were used to identify how employees
experienced psychological contract violations. They conducted a longitudinal study to gather
quantitative data in two stages of a survey. However, the qualitative data were only collected at
the end of the second stage of the survey. Participants were only asked two questions (i.e., they
were asked if their employer had ever failed to meet the obligation(s) that were promised to them,
and if so, they were asked to explain that experience). They analyzed the quantitative data using
regressions. The qualitative responses were analyzed using a simple coding scheme (i.e., the
responses were coded into categories by the individuals). When the authors discussed the findings,
they placed greater emphasis on the quantitative findings than on the qualitative findings. The
qualitative findings were used to enhance the findings of the quantitative strand of the study by
revealing different types of psychological contract violations found to be significant in the
quantitative phase of the study.

In a qualitative-dominant mixed-methods design, researchers rely on qualitative data to answer
their research questions, whereas concurrently recognizing that the addition of quantitative data
and approaches is likely to benefit some parts of the research (Johnson et al., 2007). For example,
in the study reported in Barley (1986) using an ethnographic method, his primary data (e.g., text
of field notes, tape recordings) were gathered using qualitative techniques. However, in the
research process, he also used some quantitative techniques to test a number of predictions derived
from the qualitative data analysis. For example, the findings from analyzing the qualitative data
suggested that institution and action in the areas where the CT scan was taken were linked via a
structuring process. He argued that if this is the case, the shape of each department's centralization
profile should parallel trends revealed by a chronological analysis of scripts. Thus, he tested his
prediction by regressing each department's centralization scores (linear, squares) on the day of
operation on which the scans took place to test for both linear and curvilinear trends. In this
example, the quantitative data were used to provide additional support for the findings and they
received less weight than the qualitative data.

5.1.5. Mixing Strategies
True mixed-methods research includes an integration of qualitative and quantitative methods. The
decision on when and how to integrate the data should be traced back to the research questions,
including how they are formulated and whether secondary questions have equal weight as the
primary questions. This integration or mixing can occur at various stages of the research process

88 | Basic Strategies
(Teddlie & Tashakkori, 2009), either at all stages of the study (i.e., fully mixed-methods design) or
at a specific stage of the study (i.e., partially mixed-methods design) (Teddlie & Tashakkori, 2009).
5.1.5.1. Fully Mixed-Methods Design
In a fully mixed-methods design, mixing of qualitative and quantitative approaches occurs in an
interactive manner in all stages of the study (Teddlie & Tashakkori, 2006). Although it is not
always the case, a fully mixed-methods design is commonly associated with an equal status design
in which both qualitative and quantitative strands of the study are conducted concurrently. Given
that at each stage the qualitative and quantitative strands are intertwined (Teddlie & Tashakkori,
2009), a side-by-side comparison of research questions, data, findings, and inferences that take
place in the concurrent design is favorable for the researchers who adopt a fully mixed-methods
design. A concurrent design allows researchers to compare and contrast the conceptualization of
qualitative and quantitative research questions, analyze both qualitative and quantitative data
simultaneously, and derive quantitative and qualitative inferences at the same time. A graphical
representation of a fully mixed-methods design is shown in Figure 5-6 (Teddlie & Tashakkori,
2006).

                                Figure 5-6. Fully Mixed-Methods Design
An example of a fully mixed-methods design is the study reported in Amabile et al. (2005). They
used both quantitative and qualitative longitudinal data from daily diaries of individuals working
on organizational projects to examine the nature, form, and temporal dynamics of the affect-
creativity relationship. The purpose of the study was completeness--to provide a holistic view of
the phenomenon. The data included multiple measures of affect, as well as multiple measures of
creativity. The qualitative and quantitative data were collected simultaneously. Some measures
were scale-rated responses to specific questions, whereas others were open-ended descriptions of
participants' day-to-day experiences at work. This study employed a fully mixed-methods design.

                                                                                                                            Chapter 5 | 89
At the conceptualization stage, the quantitative research questions were related to the qualitative
research questions. Using both qualitative and quantitative methods, they delved deeply into the
affect-creativity relationship. They initially formulated four quantitative research questions: "Is
there a positive or a negative linear relationship? Is creativity facilitated by fluctuation across the
range from negative to positive affect? Might creativity be higher on days of mixed emotion, when
both positive and negative emotions occur? And is there a curvilinear relationship, whereby
creativity is highest at some optimal level of affect along a continuum from extremely negative to
extremely positively?" (p. 376). Whereas these questions can be answered using a qualitative
method, they also intended to further explore the relationship between affect and creativity by
examining possible temporal patterns (e.g., whether affect precedes creative thought or whether
affect co-occurs with creative thought). This research objective was addressed using both
quantitative and qualitative analyses.

At the experiential stage, the quantitative and qualitative data were collected concurrently. A daily
questionnaire using an electronic event sampling methodology and content coding of narratives
from the daily questionnaire were used to collect quantitative and qualitative data, respectively.
The qualitative data were also quantitized and analyzed.

At the inferential stage, the results of qualitative and quantitative data analyses were integrated
and interpreted simultaneously. For example, the authors noted that "our quantitative and
qualitative data, collected over long periods of time from people doing creative work in
organizations, afforded an unusual opportunity to understand the affect-creativity relationship...,
we found consistent evidence of a positive relationship between positive affect and creativity and
no evidence of a negative relationship" (pp. 389-390).

5.1.5.2. Partially Mixed-Methods Design
A partially mixed-methods design is popular among researchers simply because this design and its
examples have been well described in the literature (Teddlie & Tashakkori, 2006). Further, using
this design, researchers do not have to integrate the qualitative and quantitative approaches across
all stages (Teddlie & Tashakkori, 2006). Mixing in a partially mixed-methods design takes place
at specific stages in the research process. The most common stages of integration in a partially
mixed-methods design are the experiential (i.e., data collection and analysis) and inferential stages.
An example of a partially mixed-methods design is the study reported in Battilana et al. (2015).
They first conducted a quantitative study by testing the hypothesis that both social imprinting and
economic productivity were positively associated with WISEs' social performance. In the
qualitative study, they examined the mechanisms underlying those relationships. The integration
took place at the inferential stage. For example, the authors noted that they "hypothesized, and
validated through regression analyses, that the relationship between social imprinting and social
performance is paradoxical . . . also uncovered, through our longitudinal comparative case
analysis, that socially imprinted WISEs may resolve this paradox" (p. 1678).

      5.2. Relationships between Purposes and Mixed-Methods Designs

Design decisions depend on the mixed-methods properties, as discussed previously. We present a
model of decision choices based on the three general properties of mixed-methods research--time
orientation, priority of methodological approach, and mixing strategies (see Figure 5-7). The other
two properties--design investigation strategies and strands/phases of research--are not included
in this decision model for two reasons. First, although mixed-methods research can address either

90 | Basic Strategies
exploratory or confirmatory questions, we encourage researchers to address both questions in a
mixed-methods study because addressing both types of questions in a single study or a program of
research is the primary strength of mixed-methods research. Second, with regard to the
strands/phases of research, we encourage researchers to adopt a multistrand design to fully harness
the advantages of mixed-methods research. A decision to transform one type of data to another
(i.e., quantitizing or qualitizing), which is a major element of a monostrand conversion design,
should be done only if researchers believe that doing so will bring additional value.

As shown in Figure 5-7, we argue that the purpose of mixed-methods research plays a major role
in guiding design decisions. Ideally, we recommend researchers use a concurrent design if the
purpose of their mixed-methods research is corroboration or complementarity. For a study with a
corroboration purpose, both qualitative and quantitative strands of the study can be executed
independently and concurrently to preserve their counteracting biases (Greene et al., 1989). Thus,
concurrent designs are the most suitable design to accommodate a corroboration purpose. When
the purpose is complementarity, a concurrent design allows researchers to measure overlapping
but different aspects of the same phenomenon. They can conduct a qualitative study and
quantitative study simultaneously because the findings from one strand of the study are
independent from those from the other strand of the study and they can be integrated at the
inferential stage. Thus, a complementarity purpose is readily achieved using a concurrent design.

If the purpose is compensation, developmental, or expansion, we suggest researchers use a
sequential design. Mixed-methods research with a compensation purpose is also best achieved
using a sequential design because the next strand of the study aims to overcome the limitations
and weaknesses associated with the previous strand of the study including those that emerge in the
first strand (e.g., small sample size, too much missing data) wherein some of the issues may not
be known until after the first strand has concluded and results known. Likewise, mixed-methods
research with a developmental purpose seeks to use the results from one approach to help develop
the research questions that will be addressed using another approach. Thus, a sequential design is
appropriate and more appropriately, necessary to achieve this purpose. Similarly, mixed-methods
research with an expansion purpose is best achieved using a sequential design because a qualitative
study is needed to expand on the initial findings from the quantitative study, or vice versa (Teddlie
& Tashakkori, 2009).

Lastly, if the purpose is diversity or completeness, researchers can use both types of designs.
Mixed-methods research with diversity as the purpose can be conducted using either sequential or
concurrent designs because the diverse findings can emerge at any stage in the research process.
When the purpose is completeness, researchers can either use a concurrent or sequential design. A
concurrent design allows researchers to examine different aspects of the same phenomenon.
Because qualitative and quantitative strands of the study are used to answer different research
questions that are related to different aspects of the same phenomenon, a concurrent research
design can help researchers shorten the length of time needed in data collection. However, a
sequential design could also be used to achieve a completeness purpose. A sequential design will
allow researchers to use the findings from the first strand of the study to further develop the
research questions in the second strand of the study. The combination of qualitative and
quantitative methods provides richness and a more complete picture of the phenomenon under
study that one method alone would not yield.

                                                                                                                            Chapter 5 | 91
Although there are different types of concurrent and sequential designs, we do not show these
design types in the decision model in order to maintain simplicity and reduce redundancy in
designing mixed-methods research. For example, a nested concurrent mixed design is typically
associated with a dominant-less dominant mixed design. Thus, if a researcher adopts a nested
concurrent design, then one will typically employ a dominant-less dominant mixed design. Further,
because the difference between the two primary sequential designs discussed previously is only in
the order of qualitative and quantitative strands of the study, we argue that this decision should be
straightforward to researchers who adopt a sequential design and, hence, is not included in the
decision model. We also propose that the most suitable way to execute a fully mixed-methods
design is to use an equal status design in which qualitative and quantitative strands of the study
are given the same priority and mixed across all stages of the study.

Based on the combination of purposes, time orientation, priority of methodological approach, and
mixing strategies, we summarize the design recommendations for mixed-methods research in
Tables 5-2, 5-3, 5-4, 5-5, 5-6, 5-7, and 5-8. As presented in the tables, we suggest researchers use
a partially mixed concurrent equal status design, a partially mixed concurrent dominant status
design, or a fully mixed concurrent equal status design if the purpose of mixed-methods research
is corroboration, complementarity, or completeness. If the purpose of mixed-methods research is
compensation, developmental, or expansion, we recommend the use of a partially mixed
sequential equal status design, a partially mixed sequential dominant status design, or a fully
mixed sequential equal status design. Researchers can use any of the possible design options if the
purpose is developmental. We also offer an example for each mixed-methods purpose using one
of the possible design options.

                             The study supplemented the quantitative data with a sample of
                             phenomenological qualitative interviews with key survey
                             participants to add clarity to the interpretations of the survey
                             questions.
                         · The mixing took place at the interpretation stage. For instance,
                             the author noted that "results of the study show no evidence of
                             difference in the ethical decision-making profiles between the
                             two groups of leaders. The themes and emergent findings
                             resulting from the qualitative analysis indicate a profound
                             incompatibility between the values informing decision-makers
                             using the luxury strategy and those employed by leaders

                             leadership and conscious capitalism" (p. 443).

                                  quantitative research questions informed one another (e.g.,

                                  are reflected in organizational identity more broadly; how

                             suggested that multiple role commitment positively related to

Note that the possible design options discussed in this chapter are not exhaustive and are
recommendations based on most likely scenarios we foresee. Researchers are welcome to use other
types of designs not listed as the possible design options for a specific mixed-methods research
purpose. For example, although a complementarity purpose is best achieved using a concurrent
design, researchers can use a sequential design to achieve this purpose, as long as they can justify
why such design is useful and/or appropriate for the given context. An example of a study with a
complementarity purpose that uses a sequential design is Sonenshein et al. (2014) that examines
the role of self-evaluations in explaining support of environmental issues. Specifically, they used
a partially mixed sequential equal status design--they started with a qualitative study followed by
a quantitative, observational study. Such a design allowed them to investigate two different, but
complementary aspects of the same phenomenon--examine how social issue supporters' everyday
experiences influenced their self-evaluations (study 1) and why these self-evaluations mattered
through their ability to predict issue-related actions (study 2).

                                            Summary

· We discuss five mixed-methods properties that should be considered by researchers in
    designing a mixed-methods study. These are design investigation strategies, strands of the
    study, time orientation, priority of methodological approach, and mixing strategies.

· From a design investigation perspective, mixed-methods research can be categorized into three
    types: exploratory, confirmatory, or both.

· From a research strand perspective, mixed-methods research can be categorized into two types:
    monostrand and multistrand.

· From a time orientation perspective, mixed-methods research can be categorized into two
    types: concurrent and sequential.

· Based on the priority of the methodological approach, mixed-methods research can be
    categorized into two types: equivalent/equal status and dominant-less dominant status.

· Based on the mixing strategies, the integration in mixed-methods research can take place at all
    stages of the study (i.e., fully mixed-methods design) or at a specific stage of the study (i.e.,
    partial mixed-methods design).

· We recommend researchers use the model of decision choices proposed in this chapter to help
    them make design decisions. In this model, the purpose of mixed-methods research plays a
    major role in guiding the design decisions. Figure 5-7 and Tables 5-2 through 5-8 provide key
    information.

· We suggest researchers use a partially mixed concurrent equal status design, a partially mixed
    concurrent dominant status design, or a fully mixed concurrent equal status design if the
    purpose of mixed-methods research is corroboration or complementarity, and to use a partially
    mixed sequential equal status design, a partially mixed sequential dominant status design, or a
    fully mixed sequential equal status design if the purpose of mixed-methods research is
    compensation, developmental, or expansion. Researchers can use any of the possible design
    options if the purpose is diversity and completeness.

                                            Exercises

1. Select a topic from your field and develop two to three research questions that can be studied
    using a mixed-methods research approach.

2. Based on your response to the previous question, determine the purpose of the proposed mixed-
    methods research. Identify different design strategies that you can use in your study and justify
    your decisions. Describe these designs and discuss how they can be used to address your
    research questions and to achieve your mixed-methods research purpose.

3. Select an article in your field that uses a mixed-methods research approach. What was the
    purpose of mixed-methods research? Review the design decisions in the article, namely design
    investigation strategies, strands of the study, time orientation, priority of methodological
    approach, and mixing strategies. Critique the decisions they made and wherever you disagree,
    indicate what decisions you would have made and why?

     MIXED-METHODS DATA COLLECTION STRATEGIES

A data collection strategy is a detailed plan to collect empirical data using one or more methods.
It is how researchers "get" their information (Johnson & Turner, 2003). After researchers have
made decisions associated with the general properties of mixed-methods research discussed in
Chapter 5, they will then need to develop a strategy for collecting data. Given mixed-methods
research involves the use of qualitative and quantitative approaches, the data collection procedures
will need to include both types of data. In this chapter, we address:

· Sampling designs and issues in qualitative and quantitative research;
· Mixed-methods sampling strategies; and
· Procedures for qualitative, quantitative, and mixed-methods data collection.

       6.1. Sampling Designs in Qualitative and Quantitative Research

Sampling is an important step in the research process because it helps determine the quality of
inferences made by the researcher (Collins et al., 2006). In both qualitative and quantitative strands
of a mixed-methods study, researchers must decide the sampling strategies, including "how many
participants do I need to answer my research questions?" (i.e., sample size) and "how do I select
these sample members?" (i.e., sampling schema) (Collins et al., 2007; Onwuegbuzie & Collins,
2007).

6.1.1. Sampling Schema
Prior studies have proposed a number of sampling schemas that can be categorized as either
random sampling (i.e., probabilistic sampling) or non-random sampling (non-probabilistic
sampling). Although probabilistic sampling is generally associated with quantitative research and
non-probabilistic sampling is generally associated with qualitative research, researchers can use
either sampling method in qualitative and quantitative studies.

One of the primary goals of using probability sampling techniques is generalizability (external
validity) or the ability to extrapolate findings from a subset of a population or a particular setting
to a larger defined population of people or setting (Kemper et al., 2003). In order to ensure random
selection of participants, researchers must set up a process or procedure that assures that the
different units in the population have equal probabilities of being chosen (Trochim, 2006). Table
6-1 summarizes five major probability sampling schemes.

sampling
Systematic random   Every individual in the desired population has an equal and
sampling            independent chance of being chosen for the study (Trochim, 2006).
                    Individuals are chosen from a list by selecting every kth sampling frame
                    member, where k is the population size divided by the sample size
                    (Collins et al., 2006).

                   Chapter 6 | 105
 Sampling Scheme                                       Description
Stratified random  The sampling frame is divided into homogeneous subgroups and then
sampling           each subgroup is randomly sampled (Trochim, 2006).
Cluster random     Intact groups, representing clusters of individuals, are chosen rather
sampling           than selecting individuals one at a time (Collins et al., 2006).
Multistage random  The first four methods are combined in a variety of useful ways that
sampling           help researchers address their sampling needs in the most efficient and
                   effective manner possible (Trochim, 2006).

Simple random sampling is a technique in which n distinct units are selected from the N units in
the population in such a way that every possible combination of n units has an equal and
independent chance of being selected in the sample (Thompson, 2012). The advantage of this
method is that data can, in theory, be generalized from the sample to the entire population with a
computable margin of error. However, the selected units might be spread over a large geographic
area, making them very difficult to reach (Kemper et al., 2003), although such barriers can be
overcome in online studies.

In systematic random sampling, the sample is chosen by selecting a random starting point and then
picking every kth element in succession from the sampling frame. The sampling interval k is
determined by dividing the population size N by the sample size n (Collins et al., 2006). This

method has the obvious caveat that it can be used only if the researcher is certain that the population
list is not ordered in such a way that every kth unit results in a sample that is systematically different
from the population at large (Kemper et al., 2003).

A stratified random sample is obtained by separating the population elements into groups or strata,
such that each element belongs to a single group (Kemper et al., 2003). There are two different
types of stratified random sampling: (1) proportional stratified random sampling--the proportion
of each unit randomly selected from each group is the same as the proportion in the target
population; and (2) non-proportional stratified sampling--the number of units selected from each
group is generally the same, regardless of the relative proportion in the population (Kemper et al.,
2003).

Cluster sampling is similar to stratified sampling in which we select groups or categories.
However, instead of taking a random sample within each group, in cluster sampling, a random
sample of groups within the population is first performed (Kemper et al., 2003). This approach is
useful when there are resource constraints that preclude developing a complete sampling frame or
when it takes a significant effort to collect data..

Multistage random sampling is a combination of two or more methods discussed above in which
the samples are selected randomly in each stage from the population (Collins et al., 2006; Trochim,
2006). The process usually starts with random cluster sampling and then applies simple random
sampling or stratified random sampling.

In non-probability sampling, subjective methods are used to decide which elements are included
in the sample, and sample members are identified in a way that does not give all participants or
units in the population an equal chance of being included (Trochim, 2006). One can divide

106 | Data Collection Strategies
non-probability sampling methods into two broad categories: accidental and purposive sampling.
In accidental or convenience sampling, members of a target population that meet certain practical
criteria, such as easy accessibility, geographical proximity, availability at a given time, and
willingness to participate, are chosen. In contrast, purposive sampling involves sampling with a
purpose in mind. This will typically be specific pre-defined groups (e.g., women aged 50-60 years;
IT professionals) or theoretically based targets of selection (e.g., multiple case studies at different
cities) (Yin, 2003). Table 6-2 summarizes major subcategories of purposive sampling methods
(definitions are from various sources, including Collins et al., 2007; Onwuegbuzie & Leech, 2007;
Trochim, 2006). For instance, one might sample for specific groups or types of people as in modal
instance, expert, or quota sampling; alternatively, one might sample for diversity as in
heterogeneous sampling. In all of these sampling methods, researchers know what they want--
they are sampling with a purpose (Trochim, 2006).

sampling

Snowball sampling Begins by identifying someone who meets the criteria for inclusion in

                 the sample. Then that person is asked to recommend others who also

                 meet the criteria.

Random purposeful Researchers first obtain a list of individuals interested in participating in

sampling         the study using one of the purposive sampling methods and then

                 randomly select a desired number of individuals from the list.

Stratified       Sampling frame is divided into strata or groups to obtain relatively

purposeful sampling homogenous subgroups and a purposeful sample is selected from each

                 stratum.

Criterion sampling Choosing settings, groups, and/or individuals because they fit one or

                 compelling insights about the phenomenon of interest.

Quota sampling   Researchers identify desired characteristics and quotas of sample

                 members to be included in the sample.

6.1.2. Sample Size
The number of participants to be recruited for a study is a challenging question (Luborsky &
Rubinstein, 1995). There is seldom a simple answer to the question of sample size, especially in
qualitative research. Nevertheless, to increase representation, it is essential that a sample size is
accurately estimated in both quantitative (e.g., Cohen, 1988) and qualitative (e.g., Onwuegbuzie
& Leech, 2007) research (Collins et al., 2007). Drawing on a number of prior studies (e.g., Collins

                                                                             Chapter 6 | 107
et al., 2006; VanVoorhis & Morgan, 2007; Wolf et al., 2013), we summarize minimum sample
sizes for most common quantitative and qualitative research designs (see Table 6-3). Whereas the
criteria for sample size in quantitative research are based on probability computations, the criteria
in qualitative research are typically based on expert opinions (Collins et al., 2006).

    6.2. Sampling Guidelines for Qualitative and Quantitative Research

Sampling issues in qualitative research focus on discovering the scope and the nature of the system
to be sampled, whereas quantitative research focuses on determining how many cases or
observations are needed to reliably represent the whole system and to minimize falsely identifying
or missing existing relationships between factors (i.e., depth/generalizability trade-off) (Luborsky
& Rubinstein, 1995). Here, sampling designs play a pivotal role in determining the type of
generalization that is justifiable (Collins et al., 2006). Whereas large and random samples tend to
support statistical generalizations (i.e., making generalizations or inferences on data extracted
from a representative statistical sample to the population from which the sample was drawn), small
and purposive samples tend to support analytical generalizations (i.e., inferences that can be
applied to wider theory on the basis of how selected cases fit with general constructs) (Curtis et
al., 2000) and case-to-case transfer (i.e., making generalizations from one case to another similar
case) (Collins et al., 2006). If the goal is not to generalize findings to a population but to obtain
insights about a phenomenon, set of individuals, or set of events, then researchers can purposefully
select individuals, groups, and/or settings that enhance understanding of that underlying
phenomenon, individuals, or events (Onwuegbuzie & Collins, 2007). Lee and Baskerville (2012,
pp. 751-752) suggested that a theory that has survived empirical testing in a particular setting (e.g.,
organizations, countries) may be responsibly generalized to a new setting, without retesting it, only
if one is willing to accept four judgment calls: (1) "the `uniformity of nature' judgment call" (i.e.,
when sufficiently similar situations occur in the future, similar effects will follow); (2) "the

108 | Data Collection Strategies
`sufficient similarity in relevant conditions' judgment call" (i.e., the setting that is being
generalized from and the setting that is being generalized to are sufficiently similar); (3) "the
`successful identification of relevant variables' judgment call" (i.e., the theory, as already
empirically tested, indeed contains all the relevant variables that have significant effects in shaping
the phenomenon of interest); and (4) "the `theory is true' judgment call" (i.e., in using a theory in
a new setting, one may only make a judgment call that it is true). These judgment calls suggest
that sampling strategies should be designed carefully because they determine how and where a
theory should be tested that in turn affects the type of generalization that can be derived from the
theory.

Generally, the decision on sampling designs is determined by research questions. Whether the
methodology employed is qualitative or quantitative, sampling methods are intended to maximize
efficiency and validity (Palinkas et al., 2015). Nevertheless, sampling must be consistent with the
purposes and assumptions inherent in the use of either qualitative or quantitative methods (Palinkas
et al., 2015). Qualitative methods place primary emphases on saturation (i.e., obtaining a
comprehensive understanding by continuing to sample until no new substantive information is
acquired) (Miles et al., 2020). In contrast, quantitative methods place primary emphasis on
generalizability (i.e., ensuring that the knowledge gained is representative of the population from
which the sample is drawn) (Palinkas et al., 2015), although more recent approaches that focus on
contextualization depart from the notion of universal generalization (Johns, 2006, 2017). Thus,
each methodology has different expectations and sampling procedures.

A number of researchers, including Glaser and Strauss (1967), Miles et al. (2020), and Patton
(1990), have discussed different sampling strategies that can be used in qualitative research.
Building on the recommendations of Miles and Huberman (1994) about sampling strategies (see
also Miles et al., 2020), Curtis et al. (2000) summarized six criteria for selecting qualitative
samples including:

1. A sampling strategy should be relevant to the conceptual framework and the research questions
    addressed by the study.

2. A sample should generate rich information on the type of phenomenon under investigation.
3. A sample should enhance the generalizability of the findings. For qualitative samples,

    researchers are more concerned with generalizability at the abstract, conceptual or theoretical
    level (i.e., applied to wider theory on the basis of how selected cases `fit' with general
    constructs) than statistical generalizability (i.e., applied to wider populations on the basis of
    representative statistical samples). The interested reader is referred to one especially interesting
    discussion of generalizability related to theoretical and empirical generalizations presented in
    Lee and Baskerville (2003).
4. A sample should produce believable descriptions/explanations.
5. Researchers should consider whether the method of selection permits informed consent where
    it is required, whether there are benefits or risks associated with selection for and participation
    in the study, and whether the study will adequately protect the enrolled participants by
    explicitly addressing potential ethical concerns.
6. Researchers should consider feasibility in terms of the resource costs of money and time, the
    practical issues of accessibility, and whether the sampling strategy is compatible with the
    researchers' work style and competency.

                                                                                                                           Chapter 6 | 109
We summarize the principles for selecting quantitative samples as follows:

1. Sampling decisions must be theoretically driven (Osborne, 2008). The sampling choices should
    be relevant to the research questions and objectives of the study (Daniel, 2012).

2. Given that the decision on design corresponding to the research objectives will have an impact
    on the sample size (VanVoorhis & Morgan, 2007), the study design should be carefully
    planned before sampling decisions are made.

3. The identification of the minimum/most appropriate sample size depends on careful and
    detailed planning of all stages of the research process (Delice, 2010). Decisions on a sampling
    schema and sample size are typically made at the beginning of the study.

4. A good sampling technique should describe the study population, list the members of the
    population, identify the sampling type, determine the sample size, and test the representative
    power of the sample (Delice, 2010).

5. A sample should aim to apply the relationships obtained among variables to a general
    population (i.e., statistical generalization) (Collins et al., 2006).

              6.3. Sampling Strategies in Mixed-Methods Research

Determining issues regarding sampling is also important in designing a mixed-methods study.
Although making sampling decisions can be difficult for both qualitative and quantitative research,
sampling strategies are even more complex for mixed-methods research. In mixed-methods
research, researchers must consider sampling schema and sample size for both the qualitative and
quantitative strands of the study (Collins et al., 2006). To help researchers make a sampling design
decision, Teddlie and Yu (2007) proposed five mixed-methods sampling strategies: (1) basic, (2)
sequential, (3) concurrent, (4) multilevel, and (5) multiple. Similarly, Onwuegbuzie and Collins
(2007) developed a framework by integrating the time orientation (i.e., concurrent and sequential)
and the relationship between the qualitative and quantitative samples (i.e., identical, parallel,
nested, and multilevel). Venkatesh et al. (2016) integrated Onwuegbuzie and Collins' (2007) and
Teddlie and Yu's (2007) framework and suggested four sampling designs: basic, sequential,
concurrent, and multiple sampling designs, which we describe next:

1. Basic sampling designs include all the qualitative and quantitative sampling designs presented
    in Tables 6-1 and 6-2.

2. Sequential sampling designs typically involve some or all of the findings stemming from the
    sample selected from one phase being used to drive the second phase and subsequently, the
    sample pertaining to this phase (Collins et al., 2007). Four types of sequential sampling designs
    include (Onwuegbuzie & Collins, 2007):
    a. Identical samples: Both qualitative and quantitative strands of the study use the same
         sample members.
    b. Parallel samples: The samples for the qualitative and quantitative components of the study
         are different, but they are drawn from the same population.
    c. Nested samples: The sample members selected for one phase of the study represent a subset
         of those participants chosen for the other component of the study.
    d. Multilevel samples: Researchers use two or more sets of samples obtained from different
         levels (e.g., organization, individual).

3. Concurrent sampling designs enable researchers to triangulate the results from separate
    quantitative and qualitative components of their study and confirm, cross-validate, or
    corroborate their findings in a single study or research program (Creswell et al., 2003;

110 | Data Collection Strategies
    Venkatesh et al., 2016). Like sequential sampling designs, concurrent sampling designs can be
    identical, parallel, nested, or multilevel designs.
4. Multiple sampling designs typically involve using more than one sampling technique, such as
    using simple random sampling in the quantitative study and expert sampling in the quantitative
    study.
Mixed-methods research frequently requires mixed-methods sampling procedures in order to
simultaneously increase inference quality and generalizability (Collins et al., 2006; Kemper et al.,
2003). To achieve this objective, there is often a need for two types of samples: probability sample
(to increase statistical generalizability) and purposive sample (to increase analytical
generalizability and case-to-case transfer) (Kemper et al., 2003). Collins et al. (2006) proposed a
two-dimensional representation of the types of generalizations made in mixed-methods research
(see Figure 6-1). Once again, for a broad discussion of generalizability, the interested reader is
referred to Lee and Baskerville (2003).

        Figure 6-1. Generalizations and Sampling Designs in Mixed-Methods Research
As can be seen in Figure 6-1, the selection of sampling designs determines the types of inferences
and generalizations that can be generated from a study. Quadrant 1 represents meta-inferences that
involve purely analytical generalization/case-to-case transfers. These types of inferences are
usually associated with non-probability sampling in both qualitative and quantitative strands of the
study. Quadrant 2 represents meta-inferences that involve a combination of statistical
generalization from the qualitative strand and analytical generalization/case-to-case transfer from
the quantitative strand. Quadrant 3 represents meta-inferences that involve a combination of
statistical generalizations from the quantitative strand and analytical generalization/case-to-case
transfer from the qualitative strand. Quadrant 4 represents meta-inferences that involve purely
statistical generalizations (Collins et al., 2007).

                                                                                                                           Chapter 6 | 111
To determine the most suitable sampling designs for one's research purpose, Collins (2010)
proposed five criteria for formulating mixed-methods sampling decisions:

1. The sampling unit selected for each strand of the study should reflect the dependent
    relationship between the samples selected per phase and the time orientation of the strand (i.e.,
    concurrent or sequential).

2. The sampling unit selected for each strand of the study should reflect the relationship between
    the quantitative and qualitative samples.

3. The sampling unit selected for each strand of the study should reflect the relationship between
    the specific combination of the sampling schemes and the chosen type of generalization.

4. The sampling unit selected for each strand of the study should reflect the relationship between
    the varying types of data collected in terms of addressing the research questions.

5. Researchers should identify the relationship between the emphasis of approach (dominant,
    less-dominant, equal) and the formulation of appropriate meta-inferences and generalizations
    based on data collected from both strands of the study.

Using the guidelines for qualitative and quantitative sampling designs discussed earlier and these
five criteria of mixed-methods sampling designs should help researchers determine the appropriate
sampling designs (i.e., sampling schemes and sample sizes) for each strand of the study.

6.3.1. Sampling Examples in Mixed-Methods Research
To illustrate how sampling decisions are made in mixed-methods research, we use two studies
discussed in Chapter 5: Stewart et al. (2017) and Koh et al. (2004). Whereas Stewart et al. used a
concurrent mixed-methods design, Koh et al. used a sequential mixed-methods design.

The mixed-methods study design was a partially mixed concurrent equal status design. The study
aimed to explore barriers to the successful implementation of a team-based empowerment
initiative within the Veterans Health Administration (VHA). The mixed-methods sampling design
was nested sampling--the sample members selected for the qualitative study represented a subset
of those participants chosen for the quantitative study. In study 1, they used a longitudinal
quasi-experimental design to gather quantitative data, and in study 2, they used an in-depth
interview technique to gather qualitative data. In study 1, they tested whether there was a difference
in effectiveness of team-based empowerment intervention between physician vs. non-physician
leaders. They used convenience sampling and recruited all providers located in one of twenty-one
geographical divisions. To be included in their sample, a provider had to be working before the
beginning of the team-based empowerment intervention. This criterion resulted in the collection
of pre- and post-intervention data for a sample of 224 providers.

Qualitative data were collected via participants' interviews, which were conducted as part of a
larger study of VHA teams. The interviews were conducted during the initial months of
implementing team-based empowerment and follow-up interviews one year later. They used a
purposive sampling strategy to recruit team members in the same geographical division as their
quantitative sample. In total, they interviewed eight providers, ten care managers, six clinical
associates, and six administrative associates.

112 | Data Collection Strategies
They used a partially mixed sequential equal status design. The mixed-methods sampling design
was parallel sampling--the samples for the qualitative and quantitative components of the study
were different, but they were drawn from the same population. Data for both qualitative and
quantitative studies were collected in Singapore. In the qualitative strand of the study, they drew
samples from the IT Management Association (ITMA) and the Singapore IT Federation (SITF)
members. They used criterion sampling for the qualitative strand. They contacted four of the
largest customer organizations from ITMA and four of the largest supplier organizations from
SITF, and requested permission to interview managers with at least three years of experience in
managing outsourcing contracts. In total, they interviewed nine customer project managers and six
supplier project managers. In the quantitative strand of the study, data collection was conducted in
two stages. The sample was drawn from the ITMA and SITF members--the sampling strategy was
simple random sampling. They sent invitation letters to all members and then contacted each
member by phone a week after the mailing. They excluded managers who participated in study 1
interviews from study 2 to eliminate primacy effects and hypotheses guessing. In total, they
received completed responses from 179 customer project managers and 191 supplier project
managers, representing a total of 158 organizations.

                 6.4. Data Collection in Mixed-Methods Research

Having discussed sampling designs in mixed-methods research, we now turn to the specific
methods of data collection that are used in qualitative and quantitative research, and how these
methods can be combined in mixed-methods research. Researchers need to consider the possible
types of data in mixed-methods research and determine what sources of data will best answer the
research questions (Creswell et al., 2006). Whereas qualitative research focuses on the use of
language data, quantitative research focuses on numerical data.

6.4.1. Qualitative Data Collection Methods
According to Creswell and Poth (2018), there are five different types of qualitative approaches:
biography (i.e., narrative study of lives) (Creswell & Poth, 2018), phenomenology (i.e., study of
structures of consciousness as experienced from the first-person perspective) (Smith, 2018),
grounded theory (i.e., inductive methodology that provides systematic guidelines for gathering,
synthesizing, analyzing, and conceptualizing qualitative data for the purpose of theory
construction) (Glaser & Strauss, 1967), ethnography (i.e., methodology that involves direct and
sustained social contact with agents), and case study (i.e., empirical inquiry that investigates a
contemporary phenomenon within its real-life context) (Creswell, 1998; Yin, 2003). Regardless of
the methodological approach involved, the purpose of data gathering in qualitative research is to
provide evidence tied to the phenomenon being investigated (Polkinghorne, 2005). Most often,
such evidence takes the form of words or texts. Data used in qualitative research are not simply on
the surface ready to be gathered. Instead, researchers need to dig below the surface to unearth
experiential accounts (Polkinghorne, 2005). Nonetheless, despite qualitative data and induction
often seen as approaches in an interprevist paradigm, it should be noted that induction can be
positivist. Further, inductive methods can use the literature as a source of the data including in an
approach termed top-down induction (Shepherd & Sutcliffe, 2011).

The most common sources of qualitative data are qualitative surveys, open-ended interviews, focus
groups, observation, and secondary data (e.g., personal and official documents, visual data, visual
and audio data, other archival data) (Creswell & Poth, 2018; Johnson & Turner, 2003). The

strengths and weaknesses of each of these methods are presented in Table 6-4 (adapted from
multiple sources including Johnson & Turner, 2003; Kitzinger, 1995; Turner, 2010). As can be
seen from this table, one of the major strengths of qualitative methods is their ability to provide a
much deeper understanding of the phenomenon under study by allowing researchers to ask
participants about their experiences. Because qualitative methods focus on experience data, it can
sometimes be challenging to use probability sampling. Thus, purposive sampling is the most
common sampling strategy for qualitative research (Miles et al., 2020).

Qualitative surveys are a useful qualitative data collection technique for gaining in-depth
information about respondents' underlying reasoning and motivations. A qualitative survey does
not count the number of people with the same characteristic (i.e., value of variable), but it
establishes meaningful variation (i.e., relevant dimensions and values) within that population
(Jansen, 2010). Qualitative surveys are usually administered using the same techniques as
quantitative surveys. However, the format of the questions is usually open-ended and participants
will need to type or write down their responses on the survey booklet/page.

Interviews are most appropriate for situations in which you want to ask open-ended questions that
elicit depth of information from relatively few people. When using this method for collecting data,
interviewers establish rapport and ask the interviewee a series of questions (Johnson & Turner,
2003). There are various forms of interview designs that can be used to obtain rich data using a
qualitative investigational perspective (Creswell & Poth, 2018; Turner, 2010). The most common
forms of interviews include informal conversational interviews (i.e., an interview technique that
relies entirely on the spontaneous generation of questions in a natural interaction, typically one
that occurs as part of ongoing participant observation fieldwork); a general interview guide
approach (i.e., this approach is more structured than the information conversational approach but
the ways in which questions are worded depend on the researcher who is conducting the interview);
and standardized open-ended interviews (i.e., participants are asked identical questions but the
questions are worded to make sure responses are open-ended) (Patton, 1987, 2014; Turner, 2010).

Focus groups are "a form of group interview that capitalises on communication between research
participants in order to generate data" (Kitzinger, 1995, p. 299). Although group interviews are
often used simply as a quick and convenient way of collecting data from several people
simultaneously, focus groups explicitly use group interaction as a part of the method (Kitzinger,
1995). According to Krueger and Casey (2015, p. 6), focus groups typically have five major
characteristics: "(1) a small group of people, who (2) possess certain characteristics, (3) provide
qualitative data, (4) in a focused discussion (5) to help understand the topic of interest." The idea
behind focus groups is that group processes can help people explore and clarify their views in ways
that would be less easily accessible in a one-on-one interview (Kitzinger, 1995).

In this method, researchers observe participants in natural or structured settings (Johnson &
Turner, 2003). Hence, this method is often described as "naturalistic research" (Mays & Pope,
1995). Observational methods used in social sciences involve a systematic, detailed observation
of behavior and talk in a natural environment. The analog in observation is to create an
environment where people will act as naturally as possible without considering the researcher's
presence (Johnson & Turner, 2003). However, in an attempt to minimize the impact on the
environment being studied, investigators sometimes adopt a "participant observer" role, becoming
involved in the activities taking place while also observing them (Mays & Pope, 1995). Thus,
observers can remain objective and not contaminate the data with their own preconceptions
(Mulhall, 2003), though the Hawthorne effect cannot be ruled out.

116 | Data Collection Strategies
Secondary data are "data that were originally recorded or `left behind' or collected at an earlier
time by someone other than the current researcher, often for an entirely different purpose from the
current research purpose" (Johnson & Turner, 2003, p. 314). Secondary data may be internal to a
program or organization (e.g., corporate annual report) or external and personal (e.g., personal
notes from daily activities, photographs, anything recorded for private purposes). Archival
research files can also be a source of secondary data. These are files originally used for research
purposes and then stored for possible later use (Johnson & Turner, 2003). Another source of
secondary, qualitative data is social media data. Social media offers a novel opportunity to harvest
a massive and diverse range of content without the need for intrusive or intensive data collection
procedures (Andreotta et al., 2019). The volume of secondary data continues to grow leaps and
bounds, and researchers are using such data extensively.

6.4.2. Quantitative Data Collection Methods
As mentioned previously, quantitative data collection methods focus on numerical data. Thus,
quantitative data collection may include any method that will result in numerical data. The most
common types of quantitative data collection strategies are quantitative surveys, experiments,
quantitative observations, quantitative interviews, and secondary data. The strengths and
weaknesses of these methods are summarized in Table 6-5 (adapted from multiple sources,
including Johnson & Turner, 2003; McLeod, 2012). As can be seen from Table 6-5, the strength
of quantitative methods resides in standardization. All these methods gather numerical data using
standardized techniques. However, because these methods involve structured, closed-ended
questions, the research outcomes are limited and cannot always represent the actual occurrence of
a specific case.

Surveys are one of the most common methods of data collection in quantitative research. When
using this method, researchers typically develop a self-report data collection instrument that is
filled out by participants (Johnson & Turner, 2003). Quantitative surveys permit the collection of
data from large numbers of people in standardized ways, thus enabling a comparison across
different settings (e.g., communities, countries, time periods) (Hentschel, 1998). The response
categories often take the form of rating scales (e.g., Likert scale), rankings, semantic differentials,
and checklists (Johnson & Turner, 2003). Johnson and Christensen (2019) proposed 15 principles
of questionnaire construction:

1. Make sure that the questionnaire items match your research objectives.
2. Understand your research participants.
3. Use natural and familiar language.
4. Write items in a clear, simple, and precise way.
5. Do not use "leading" or "loaded" questions.
6. Avoid double-barreled questions.
7. Avoid double negatives.
8. Determine whether an open-ended and a closed-ended question is needed.
9. Use mutually exclusive and exhaustive response categories for closed-ended questions.
10. Consider the different types or response categories available for closed-ended questions.
11. Use multiple items to measure abstract constructs.
12. Consider using multiple methods when measuring abstract constructs.
13. Use caution if you reverse the wording in some of the items to prevent response sets in

    multi-item scales.
14. Develop a questionnaire that is properly organized and easy for the participants to use.
15. Always pilot-test your questionnaire.

Experiments refer to a research approach in which variables are manipulated and their effects on
other variables are observed (Campbell & Stanley, 1963). The two most common types of
experiments in the social sciences are laboratory experiments and field experiments. A laboratory
experiment is commonly used in psychology; it allows tight control of decision environments. The
environment created in a laboratory setting is artificial. That is, laboratory experiments allow
observation in a situation that has been designed and created by investigators rather than one that
occurs in nature (Webster & Sell, 2014). From a methodology perspective, the major benefit of
laboratory experiments is its potential for high internal validity (demonstration of causality)
(McGrath et al., 1982). This is because researchers are able to control the level of an independent
variable before measuring the level of a dependent variable (Webster & Sell, 2014).

In contrast, field experiments take place in naturally occurring environments rather than in a
laboratory. Experimenters still manipulate the independent variables but in a real-life setting. Field
experiments attempt to simulate, as closely as possible, the conditions under which a causal
process occurs to enhance the external validity or generalizability of experimental findings (Gerber
& Green, 2008, 2012). Field experiments can be differentiated into three types: (1) an artefactual
experiment; (2) a framed field experiment; and (3) a natural field experiment (Harrison & List,
2004). In an artefactual experiment, experimenters use nonstandard subject pools (i.e., actual field
subjects) instead of using a standard subject pool (i.e., using a student sample). A framed field
experiment is the same as an artefactual field experiment, but the research experiment is framed
in the field context of the commodity, tasks, or information set of the subjects (List, 2011). Lastly,
a natural field experiment is the same as a framed field experiment, but the experiment takes place
in the environment where subjects naturally undertake their experimental tasks and where the
subjects do not know that they are in an experiment (Harrison & List, 2004). In natural
experiments, participants are exposed to experimental and control conditions that are determined
by nature or by factors outside the control of researchers (Craig et al., 2017). Natural experiments
are often used to study situations in which controlled experimentation is not possible--e.g., when
an exposure of interest (intervention/manipulation)cannot be practically or ethically assigned to
participants (Messer, 2008). Natural experiments are quasi-experiment in nature--although
independent variables are manipulated, participants are not randomly assigned to conditions (Cook
& Campbell, 1979). Therefore, the assumptions and analytical techniques applied to experimental
designs are not valid for them (Dunning, 2012). Given the absence of random assignment in a
natural experiment, researchers need to make sure the pre-conditions of control and treatment
groups are comparable by providing convincing empirical evidence for the same (Murnane &
Willett, 2011).

The popularity and convenience of online transactions and interactions have created both the need
and opportunity for online experiments for all types of experiments discussed above (Dandurand
et al., 2008; Reips, 2002). Although the move to online experiments may lead to new threats to
validity (e.g., loss of control over subjects and environments, loss of ability to collect verbal
protocols), this practice comes with benefits including: (1) reducing the cost and the amount of
time spent managing the experiment; (2) increasing the uniformity of the procedure across
participants; (3) maintaining ethical standards by making the experiment publicly available for
criticism; (4) increasing external validity by recruiting more diverse samples; (5) leveraging online
trace data to understand mechanisms for treatment effects; (6) leveraging large sample sizes to
uncover heterogenous treatment effects; and (7) being able to capitalize on naturally occurring

120 | Data Collection Strategies
events because of the availability of trace data (Dandurand et al., 2008; Karahanna et al., 2018;
Reips, 2002).

An example of online experiments is Aiken and Boush (2006). They conducted an online
experiment to study the effectiveness of Internet marketers' various attempts to develop customer
trust through web signals. They manipulated three web site trust signals (i.e., trustmarks, objective-
source ratings, and implied investment in advertising) and created eight experimental web sites
(i.e., one web site with all three signals, three web sites with combinations of two signals, three
web sites with one signal, and one web site with no signal). They sent emails with an invitation
letter to participants that pointed them to the study's web site. If participants agreed to participate,
they logged on, read through a procedural description and greeting, followed instructions, and then
clicked through to the experimental stimuli. They were randomly assigned to view one of the eight
possible websites and answered the same survey questions after exposure. Although the authors
were not able to control the study environment conditions (e.g., type of devices participants used
in the study), they were able to leverage online trace data to rule out alternative causal mechanisms.

Quantitative observations involve using standardized observational procedures in order to obtain
reliable research data (Johnson & Christensen, 2019). This technique is similar to qualitative
observations. However, it usually results in quantitative data (e.g., counts, frequencies,
percentages). Different events that may be of interest in quantitative observation include observing
nonverbal behaviors (e.g., body movement, eye contacts), observing spatial behavior (e.g., the
distance between people and objects), and observing extralinguistic behaviors (e.g., speech rate
and volume) (Johnson & Christensen, 2019).

The goal of a quantitative interview is to standardize what is presented to interviewees (Johnson
& Christensen, 2019). In a quantitative interview, interviewers simply read a series of
closed-ended questions to the respondents and record the answer (Johnson & Turner, 2003). The
key idea is to expose each participant to the same stimulus so that the results will be comparable
(Johnson & Christensen, 2019). Any probes and/or responses to interview questions are
pre-planned. The only questions to which interviewers can respond are clarification questions to
closed-ended questions being asked (e.g., what do you mean by `group dynamic'?) (Johnson &
Turner, 2003).

Another source of data in quantitative research is secondary data. These data were originally
collected by other researchers or external parties, often for a different purpose. For example,
companies might publish their financial report every year to meet legal requirements. Researchers
can use these publicly available, quantitative data in their research.

6.4.3. Mixed-Methods Data Collection Procedures
Having discussed the most common qualitative and quantitative data collection methods, we now
turn to specific mixed-methods data collection procedures. We propose four key ideas for
collecting data using a mixed-methods approach:

                                                                                                                           Chapter 6 | 121
1. The research questions and purposes of mixed-methods research should drive the selection of
    data collection techniques. Like all research, the goal of data collection in mixed-methods
    research is to develop answers to research questions (Creswell & Plano Clark, 2018; Teddlie
    & Yu, 2007). Thus, researchers should determine whether the techniques and types of data
    they are collecting will help answer the research questions. For example, if the research
    objective is to study properties of some natural setting (e.g., characteristics of team-based
    empowerment initiative within the Veteran Health Administration), a combination of field
    experiments, surveys, or interviews is suitable, whereas the use of a laboratory experiment or
    secondary data is less suitable.

2. Researchers should follow the fundamental principle of mixed-methods research: "methods
    should be mixed in a way that has complementary strengths and nonoverlapping weaknesses"
    (Johnson & Turner, 2003, p. 299). Researchers can use Tables 6-4 and 6-5 as references when
    comparing the strengths and weaknesses of different qualitative and quantitative methods.

3. Researchers should link the sampling strategy with the data collection strategies. As we
    mentioned earlier, although qualitative data collection techniques are typically associated with
    non-purposive sampling and quantitative data collection techniques are associated with
    purposive sampling, both qualitative and quantitative data collection techniques can use either
    type of sampling strategy. Although researchers can use one type of sampling strategy, we
    encourage them to use both, especially if the design is a sequential equal status design in which
    both types of methods are given equal weight (Kemper et al., 2003). Using a combination of
    purposive and non-purposive sampling procedures will help researchers offset the limitations
    of any one sampling technique.

4. Given that in a mixed-methods research study, researchers should collect both qualitative and
    quantitative data, they need to be familiar with the array of qualitative and quantitative data
    collection methods discussed earlier. A mistake that novice mixed-methods researchers tend
    to make is using the research paradigm with which they are familiar in all stages of data
    collection. For example, they use the same principles of questionnaire construction to develop
    interview protocols. When it comes to collecting data in mixed-methods research, we
    encourage researchers to learn how to make Gestalt switches from a qualitative lens to a
    quantitative lens to go back-and-forth. If a single researcher is not competent or an expert at
    this, assembling a heterogeneous team of researchers whose primary paradigms are different
    is a potential solution (Onwuegbuzie et al., 2011).

These four principles should guide researchers in selecting the most suitable data collection
techniques for their mixed-methods study. Next, we propose a data collection matrix consisting of
qualitative and quantitative data collection techniques.

6.4.4. Mixed-Methods Data Collection Matrix
Thirty alternative data collection designs for mixed-methods research are listed in Table 6-6. This
table is formed by integrating five different approaches to qualitative data collection and six
different approaches to quantitative data collection previously discussed. According to Kemper et
al. (2003), the mixing can take place in two different forms: intramethod mixing and intermethod
mixing. Intramethod mixing occurs when a concurrent or sequential use of a single method
includes both qualitative and quantitative components. For example, a concurrent use of open- and
closed-ended items on a single questionnaire or on different questionnaires but in the same
research study. Types 1, 19, 22, and 30 are categorized as intramethod mixing. In contrast,
intermethod mixing occurs when a mixed-methods research study includes both qualitative and

122 | Data Collection Strategies
quantitative components from different approaches--for example, a sequential use of quantitative
surveys and open-ended interviews in the same research study.

Researchers should also take into account the general properties of mixed-methods research,
discussed in Chapter 5, when they make a decision about their data collection procedure. The
procedure needs to consider the research questions, the purposes of mixed-methods research, the
timing of the study, and the emphasis placed on the quantitative and qualitative data (Creswell &
Plano Clark, 2018). As the purpose of mixed-methods research plays a significant role in guiding
the design decisions, we approach the data collection strategies from the perspective of the mixed-
methods purpose. Tables 6-7 and 6-8 summarize our recommendations for mixed-methods data
collection procedures based on the study purpose.

                                                                   Chapter 6 | 123

                                  on the duration for the qualitative and quantitative data collection.

                                  and (13)), researchers should consider using parallel samples

                                  because any verbal interactions (unrelated to the study protocols)

                                  during an experimental study may impose threats to validity.

                  · It is recommended that researchers adopt parallel samples when

                                  they use intermethod data collection strategies (2), (3), (4), (9),

                                  (14), (16), (17), (18), (21), (23), and (24) to minimize participant-

                                  related biases. However, identical sampling can also be used if

                                  researchers have limited resources. In that case, the study should be

                                  designed carefully to ensure participants' responses collected using

                                  one method does not affect their responses collected using a

                                  different method.

                  · If the study uses an equal status design, consider using intermethod

                                  data collection strategies (e.g., questionnaires for the quantitative

                                  strand and interviews for the qualitative strand) to ensure the

                                  strengths of each method are able to shed light on different aspects

                                  of the phenomenon under study.

As discussed in Chapter 5, mixed-methods studies with corroboration, and [some studies with]
diversity, complementarity, and [some studies with] completeness purposes are best achieved
using a concurrent design. Several considerations that need to be taken into account when
researchers use this design include the selection of participants, the sample size, and the priority
of each study strand. Researchers should start with research questions (e.g., whether the qualitative
and quantitative approaches address the same research questions, the relationship between the
qualitative and quantitative research questions) and the purposes of mixed-methods research.
Based on these preliminary decisions, researchers determine the data collection strategies that
follow the general design strategies. With regard to the participants, Creswell and Plano Clark
(2018) suggested two options for selecting individuals to participate in the study: the samples can
include different or the same individuals. One can use different individuals if the goal is to compare
behaviors and characteristics of two cases or subgroups as one does in a study with a diversity
purpose. For example, Chang (2006) investigated the differences between IT and general
management regarding the perceived importance of business functions and perceived
implementation success factors and benefits. In this study, it was necessary to gather data from
two different samples. One can also use the same individuals if intramethod mixing strategies are
used. For example, Bhattacherjee and Premkumar (2004) used the same questionnaire to gather

                                                                                                                           Chapter 6 | 125
both qualitative and quantitative data in their study. Qualitative data analysis of respondents'
comments that were gathered at the same time as the quantitative data using questionnaires helped
validate the findings from the quantitative study. We also suggest researchers use intermethod
mixing strategies (e.g., questionnaires for the quantitative strand and interviews for the qualitative
strand) in a concurrent, equal status design to ensure the methods used in data collection do not
contain overlapping weaknesses. Further, one should determine a sampling strategy for each
approach and, based on that strategy, estimate the sample size. We encourage researchers to use
both purposive and non-purposive sampling (e.g., using purposive sampling for the qualitative
approach and using non-purposive sampling for the quantitative approach or vice versa) in the
same study or the same research program. By doing so, researchers may optimize the strengths
associated with each sampling technique.
For example, Stewart et al. (2017) used type (7) design (i.e., a combination of field experiment
and open-ended interviews). This type of design is illustrated in Figure 6-2. In the quantitative
study, they adopted a longitudinal quasi-experimental design. They selected all providers located
in one of 21 geographical divisions to participate in the study. They had a sample of 224 providers
with data collected during pre- and post-intervention stages of a team-based empowerment
intervention. In the qualitative study, they interviewed several team members in the same
geographical division as their quantitative sample. Interviews, each averaging 50 minutes, were
conducted by the same interviewer to minimize confounding. They also conducted interviews prior
to the quantitative analysis. They used a semi-structured interview format focused broadly on
identifying facilitators and barriers associated with the implementation of team-based
empowerment.

Mixed-methods studies with compensation, and [some studies with] diversity, developmental,
[some studies with] completeness, and expansion purposes are best achieved using a sequential
design. Studies with these purposes typically address different research questions in each strand of
the study. One should determine the order of data collection based on the research questions. For

example, if the goal is to use the first strand of the study to identify the important constructs and
develop testable hypotheses, then a qualitative data collection, followed by a quantitative data
collection will be suitable for the study. We encourage researchers to use methods that do not have
overlapping weaknesses to offset weaknesses across methods. For example, the use of both
qualitative and quantitative surveys might prevent researchers from asking follow-up questions.
Thus, researchers may not want to use both methods in both strands. We also suggest researchers
use different sampling strategies in both strands of the study to ensure a mixed-methods research
approach can generate different types of generalizability. Lastly, if each strand of the study is given
equal weight, we suggest researchers use intermethod mixing strategies to avoid overlapping
weaknesses that are likely to exist in intramethod mixing strategies, as previously explained.

In Koh et al. (2004), qualitative data were gathered using in-depth interviews, and quantitative
data were gathered using a field study survey (i.e., intermethod mixing strategies). We show their
data collection procedure in Figure 6-3. The qualitative and quantitative strands had different
participants. They sought to identify both customer and supplier obligations that were critical to
success in the first strand of the study. To achieve this goal, they used qualitative interviews.
During the interviews, they employed a critical incident technique and asked interviewees to
identify an outsourcing project that was currently underway or had been recently completed. They
probed interviewees to describe critical incidents illustrating situations where meeting these
obligations was particularly challenging and to discuss their obligations to the other contractual
party in relation to the project. To assess the impact of fulling these obligations on success, they
collected data using a survey. They surveyed 370 managers (i.e., 179 customer project managers
and 191 supplier project managers). Whereas some of the instruments they used in the survey were
adapted from prior research, they also developed a scale for their key construct (i.e., psychological
contract obligations). They crafted a set of items for each obligation, and these items were based
on the content analysis of their qualitative data. These items were then pilot-tested with three senior
project managers. The actual data collection was conducted in two rounds. In the first round,
invitation letters were sent to members of the IT Management Association (ITMA) and the
Singapore IT Federation (SITF). In the second round, the authors sent out surveys to 262 customer
project managers from the 90 customer organizations, and 341 suppliers project managers from 68
supplier organizations. The authors examined all returned questionnaires for completeness and
contacted respondents by phone to obtain any missing information.

                                            Summary

· Sampling issues in qualitative research focus on discovering the scope and the nature of the
    system to be sampled, whereas quantitative research focuses on determining how many cases

                                             Chapter 6 | 129
    or observations are needed to reliably represent the whole system and to minimize falsely
    identifying or missing existing relationships among factors.
· Two important aspects of sampling decisions are sample size and sampling schema.
· In mixed-methods research, researchers must make sampling schema and sample size
    decisions for both the qualitative and quantitative strands of the study.
· Five major probability sampling schemes are simple random sampling, systematic random
    sampling, stratified random sampling, cluster random sampling, and multistage random
    sampling.
· Ten major non-probability sampling schemes are modal instance sampling, expert sampling,
    heterogeneity sampling, homogeneous sampling, snowball sampling, random purposeful
    sampling, stratified purposeful sampling, criterion sampling, critical case sampling, and quota
    sampling.
· Four types of sampling strategies for mixed-methods research are basic sampling, sequential
    sampling, concurrent sampling, and multilevel sampling.
· The selection of sampling designs determines the types of inferences and generalizations that
    can be generated from a study.
· The most common sources of qualitative data are qualitative surveys, open-ended interviews,
    focus groups, observation, and secondary data (e.g., personal and official documents, visual
    data, visual and audio data, and archival data).
· The most common types of quantitative data collection strategies are quantitative surveys,
    experiments, quantitative observations, quantitative interviews, and secondary data.
· In making decisions on data collection strategies, researchers should follow the fundamental
    principle of mixed-methods research: "methods should be mixed in a way that has
    complementary strengths and nonoverlapping weaknesses" (Johnson & Turner, 2003, p. 299).

                 QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE
                     DATA ANALYSIS STRATEGIES

After researchers complete data collection (Chapter 6), the next step is to analyze the data. Given
that the research questions and purpose(s) are the foundations of mixed-methods research,
mixed-methods data analysis strategies should be used to address the research questions and
achieve the purpose(s) set forth in conducting mixed-methods research, although, as noted in
Chapter 4, there may be emergent purposes. Ideally, data analysis in mixed-methods research
involves separately analyzing the qualitative and quantitative data using qualitative and
quantitative data analysis techniques, respectively, and/or combining both types of data using
approaches that mix or integrate the qualitative and quantitative data to yield integrated results
(Creswell & Plano Clark, 2018). In this chapter, we discuss the most common techniques used to
analyze qualitative and quantitative data. Because it is not our goal to cover all possible data
analysis strategies, we focus primarily on the general discussion and procedures for how to analyze
data in qualitative and quantitative research.

We underscore that this chapter is not meant to substitute for a strong education in qualitative and
quantitative data analyses. The interested reader is referred to a variety of sources on these
topics--some of these are discussed throughout this chapter. In the next chapter (Chapter 8), we
will discuss the procedures for selecting the most appropriate data analysis techniques for
mixed-methods research.

                     7.1. Data Analysis in Qualitative Research

Qualitative data analysis is "the classification and interpretation of linguistic (or visual) material
to make statements about implicit and explicit dimensions and structures of meaning-making in
the material and what is represented in it" (Flick, 2014, p. 5). Qualitative data analysis can support
either a confirmatory or exploratory goal. It can be directed by a conceptual framework,
suggesting, in part, a deductive process, or driven more by the data, suggesting an inductive
process (Mihas, 2019). Thus, the analysis of qualitative data can have several objectives, including
to describe a phenomenon in some, or greater, detail; to compare several cases based on what they
have in common or on the differences between them; and/or to develop a theory of the phenomenon
under study from the analysis of empirical material (Flick, 2014).

There are a number of approaches to collecting and analyzing qualitative data. Some of the
best-known approaches are: case study (Yin, 2003, 2006), grounded theory (Corbin & Strauss,
1990; Glaser & Strauss, 1967), direct and pragmatic (Miles et al., 2020), narrative analysis
(Bamberg, 2012), content analysis (Krippendorff, 1980; Mayring, 2004; Weber, 1990),
classification (Bailey, 1994; Doty & Glick, 1994; Nickerson et al., 2012), event analysis (Earl et
al., 2004; Happ et al., 2004; Olzak, 1989), metaphorical analysis (Schmitt, 2005), hermeneutic
analysis (Bergman, 2010; Lee, 1994), discourse analysis (Brown & Yule, 1983; Gee, 2010), and
phenomenology/heuristic analysis (Sadala & Adorno, 2002; Sanders, 1982; Starks & Trinidad,
2007). A summary of these approaches is shown in Table 7-1. Although each of these techniques
are different from one another, they have the same orientation--focusing on how data should be
organized and coded so that the key issues emerging from the dataset can be easily interpreted.

                                of these strategies can be used when practicing five

                                specific techniques for analyzing case studies: (1) pattern

                                matching (i.e., to compare an empirical pattern to a

                                predicted one); (2) explanation building (i.e., to stipulate a

                                presumed set of causal relationships about the

                                phenomenon under study); (3) time-series analysis (i.e., to

                                use an essential feature to identify the specific indicator(s)

                                to be traced over time); (4) logic model (i.e., to match

                                empirically observed events to theoretically predicted

                                events); and (5) cross-case synthesis (i.e., to compare two

                                or more cases to identify patterns, similarities, and

                                differences).

             Corbin and In the grounded theory approach, data collection and

             Strauss            analysis are interrelated processes. Like many other

             (1990);            qualitative techniques, coding is a crucial process in

             Glaser and grounded theory. Here, there are three basic types of

             Strauss            coding, per Corbin and Strauss (1990): (1) open coding--

             (1967)             "the interpretive process by which data are broken down

                                analytically" (p. 12); (2) axial coding--"categories are

                                related to their subcategories, and the relationships are

                                tested against data" (p. 13); and (3) selective coding--"the

                                process by which all categories are unified around a `core'

                                category, and categories that need further explication are

                                filled-in with descriptive detail" (p. 14).

             Miles et al. In the direct and pragmatic approach, the analysis consists

             (2020)             of three activities: (1) data reduction; (2) data display; and

                                (3) conclusion drawing/verification. In this approach,

                                analysis can take place at three different phases/points:

                                · analysis during data collection to allow researchers to

                                cycle back and forth between thinking about the

                                existing data and generating strategies for collecting

                                new data;

                                · within-site analysis by optimizing the use of different

                                displays (e.g., narrative text, matrix); and

                                · cross-site analysis to increase explanatory power and

                                generalizability.

Narrative         Bamberg       There are three different approaches in analyzing narrative
analysis          (2012)        data: (1) analytical or linguistic orientation (i.e., the focus
                                of analysis is on the linear sequence of clauses--the way

                  (1980);       conceptual orientation (i.e., focuses on the way events are

                  (1990)        on the linguistic means, but also on expression and

                  Bailey,       Content analysis commonly consists of six steps: (1)
Metaphorical      (1994);       design--researchers define the context of their study; (2)
analysis          Nickerson et  unitizing--defining and identifying the unit of analysis; (3)
                  al. (2012)    sampling--determining sampling strategies; (4) coding--
                                classifying units in terms of categories of the analytical
                  Earl et al.   constructs chosen; (5) drawing inferences; and (6)
                  (2004);       validation. The coding step can be conducted either
                  Happ et al.   manually (by trained human coders) or using software.
                  (2004);       In developing typologies, researchers start with a
                  Olzak (1989)  conceptual or theoretical foundation and then derive the
                                typological structure through deduction (Bailey, 1994). In
                  Schmitt       developing taxonomies, researchers first identify the meta-
                  (2005)        characteristics. Next, the conditions (i.e., subjective and
                                objective) that end the process need to be determined.
                                After these steps, researchers can begin with either an
                                empirical approach or a conceptual approach (Nickerson et
                                al., 2012).
                                Event analysis is conducted using four different designs:
                                (1) cross-sectional--record occurrences of events in one
                                period for multiple units; (2) time series--record
                                occurrences of events by period for a single unit; (3)
                                panel--record occurrences for multiple units in two or
                                more periods; and (4) event history--record the exact
                                timing and sequence of events (Olzak, 1989, p. 130).
                                A metaphor is used to describe the findings and the
                                research process. A metaphor is determined when: (a) a
                                word or phrase can be understood beyond the literal
                                meaning in context of what is being said; and (b) the literal
                                meaning stems from an area of physical or cultural
                                experience (i.e., source area); and (c) it can be transferred
                                to a second, often abstract, area (i.e., target area) (Schmitt,
                                2005).

                                experience; (2) phenomenological reduction--a step to

                                phenomenological interpretation--in this step, researchers
                                construct meanings from the text using hermeneutic
                                procedures (Sadala & Adorno, 2002).

7.1.1. Case Study
According to Yin (2003), in analyzing case study evidence, researchers should (1) rely on
theoretical propositions; (2) setting up a framework based on rival explanations; and (3)
developing case descriptions. The propositions shape a researcher's data collection plan and,
therefore, will give priority to the relevant analysis strategies. When a case study includes specific
propositions, it increases the likelihood that researchers will be able to place limits on the scope of
the study and increase the feasibility of completing the project (Baxter & Jack, 2008). By defining
and testing rival explanations, researchers can eliminate other possible explanations and be more
confident in their findings. Lastly, developing case descriptions can serve as an alternative strategy
when researchers have difficulty in making either of the other two approaches work (Yin, 2003).

Yin (2003) described five specific analysis techniques that can be used in analyzing data from case
studies. These are: (1) pattern matching--researchers compare an empirical pattern with a
predicted one, and if the patterns coincide, the results can help a case study to strengthen its internal
validity; (2) explanation building--a process of refining a set of ideas to eliminate other plausible
or rival explanations; (3) time-series analysis--to show the occurrence of events in a chronological
order; (4) logic model--a similar technique to pattern matching though the events are staged in
repeated cause-effect-cause-effect patterns, whereby a dependent variable at an earlier stage
becomes the independent variable for the next stage; and (5) cross-case analysis--a technique
used to compare multiple case studies. Whereas the first four techniques can be used both in single
or multiple study designs, the last technique, due to its nature, can only be used in a multiple case
study design. In a multiple case study design, it is helpful to analyze data relating to the individual

138 | Data Analysis Strategies
component cases first and then make comparisons across cases (Crowe et al., 2011). In analyzing
case study data, researchers must ensure the data converge in an attempt to understand the overall
case, not the various components of the case, or the contributing factors that influence the case
(Baxter & Jack, 2008).

7.1.2. Grounded Theory
Data for a grounded theory study can come from various sources (e.g., books, government
documents, interviews, letters, newspapers, video tapes) (Corbin & Strauss, 1990). Each of these
sources can be coded in the same way as interviews and observations are (Glaser & Strauss, 1967).
Researchers will use the typical ideas/approaches suggested for the interviews and fieldwork to
assure credibility of respondents and to avoid biasing their responses and observations (Corbin &
Strauss, 1990; Guba, 1981). According to Corbin and Strauss (1990), in grounded theory, the
analysis begins as soon as the first bit of data is collected. The analysis is necessary from the start
because it is used to direct the next interview and observations. Every concept brought into the
study or discovered in the research process needs to be tested to earn its way to the theory by
repeatedly being present in the dataset in one form or another (Corbin & Strauss, 1990).

Corbin and Strauss (1990) also note that "concepts that pertain to the same phenomenon may be
grouped to form categories. . . Categories are the `cornerstones' of a developing theory. They
provide the means by which a theory can be integrated" (p. 7). Further, data must be examined for
regularities and for an understanding of where the regularity is not apparent. As the data are
analyzed and coded, ideas and potential insights will begin to develop that are then recorded in
theoretical memos; "it is the data that develops theoretical sensitivity" (Heath & Cowley, 2004, p.
144). According to this technique, ideas generated must be verified by all data and categories must
be constantly refitted (Heath & Cowley, 2004).

There are three types of basic coding processes in grounded theory research: (1) open coding; (2)
axial coding; and (3) selective coding (Corbin & Strauss, 1990). Open coding is "the interpretive
process by which data are broken down analytically" (p. 12). The purpose of this coding is to give
researchers insights by breaking through standard ways of thinking about or interpreting
phenomena reflected in the data. In axial coding, categories are related to their subcategories, and
the relationships are tested against data. Lastly, in the selective coding process, all categories are
unified around a "core" category, and categories that need further explication are filled-in with
more detailed descriptions.

7.1.3. Direct and Pragmatic Approach
Data analysis in qualitative research consists of three steps: (1) data consolidation; (2) data display;
and (3) conclusion drawing/verification (see also Miles et al., 2020). The first step is data
consolidation--i.e., "the process of selecting, focusing, simplifying, abstracting, and transforming
the `raw' data that appear in the full corpus (body) of written-up field notes, interview transcripts,
documents, and other empirical materials " (Miles et al., 2020, p. 8). Data consolidation takes place
throughout the research process of conducting qualitative research. As Glaser and Strauss (1965)
noted, "in qualitative work, just as there is no clear-cut line between data collection and analysis .
. . there is no sharp division between implicit coding and either data collection and data analysis.
There tends to be a continual blurring and intertwining of all three operations from the beginning
of the investigation until its near end" (p. 6). Anticipatory data consolidation takes place when
researchers decide which conceptual framework, which sites, which research questions, and which

                                                                                                                           Chapter 7 | 139
data collection approaches to choose. As data collection proceeds, there are further episodes of
data consolidation (e.g., doing summaries, coding, making clusters, writing memos), and this
process continues after fieldwork, until a final report is complete (Miles et al., 2020; Miles &
Huberman, 1984).

Miles et al. (2020) suggested the following strategies to analyze data from multiple cases (the
interested reader is referred to the cited references for more information):

· Replication strategy--i.e., a theoretical framework is used to study one case in depth and then
    successive cases are examined to see whether the pattern found matches that in previous cases.

· Multiple exemplar--i.e., after deconstructing prior conceptions of a particular phenomenon,
    researchers collect multiple instances (cases) and then "bracket" them, inspecting them
    carefully for essential elements or components.

· Forming types or families--e.g., typology, taxonomy.

The second step is data display. Data display is a process of organizing information that enables
researchers to draw conclusions and take actions (Miles et al., 2020). There are two ways of
displaying qualitative data analysis results: textual and diagrammatic displays. Text and diagrams
(pictures) together communicate more than either could alone (Miles et al., 2020). Although text
is a useful vehicle for presenting and explaining information, a picture, as the old adage goes, is
worth a thousand words and can thus portray information more concisely to illustrate details
provided in longer blocks of text (Verdinelli & Scagnoli, 2013). When researchers deal with
complex and voluminous data, diagrams can help them disentangle the threads of data analysis
and present results in an interactive form (Dey, 1993). By trying to construct diagrams, researchers
can force themselves to clarify the main points in their analysis and how they are related (Dey,
1993).

The third step is conclusion drawing or verification. Researchers note regularities, explain patterns,
test causal flows, and draw propositions or conclusions (Miles et al., 2020). These conclusions are
also verified, tested for their plausibility, robustness, sturdiness, and validity (Miles et al., 2020).

7.1.4. Narrative Analysis
Narrative analysis attempts to explain or normalize what has occurred; it lays out the reasons why
things are the way they are or have become the way they are (Bamberg, 2012). This approach is
typically used to analyze autobiographical data (i.e., about non-shared, personal experience, single
past events) (Georgakopoulou, 2007). There are three common approaches used to analyze
narrative data.

The first approach views text as a linguistic structure (Bamberg, 2012). According to this view, a
narrative consists of at least two narrative event clauses. This approach assumes that events do not
happen in the world. The flow of continuously changing time needs to be stopped and packaged
into bounded units--events and event sequences. This is accomplished by the use of particular
verb-type predicates in conjunction with the kinds of temporal marking that particular languages
have at their disposal (Bamberg, 2012).

The second approach views text as a cognitive structure (i.e., plots, themes, and coherence).
According to this view, to describe the units that emerge in the course of narrative cohesion

140 | Data Analysis Strategies
building, the emerging units are not just the linguistic elements per se. They typically consist of
"an (optional) abstract, followed by an orientation (or setting or exposition), followed by the
complication (also called problem or crisis), maybe an action or action orientation toward a
resolution, resulting in the resolution (or occasionally failure), which then is ultimately followed
by a coda (or closure)" (Bamberg, 2012, p. 90). Like the linguistic approach, the cognitive
approach focuses on monologic text. The purpose of the story is to encode information, and the
way the information is structured is relevant for the effect of the story on the audience, as
eloquently noted by Bamberg (2012): "linguistic and conceptual structures of the story are
functions in the service of the theme, the overall plot, and the content" (p. 91).

The third approach is called an interactive-performance approach. It goes beyond the text and is
intended to address such questions as why this story takes place now (Bamberg, 2012). Unlike the
linguistic and cognitive approaches, this approach focuses on situating the narratives within a
dialog (Bamberg, 2012). According to this third performance type approach, linguistic and
cognitive structuring is a part of what speakers accomplish with their narratives. This approach
views a participant as an actor in cultural performances within their daily lives (Schechner, 2002).
Thus, through an interactive-performance approach, researchers are afforded a more intimate
understanding of culture through an ethnographic performance and "`travels' into the life-world
of the subject" (Madison, 2005, p. 478).

7.1.5. Content Analysis
Content analysis is "a research method that uses a set of procedures to make valid inferences from
text" (Weber, 1990, p. 9). It seeks to analyze data within a specific context in view of the meaning
someone attributes to them (Krippendorff, 1989). The sources for content analysis can be any kind
of communication (e.g., discourses, documents, protocols of observations, transcripts of
interviews, video tapes) (Krippendorff, 1989; Mayring, 2004). Compared to other qualitative data
analysis techniques, content analysis has several advantages including that it operates directly on
text or transcripts of human communications; it uses both qualitative and quantitative operations
on text; it documents various kinds of events that exist over a long period of time; and it usually
yields unobtrusive measures in which neither the sender nor the receiver of the message is aware
that it is being analyzed (Weber, 1990).

Content analysis commonly consists of six steps: (1) defining the context of the study; (2) defining
and identifying the unit of analysis; (3) determining sampling strategies; (4) classifying units in
terms of categories of the analytical constructs chosen; (5) drawing inferences; and (6) validating
the results (Krippendorff, 1989). The two most common approaches to coding in content analysis
are inductive category development and deductive category application (Mayring, 2000). In
inductive category development, researchers inductively formulate new categories from the
material. These categories are tentative and revised throughout the coding process until the key
categories emerge. In deductive category development, researchers begin by defining the key
categories or criteria derived from the theoretical background and following these criteria; the
material is coded, and categories are revised.

7.1.6. Classification: Typology and Taxonomy
Classification is a fundamental mechanism for organizing knowledge (Wand et al., 1995).
Classification involves the ordering of cases in terms of their similarity and can be broken down
into two essential approaches: typology and taxonomy (Bailey, 1994). A typology is defined as

                                                                                                                           Chapter 7 | 141
"systematic classifications of types of social phenomenon as they fall within a particular category"
(Layder, 1998, p. 73). In contrast, a taxonomy refers to the "classification systems that categorize
phenomena into mutually exclusive and exhaustive sets with a series of discrete decision rules"
(Doty & Glick, 1994, p. 232). Unlike typologies, taxonomies provide decision rules for classifying
objects. Although Bailey (1994) argued that the basic difference between a typology and taxonomy
is that a typology is primarily conceptual, whereas a taxonomy is generally empirical, researchers
typically use taxonomy for systems of grouping that are derived conceptually and empirically,
making it an appropriate qualitative data analysis method in certain research situations (Nickerson
et al., 2012). Next, we discuss each of the classification methods in detail.

The classification of data in the typology approach is based on the theoretically derived, and more
or less intuitively categorized, qualities of observed phenomena (Rich, 1992). Typologies
generally define conceptually "ideal types," each one presenting a unique combination of
individual attributes or dimensions that constitute a categorical type (Martín-Peña & Díaz-Garrido,
2008). The ideal type is used to examine empirical cases in terms of how much they deviate from
the ideal (Nickerson et al., 2012). In developing typologies, researchers start with a conceptual or
theoretical foundation and then derive the typological structure through deduction. Researchers
may conceive of a single type and then add dimensions until a satisfactorily complete typology is
reached (Bailey, 1994). Alternatively, researchers could conceptualize an extensive typology and
then eliminate certain dimensions in a process called reduction until a sufficiently parsimonious
typology is reached (Bailey, 1994).

Taxonomies provide a structure and an organization to the knowledge of a field, thus enabling
researchers to study the relationships among concepts (Glass & Vessey, 1995). Taxonomies also
help us understand divergence in previous findings (Sabherwal & King, 1995). According to
Nickerson et al. (2012), the development of taxonomies involves "determining the characteristics
of the objects of interest" (p. 343). The choice of such meta-characteristics should be based on the
purpose of the taxonomy. The development of taxonomies also needs to meet ending conditions,
which could be objective and/or subjective. An objective ending condition is that the taxonomy
must satisfy a researcher's definition of a taxonomy, specifically that it consists of a set of
dimensions with mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive characteristics (Nickerson et al.,
2012). In contrast, to meet a subjective ending condition, a researcher must ensure the taxonomy
is concise, robust, comprehensive, extensible, and explanatory. Nickerson et al. noted that the
development of taxonomies involves a combination of both conceptual and empirical strategies in
a single method (see Figure 7-1).

The first step is to identify the meta-characteristics. Next, the conditions (i.e., subjective and
objective) that end the process need to be determined. After these steps, researchers can begin with
either a conceptual approach or an empirical approach. If little data are available but researchers
have significant understanding of the domain, they can then start with the conceptual-to-empirical
approach. However, if researchers have little understanding of the domain but significant data
about the object are available, they should start with the empirical-to-conceptual approach. At the
end of these processes, researchers should check whether the ending conditions are met.

7.1.7. Event Analysis
Event analysis is popular among sociologists who study social movements. Event analysis is a
form of qualitative data collection method that focuses on data collection around a particular event,
activity, or issue occurring with a research participant (Happ et al., 2004). Events are defined as
"nonroutine, collective, and public acts that involve claims on behalf of a larger collective" (Olzak,
1989, p. 124). Qualitative event analysis consists of a detailed description and assessment of events
using a variety of data sources: secondary document review, published listings of events originally
compiled from various newspaper sources, and official archival records (Happ et al., 2004; Olzak,
1989). Event analysis allows diverse forms of collective action to be measured and compared

                                                                                                                           Chapter 7 | 143
because observations are collected in commensurate dimensions (Olzak, 1989). This data analysis
technique is useful in limiting the focus of data collection in complex settings and in obtaining and
managing multiple perspectives about an event while situating the event within appropriate social
and environmental contexts (Happ et al., 2004). Event data also allow for the examination of
multiple types of collective action and facilitate longitudinal research (Earl et al., 2004; Olzak,
1989).

There are four variations of event analysis designs that have been dominant: (1) cross-sectional--
record occurrences of events in one period for multiple units; (2) time series--record occurrences
of events by period for a single unit; (3) panel--record occurrences for multiple units in two or
more periods; and (4) event-history--record the exact timing and sequence of events (Olzak, 1989,
p. 130). A major challenge associated with event analysis is the media bias if the major data source
is newspapers. To correct for this bias, researchers should complement media data with additional
non-media sources, such as records of organizations, public records, or other administrative
archives (Barranco & Wisler, 1999).

7.1.8. Metaphorical Analysis
Metaphorical analysis is a qualitative data analysis technique that focuses on describing everyday
cognitive structures using linguistic models (Schmitt, 2005). This analysis technique was
originally based on Lakoff and Johnson's theory of metaphor (Lakoff & Johnson, 1980).
Metaphors enable the reconstruction of cognitive strategies in action (Schmitt, 2005). In qualitative
research, metaphors can be used to describe the findings and the research process. Because
qualitative research often yields a multitude of heterogeneous pieces of information, metaphors
can be used to reduce this complexity by clearly illustrating the meaning using linguistic models.
In term of the research process, metaphors can be used to give some orientation for the researchers
in their endeavor and its presentation (Schmitt, 2005). According to Schmitt (2005), a metaphor
can be determined when:

· a word or phrase can be understood beyond the literal meaning in context of what is being
    said;

· the literal meaning stems from an area of physical or cultural experience (i.e., source area);
    and

· it can be transferred to a second, often abstract, area (i.e., target area).

For example, when an interviewee says, "today things are already going much better for me," the
abstract "better" is the target area, which extends the meaning of the word "much" that stems from
substance quantification (source area). Here, to be "better" means having "more," cf. the
metaphors of giving and providing (Schmitt, 2005, p. 385).

Metaphorical analysis requires that different people are able to conceptualize the subject being
analyzed differently and the question being researched is targeted at least in part at the various
subjective, group-specific or cultural conceptualizations of the phenomenon being investigated
(Schmitt, 2005). Steinke (2004) proposed four different types of quality criteria to evaluate the
trustworthiness of a metaphor: (1) the reflection on or testing of the limits and range of the results
of a study; (2) the coherence of the theory developed; (3) its relevance for research and practice;
and (4) documentation of a reflective subjectivity.

7.1.9. Hermeneutic Analysis
Hermeneutic analysis is "the study of interpretation, especially the process of coming to
understand a text" (Lee, 1994, p. 147). The guiding assumption of hermeneutic analysis is that the
content and associated meanings of the text may never be identified unequivocally. This is due to
the fact that the text material as a whole can only be understood by studying some of its parts,
while the parts under study can only be understood in relation to the whole. However, the meaning
of the parts does not unequivocally represent the meaning of the whole (Bergman, 2010).
Researchers become part of the hermeneutic circle, moving repeatedly between interpretations of
parts of the text and interpretations of the whole text, representing an emerging understanding of
the phenomenon (Paterson & Higgs, 2005). In addition, all research activities, from
conceptualization to interpretation of the findings, are always linked and must be understood in
relation to their cultural, historical, political, and social contexts (Bergman, 2010).

Five concepts central to hermeneutic analysis are: (1) distanciation--"the separation, in time and
distance, that occurs between a text and its authors, its originally intended audience, and/or its
originating culture and society"; (2) autonomization--"the text's taking on a life of its own, despite
the distanciation"; (3) social construction--the text is a manifestation of a socially constructed
reality; (4) appropriation--"`to make one's own what was initially alien' as it `actualises' the
meaning of the text for the present reader"; and (5) enactment--a meaning which is constituted by
the actions independent of human actors (Lee, 1994, pp. 149-151).

Hermeneutic analysis can be carried out in three simple steps (Bergman, 2010). First, researchers
conduct an initial content analysis, in alignment with the hermeneutic limits, to identify themes,
concepts, components, identities, agents, interactions, and structures relevant to the research
question. In the second step, researchers conduct dimensional analysis of themes, narrative
components, concepts, etc. derived from the previous step. The goal of this step is to
decontextualize the elements identified in the previous step to examine the latent structure and
patterns among them. After researchers complete this step, they conduct a second
recontextualization. This step is intended to assist in the interpretation of the results from the
dimensional analysis by associating the findings with the context.

7.1.10. Discourse Analysis
Discourse analysis is a technique that focuses on the use of language within a social context
(Salkind, 2010). Discourse analysis encompasses a broad range of theories, topics, and analytic
approaches for explaining language in use, whether in a conversation or in text (Shaw & Bailey,
2009). There are many different approaches to discourse analysis. Some of them look only at the
"content" of the language being used, the themes being discussed in the conversation or an article,
or the structure of language and how this structure functions to make meanings in specific contexts
(Gee, 2010). In doing discourse analysis, researchers view the data as the record of a dynamic
process in which language is used as an instrument of communication in the context of a
speaker/writer to express meanings and achieve intentions (discourse) (Brown & Yule, 1983).

In discourse analysis, researchers can build or construct things through language. There are seven
things or seven areas of reality that can be built using discourse analysis: (1) significance; (2)
practices (activities); (3) identities; (4) relationships; (5) politics; (6) connections; and (7) sign
systems and knowledge (Gee, 2010). Some tools that researchers can use to analyze the working
of these building tasks in specific instances of language-in-use include (Gee, 2010):

                                                                                                                           Chapter 7 | 145
· Social languages--using different styles or varieties of languages for different purposes.
· Discourses--combining and integrating language, actions, interactions, ways of thinking, and

    using various tools and objects to enact a particular sort of socially recognizable identity.
· Conversations--using conversations as a tool to identify themes, debates, or motifs to interpret

    language within a social group.
· Intertextuality--relying on multiple sources (e.g., spoken words, written text) to identify

    meanings.

An example of discourse analysis is a study by Munir and Phillips (2005). This study examined
how the meanings and uses of new technologies were discursively constructed. Specifically, they
examined how Kodak managed to transform photography from a highly specialized activity to one
that became an integrated part of everyday life. Discourse analysis provided them with a useful
theoretical framework to explore how the socially constructed ideas and objects that constitute a
social world are created and maintained. It enabled them to "observe how institutional
entrepreneurs engage in discursive strategies to transform the `meaning' embodied by particular
technologies, by producing new concepts, objects, and subject positions" (p. 1666). Using this
technique, they were able to develop a typology of the strategies available for entrepreneurs who
wish to affect the processes of social construction that lead to change in institutional fields.

7.1.11. Phenomenology/Heuristic Analysis
Phenomenology or heuristic analysis is "a study of conscious phenomena" (Sanders, 1982, p. 354)
and is concerned with understanding a phenomenon rather than explaining it (Starks & Trinidad,
2007). It involves the use of thick description and close analysis of lived experience to understand
how meaning is created through embodied perception (Sokolowski, 2000; Starks & Trinidad,
2007). Phenomenology seeks to make explicit the implicit structure and meaning of human
experiences (Sanders, 1982). Starks and Trinidad (2007) explain, "In phenomenology reality is
comprehended through embodied experience. Through close examination of individual
experiences, phenomenological analysts seek to capture the meaning and common features, or
essences, of an experience or event. The truth of the event, as an abstract entity, is subjective and
knowable only through embodied perception; we create meaning through the experience of
moving through space and across time" (p. 1374).

The core of phenomenology is the intentionality of consciousness, understood as the direction of
consciousness toward understanding the world (Sadala & Adorno, 2002). Thus, in doing
phenomenology analysis, the researcher's task is to analyze the intentional experiences of
consciousness in order to perceive how a phenomenon is given meaning (Sadala & Adorno, 2002).
The researcher's thoughts, responses, and decision-making processes should be acknowledged and
explicated throughout the research process (Donalek, 2004).

An analysis of the structure of a phenomenon can be carried out using the steps suggested by
Sadala and Adorno (2002). The first step is called phenomenological description. This step is
intended to mirror and express a participant's conscious experience. The second step is
phenomenological reduction, a step to critically reflect the descriptive content. This can be
conducted in three different moments: (1) at the first moment, researchers keep the description in
its original format, aiming to analyze the experience as it is without allowing personal or theoretical
concepts to influence the analysis; (2) at the second moment, a radical gestalt perspective is created
where observers and subjects are the focus of the description; and (3) at the third moment,

146 | Data Analysis Strategies
researchers try to focus on the pre-reflexive sources (i.e., what subjects said about their daily lives)
and state the meaning of the experience by taking into account their understanding of the
experience. The third step is called phenomenological interpretation, when the four stages of
hermeneutic procedures are identified: (1) locating the invisible elements that can be found in the
text; (2) producing the reflective phenomena present in the consciousness (i.e., radical cogito); (3)
the manifestation of preconscious phenomena; and (4) the specification of the existential meaning
(Sadala & Adorno, 2002).

                    7.2. Data Analysis in Quantitative Research

Quantitative research yields data that provide quantifiable results. Similar to approaches for
qualitative research, the choice of method for data analysis is determined by the research questions
as well as the processes by which selection is made from the sources of data (Blaikie, 2003). In
analyzing quantitative data, researchers first need to recognize the scales of measurement (i.e.,
nominal, ordinal, interval, or ratio). A nominal scale separates objects, events, or people into
groups (e.g., categorizing people according to their gender, marital status, education level). When
a nominal scale can be ordered according to their magnitude, the measurement scale is an ordinal
scale (e.g., ranking) (Tashakkori & Teddlie, 1998). Both nominal and ordinal scales are also
known as categorical data. An interval scale is a set of ordered and equal interval categories on a
contrived measurement scale (Blaikie, 2003). Unlike on a nominal scale, the distances between
categories in the interval scale can be assumed to be equal. For example, the difference between
90 and 100 degrees is the same as the difference between 10 and 20 degrees. The interval scale
has a zero point, but not an absolute zero. A measurement scale with an absolute zero is called a
ratio scale (e.g., age, number of medical treatments). The ratio scale has all the attributes of the
interval scale but with an absolute zero.

Understanding these approaches to measurement helps researchers determine the best way of
organizing their data. For most nominal variables, nonparametric statistics (e.g., chi-square test,
Wilcoxon rank sum test, logistic regression) are appropriate, whereas for interval/ratio-level
variables, parametric statistics (e.g., Pearson correlation, multiple regression) are appropriate
(Tashakkori & Teddlie, 1998). In nonparametric statistical procedures, it is not necessary to
assume that the random variable of the population has a normal distribution, whereas in parametric
procedures, it is assumed the random variable is normally distributed. Interval, ratio, and some
ordinal scales have a greater possibility to meet this requirement, although whether they do will
depend on the characteristics of the population (Blaikie, 2003).

The choice of quantitative data analysis methods is also determined by the research questions.
Various data analysis methods are used to describe the characteristics of a social phenomenon, and
to understand, explain, and predict patterns that exist in the social environment. The data can also
be analyzed to estimate whether characteristics and relationships found in a sample could be
expected to exist in the population (Blaikie, 2003). Thus, quantitative data analysis techniques can
be divided into three types: descriptive, explanatory, and inferential analysis, and each can be
further divided into univariate, bivariate, and/or multivariate statistics.

7.2.1. Descriptive Analysis
Descriptive analysis provides simple summaries of the sample and the measures (Trochim, 2006).
The main objective of these analyses is to provide images and/or summaries that can help readers
understand the nature of the variables and their relationships (Tashakkori & Teddlie, 1998). With

                                                                                                                           Chapter 7 | 147
descriptive methods, researchers simply discuss what is or what the data show. Descriptive
statistics can be divided into two categories: univariate and bivariate. Univariate descriptive
analysis is used to represent the characteristics of a single variable at a time (e.g., the average score
of students' GPAs for a particular semester) (Blaikie, 2003; Trochim, 2006). The three most
commonly used methods of univariate descriptive analysis are: (1) measures of data distribution;
(2) measures of central tendency; and (3) dispersion (Trochim, 2006). Measures of data
distribution represent a summary of the frequency of individual values or range of values for a
variable (Trochim, 2006). One of the most common methods to observe the distribution is a
frequency distribution that can be presented in a pictorial or graphical form. Measures of central
tendency summarize a group of observations/scores into a single score. The three major types of
estimates of central tendency are mean, median, and mode. Mean is the average score (by summing
all the values and dividing the sum by the number of value); median is the score found at the exact
middle of the set of values; and mode is the most frequently occurring value in the set of scores.
Researchers can also calculate the spread of frequencies around this central tendency. This type of
measure is called dispersion. There are two common measures of dispersion: range (i.e., highest
value and lowest value) and standard deviation (i.e., dispersion of a dataset relative to the mean).

Bivariate descriptive analysis involves two variables. The goal of bivariate descriptive statistics is
to either establish similarities or differences between the characteristics of categories of objects,
events, or people, or to describe patterns or connections between such characteristics (Blaikie,
2003). The most common methods that have been used to establish an association between two
variables include contingency coefficient (x2 measures of association), phi and Cramer's V
(nominal level), gamma (ordinal-level data and categorized interval-level and ratio-level data), and
Pearson's correlation coefficient (interval-level and ratio-level data) (Blaikie, 2003). The Pearson
correlation, ranging from -1 (perfect negative relationship) to +1 (perfect positive relationship), is
a widely used bivariate statistic (Tashakkori & Teddlie, 1998). A summary of descriptive analysis
techniques is presented in Table 7-2 (adapted from Blaikie, 2003).

                Spearman's rank correlation coefficient (rs).
            4. Categorical (nominal or ordinal) and metric variables (interval or ratio):

                (a) transform metric variables into categorical form and then use G or Cs
                or V; and (b) if the categorical variable is a dichotomy or can be
                dichotomized, use Pearson's r.
            5. Interval and ratio variables: Covariance, Pearson's r.

148 | Data Analysis Strategies
7.2.2. Explanatory Analysis
In explanatory analysis, the goal is to test for the existence of causality or influence. Table 7-3
(adapted from Blaikie, 2003) summarizes the methods used for explanatory analysis based on the
types of measurement used. Although explanatory analysis is built on bivariate descriptive
(association) analysis, the existence of association is a necessary, but insufficient, condition for
explanatory analysis (Blaikie, 2003). Causality is to explain the occurrence of events and to
understand why particular events occur (Marini & Singer, 1988). Although in-depth discussions
on causality are beyond the scope of this book, they are necessary to differentiate independent
variables (predictors) from dependent variables (outcomes) in explanatory analysis. Explanatory
analysis can be conducted on both bivariate and multivariate relationships. The most common
methods used in bivariate explanatory analysis are lambda (nominal variables), Somer's d (ordinal
variables), and bivariate regression (metric variables) (Blaikie, 2003).

Multivariate explanatory analysis aims to establish networks of relationships among variables
(Blaikie, 2003). In multivariate analysis in which the effect of a predictor variable on an outcome
variable is controlled by a third variable, and all variables are categorical, researchers can use
methods of association or influence previously discussed (i.e., lambda, Somer's d, Cramer's V).
In this case, the methods of analysis are dependent on the levels of measurement of the predictor
and outcome variables (Blaikie, 2003). Some more popular techniques for multivariate explanatory
analysis that are used to establish the relative influence of two or more predictor variables on one
or more outcome variables include multiple regression, logistic regression, ANOVA, MANOVA,
discriminant analysis, and structural equation modeling (see Table 7-3).

There are also some other multivariate analysis techniques that allow users to group parts of the
data into clusters or factors. These techniques focus on grouping the data based on what they have
in common and reducing them to a number of factors or dimensions. The four most common
methods used in social sciences for this data reduction purpose are exploratory factor analysis,
cluster analysis, perceptual mapping or multidimensional scaling, and profile analysis. Whereas
factor analysis is used to discover underlying patterns or relationships in a large number of
variables and reduce them to a smaller set of factors (Pituch & Stevens, 2015), cluster analysis is
concerned with grouping individuals or objects based on similarities among them (Blaikie, 2003).
Multidimensional scaling is a method to uncover the "hidden structure" of data--it uses
proximities among any kind of object as input (Kruskal & Wish, 1978). Lastly, profile analysis is
a multivariate technique equivalent to repeated measures or mixed ANOVA. This technique uses
data plots to visually compare different groups.

7.2.3. Inferential Analysis
In inferential analysis, researchers use a random sample of data from a population to describe and
make inferences about the population (Tashakkori & Teddlie, 1998; Trochim, 2006). Whereas we

150 | Data Analysis Strategies
use descriptive statistics to describe the basic features of the data in a study, we use inferential
statistics to draw inferences that generalize to broader settings (Trochim et al., 2015). Inferential
statistics is only appropriate when the sample is drawn using probability or random selection
procedures (see Chapter 5). Some examples of inferential statistics are the t-test for testing
significant differences between two group means and the F-test for the significance of a multiple
correlation.
Inferential analysis is a collection of methods for estimating what the population characteristics
(i.e., parameters) might be, based on the sample characteristics (i.e., statistics) (Blaikie, 2003).
When data from a single variable are obtained from a probability sample and the population value
is required, inferential analysis must be used (Blaikie, 2003). This is called univariate inferential
statistics. The goal of this analysis is to estimate whether the sample and population means are the
same. Some examples of univariate inferential analysis are one-way chi-square and one-sample
t-test (Trochim et al., 2015). When the analysis is concerned with relationships between two
variables, different inferential procedures are required. These procedures are commonly referred
to as "tests of significance"--a statistical test to estimate whether the relationship that we have
found in the sample could also be expected to exist in the population from which the population is
drawn (Blaikie, 2003, p. 177). The process of testing statistical hypotheses generally follows five
basic steps (see Figure 7-2). A researcher first starts with stating the null and alternative
hypotheses. These hypotheses specify the possible relationships that exist between two variables
in a population. After that, the researcher selects the level of significance with Type I and Type II
errors in mind. A Type I error occurs when the null hypothesis is rejected when it is true and a
Type II error occurs when the null hypothesis is not rejected when it is false (Warner, 2013). The
researcher then identifies the appropriate test statistic based on the level of measurement and the
type of analysis. Some of the most common test statistics are the chi-square, z-score, t-statistic,
and F-statistic. The researcher then computes the value of the test statistic using the appropriate
procedure and decides whether to reject or not to reject the null hypothesis (Blaikie, 2003).

                                                                                                                           Chapter 7 | 151

Inferential statistics can be used for associational analysis (bivariate descriptive) and explanatory
analysis. In associational analysis, the goal is to test for the existence of associations between two
variables (i.e., hypothesized relationships are non-directional). What researchers want to know is
whether the association found in the sample also exists in the population. As we mentioned
previously, the type of analysis method is dependent on the levels of measurement. For example,
to test the significance of association between two nominal variables, the chi-square test is
appropriate. We summarize the most common test statistics used for explanatory analysis,
dependent on the scales of measurement, in Table 7-4 (adapted from Blaikie, 2003).

As shown in Table 7-4, some of the most common test statistics used are z-test, t-test, and F-test.
The test statistic for inferential analysis also depends on the type of measurement as well as the
objective of the analysis--e.g., whether it's an associative analysis or explanatory analysis.

                                            Summary

· Qualitative data analysis is associated with the classification and interpretation of linguistic (or
    visual) materials. Some of the best-known techniques are case study, grounded theory, direct
    and pragmatic, narrative analysis, content analysis, classification, event analysis, metaphorical
    analysis, hermeneutic analysis, discourse analysis, and phenomenology/heuristic analysis.

· Quantitative research yields data that provide quantifiable results. In analyzing quantitative
    data, researchers first need to recognize the types of measurement scales (i.e., nominal, ordinal,
    interval, or ratio). Quantitative data analysis techniques can be divided into three types:

                                                                                Chapter 7 | 153
    descriptive, explanatory, and inferential, and each of them can be further divided into
    univariate, bivariate, and/or multivariate.
· Descriptive analysis provides simple summaries about the sample and the measures. The three
    most commonly used methods of univariate descriptive analysis are: (1) measures of data
    distribution; (2) measures of central tendency; and (3) dispersion.
· The goal of explanatory analysis is to test the existence of causality or influence. Some most
    popular techniques of multivariate explanatory analysis that are used to establish the relative
    influence of two or more predictor variables on one or more outcome variables include multiple
    regression, logistic regression, ANOVA, MANOVA, discriminant analysis, and structural
    equation modeling.
· Inferential analysis is a collection of methods for estimating what the population characteristics
    (i.e., parameters) might be based on the sample characteristics (i.e., statistics).

                                            Exercises

1. Building on exercises in previous chapters where you designed a mixed-methods study,
    develop the qualitative and quantitative data analysis section of your study. Describe (a) what
    types of data you will gather; (b) how you will prepare your qualitative and quantitative data
    for analysis; and (c) what types of qualitative and quantitative analyses you will perform.

2. Select one or two articles in your field or a related field that used mixed-methods research and
    answer the following questions:
    a. How were the qualitative and quantitative data analyzed?
    b. How did the approaches selected contribute to the findings and inferences?

        MIXED-METHODS DATA ANALYSIS STRATEGIES

We discussed different strategies to analyze qualitative and quantitative data in Chapter 7. In this
chapter, we discuss data analysis strategies for mixed-methods research. Specifically, we identify
factors that should inform researchers' decisions in selecting the most appropriate data analysis
strategies for mixed-methods research. The most common approach of analyzing data in mixed-
methods research is to compare the separate results of the two data analyses using techniques
discussed in Chapter 7. In conducting mixed-methods data analyses, researchers must not only be
competent in conducting an array of quantitative and qualitative analyses, but also know how to
mix and embed these analyses so that the findings enable researchers to generate high-quality
meta-inferences (Onwuegbuzie et al., 2009). Moreover, mixed-methods data analyses should be
conducted in a way that is consistent with the purpose(s) of the study (e.g., completeness). The
analyses should also address the research questions (e.g., explain, predict, describe) (Onwuegbuzie
et al., 2009). Next, we discuss the criteria that need to be met in conducting mixed-methods data
analyses. We also briefly discuss potential threats to quality in mixed-methods research, including
potential threats to internal and external validity in qualitative and quantitative research.

                  8.1. Criteria for Mixed-Methods Data Analysis

Onwuegbuzie and Combs (2011) argue that mixed-methods data analysis involves "the use of both
quantitative and qualitative analytical techniques within the same framework, which is guided
either a priori, a posteriori, or iteratively (representing analytical decisions that occur both prior to
the study and during the study)" (p. 3). The critical criteria that researchers need to consider during
the data analysis phases include: (1) number of data types that will be analyzed; (2) number of data
analysis types that will be used; (3) time sequence of the analysis; (4) priority of analytical
components; (5) number of analytical phases; and (6) analysis orientation (Onwuegbuzie &
Combs, 2011).

8.1.1. Number of Data Types That Will Be Analyzed
Traditionally, data analysis in mixed-methods research involves analyzing qualitative data using
qualitative methods and analyzing quantitative data using quantitative methods (Creswell & Plano
Clark, 2018; Onwuegbuzie & Combs, 2011). However, mixed-methods data analysis can also
involve a sequential analysis of one type of data, i.e., data that are generated from the initial
analysis (either qualitative or quantitative) are then converted into the other data type (Venkatesh
et al., 2016). A type of mixed-methods design involving only one type of data but using both
qualitative and quantitative data analyses is known as conversion mixed designs (Teddlie &
Tashakkori, 2006). Conversion mixed designs only consist of one strand of a research study (see
Chapter 5 for a review on mixed-methods monostrand designs). These designs are considered
mixed-methods research because they switch approaches in the experiential phase of the study,
when the data that are originally collected (e.g., narrative, numerical) are converted into the other
form (e.g., numeric, narrative) (Teddlie & Tashakkori, 2006). For example, a researcher could
conduct a content analysis of interview transcripts and then perform an exploratory factor analysis
of the qualitative codes that emerge from the qualitative analysis and that are transformed to
quantitative data. A technique for transforming qualitative data to quantitative data is known as
quantitizing (Venkatesh et al., 2016). Alternatively, a researcher could conduct a quantitative

                                                                                                                           Chapter 8 | 159
analysis of quantitative data (e.g., using linear regression) and then qualitatively analyze the
quantitative data that emerge from the quantitative analysis that are transformed to qualitative data
(e.g., narrative profiling formation of a set of test scores) (Onwuegbuzie & Combs, 2011). This
method is known as qualitizing. For example, Ferguson and Hull (2018) applied latent profile
analysis (LPA) to model personality. They first gathered quantitative data from a sample of high
school students. They conducted descriptive analysis and then confirmatory factor analysis (CFA)
to examine the overall factor structure. They then performed LPA to identify latent profiles of
individuals based on the five-factor personality scores. After several analytical phases, they found
three profiles of personality types: reserved, well-adjusted, and excitable. The authors discussed
this categorization from both quantitative and qualitative perspectives. Specifically, whereas the
CFA they performed did not meet the cut-offs for fit indexes, LPA provided an alternative method
to address the challenge of adequately modeling the personality inventory data. LPA uses a
person-centric approach and focuses on sub-scales and individual patterns of responses.

While the proliferation of big data brings new opportunities to the mixed-methods research
community, it has yet to make major inroads into mixed-methods research. Big data hold great
promise for discovering subtle population patterns and heterogeneities that are not possible with
small-scale data (Fan et al., 2014). Unlike traditional datasets where the sample size is typically
larger than the number of dimensions, big data are characterized by a massive sample size and
high dimensionality (Fan et al., 2014). These data are less structured and often contain both text
(e.g., customer opinion) and numbers (e.g., number of clicks, number of visits). By carefully
analyzing the application and data characteristics, researchers and practitioners can then use
appropriate mixed-methods data analysis techniques to develop high-quality meta-inferences.
Although we specifically discuss more about big data and mixed-methods research in Chapter 9,
it is important to mention here that qualitizing and quantitizing are the two of the most common
practices in analyzing big data. For example, D. Yin et al. (2014) collected and analyzed actual
review data from the Yahoo! shopping website. These data contained both user ratings (i.e.,
quantitative data) and text reviews for online merchants (i.e., qualitative data). They used review
helpfulness, measured as the proportion of helpful votes out of the total votes a review received,
as the dependent variable. To measure the independent variables (i.e., anxiety and anger), they
quantitized the qualitative data (i.e., text reviews). Specifically, they used Linguistic Inquiry and
Word Count (LIWC), a text analysis software, to evaluate psychological and structural
components of text samples. Using quantitizing, they were able to statistically analyze the
relationship between emotions and overall helpfulness ratings.

Although it is practically sufficient to gather one type of data and transform it to another type of
data in mixed-methods research, we encourage researchers to gather both types of data and perform
a data transformation within the same strand of a research study only if such a transformation can
bring additional insights. Gathering both types of data will allow researchers to perform a more
complete analysis and benefit from the inherent strength of the types of data and associated
analyses. When both types of data are available in a mixed-methods research study, researchers
can rely on multiple techniques that yield high quality of meta-inferences as different types of data
complement each other (Creswell et al., 2004). In addition, researchers can avoid methodological
issues associated with conversion designs (e.g., loss of depth and flexibility of qualitative data,
overgeneralization of the observed numeric data).

8.1.2. Number of Data Analysis Types That Will Be Used
We discussed different types of data analyses in qualitative and quantitative research in the
previous chapter--several examples are shown in Table 8-1. In mixed-methods research,
researchers need to use at least one qualitative analysis and one quantitative analysis. A key
question in mixed-methods research is how many different qualitative and quantitative analysis
techniques will be used in the study (Onwuegbuzie & Combs, 2010). The decision on data analysis
techniques is influenced by the types of data collected by the researchers as well as the purposes
of the study (e.g., completeness). For example, if the purpose is to explain why the phenomenon
under study occurs, descriptive statistics will be insufficient. Researchers may want to use
interviews and/or a grounded theory approach (if the goal is to develop a theory or to address the
why question) and statistical analysis techniques that will allow them to test for causality (e.g.,
regression analysis, structural equation modeling).

8.1.3. Time Sequence of Mixed-Methods Data Analysis
Time sequence refers to whether or not the analysis phases occur in a chronological order
(Creswell & Plano Clark, 2018; Onwuegbuzie & Combs, 2010). Based on the order of data
analysis, there are three strategies for analyzing data in mixed-methods research: (1) concurrent
mixed-analyses (i.e., simultaneously analyze qualitative and quantitative data); (2) sequential
qualitative-quantitative data analyses (i.e., qualitative data analysis followed by quantitative data
analysis); and (3) sequential quantitative-qualitative data analyses (i.e., quantitative data analysis
followed by qualitative data analysis) (Tashakkori & Teddlie, 1998; Venkatesh et al., 2016).

Tashakkori and Teddlie (1998) proposed three different types of sequential
qualitative-quantitative data analyses. These are the following:

                                                                        Chapter 8 | 161
1. Researchers form groups of people or settings on the basis of qualitative data or observations.
    Researchers then compare the groups on quantitative data (e.g., using cluster analysis,
    discriminant analysis, MANCOVA). This technique is also called typology development
    (Tashakkori & Teddlie, 1998).

2. Researchers form groups of attributes or themes through qualitative analysis (e.g., content
    analysis), followed by confirmatory quantitative analysis (e.g., factor analysis, structural
    equation modeling). For example, Sarker et al. (2018) used qualitative data to identify key
    variables (or relevant categories and factors) that play a role in determining the level of
    work-life conflict in the context of globally distributed software development personnel. They
    then used the quantitative data and analysis to test the effect of these key variables on work-life
    conflict.

3. Researchers establish a theoretical order of a relationship or causality through exploratory
    qualitative analysis and then confirm the proposed theoretical order using quantitative data and
    analysis. For example, Stefano et al. (2015) examined sanctioning behaviors in the gourmet
    cuisine industry. They used qualitative data to develop their hypotheses and then tested their
    predictions using a field experiment.

Some of the variations of sequential quantitative-qualitative data analyses are:

1. Forming groups of people or setting on the basis of quantitative data (e.g., cluster analysis) and
    then comparing the groups on qualitative data.

2. Forming groups of attributes or themes through exploratory quantitative analysis and then
    confirming with available or new qualitative data and analysis.

3. Establishing a theoretical model using exploratory quantitative analysis and then confirming
    the obtained sequence through qualitative data analysis.

8.1.4. Priority of Analytical Components
Another aspect of mixed-methods research that influences data analysis decisions is the priority of
the study, whether it's an equal-status design or a dominant-less dominant status design. For
example, a study in which the quantitative phase(s) has (have) less priority than does the qualitative
phase(s) is (are) less likely to involve a complex quantitative-based research question that requires
sophisticated quantitative data analysis techniques than a study where the quantitative phase(s) has
(have) greater priority (Onwuegbuzie & Combs, 2010). If the qualitative analysis component is
given significantly higher priority, then the analysis essentially is a qualitative-dominant mixed
analysis. In contrast, if the quantitative analysis component is given significantly higher priority,
then the analysis is essentially a quantitative-dominant mixed analysis.

8.1.5. Number of Analytical Phases
Mixed-methods data analysis can be conducted in several phases. Onwuegbuzie and Teddlie
(2003) conceptualized seven phases of mixed-methods data analysis. These phases are:

1. Data reduction: Reducing dimensionality of the qualitative and quantitative data. To reduce
    dimensionality of the qualitative data, researchers can use different coding strategies to create
    themes and categories that describe the characteristics of the data. In quantitative research,
    researchers can use factor analysis.

2. Data display: Visually describing the quantitative and qualitative data. Whereas quantitative
    data can be easily presented using a variety of different tables and diagrams, the visual

162 | Mixed-Methods Data Analysis Strategies
presentation of qualitative data, which is typically characterized by unstructured content, is
different and more difficult. Miles et al. (2020) proposed different types of displays that we
believe can be used to display not only qualitative findings, but also mixed-methods findings,
and several examples of these formats are shown in Table 8-2. If the qualitative study's
objective is to explore and describe, and the study only consists of one case (e.g., one
organization, one event), then partially ordered displays, time-ordered displays, role-ordered
displays, and conceptually ordered displays are recommended. If the qualitative study's
objective is to explain and predict and the study only consists of one case, then explanatory
effect matrix, case dynamic matrix, and causal network can be used. Cross-case displays for
exploring and describing purposes include partially ordered meta-matrix, content-analytic
summary table, substructing a variable, construct table, case-ordered descriptive meta-matrix,
scatterplot, time-ordered meta matrix, and composite sequence analysis. Cross-case displays
for ordering and explaining purposes include case-ordered effects matrix, case-ordered
predictor-outcome matrix, variable-by-variable matrix, causal model, and causal networks
(Miles et al., 2020).

Visual displays provide a pragmatic way to share mixed-methods findings. With increased access
to technology and use of advanced graphic software, the capacity to produce more efficient and
easily understood graphical information displays can be a powerful visual tool for mixed-methods
data analysis (Dickinson, 2010).

8.1.6. Analysis Orientation
Onwuegbuzie et al. (2009) proposed a classification of mixed analysis techniques into three
orientations: (1) case-oriented approach; (2) variable-oriented approach; and (3) process-
oriented approach. Case-oriented analysis focuses mainly on the selected case(s) in order to
"analyze and to interpret the meanings, experiences, perceptions, beliefs, or the like of one or more
people--with a goal of particularizing and making analytical generalizations" (Onwuegbuzie &
Combs, 2010, p. 418). Conversely, variable-oriented analysis involves "identifying
relationships--typically probabilistic in nature--among constructs that are treated as variables in
a way that facilitates research that often is conceptual or theory-centered from the onset and has a
tendency toward external generalizations" (Onwuegbuzie & Combs, 2010, p. 418). The building
blocks of a variable-oriented approach are variables and their relationships, rather than cases.
Whereas qualitative methods generally focus on cases (i.e., case-oriented approach), quantitative
methods usually focus on variables (i.e., variable-oriented approach).

Although variable-oriented analysis is good for finding probabilistic relationships among variables
in a large population, it is poor at handling the real complexities of causation or dealing with
multiple subsamples, and its findings are often very general (Miles et al., 2020). In contrast, case-
oriented analysis focuses on a small sample size and usually points at similarities and differences
through dense narratives. Thus, its findings are often very specific (Porta, 2008).

Mixed-methods research allows researchers to combine variable-oriented and case-oriented
strategies in the same study or research program (i.e., process-oriented analysis). Process-oriented
analysis involves evaluating processes or experiences relating to one or more cases within a
specific context over time, with processes tending to be linked to variables and experiences to
cases (Onwuegbuzie & Combs, 2010). For example, researchers who use case-oriented methods
to study several companies that have implemented artificial intelligence tools might benefit from
conducting surveys of their members and performing a conventional quantitative analysis of these
data. Building on Tables 8-1 and 8-2, in Table 8-3, we present the listed techniques and additional
techniques and how both qualitative and quantitative data analysis methods can be used for
case-oriented and variable-oriented approaches. We complement and modify this table from
Onwuegbuzie et al. (2009) by adding some additional data analysis techniques from multiple
sources, including Miles et al. (2020). Process-oriented analyses usually use a combination of both
case-oriented and variable-oriented analysis methods.

The list is by no means exhaustive but covers a range of techniques. Researchers can use a
combination of these techniques as long as such a combination helps them obtain consistency
between meta-inferences and the elements that characterize the study (i.e., research objectives,
mixing purposes, research questions, mixed-methods sampling designs, and other research design
decisions).

                    8.2. Validation in Mixed-Methods Research

Validation is a cornerstone in social sciences research and is a symbol of research quality and rigor
(Venkatesh et al., 2013). Prior to considering the quality of mixed-methods research, researchers
need to describe and report the accepted criteria for the qualitative and quantitative strands of the
study. This is an important step because researchers collect, analyze, and interpret both types of
data. Thus, traditional approaches to validation should not be ignored regardless of the types of
mixed-methods designs employed. For instance, if researchers leverage a dominant/less-dominant
status design, validity should be established for both the dominant and less-dominant strands of
the study.

The most widely used validation concepts from qualitative and quantitative research are
summarized in Table 8-4 (Venkatesh et al., 2013).

8.2.1. Validation in Qualitative Research
Qualitative research does not have general guidelines or evaluation criteria for validation that are
widely accepted (Venkatesh et al., 2013). Perhaps the best-known quality criteria have been
developed specifically for qualitative research are the four proposed by Lincoln and Guba (1985)
(see Table 8-4): (1) credibility--i.e., involves the confidence that can be placed in the truth of the
research findings; (2) confirmability--i.e., degree to which the results could be confirmed or
corroborated by others; (3) transferability--i.e., degree to which the results of qualitative research
can be generalized or transferred to other contexts or settings; and (4) dependability--i.e.,
emphasizes the need for the researcher to describe the changes that occur in the setting and how
these changes affected the way the researcher approached the study (Venkatesh et al., 2013).
According to Lincoln and Guba, concern for credibility should replace truth value; transferability
should replace external validity; dependability should replace reliability; and confirmability should
replace the conventional criterion of neutrality and objectivity.

Using the classification of validity types presented in Table 8-4, Venkatesh et al. (2013) organized
different types of quality for qualitative research into three broad categories: (1) design validity--
e.g., descriptive validity, credibility, transferability; (2) analytical validity--e.g., theoretical
validity, dependability, consistency, plausibility; and (3) inference quality--e.g., interpretive
validity, confirmability.

8.2.2. Validation in Quantitative Research
Quantitative research that has widely accepted guidelines for validation (e.g., Cook & Campbell,
1979; Nunnally & Bernstein, 1994). Typically, in quantitative research, two primary validation
issues are addressed (i.e., reliability and validity of measures) (Venkatesh et al., 2013). In its
everyday sense, reliability is the "consistency" or "repeatability" of your measures (Trochim,
2006). A measure is considered reliable if it yields the same result over and over again (Straub et
al., 2004). Without reliable measures, a quantitative study is considered invalid. Thus, reliability
is a necessary condition for validity in quantitative research (Venkatesh et al., 2013).

Validity refers to "the legitimacy of the findings (i.e., how accurately the findings represent the
truth in the objective world)" (Venkatesh et al., 2013, p. 32). According to Cook and Campbell
(1979) and Shadish et al. (2002), validity in quantitative research can be categorized into three
groups: (1) measurement validity (e.g., content and construct validity); (2) design validity (i.e.,
internal and external validity); and (3) inferential validity (e.g., statistical conclusion validity)
(Venkatesh et al., 2013). The definition of each type of validity as well as its variations and
strategies to establish the validity were summarized earlier in Table 8-4.

8.2.3. Quality Criteria in Mixed-Methods Research
Just like qualitative and quantitative research, mixed-methods research needs its own quality
criteria. Here, we use the term "domains of quality" to refer to the areas of mixed-methods where

170 | Mixed-Methods Data Analysis Strategies
the quality of data on which they are based must be assessed (Caracelli & Riggin, 1994; O'Cathain,
2010). There are two quality domains that have been widely discussed in mixed-methods research:
(1) design quality--i.e., degree to which a researcher has selected the most appropriate procedures
for answering the research questions; and (2) interpretive rigor--i.e., degree to which one has
made credible interpretations based on the obtained results (Tashakkori & Teddlie, 2010a;
Venkatesh et al., 2013, 2016). The different types of quality in each domain along with the
questions researchers need to ask about when they assess the quality of their research design and
its implementation are presented in Table 8-5 (Teddlie & Tashakkori, 2009).

                                                   design?

As can be seen from Table 8-5, the domain of design quality focuses on how well the design
elements are consistent with the research questions and purposes for conducting mixed-methods
research. These quality criteria include design suitability, design fidelity, within-case consistency,
and analytical adequacy. The domain of interpretive rigor concerns the credibility and
trustworthiness of the findings (i.e., meta-inferences). These include interpretive consistency,
theoretical consistency, interpretive agreement, interpretive distinctiveness, integrative efficacy,
and interpretive correspondence. We will discuss meta-inferences and how to establish high
quality meta-inferences in Chapter 10.

Other key quality criteria are those recommended by Onwuegbuzie and Johnson (2006):

1. Sample integration: Applies to situations in which researchers aim to make statistical
    generalizations from a sample population to a larger population.

2. Inside-outside: "The extent to which the researcher accurately presents and appropriately
    utilizes the insider's views and the observer's views for purposes, such as description and
    explanation" (p. 57).

172 | Mixed-Methods Data Analysis Strategies
3. Weakness minimization: "The extent to which the weakness from one approach is compensated
    by the strengths from the other approach" (p. 57).

4. Sequential legitimation: "The extent to which one has minimized the potential problem
    wherein the meta-inferences could be affected by revising the sequence of the quantitative and
    qualitative phases" (p. 57).

5. Conversion legitimation: The extent to which quantitizing and qualitizing lead to interpretable
    data and high inference quality.

6. Paradigmatic mixing: The extent to which researchers successfully combine and blend their
    paradigmatic assumptions underlying the qualitative and quantitative approaches "into a usable
    package" (p. 57).

7. Commensurability: "Mixed-methods researchers need to be able to make Gestalt switches (i.e.,
    to switch back and forth from a qualitative lens to a quantitative lens)" (Venkatesh et al., 2016,
    p. 450).

8. Multiple validities: The extent to which one uses all relevant research strategies and the study
    meets multiple relevant validity criteria.

9. Political legitimation: "The extent to which consumers of mixed methods research value the
    meta-inferences stemming from both the qualitative and quantitative components of a study"
    (p. 57).

               8.3. Threats to Quality in Mixed-Methods Research

There are various potential threats in mixed-methods research that need to be addressed throughout
the research process (i.e., the design, data collection, data analysis and interpretation stages). As
with all research, plausible threats should be identified in the qualitative and quantitative strands
of the study (Dellinger & Leech, 2007) and careful attention should be paid to alleviating or
managing these threats.

8.3.1. Threats to Internal Validity
In qualitative research, internal validity is also known as internal credibility (Onwuegbuzie, 2002).
Table 8-6 provides examples of threats to internal credibility in qualitative research (Ihantola &
Kihn, 2011; Onwuegbuzie & Leech, 2007b). These include insufficient or biased knowledge of
earlier studies and theories during the research design stage; selection bias and researcher bias
during the data collection stage; and lack of descriptive legitimation and lack of interpretive
legitimation during the data analysis and interpretations stage (Ihantola & Kihn, 2011).

                   differently from their usual selves in front of researchers).

                   · Observer bias (i.e., insufficient data is collected and interpretation

                   gaps closed with the researcher's own values, projections and

                   expectations).

                   · Researcher bias (i.e., occurs when researchers have personal biases or

                   a priori assumption that they are not able to rule out).

                                                                                  Chapter 8 | 173

                   · Data access limitations--i.e., researchers are on site for a limited

                   period of time and their access to certain documents, events, or

                   people may be restricted.

                   · Complexities and limitations of the human mind--i.e., subjects may

                   consciously seek to mislead or deceive the researcher, or their

                   statements or reports are affected by natural human tendencies and

                   fallibilities.

                   · Serious reactivity--i.e., changes in informants' responses that result

                   processes and relationships.

                   · Lack of generalizability--e.g., lack of inability to generalize to

                   theory.

                   · Issues in ironic legitimation--i.e., ability to reveal co-existing

                   opposites of the same phenomenon.

                   · Issues in paralogical legitimation--i.e., ability to reveal paradoxes.

                   · Issues in rhizomatic legitimation--i.e., ability to map and not merely

                   describe data.

                   · Voluptuous legitimation--i.e., the extent to which the researchers'

                   level of interpretation exceeds their knowledge base stemming from

                   the data.

                   · Confidential information--i.e., problems in treating confidential

                   information in writing case reports.

                   · Difficulty in interpreting the typicality of instances and findings.

                   · All data are not analyzed and treated equally regardless of whether it

                   fits the theory.

                   · Lack of structural corroboration--i.e., utilization of multiple types of

                   data to support or to contradict the interpretation.

                   · Confirmation bias--i.e., interpretations and conclusions based on

                   new data are overly congruent with a priori hypotheses.

                   · Illusory correlation--i.e., a tendency to identify a relationship when

                   no relationship actually prevails.

                   · Causal error--i.e., providing causal explanations and attributions for

                   observed behaviors and attitudes without attempting to verify such

                   interpretations.

In quantitative research, internal validity asserts that variations in the dependent variable result
from variations in the independent variables--not from other confounding factors (Trochim,
2006). During the research design stage, possible threats to internal validity include contradictions
in the logic used to develop research questions, theories, hypotheses, statistical tests and analyses.
During the data collection stage, possible threats include instrumentation issues (Tashakkori &

174 | Mixed-Methods Data Analysis Strategies
Teddlie, 1998), selection bias, and researcher bias (Ihantola & Kihn, 2011; Onwuegbuzie &
McLean, 2003). During data analysis and interpretation, possible threats include statistical
regression bias and confirmation bias (Ihantola & Kihn, 2011). The interested reader is referred to
Bhattacherjee (2012), Tashakkori and Teddlie (1998), and Trochim (2006).

8.3.2. Threats to External Validity
In qualitative research, threats to external validity or external credibility include catalytic
legitimation (i.e., degree to which a given study empowers and liberates a research community),
communicative legitimation (i.e., occurs when researchers disagree on knowledge claims in a
discourse), interpretive legitimation (i.e., "extent to which a researcher's interpretation of an
account represents an understanding of the perspective of the group under study and the meaning
attached to their words and actions"), and population generalizability (i.e., tendency to generalize
findings rather than to utilize the data to obtain insights into particular underlying processes and
practices that prevail within a specific location) (Onwuegbuzie & Leech, 2007a, pp. 237-238).

In quantitative research, external validity determines whether one can draw more general
conclusions on the basis of data collected and whether the results may be generalized to other
samples, time periods, and settings (Ryan et al., 2002). Threats to external validity in quantitative
research include selection bias (i.e., if the sample size is inadequate and/or the sample is not
random) and interaction of history and treatment effect (i.e., as time passes, the conditions under
which treatments work change) (Bracht & Glass, 1968; Ryan et al., 2002).

8.3.3. Threats to Quality in Mixed-Methods Research
As we discussed earlier, there are two types of quality criteria in mixed-methods research: design
quality and interpretive rigor (Tashakkori & Teddlie, 2010b). Teddlie and Tashakkori (2003)
suggested that "within-design consistency" (i.e., the consistency of the procedures/study design
from which meta-inferences emerge) is threatened if any of the following conditions are present:
(1) the design is not consistent with the research questions/purpose; (2) the observations/measures
do not demonstrate validity; (3) the data analysis techniques are not sufficient and appropriate for
providing answers to research questions; (4) the results do not have the necessary strength to
warrant high-quality meta-inferences; (5) the inferences are not consistent with the results of data
analysis; and (6) the inferences are not consistent with research questions/purposes (Ihantola &
Kihn, 2011).

Threats to interpretive rigor include the inconsistency of inferences and the findings from each
strand of the study, the inconsistency of inferences with empirical findings of other studies, the
inconsistency of interpretations across scholars and participants' construction of reality (e.g., other
scholars do not agree that the inferences are the most plausible interpretations of the findings;
participations' construction of events is important to researchers, but the interpretations do not
make sense to participants), failure to distinguish inferences from other possible interpretations of
the findings, and failure to adequately integrate the findings (Ihantola & Kihn, 2011; Teddlie &
Tashakkori, 2003). All these threats should be properly addressed in a mixed-methods inquiry.
Although not all the threats are likely to appear in a single research inquiry, one should,
nevertheless, take them into consideration and address them when necessary to ensure high-quality
meta-inferences.

                                                                                                                           Chapter 8 | 175
 8.4. Data Collection and Analysis in Mixed-Methods Research in Practice

We provide two exemplars that have been discussed in previous chapters--i.e., Sonenshein et al.
(2014) and Stewart et al. (2017)--to illustrate how data are analyzed in mixed-methods research.

8.4.1. Sonenshein et al. (2014)
As discussed in Chapter 4, Sonenshein et al. (2014) conducted a sequential qualitative-quantitative
mixed-methods study of self-evaluations in explaining support of environmental issues. The
purpose of mixed-methods research in this study was complementarity (with an element of
developmental). They used type (2) data collection--qualitative interviews and quantitative survey
(see Table 6-6, Chapter 6).

8.4.1.1. Qualitative Data Collection
In their study 1, they used a sample of identified issue supporters of a variety of environmental
issues, including climate change. They located a program at a North American university called
the Environment and Business Program (EBP). They provided a justification why they selected
this sample: "Although obviously different from the general population, our sample was important
for theory development, as it allowed us to learn from a highly deviant set of individuals.... While
many individuals in the general population may want to address climate change at some point, our
sample represented individuals who had taken distinctive steps to learn about how to do so and to
be in the position to do so" (p. 12). They also explained how they recruited the participants in their
study, providing descriptive validity. They interviewed twenty-nine participants (i.e., fourteen
current students and fifteen working alumni of EBP). They provided a detailed description of their
interview protocol, establishing analytical validity (i.e., consistency). They also supplemented the
interview data with field observations and secondary documents.

8.4.1.2. Analysis of Qualitative Data
They adopted a grounded theory approach (Strauss & Corbin, 1998) to analyze their qualitative
data. They followed a three-step approach: (1) initial data coding; (2) theoretical categorization;
and (3) theory induction. During the initial data coding, they used open codes to classify
informants' statements. To establish credibility, they were mindful of the different settings in
which informants attempted to address climate change, inside and outside their formal
organizational settings. They developed a list of open codes that attempted to stay close to
informants' interpretations. During this stage, they began to shift their focus to self-interpretations,
as their first-order codes highlighted significant attention informants gave to the self. In the second
step, they moved to create abstract, theoretical codes that grouped informants' self-meaning and
other constructs into more generalizable categories. "This step involved abstracting informants'
categories to match theoretical concepts, with the goal of grouping informants' conceptual
schemes into theoretical categories" (p. 13). This practice also established theoretical validity.
After settling on a set of theoretical categories, the authors identified three key aggregate
theoretical dimensions that they grouped into their theoretical categories. These aggregate
dimensions--issue support challenges, self-assets, and self-doubts--served as the basis for their
induced theory. They used several different display formats to illustrate their qualitative data and
findings. For example, they used a causal network (Figure 8-1, reproduced from Sonenshein et al.,
2014, p. 14) to illustrate the data structure (i.e., how the first-order categories were related to the
second-order themes and how these second-order themes led to aggregate dimensions). They also
used a construct table to show the representative quotes underlying the second-order themes.

8.4.1.3. Quantitative Data Collection
In their study 2, they conducted an observational study to empirically and theoretically test their
theoretical premise that social issue supporters experience a mixed self. They inductively
examined the different ways this mixed self is manifested and how these differences relate to issue-
supportive behaviors. They first collected pre-test data to demonstrate construct validity for
measures of self-assets and self-doubts. They then recruited a second sample of issue supporters
and used surveys with concealed observations to inductively examine patterns of self-assets and
self-doubts and investigated how these patterns related to issue-supportive behaviors. They
collected data from 91 environmental issue supporters who were active members of environmental
groups in a North American city.

Participants were invited to come to a lab to complete the survey. Following the completion of
surveys, participants received a beverage, three slices of pizza, vegetables, and strawberries (with
the greens still attached), with the expectation that participants would be less likely to eat
everything on their plate, even if they were hungry. The participants were told to stay as long as
they wished and to finish all food and beverages in the lab. A research assistant took notes of each
participant's composting behavior. When participants left the building, two research assistants,
posing as environmental activists on the street, approached participants, told them about Earth
Hour--a real upcoming event sponsored by WWF--and asked them whether they would like to
sign the pledge and include their email address for a reminder to turn their lights off for Earth
Hour. They also videotaped the street activists' interactions with participants to identify them after
the study. They provided actual descriptions of the events and study settings, establishing
descriptive validity. They did checks to ensure the credibility of their observations.

                                                                                                                           Chapter 8 | 177
8.4.1.4. Quantitative Data Analysis
To analyze the survey data, they first conducted a confirmatory factor analysis on all independent
measures. Because of their small sample size, they ran a bootstrapped model. They reported the
goodness of fit indices of their results. Specifically, they mentioned, "although we had limited
power to reject a model, our results demonstrated a sufficient fit to the data (X2[44] = 68.96, p <
.01; CFI = .96, RMSEA = .08). Each item loaded significantly with its intended construct and with
no significant cross-loadings (p < .001)" (p. 27). They also used cluster analysis to inductively
examine how participants grouped into three self-evaluation profiles based on degree of self-assets
and self-doubts. After examining the scores associated with the individuals in each cluster, they
proposed three clusters of participants: (1) self-affirmers (i.e., those with low self-doubts and high
self-assets); (2) self-equivocators (i.e., those with high self-doubts and high self-assets); and (3)
self-critics (i.e., those with high self-doubts and low self-assets).

To analyze issue-supportive behaviors, they coded participant behaviors that they observed during
study 2. First, they coded participants who composted their leftover food and/or dishware as having
composted (i.e., consumption-offset opportunity). Second, participants had the opportunity to offer
feedback in their handwritten survey (i.e., qualitative survey). They binary coded each participant
who exhibited either a written or verbal complaint about environmental issues with their studies
as having engaged in an interpersonal influence attempt or not (i.e., interpersonal influence
opportunity). Finally, they examined whether participants signed the pledge to turn their lights off
for Earth Hour (i.e., collective advocacy opportunity). These opportunities data were used as the
dependent variables. To examine how different profiles of environmental issue supporters' three
self-evaluation profiles (i.e., self-affirmers, self-critics, self-equivocators) engaged in different
levels of issue-supportive action, they assigned categorical codes to each profile membership and
ran a one-way ANOVA with post-hoc comparisons. They found that self-critics engaged in the
lowest number of actions, followed by self-equivocators, and finally self-affirmers.

8.4.1.5. Mixed-Methods Data Analysis (Summary)
They used mixed-methods research to develop a theory of situated self-work and then examined
how two core constructs in this theory (i.e., self-assets and self-doubts) related to real issue-
supportive behaviors. Although they did not explicitly discuss the quality criteria of their mixed-
methods research study, their methods were appropriate for answering the research questions.
They not only did a mixed-methods study, but also embedded a multi-method element in their
study 2 (i.e., survey and quantitative/qualitative observation). They reported the study setting,
along with events that took place during the study in detail. The components of the design fit
together--the findings of study 1 were used to develop a theory that was later used to develop
another theory in study 2. In study 2, they examined self-assets and self-doubts and their
relationship with real behaviors. They transformed the qualitative observation data into
quantitative data by assigning a binary number (0 or 1). These research elements were linked
together seamlessly. They also used different data analysis methods to ensure high-quality meta-
inferences.

8.4.2. Stewart et al. (2017)
As we discussed in the previous chapter, Stewart et al. (2017) used type (7) design--i.e., a
combination of field experiment and open-ended interviews in their mixed-methods research
study. The purpose of mixed-methods research was completeness.

178 | Mixed-Methods Data Analysis Strategies
8.4.2.1. Quantitative Study
In their study 1, they adopted a longitudinal quasi-experiment design to test the effect of team-
based empowerment on team effectiveness. They collected pre- and post-intervention data for a
sample of 224 providers. They also analyzed monthly time series measures for 142 physician
providers and 82 nonphysician providers obtained seven months before and thirty-seven months
after the adoption of team-based empowerment. An important objective of the Veteran Health
Administration (VHA) transformation to team-based empowerment was improving patients'
timely access to care. Thus, to measure team effectiveness, they used the "VHA metric same-day
appointment access, operationalized as the percentage of same-day appointment requests granted
within a monthly reporting period" (p. 2272). They coded the status of each team, provided as a
dichotomous variable (i.e., 1 represented higher-status physician providers and 0 represented
lower-status nonphysician providers). To code the time variable, they used an absolute coding
scheme for discontinuous growth modeling time variables.

They reported the descriptive data and intercorrelations and intraclass correlation coefficient to
establish reliability. To analyze the quantitative data, they conducted discontinuous growth
modeling analyses using the nlme package included in the R software. They began the
discontinuous growth modeling process by first adding covariates to the model. They then tested
different forms of time (e.g., linear, quadratic) to properly model fixed effects for change
trajectories. Next, they tested variations of the basic linear model to account for random effects in
the change terms. They then added status as a predictor to model its main effect. They also added
interaction terms between status and the pre- and post-intervention time indicators to examine
whether trajectories of access significantly differ based on the status of a team's provider. To
estimate the percentage of variance accounted for by time and status, they also calculated pseudo-
R2 values. From the quantitative study, they concluded that teams led by lower-status providers
improved access at a faster rate than did teams led by higher-status providers.

8.4.2.2. Qualitative Study
In the second stage of the study, they inductively developed theory about status and team
leadership. Qualitative data were drawn from participant interviews (during the initial months of
implementing team-based empowerment and follow-up interviews one year later) conducted as
part of a larger study of VHA teams. They used a purposive sampling strategy to recruit
participants. Interviews were conducted using a semi-structured format, focusing broadly on
identifying facilitators and barriers associated with the implementation of team-based
empowerment.

They followed the procedures described by Miles and Huberman (1994). Specifically, they
followed a three-step analysis: (1) identifying themes; (2) creating categories within themes; and
(3) connecting patterns between categories. In order to guard against confirmatory bias, a research
assistant blind to both the findings and developing theory was involved in the coding process. In
the first step (i.e., identifying themes), they identified two themes: leader identity work and leader
delegation. In the second step (i.e., creating categories within themes), they identified two
categories under "identity work": (1) embracing empowering identity; and (2) protecting
hierarchical identity; and three categories under leader delegation: (1) insufficient delegation; (2)
overabundant delegation; and (3) balanced delegation. In the third step, they associated
nonphysician providers with embracing the new team-based empowerment identity. They
illustrated the qualitative findings using an explanatory effect matrix.

                                                                                                                           Chapter 8 | 179
8.4.2.3. Mixed-Methods Data Analysis (Summary)
Although the qualitative and quantitative data were collected concurrently, the data were analyzed
sequentially. Stewart et al. (2017) did not explicitly provide the quality criteria for their mixed-
methods study. Based on our reading, we argue that the methods were appropriate to answer the
research questions. The quantitative and qualitative strands of the study addressed different
research questions and together they provided a complete picture of the phenomenon. In study 1,
their findings confirmed the hypothesis that teams with high-status leaders were less effective in
implementing team-based empowerment. To examine leader behaviors in-depth, they conducted
qualitative data analyses, and found identity and delegation were two behaviors that facilitated
team effectiveness. Due to the richness of the qualitative data, they should have used different
visual formats to display their findings. For example, they can use a time-ordered matrix to show
the flow and sequence of the impact of team-based empowerment. However, the integration of
findings was well reported. They integrated the qualitative and quantitative findings and illustrated
them using a causal model (Figure 8-2).

          Figure 8-2. Example of Joint Display Quantitative and Qualitative Findings

                                            Summary

· The main objective of data analysis in mixed-methods research is to enable researchers to use
    both of the qualitative and quantitative types of analyses simultaneously or sequentially in the
    same study or research program.

· The critical criteria that researchers need to consider during the data analysis phases include:
    (1) number of data types that will be analyzed; (2) number of data analysis types that will be
    used; (3) time sequence of the analysis; (4) priority of analytical components; (5) number of
    analytical phases; and (6) analysis orientation.

· Prior to considering the quality of mixed-methods research, researchers need to describe and
    report the accepted criteria for the qualitative and quantitative strands of the study. Validity in
    quantitative research can be categorized into three groups: (1) measurement validity--e.g.,
    content and construct validity; (2) design validity--i.e., internal and external validity; and (3)
    inferential validity--e.g., statistical conclusion validity. Validity in qualitative research can be
    categorized into three groups: (1) design validity--e.g., descriptive validity, credibility,
    transferability; (2) analytical validity--e.g., theoretical validity, dependability, consistency,
    plausibility; and (3) inference quality--e.g., interpretive validity, confirmability.

180 | Mixed-Methods Data Analysis Strategies
· There are two quality domains that have been widely discussed in mixed-methods research:
    (1) design quality--i.e., degree to which a researcher has selected the most appropriate
    procedures for answering the research questions; and (2) interpretive rigor--i.e., degree to
    which one has made credible interpretations based on the obtained results.

                                            Exercises

1. Revisit the research proposal you developed in Chapter 7. Describe how the selection of your
    data analysis methods are informed by six criteria of mixed-methods data analysis discussed
    in this chapter.

2. Select one or two articles in your field that has used a mixed-methods research approach and
    answer the following questions:
    a. How did the authors present their data and findings? What types of displays did the authors
         use?
    b. How did the authors validate their data?
    c. If the quality of mixed-methods research was not reported, explain whether or not the
         authors met the quality criteria of mixed-methods research.

    MAKING CONTRIBUTIONS AND PUBLISHING PAPERS

                USING MIXED-METHODS RESEARCH

In the third and final section of the book, we discuss the unique aspects of mixed-methods research
in terms of crafting contributions and publishing papers. We begin in Chapter 9. Mixed-Methods
Research and Big Data Analytics with a discussion of how trends of massive amounts of
numerical, text, and other forms of non-numerical data today can be leveraged to generate rich
insights and consequent contributions. In Chapter 10. Generating Meta-Inferences in Mixed-
Methods Research, we discuss three theoretical reasoning techniques for generating meta-
inferences. We also discuss convergence and divergence in meta-inferences and various strategies
to address divergence meta-inferences. We recommend readers review Chapter 8 on quality
criteria in mixed-methods research to assess the credibility and trustworthiness of meta-inferences.
We then focus on various practical issues in publishing a mixed-methods research paper. In
Chapter 11. Mixed-Methods Research Paper Templates, we provide a number of templates that
researchers can use to develop and structure their mixed-methods paper. We specifically offer

 MIXED-METHODS RESEARCH AND BIG DATA ANALYTICS

The rapid development of technology and the associated collection of data over the past few years
has led to the availability of a massive amount of diverse data, commonly referred to as "big data"
(Tay et al., 2018; Wamba et al., 2015). Big data can be thought as "data whose scale and
complexity go beyond typical database software tools, requiring new technical architectures and
analytics to enable insights that unlock new sources of business value" (Tay et al., 2018, p. 661).
The opportunities associated with this type of data have generated significant interest in various
ways of analyzing the data including techniques, technologies, practices, methodologies, and
applications that facilitate the analysis of unstructured data and generation of richer insights (H.
Chen et al., 2012).

In this chapter, we discuss how mixed-methods research and different ways of mixing qualitative
and quantitative strategies dovetail with analytics research, especially given the widespread
availability of different types of data, ranging from numerical data to text data to audio and video
data that could be codified as both quantitative and qualitative data. Whereas quantitative research
provides numerical and thematic analysis, qualitative research offers insights that enhance
meaning and understanding (Frizzo-Barker et al., 2016). Both types of methodologies are valuable
to unravel relationships or insights that may exist in large-scale datasets. Together, both
quantitative and qualitative research can provide a basis for the investigation of a variety of
problems in big data analytics endeavors. We first discuss the properties of big data and analytics
and then propose several mixed-methods design strategies that can be used in analytics research.

                               9.1. Big Data and Analytics

Big data describes "data that are `generated from an increasing plurality of sources, including
Internet clicks, mobile transactions, user-generated content, and social media as well as
purposefully generated content through sensor networks or business transactions such as sales
queries and purchase transactions'" (Lehrer et al., 2018, p. 428). The big data era is interconnected
with the development and extensive use of social media platforms (e.g., blogs, Facebook, Twitter,
YouTube), as well as the rise of wearable (e.g., smartwatches) and mobile technologies (e.g.,
smartphones) that generate quantitative and qualitative data (Hesse et al., 2019). Big data are
characterized by volume (i.e., "large volume of data that either consume huge storage or consist of
large number of records"), variety (i.e., "data generated from greater variety of sources and
formats, and contain multidimensional data fields," velocity (i.e., "frequency of data generated
and/or frequency of data delivery"), veracity (i.e., "inherent unpredictability of some data requires
analysis of big data to gain reliable prediction"), and value (i.e., "the extent to which big data
generates economically worthy insights and or benefits through extraction and transformation")
(Wamba et al., 2015, p. 236). If a dataset can be characterized by at least two of these properties,
it can be considered big data (Gorodov & Gubarev, 2013; Tay et al., 2018). For example, online
customer review data can be considered as big data because of its high volume, velocity, and
variety (Zhou et al., 2018).

Analytics techniques refer to scalable techniques, such as text analytics and web analytics, that
enable researchers to process and analyze big data (e.g., digital records and activities from websites

                                                                                                                           Chapter 9 | 187
and social media including users' online activities and online conversations) (Lehrer et al., 2018).
Many tools and techniques for data mining and analysis are available. Table 9-1 provides an
overview of key analytics techniques. First, general analytics techniques involve processing of
data from different sources in different formats (Choi et al., 2018). Data sources can be from
Internet clicks, social media networks, sensors, web service data, and Internet of Things devices
(e.g., power meters) (Mohamed et al., 2020). The various formats of data in analytics research
include: (1) structured data (i.e., data with a specific format and a relational structure); (2)
unstructured data (i.e., data that do not follow any specific format, such as videos, text, time
information, and geographic location); and (3) semi-structured (i.e., data with a mix of structured
and unstructured elements) (Mohamed et al., 2020). General analytics techniques rely on mature
commercial technologies of relational DBMS, data warehousing, ETL, and OLAP. Various data
mining algorithms (e.g., C4.5 algorithm to generate a decision tree, k-means, support vector
machine) that cover classification, clustering, regression, association analysis, and network
analysis have been used to incorporate commercial and open source data mining systems (H. Chen
et al., 2012). The most commonly used data analytics approaches include multivariate statistical
analysis, optimizing techniques and heuristic search, statistical machine learning techniques,
spatial data mining approach, and data mining for high-speed data streams and sensor data.

                                        modeling for mobile apps

Second, text analytics refers to the process of automatically extracting quantitative data from text
(e.g., email communication, corporate documents, webpages, social media content, online
reviews) (Allahyari et al., 2017; H. Chen et al., 2012). Some techniques used to process such data
include information retrieval and query processing techniques (e.g., vector space model, Boolean
retrieval model, probabilistic retrieval model), text representation techniques (e.g., statistical
natural language processing (NLP) techniques for lexical acquisition, word sensing
disambiguation, part-of-speech-tagging (POST), probabilistic context-free grammars),
information extraction techniques (e.g., NER: Named Entity Recognition) (H. Chen et al., 2012),
supervised and supervised learning methods, and probabilistic methods for text mining (e.g.,
probabilistic latent semantic analysis) (Allahyari et al., 2017). Text analytics techniques can help
researchers analyze a massive amount of text data and discover knowledge that may be hidden in
the text (Hu & Liu, 2012). In Chapter 5, we discussed the concept of quantitizing in the context of
mixed-methods research--text analytics is thus quantitizing (i.e., transforming qualitative data
into numerical, quantitative data for further analysis). For example, Raman et al. (2022) converted
sentiments conveyed in news articles into quantitative data that were then analyzed using various
quantitative techniques.

Third, web analytics aims to measure and understand the relationship between customers and a
website (Phippen et al., 2004). Web analytics techniques are built on data mining and statistical
analysis foundations of data analytics and on information retrieval and NLP models in text
analytics (H. Chen et al., 2012). Website crawling/spidering, webpage updating, website ranking,
and search log analysis are some of the techniques that researchers can use to gather and analyze
large-scale datasets generated from the web.

Fourth, network analytics refers to the process of analyzing network data with entities being
modeled as nodes and their connections as edges, comprising large networks (Przulj &
Malod-Dognin, 2016). Network analytics is built on the earlier citation-based bibliometric
analytics to include new computational models for online community and social network analysis
(H. Chen et al., 2012). Network analytics investigates the relations among various relationships in
the network (e.g., the formation of clusters) and the influence of structural properties of networks
and social relations on social integration (Hollstein, 2014). Various social network theories,

190 | Big Data Analytics
network metrics, topology, and mathematical models have been developed to understand network
properties and relationships. For example, Benson et al. (2016) proposed a scalable heuristic
framework for grouping entities based on their wiring patterns and using the discovered patterns
for revealing the higher-order organizational principles of several real-world networked systems.
Another network analytics technique that has gained popularity in recent years is the use of
visualization tools to present and understand information drawn from a large-scale dataset.

Fifth, mobile analytics refers to techniques used to analyze clickstream data logs and sensor data
(e.g., location data) generated by mobile devices to provide insights on customers' mobile
activities and movement patterns (Lehrer et al., 2018). The number of downloads and the direct,
quantitative measurement of use, habit, and engagement are some of the types of data that can be
analyzed using mobile analytics techniques (Han et al., 2016). The most common mobile analytics
techniques include mobile sensing apps that are location-aware and activity-sensitive, mobile
social innovation for m-health and m-learning, mobile social network and crowdsourcing, mobile
visualization, and personalization and behavior modeling for mobile apps (H. Chen et al., 2012).

The various analytics techniques, discussed in this chapter, can be used in either qualitative or
quantitative research. An example of quantitative research in the analytics context is a study by
Wang et al. (2020). Wang et al. used an analytics approach to address the following research
question: "how does environmental crowdedness moderate the impact of non-customized
information-only posts on (1) unfollowing and (2) long-term sales?" (p. 1522). They leveraged a
longitudinal dataset from a large Chinese fashion retailer who regularly posted on WeChat, which
is the leading Chinese mobile social media platform. Their quantitative data captured the retailer's
social media posts during a five-month period, as well as the hourly purchases and unfollowing of
the focal retailer's approximately 80,000 followers. They ran a pooled regression and a
discontinuous regression to analyze the data. They found that changes in unfollowing and
long-term sales were larger when firms post in densely populated areas or when they post at times
of peak travel stress, thus suggesting that "the stress formed by personal crowding and the
follower's environment may play a key role in followers' reactions to social media postings" (p.
1521).

An example of qualitative research in the analytics context is Karamshuk et al. (2017). They
conducted a case study of Twitter responses to high-profile deaths by suicide. To analyze public
discourses on social media relating to high-profile suicides, they selected five highly publicized
cases. They collected five datasets of related Twitter posts for twenty days following each death.
They proposed a semi-automated coding approach to analyze the large-scale data: an approach
that starts with manually bootstrapping a coding scheme from a micro-scale sample of data,
followed by a crowdsourcing platform to achieve a meso-scale model and machine learning to
build a macro-scale model. Using this approach, they showed that it is possible to code text-based
data automatically in a large dataset to a high degree of accuracy.

A wide variety of data (e.g., text-based data, numerical data) with high volumes (large-scale data),
high velocity (high-speed data), and with a high level of veracity offers opportunities for
mixed-methods research. Integrating semantically rich data (i.e., text-based data) and numerical
data (e.g., transactional data, activity logs) provides researchers with new opportunities for
discovering new values, helps us to gain an in-depth understanding of the hidden values, and poses
new challenges (M. Chen et al., 2014). As noted earlier, conducting analytics research using a

                                                                                                                           Chapter 9 | 191
mixed-methods approach should involve at least one qualitative data strand and one quantitative
data strand (i.e., multistrand designs) or a sequential analysis of one type of data (i.e., monostrand
design with quantitizing--qualitative data are transformed into quantitative data (e.g, Raman et
al., 2022)--and qualitizing--quantitative data are transformed into qualitative data). Regardless
of the number of data types being analyzed, analytics research using a mixed-methods approach
can benefit from the use of visualization tools.

         Analytics Research Using Mixed-Methods Multistrand Designs
As discussed in earlier chapters, mixed-methods research with a multistrand design contains at
least two research strands. Each strand consists of a complete quantitative cycle (including
quantitative data collection and analysis) and a complete qualitative cycle (including qualitative
data collection and analysis). The integration can take place during the conceptualization, data
collection, data analysis, or inferential stage. When researchers adopt a multistrand design in
analytics research, they generally mine the patterns from large-scale data in various formats (e.g.,
the aggregation of email, Twitter feeds, Facebook posts, and other forms of social media that
convert and store human interaction as numerical, text, geographic, or visual data). They then
uncover insights from such data not only by applying traditional inferential statistics (e.g.,
ANOVA, regression analysis) and qualitative analysis (e.g., coding of interviews), discussed in
Chapter 7, but also by making use of data mining and machine-learning algorithms to analyze both
quantitative and qualitative data (Müller et al., 2016).

When adopting a mixed-methods multistrand design, researchers need to decide the sampling
methods employed in their mixed-methods research, whether the sample for quantitative and
qualitative strands of the study are identical or whether they overlap (see Chapter 5). After data
are collected, researchers may choose among different types of analytics techniques (see Table
9-1) to process their quantitative and qualitative data independently. Going back to the purposes
of mixed-methods research, if the purposes are corroboration or complementarity, it is more
desirable to analyze quantitative and qualitative data simultaneously, rather than sequentially. This
is because simultaneous data analysis allows researchers to validate and corroborate results at the
same time, and increase explanatory power as well as the generalizability of the results by
generating a broad and comprehensive understanding of the phenomenon under study (Hollstein,
2014). However, if the purposes are compensation, developmental, or expansion, researchers are
encouraged to adopt a sequential mixed-methods analysis design because one method is meant to
deepen and further elucidate the results of another method.

An example of analytics research that adopts multistrand designs is Wu et al. (2017). They
developed an assessment that helps firms identify decisive attributes and enhance their
understanding of supply chain risks and uncertainties (SCRU) by aggregating various types of
data, including quantitative data from business operations and qualitative data from management
and social media data. Although they did not explicitly report that they conducted mixed-methods
research, our assessment revealed that they adopted a concurrent mixed-methods design with a
completeness purpose. They gathered social media data and performed content analysis to capture
fragmented terms and frequencies from several LED firms' websites in Taiwan. The analysis
established the existence and frequency of SCRU attributes. They converted qualitative social
media data into quantitative data (i.e., quantitizing). They used a fuzzy Delphi method (FDM) and
a grey Delphi method (GDM) to convert the qualitative data into quantitative data. They also
obtained quantitative data from financial statements as well as daily operational information,

192 | Big Data Analytics
which includes input and output of raw materials, production time, and number of defective units
over the past decade (total 1,951,749 sets of data). They quantitatively transformed the data to a
manageable scale. They used several different techniques (e.g., decision-making matrix, causal
diagram) to aggregate the qualitative and quantitative findings. The process of data analysis is
illustrated in Figure 9-1 (adapted from Wu et al., 2017). The results revealed that capacity and
operations had greater influence than other supply-chain attributes did and that risks stemming
from triggering events were difficult to diagnose and control.
In this example, although the researchers performed a quantitizing technique, qualitative and
quantitative data remain as distinct datasets. The aggregated entropy weights (i.e., the results of
the quantitized) and quantitative transformations were then incorporated into the decision-making
matrix. Subsequently, a causal diagram was generated and compared with the initial expert
judgments gathered in the early stage of the study.

         Analytics Research Using Monostrand Conversion Designs
Another popular mixed-methods design in analytics research is a monostrand conversion design
(i.e., a single strand study in which research questions are answered through an analysis of
transformed data, see Chapter 5 for details). In this design, qualitative and quantitative datasets are
merged using computational techniques (e.g., qualitative coding is transformed into numerical
values for various statistical analyses, such as frequency counts and measures of association)
(O'Halloran et al., 2018). One popular quantitizing technique is text mining or text analytics. The
schema of preprocessing text before performing text mining is illustrated in Figure 9-2 (adapted
from Jo, 2019). Researchers first index a text into a list of words. This step is needed for encoding
text into a structured form. The list of nouns, verbs, and adjectives is usually the output of text

194 | Big Data Analytics
indexing. The output of text indexing is used in the second step--text encoding (i.e., "the process
of mapping texts into numerical vectors" (Jo, 2019, p. 57). A list of words that is generated from
the previous step is given a collection of feature candidates or dimensions, values are assigned to
selected features, and a numerical vector is constructed as the representation of text. This step
occurs when text is converted into numbers using different techniques, such as the wrapper
approach (i.e., schema where dimensions are added or deleted) and principal component analysis
(i.e., dimension reduction scheme where the covariance matrix is made from the input vectors
where all feature candidates are used, and Eigen values are computed to reduce the number of
dimensions). Next, researchers can use text association techniques. Text association refers to "the
process of extracting association rules as the if-then template from word sets or text sets" (p. 59).
Association rules are extracted from word sets or text sets using an association algorithm, such as
A priori algorithm. The results from executing the text association are used for displaying the
directional relationships among blocks of text (e.g., A  B  C).

               Figure 9-2. Text Indexing and Encoding Process for Text Analytics

Text categorization is one way to perform text mining (Jo, 2019). Text categorization also involves
transforming text data into numerical data (i.e., quantitizing). It is the process of assigning one or
some of the pre-defined categories to each text through three steps: (1) preliminary task; (2)
learning; and (3) classification (see Figure 9-3). First, researchers should pre-define a list or a tree
of categories as the frame for classifying data items. In most cases, prior theories are needed as a
foundation for creating a pre-defined list or categories. Once the predefined list is established and
the decision of which classification or machine learning algorithm is selected, sample text is
allocated to each category. All sample text is indexed into a list of words that are called feature
candidates. During the learning process, the classification capacity that is given as one of various
forms, such as equations, symbolic rules, or optimized parameters, is constructed. After the
learning process, text data, separated from the sample text, are classified. Depending on the
classification performance, researchers then decide whether the classification algorithm is
appropriate.

                      Figure 9-3. Text Categorizing Process for Text Analytics

An example of an analytics study that adopts a monostrand conversion design is Zhou et al. (2018).
They investigated the impact of online customer reviews on customer agility and product
performance. The purposes of their mixed-methods research were completeness and
complementarity. They collected data on the mobile game apps segment from the U.S. Apple app
store. They measured product performance based on app sales ranking and review volume as the

                                                                                                                           Chapter 9 | 195
total number of online customer reviews available. To measure customer agility, they obtained
online review data from 2.4 million unique customers that contain rich data including product
details and review details. They developed a singular value decomposition-based semantic
keyword similarity method to quantify customer agility using large-scale customer review text and
product release notes (i.e., quantitized). They first performed standard text data preprocessing on
customer reviews and product release notes. They then represented each text document with a bag
of words (i.e., nouns, verbs, and adjectives), extracted a keyword list using the standard TF-IDF
scheme (i.e., a statistical measure that evaluates how relevant a word is to a document in a
collection of documents), and used the list to construct a keyword-by-keyword matrix with each
cell containing the Salton Cosine Similarity between the two corresponding keywords. They used
the SDV technique to reduce the keyword dimensionality. The process of calculating customer
agility, drawing from Zhou et al. (2018), is presented in Figure 9-4. Finally, they regressed review
volume and product performance on customer agility. They found that review volume had a
curvilinear relationship with customer agility and customer agility had a curvilinear relationship
with product performance.

                         Figure 9-4. Process of Calculating Customer Agility
In this example, customer agility was computed by transforming the qualitative data into numerical
values. Mixing the qualitative and quantitative strands took place at all stages, with the qualitative
data being quantitized. The quantitized data were then analyzed using only one type of method--
in this case, quantitative analysis).

         Using Visualization in Analytics Research with Mixed-Methods Designs
Visualization is a popular technique to bring qualitative and quantitative data together visually to
discuss the integrated analysis and garner insights (O'Halloran et al., 2018). It is effective not only
to present essential information in vast amounts of data, but also to aid complex analyses (Keim
et al., 2013). Although big data visualization may not be substantially different from traditional
small data visualization, big data visualization in mixed-methods research focus on visual
analytics--"a combination of `automated analysis techniques with interactive visualization for an
effective understanding, reasoning and decision making on the basis of very large and complex
datasets'" (Tay et al., 2018, p. 664). For example, visual analytics can show statistics-by-themes

196 | Big Data Analytics
and side-by-side comparisons, and connect research findings to theoretical frameworks and
recommendations (Guetterman et al., 2015; O'Halloran et al., 2018).

To visualize the findings of quantitative and qualitative research strands in analytics research,
researchers need to visually deal with a massive number of data points. There are methods for
reducing data points, dimensions, and clutter in order to produce better visual information. These
methods include the aggregation or simplification of data, data subset (i.e., selecting only a portion
of relevant data rather than the entire dataset), jittering (i.e., "a method to add random noise to the
data samples so that points are not plotted at a specific location"), and data binning (i.e., "a
technique for data visualization of grouping a dataset of N values into fewer than N discrete
groups") (Tay et al., 2018, p. 666).

Researchers also need to recognize various attributes in their visual presentations. Because a large
number of data points and different types of data will often need to be presented together (e.g., text
and numeric data), researchers first need to carefully select their visualization types (e.g.,
comparing categories, assessing hierarchies, showing changes over time, plotting connection and
relationship, and mapping geospatial data) (Tay et al., 2018). Each visualization type has its own
characteristics that can help researchers best translate their data into visual elements. Researchers
can use various types of visual presentations, depending on: (1) the analysis goal; (2) interaction
(i.e., level of details to be shown); (3) user (i.e., level of users' visual literacy); (4) dimensionality
(i.e., number of variables researchers wish to visualize); (5) cardinality; and (6) data type (i.e.,
types of data to be analyzed) (Golfarelli & Rizzi, 2020). Table 9-2, adapted from Golfarelli and
Rizzi (2020), lists different types of visualization from which users can select, depending on these
six dimensions.

Visualization is generally used in tandem with other analytics approaches. For example,

O'Halloran et al. (2018) proposed a digital mixed-methods design by integrating data
transformation and visualization. This technique involves: qualitative analysis  transformation
to quantitative data  data mining (quantitative analysis)  visualization  qualitative

exploration.

Using this design path, qualitative analyses of text, images, and other types of non-numeric data
can be transformed into quantitative data using digital tools (e.g., multimodal annotation software).
These quantitized results are analyzed using machine-learning techniques. After that, the findings
are visualized to help qualitative interpretations and explanations of large datasets. Qualitative and
quantitative strands are integrated in relation to the design of the study, the method, interpretation,
and reporting (O'Halloran et al., 2018).

To illustrate the use of visualization in mixed-methods research, we use the study reported in Dong
et al. (2018). This study qualifies as mixed-methods research because it used both qualitative and
quantitative data (i.e., concurrent mixed-methods design). Drawing on systemic functional
linguistics (SFL) theory, Dong et al. (2018) proposed a framework that taps into unstructured data
from financial social media platforms to assess the risk of corporate fraud. They employed a

198 | Big Data Analytics
dimension reduction technique (principal component analysis) for the TF-IDF feature selection.
They used support vector machine (SVM) for document classification. For comparison purposes,
they also implemented logistic regression (LR), neural networks (NN), and decision tree (DT).
They used accuracy, recall, F1 score, and the area under the receiver operating characteristic
(ROC) curve (AUC) to evaluate the quality of trained classifiers. They used a web crawling
technique to gather financial social media data on the SeekingAlpha platform. They also gathered
the financial ratios and text content of the MD&A section from the annual financial statements of
the firm. They used the Stanford CoreNLP toolkit to analyze the social media content. Their
framework automatically extracted signals, such as sentiment features, emotion features, topic
features, lexical features, and social network features, that were then fed into machine learning
classifiers for fraud detection. Using the SVM model with the best performance, they investigated
each set of social media features independently. They used a line graph to visualize these models
(see Figure 9-5). They were able to compare different signals and display the comparisons using
the graph. As can be seen in Figure 9-5, reproduced from Dong et al. (2018, p. 475), they found
that topic features were most predictive of fraud.

     Figure 9-5. Performance of Classification Using Each Set of Social Media Features
Visualization is not only important in presenting data, but also valuable in exploring and analyzing
data. The particular strength of visualizations lies in their ability to trigger cognitive responses that
are difficult to obtain by other means (Molina et al., 2014). Using visualization in mixed-methods
research can transform a researcher from being a passive transmitter of knowledge, who collects
and analyzes data, to an active researcher who co-constructs knowledge with participants via
visualization (Onwuegbuzie & Dickinson, 2008). This is particularly true for analytics research
that deals with big data.

                                                                                                                           Chapter 9 | 199
     9.2. Building Theory in Analytics Research Using a Mixed-Methods
                                                Approach

Although one can use mixed-methods research to test and build theory, when it is applied to
analytics research, researchers have a greater opportunity to build theory using large-scale datasets
(i.e., data-driven research approach). A mixed-methods approach to analytics research not only
allows researchers to observe psychological and behavior elements that could not be observed
using conventional quantitative methods, such as a survey, but also enable them to include
unconscious behaviors and emotional states of customers or users into the analysis that can hardly
be observed using qualitative methods, such as interviews (Kar & Dwivedi, 2020). Findings from
analytics techniques, such as natural language processing, can be used to uncover factors or
constructs that may be further used for theoretical model development (Kar & Dwivedi, 2020).
When researchers employ mixed-methods research in the context of analytics work, they not only
report what they observe in the data, but also are tasked to uncover relationships that are hidden in
large-scale datasets by analyzing and interpreting data from a pragmatic perspective (O'Halloran
et al., 2019). Consequently, a mixed-methods approach in analytics research offers important
knowledge and insights that a single method cannot offer.

We propose a framework (see Figure 9-6) to use a mixed-methods approach in analytics research
to build theory. First, researchers need to begin with research questions. As we discussed in earlier
chapters, research questions should drive the selection of the research method. Although research
questions can come from a gap in the literature and conflicts in results in the literature (Creswell
& Creswell, 2018), it is common for analytics research to start from data (data-driven) (Maass et
al., 2018). Data-driven research uses exploratory approaches to analyze big data to extract
scientifically interesting insights (Kitchin, 2014; Maass et al., 2018). Researchers can also combine
theory-driven and data-driven approaches to strengthen the outcomes of mixed-methods research.
If researchers do not consider domain theory in their analytics research, they can skip the theory
step and directly determine the purpose of mixed-methods research (see Chapter 4).

Next, researchers should decide whether they will adopt a mixed-methods monostrand design or
multistrand design and determine their mixed-methods research designs (e.g., concurrent or
sequential; equal-status or dominant-less dominant status design). After collecting large volumes
of data, it may be necessary for researchers to undertake data cleaning based on their research
questions and transform the data (say by quantitizing). For example, large volumes of text can be
summarized into closely grouped themes (Kar & Dwivedi, 2020). Researchers then move to the
validation and data analysis stage. If researchers adopt a mixed-methods multistrand design, they
need to state clearly when the mixing takes place (e.g., at the analysis stage and at the inferential
stage).

We refer to the integration of findings and meta-inference stage as the theory development block
(see Chapter 10 for a discussion of meta-inferences). During this stage, researchers are encouraged
to use visualization to draw their theoretical model if they use a data-driven approach. Correlations
and patterns that researchers extracted from the analysis of large datasets can yield insights into
empirically interesting phenomena, rather than predictions based on prior theory (Maass et al.,
2018). Building a cohesive body of knowledge about phenomena should be traced back to an
existing theory, when possible, even if the results may not fit the theory. Therefore, the outcomes
of analytics research can extend and refine an existing theory or even generate a new theory.

                                            Summary

· Big data describes data that are generated from an increasing plurality of sources including
    Internet clicks, mobile transactions, user-generated content, and social media as well as
    purposefully generated content through sensor networks or business transactions, such as sales
    queries and purchase transactions.

· Big data analytics refers to scalable techniques, such as text analytics and web analytics, that
    enable researchers to process and analyze big data (e.g., digital records and activities from
    websites and social media including users' online activities and online conversations). Big data
    analytics include general analytical techniques, text analytics, web analytics, network
    analytics, and mobile analytics.

· A wide variety of data (e.g., text-based data and numerical data) with high volumes (large-scale
    data), high velocity (high-speed data), and with a high level of veracity offers a new practice
    for mixed-methods research. New digital approaches to mixed-methods research include: (1)
    the use of both text-based data and numerical data; (2) one type of data is analyzed and
    transformed into another type of data (i.e., quantitized--qualitative data are transformed into
    quantitative data; qualitized--quantitative data are transformed into qualitative data); and (3)
    the use of visualization for analysis of large-scale data.

                                                                                                                           Chapter 9 | 201
· Four basic ideas and techniques for big data visualization that mixed-methods researchers can
    use are: (1) understanding different ways of processing data; (2) visually dealing with a
    massive number of data points; (3) recognizing attributes in visual presentation; and (4)
    identifying key features of interactivity and real-time visualization.

· Mixed-methods research provides opportunities for researchers to integrate data-driven and
    theory-driven approaches to research. Correlations and patterns that researchers extract from
    the analysis of large datasets can yield insights on empirically interesting phenomena that can
    be used to refine an existing theory or even generate a new theory.

  GENERATING META-INFERENCES IN MIXED-METHODS
                                   RESEARCH

After researchers analyze their qualitative and quantitative data, the next step is to develop
meta-inferences. Inferences made on the basis of the results from each strand are synthesized to
generate meta-inferences, typically at the end of the study (Teddlie & Tashakkori, 2006). Thus,
meta-inferences denote "an integrative view of findings from qualitative and quantitative strands
of mixed-methods research" (Venkatesh et al., 2016, p. 436).

A critical aspect of developing meta-inferences includes keeping one's research questions in the
foreground because, at the very basic level, inferences are answers to research questions (Teddlie
& Tashakkori, 2010). Researchers need to examine each set of data analysis outcomes separately
and evaluate how effectively they answer the relevant research question(s). After each research
question is answered, researchers should then compare and contrast the answers to different
questions and assess conceptual variations and similarities among them (Teddlie & Tashakkori,
2010). Meta-inferences, therefore, denote a coherent conceptual framework that provides answers
to research questions in mixed-methods research (Creswell, 2010).

Researchers generally develop meta-inferences through a different analysis pathway that depends
on their mixed-methods design strategies. The three most common pathways are: (1) researchers
merge the qualitative and quantitative findings to develop meta-inferences (i.e., merging of
qualitative and quantitative inferences  meta-inferences); (2) researchers first develop
quantitative inferences, followed by qualitative inferences; meta-inferences are then created based
on the qualitative inferences that have been developed by integrating the quantitative inferences
(quantitative inferences  qualitative inferences  meta-inferences); and (3) researchers first
develop qualitative inferences, followed by quantitative inferences; meta-inferences are then
created based on the quantitative inferences that have been developed by integrating the qualitative
inferences (qualitative inferences  quantitative inferences  meta-inferences) (Venkatesh et al.,
2013). Regardless of the researchers' paradigmatic stance and purposes of their mixed-methods
research, we recommend researchers use the first pathway if they use a concurrent mixed-methods
design and the second or third pathways if they use a sequential mixed-methods design..

   10.1. Theoretical Reasoning Techniques of Generating Meta-Inferences

Given that meta-inferences are essentially theoretical statements about a phenomenon, including
its interrelated components and boundary conditions, the process of developing meta-inferences is
conceptually similar to the process of developing theories from observations. The observations
here are the findings from the qualitative and quantitative strands (Venkatesh et al., 2013). Beyond
induction, theoretical reasoning techniques, such as deduction, the combination of induction and
deduction, and abduction, can be used to develop meta-inferences (Venkatesh et al., 2016).

Induction, deduction, and abduction can be distinguished from each other in two important ways:
the generality of the explanations they propose and the certainty of knowledge claims they produce
(Behfar & Okhuysen, 2018). The differences among these three methods of generating
meta-inferences are summarized in Table 10-1 (adapted from Behfar & Okhuysen, 2018).

                                                                                                                         Chapter 10 | 205

10.1.1. Inductive Theoretical Reasoning
Inductive reasoning refers to reasoning from a particular observation to a general perspective
(Johnson & Gray, 2010). It involves generalizing a theory supported in a specific setting to another
context as the theory evolves (Tashakkori & Teddlie, 1998). Inductive reasoning is a
theory-building process, starting with observations of specific instances, and seeking to establish
generalizations about the phenomenon under investigation (Hyde, 2000). It broadens the meaning
of a concept as the phenomenon and individuals under study are embedded in a larger social
context (Polsa, 2013). More generally, induction is involved in a range of cognitive activities, such
as categorization, probability judgment, analogical reasoning, scientific inference, and decision
making (Hayes et al., 2010).

An inductive argument is one in which the premise provides some, but not complete, evidence for
the conclusion (Miller, 2003). Toulmin's (2003) work on practical reasoning provides a useful
conceptual basis in explaining the process of drawing a theoretical claim using an inductive
approach (Ketokivi & Mantere, 2010) (see Figure 10-1). In Toulmin's terminology, grounds
constitute the premises of argument (e.g., data, observations, practical premises); claims can be
theoretical interpretations or empirical and theoretical generalizations. Grounds and claims appear
throughout scientific texts. Finally, warrants--"the practical standards or canons of argument"
(Toulmin, 2003, p. 91)--provide the justification for bridging grounds to claims (Ketokivi &
Mantere, 2010).

206 | Meta-Inferences
                             Figure 10-1. Inductive Theoretical Reasoning

Toulmin's framework emphasizes the important distinction between inference and explanation.
Glaser (1992) also underscores the importance of separating inference from explanation: what the
researcher finds interesting must not interfere with the interpretation of data. Whereas grounds are
empirical data, claims are theoretical conclusions. We can think of claims as explanations.
Inference, in turn, is the mechanism that bridges the grounds with the claims and warrants are "the
essence of inference" (Ketokivi & Mantere, 2010, p. 317). Therefore, induction makes knowledge
claims where "it is improbable that the premises be true and the conclusion false" (Hurley, 2000,
p. 33; see also Behfar & Okhuysen, 2018, p. 325).

One of the advantages of an inductive approach is its capability to uncover previously unknown
aspects of a phenomenon under study (Polsa, 2013). However, inferences generated using an
inductive approach often lack the solid normative foundation of deduction and thus are
"methodologically incomplete" (Ketokivi & Mantere, 2010, p. 317). Inductive conclusions contain
knowledge claims not analytically implied by premises and researchers are only able to observe
particular events, not generalities (Ketokivi & Mantere, 2010). Hume (1969, p. 139) underscores
this problem of induction by arguing that "there is nothing in any object, consider'd in itself, which
can afford us a reason for drawing a conclusion beyond it; and, that even after the observation of
the frequent or constant conjunction of objects, we have no reason to draw any inference
concerning any object beyond those of which we have had experience."

Inductive reasoning can be used in both qualitative and quantitative research. For example, Follmer
et al. (2018) conducted a qualitative study to investigate how people respond to
person-environment misfit in an organization. Based on interviews with eighty-one individuals,
they identified three broad responses to the experience of misfit: resolution, relief, and resignation.
In this example, the authors established generalizations from a specific sample to a broad, general
population. Researchers can also use inductive reasoning in quantitative research. For example,
one can use supervised machine learning (ML) methods to discover robust patterns in quantitative
data. The patterns identified by ML could be used for exploratory inductive or for post-hoc analysis
of regression results to detect patterns that may have gone unnoticed (Choudhury et al., 2021).

The applicability of an inductive approach in both qualitative and quantitative research makes it a
suitable inference-generation tool in mixed-methods research. Developing meta-inferences using
inductive theoretical reasoning enables researchers to propose theoretical relationships that are
both argumentatively plausible and statistically likely (Creswell & Plano Clark, 2018).

                                                                                                                         Chapter 10 | 207
10.1.1.1. Applying Inductive Theoretical Reasoning to Draw Meta-Inferences
Klingebiel and Joseph (2016) examined how firms made decisions about the timing of innovations,
focusing on the mobile handset industry during the feature-phone era. They conducted a
mixed-methods study by conducting interviews with managers at handset manufacturing firms and
using quantitative data from secondary sources about their firms' feature entries. They gave equal
importance to qualitative and quantitative data, and their objective was to build theory. In
developing their meta-inferences, they followed the first analysis pathway (merging of qualitative
and quantitative inferences  meta-inferences). They drew their meta-inferences using inductive
theoretical reasoning. They developed qualitative and quantitative inferences simultaneously.
Meta-inferences were then developed based on the integration of the qualitative and quantitative
inferences. Following Toulmin's framework, the authors differentiated inferences (i.e.,
conclusions based on evidence and reasoning) from explanations (i.e., authors' interpretations of
the conclusion). An example of qualitative inferences in their study was "managers at early-mover
firms deliberately compensate [for] the commercial uncertainty associated with launching early"
(p. 1010), and an example of quantitative inferences was "early movers launch significantly (0.1%
level) more features than late movers" (p. 1011). Based on these two inferences, they developed
their meta-inference: "collectively, these findings lend support to interviewees' suggestions of
greater breadth for early movers" (p. 1011).

In this example, Klingebiel and Joseph (2016) started with grounds (empirical data), then
established generalizations about the phenomenon being investigated. In both qualitative and
quantitative strands of the research, they employed inductive theoretical reasoning. Based on their
meta-inferences, they then made a broader theoretical claim: "Firms with different entry-timing
positions deliberately follow different investment strategies: early movers aim for larger, more
uncertain returns, while late movers aim for smaller, more certain returns" (p. 1010). They also
considered a number of alternative explanations to defend their claim. One was that firms with low
capabilities (i.e., firms in the narrow-late cluster) may be constrained by the frequency and speed
of feature launch. They argued that this was not the case, however. Their respondents confirmed
that most firms could access the base technologies underlying each feature because patents were
held not by rivals but by supplier (see p. 1012 for details). A second alternative explanation was
from an ecological perspective. They argued that one might suspect specialists to enter earlier into
areas close to their core through phones, with advanced technologies catering to their niche's user
needs, whereas a generalist might follow only if the new technology shows a propensity to become
integrated into mainstream handsets. They argued that this alternative explanation is more likely a
conservative bias for breadth-timing nexus because early specialists are unlikely to have broad
feature lineups. Their analysis showed that variation in the market orientation variable did not
explain heterogeneity in entry timing. They refuted possible alternative explanations by revisiting
their results and drew inferences inductively from their datasets. Through the analyses of
qualitative and quantitative data and the adoption of inductive theoretical reasoning, they built a
theory that demonstrated how firms deliberately self-select into moving early or late.

10.1.2. Deductive Theoretical Reasoning
Deductive reasoning is a theory-testing approach that seeks to test whether the theory applies to
specific instances (Hayes et al., 2010; see also Sarker & Lee, 2002). Inferences generated using
deductive reasoning are viewed, at least by some, to be stronger than inductive reasoning because
by testing a priori hypothesis, "it is impossible for the premises to be true and the conclusion false"
(Hurley, 2000, p. 33; see also Behfar & Okhuysen, 2018, p. 325). Whereas inductive reasoning

208 | Meta-Inferences
offers a probable explanation, deductive reasoning offers a certain explanation (Behfar &
Okhuysen, 2018).

We illustrate drawing inferences using deductive theoretical reasoning in Figure 10-2. In deductive
reasoning, researchers start with an abstract, general relationship among concepts based on a
theory and then move toward concrete empirical evidence (Neuman, 1997). Thus, in deductive
reasoning, there is a well-established role for existing theory because it informs the development
of hypotheses and the selection of variables. After researchers develop the hypotheses, they should
empirically test them and derive the claims or results based on the empirical evidence. Inference
in deductive theoretical reasoning is the mechanism that bridges the theory with empirical
evidence. If the theory produces acceptable predictions of the unknown (e.g., correct signs of
regression coefficients), the theory is deemed empirically adequate (Ketokivi & Mantere, 2010).

                      Figure 10-2. Deductive Theoretical Reasoning Processes

The advantage of a deductive approach is that it uses an existing theory and presumes [universal]
applicability across contexts. A theory guides the study purposefully in an empirical setting (Polsa,
2013). However, the drawback of this approach is that it is self-evident--its lack of flexibility in
addressing and adapting to empirical circumstances does not provide selection criteria for choosing
among alternative explanations (Ketokivi & Mantere, 2010; Polsa, 2013).

Deductive theoretical reasoning is commonly used in quantitative research. For example, Chen et
al. (2015) drew on dynamic capabilities theory to conceptualize the use of big data analytics as an
enterprise dynamic capability that brings competitive advantage to organizations. Using a
quantitative survey technique, they tested their model and found support for the theory--an
enterprise dynamic capability (i.e., in this case, BDA usage) affects organizational value creation.

Deductive theoretical reasoning can also be used in qualitative research. Patton (2002, p. 253)
stated that when conducting qualitative research, "the evaluator may be open to whatever emerges
from the data, a discovery or inductive approach. Then, as the inquiry reveals patterns and major
dimensions of interest, the evaluator will begin to focus on verifying and elucidating what appears
to be emerging--a more deductive approach to data collection and analysis." Theory testing by
pattern matching is an example of the use of deductive theoretical reasoning in qualitative research
(Campbell, 1975; Sarker & Lee, 2002). At the beginning of the study, a primary theory and at least
one competing theory are put forward for testing. The main theory is expressed as a pattern of
independent outcomes that are predicted to occur. Researchers then gather case data and compare
it to the predictions of the theory and of the counter-theory. Support is demonstrated for the theory
if the case data match the predicted pattern of outcomes of theory more closely than they match
the predicted pattern of outcomes for the counter-theory (Hyde, 2000). For example, Mikalef et al.
(2021) conducted a multiple-case study approach to examine the role of big data analytics in the
formation of dynamic capabilities. Drawing on dynamic capabilities theory, they compared the

                                                                                                                         Chapter 10 | 209
case study data to the predictions of the theory. They found that different combinations of
organizational inertia (e.g., economic, political, socio-technical) may hinder the formation of
dynamic capabilities, which according to the theory, is built upon three organizational processes:
sensing, seizing, and transforming. This example thus demonstrates the applicability of deduction
in qualitative research.

10.1.2.1. Applying Deductive Theoretical Reasoning in Mixed-Methods Research
Researchers can apply deductive reasoning when developing their meta-inferences if their goal is
to demonstrate how the findings are strongly tied to theories. For example, drawing on
expectation-confirmation theory, Bhattacherjee and Premkumar (2004) conducted three studies
using a mixed-methods approach to demonstrate how users' beliefs and attitudes changed during
the course of their IT usage. Their first and second studies, which were conducted using a
quantitative survey, examined the influence of pre-usage beliefs and attitudes on post-usage beliefs
and attitudes as well as intention in the end-user training contexts (i.e., rapid application
development (RAD) and computer-based training (CBT) contexts). Overall, their quantitative
findings support the predictions of expectation-confirmation theory. Two of their many
quantitative inferences were "usefulness at time t2 was explained by disconfirmation beliefs at t2
and usefulness at time t1" and "the attitude variance at time t2 was explained by satisfaction at t2 .
. . usefulness at time t2 . . ., and attitude at t1" (p. 241). These inferences are theory-driven, generated
using a deductive approach.

After analyzing the data from the quantitative studies, they conducted a content analysis of CBT
users' qualitative responses to a set of open-ended questions on what they liked or disliked about
using CBT, whether their initial expectations from CBT usage were met, and whether they
intended to use it again in the future. The qualitative data were content-analyzed into general
themes representing the main constructs. In this analysis, expectation-confirmation theory was the
main theory driving the qualitative inferences. One of the qualitative inferences was
"disconfirmation [influences] later-stage usefulness perceptions and intentions" (p. 247). Although
they did not explicitly generate and report their meta-inferences, they used deductive theoretical
reasoning to draw their final conclusions (e.g., "IT users' usefulness (the most salient belief driving
IT usage) and attitude perceptions tend to fluctuate with time"; p. 249).

10.1.3. Combination of Inductive and Deductive Theoretical Reasoning
Although researchers can adopt either inductive or deductive theoretical reasoning to develop their
meta-inferences, we recommend that they use both types of theoretical reasoning (Miller, 2003;
Tashakkori & Teddlie, 1998; Venkatesh et al., 2016). A balance of induction and deduction in
developing meta-inferences allows researchers to defend both their inference and explanation
(derived using an inductive approach) with empirical testing. Similarly, when deductive theoretical
reasoning limits researchers from justifying their findings using alternative theoretical
explanations, inductive theoretical reasoning may help researchers generate theoretical insights.

10.1.3.1. Applying Both Inductive and Deductive Theoretical Reasoning in Mixed-Methods
           Research

Califf et al. (2020) conducted a mixed-methods research study to conceptualize a holistic
technostress process that included positive and negative components of technostress embedded in
two subprocesses: the techno-eustress subprocess and the techno-distress subprocess. The purpose
of their mixed-methods research was developmental, and the design was sequential less-dominant
qualitative followed by a dominant quantitative investigation. They addressed three research
questions: (1) "what are the salient factors that determine technostress in healthcare?" (qualitative
research question); (2) "what are the outcomes of the salient factors that determine technostress in
healthcare?" (quantitative research question); and (3) "are the factors identified in the qualitative
study supported by the results of the quantitative study?" (mixed-methods research question) (p.
849).

They started with a qualitative, interpretive case study involving interviews of 32 nurses. Based
on the findings from the case study, the authors built a research model that operationalized the
concepts embedded in the holistic technostress model. They then empirically validated the model
by analyzing survey data collected from 402 nurses employed in the U.S. Whereas they derived
their qualitative inferences using an inductive approach, they used a deductive approach to derive
their quantitative inferences. They used the first analysis pathway to derive their meta-inferences
(qualitative inferences  quantitative inferences  meta-inferences). One of their many
qualitative inferences was "the appraisal of characteristics of HealthTech [are] related to
promoting job performance, tasks, and skills" (p. 855). Given the results of their quantitative data
analyses were consistent with the qualitative analysis, their quantitative inference regarding the
appraisal characteristics was the same as their qualitative inference. Based on both types of
inferences, they generated their meta-inferences as follows: "characteristics of the technology that
are related to promoting task accomplishment and/or personal development will lead to positive
psychological states" and "when nurses view the technology as conducive to completing one's
work tasks, they experience positive emotions" (p. 855).

10.1.4. Abductive Theoretical Reasoning
Abductive theoretical reasoning, or inference to the best explanation, is "a form of inference that
goes from data describing something to a hypothesis that best explains or accounts for the data"
(Josephson & Josephson, 1996, p. 5). It was proposed by Charles Peirce to indicate a form of
reasoning that moves from observations in a specific situation, information source, or data set to
an explanation that accounts for those particular observations (Anderson, 1986; Behfar &
Okhuysen, 2018). Abductive theoretical reasoning follows a distinctive rule--for example: (1) D
is a collection of data (facts, observations); (2) H explains D (H would, if true, explain D); (3) no
other alternative explanations can explain D as well as H does; (4) therefore, H is probably true
(Josephson & Josephson, 1996, p. 5). The core idea is that a body of data provides evidence for a
hypothesis that satisfactorily explains or accounts for that data (Josephson & Josephson, 1996).
Thus, an abductive approach is a kind of theory-forming or interpretive inference. It contributes to
the advancement of science by allowing for discovery through the exploration of data to produce
plausible explanations (Behfar & Okhuysen, 2018).

Abductive reasoning allows researchers to make a logical connection between data and theory,
and is often used for theorizing about surprising events (Teddlie & Tashakkori, 2009). This
connection effectively makes inference and theoretical explanation integral parts of abduction

                                                                                                                         Chapter 10 | 211
(Ketokivi & Mantere, 2010; Lipton, 2004). As explained earlier, induction emphasizes the
distinction between inferences and explanations (see Figure 10-1). Inferences are the mechanisms
that bridge empirical data and theoretical explanations, whereas theoretical explanations are an
author's interpretations or empirical and theoretical generalizations. According to abductive
reasoning, researchers have the authority to select the best explanation among the competing
explanations, and the criteria for being the best explanation are defined by pragmatic virtues (e.g.,
interestingness, usefulness, simplicity), not by truth value or even empirical adequacy; inferences
and theoretical explanations are seen as integral parts of a single process in abduction (Ketokivi &
Mantere, 2010).

The main strength of abduction is that "it is a candid description of how empirical scientists in
practice make choices in their reasoning" (Ketokivi & Mantere, 2010, p. 319). Abductive
reasoning leads to plausible knowledge claims that are untested, held tentatively, and subject to
continuous revision (Behfar & Okhuysen, 2018). Whereas deduction supports its conclusions in
such a way that the conclusions must be true, given true premises (i.e., they convey conclusive
evidence), abduction produces fallible inferences--i.e., researchers consider all possible
explanations from the data and then choose one explanation after ruling out other alternative
explanations (Josephson & Josephson, 1996). Abduction also produces ampliative inference--i.e.,
at the end of abduction, having accepted the best explanation, researchers may have more
information than they had before (Josephson & Josephson, 1996). Unlike inductive reasoning,
abduction does not rely solely on empirical data to move from the specific to the more general,
and unlike deductive reasoning, theoretical premises do not guarantee the results (Coreynen et al.,
2020). Taken together, abduction overcomes some problems associated with induction, which only
allows researchers to observe particular events, not generalities. Abduction also addresses some
problems associated with deduction, which do not provide researchers with an understanding of
how they choose among alternative explanations (Ketokivi & Mantere, 2010). Therefore,
abductive theoretical reasoning is a suitable approach to draw meta-inferences in mixed-methods
research.

10.1.4.1. Applying Abductive Theoretical Reasoning in Mixed-Methods Research
Huré et al. (2017) conducted a mixed-methods study to investigate omni-channel shopping value
(SV). The authors addressed two research questions: (1) "how can omni-channel shopping value
be modeled?"; and (2) "how can omni-channel shopping value be accurately measured?" (p. 314).
They first conducted a quantitative study to test the appropriateness of their research model, which
suggested that offline SV, online SV, and mobile SV influenced omni-channel SV. Some of their
quantitative inferences are: (1) the hedonic dimension contributed positively and significantly to
offline, online, and mobile SV; (2) the social dimension contributed positively and significantly to
the online and offline SV; (3) the joint utilitarian and social dimension contributed positively and
significantly to the mobile SV; (4) the utilitarian dimension contributed positively and significantly
to the online SV . . . [whereas] this relationship was not significant in the mobile and offline
channels; and (5) online and offline SV had significant effects on omni-channel SV, but mobile
SV had a negative, albeit nonsignificant, effect on omni-channel SV.

They then conducted a qualitative study (semi-structured interviews) to understand the findings of
the quantitative study (e.g., mobile SV had a negative and nonsignificant effect on omni-channel
SV). They adopted an abductive theoretical reasoning approach to draw inferences. Consistent
with an inductive method, they approached their data with an open mindset, putting aside existing

212 | Meta-Inferences
knowledge during the qualitative data collection and analysis. Prior knowledge was used in the
second step to discuss the emergent codes and better understand the dimensions of the omni-
channel SV. One of their many qualitative inferences was "omni-channel SV as stemming from
the SV derived from different patronized touch points [online, offline, and mobile]; the latter
themselves are formed by SV sub-dimensions--utilitarian, hedonic, and/or social" (p. 320). This
inference was consistent with their quantitative inferences. The abductive approach was
particularly useful in providing "the best explanation" to understand why their quantitative study
showed a negative, nonsignificant path between the mobile SV and the omni-channel SV. They
noted that "the lack of usability of smartphones together with the specialized usages of mobile
touch points could explain that even though the mobile SV is identified, the latter was not observed
to contribute to the global SV" (p. 322). An abductive approach was effective in this case to solve
a practical problem and resolve an anomaly (Tashakkori & Teddlie, 1998).

 10.2. Convergence, Complementarity, and Divergence in Meta-Inferences

Findings from mixed-methods research have three possible patterns: convergence,
complementarity, and divergence (Erzberger & Kelle, 2003; Venkatesh et al., 2016). If the
qualitative and quantitative inferences are consistent, or converge, then meta-inferences strengthen
the initial theoretical assumptions (Erzberger & Kelle, 2003). If qualitative and quantitative
inferences complement each other, then meta-inferences provide a more complete picture of the
empirical domain under study (Venkatesh et al., 2016). If inferences are contradictory, researchers
need to resolve the divergent findings to further understand the phenomenon under study.
Conflicting evidence between qualitative and quantitative findings and resolving the same are a
key value of conducting mixed-methods research.

There are several strategies that can be used to deal with divergent findings: (1) an appraisal of the
quality of components of mixed-methods research (i.e., checking for methodological mistakes);
(2) reanalyzing existing data and revisiting theoretical assumptions; and (3) collecting and
analyzing additional data when needed (Moffatt et al., 2006; Pluye et al., 2009). Divergent findings
(i.e., qualitative and quantitative inferences contradict each other) could be because researchers
made methodological mistakes at the initial stage of the study or the initial theoretical assumptions
are not relevant for the study context (Venkatesh et al., 2016). If the divergent findings are due to
methodological mistakes, researchers must engage in a re-examination to determine what issues
caused such divergent findings (da Costa & Remedios, 2014; Venkatesh et al., 2016).

If, however, the divergence between qualitative and quantitative inferences can be interpreted in a
sense-making plausible manner, researchers should reanalyze the existing data and revisit their
theoretical assumptions (Pluye et al., 2009). For example, in investigating the antecedents of
technostress in the context of HIT, one of the qualitative inferences of Califf et al. (2020) was "the
appraisal of the environmental conditions associated with end-user support activities focused on
responsiveness and benevolence will engender positive psychological responses" (p. 855). Their
quantitative data analysis led to a contradictory inference: "technical support was found to reduce
one's positive psychological response" (p. 855). To find the best possible explanation for this
finding, the authors revisited the qualitative data. Their re-examination of the qualitative data led
to the following best explanation: "healthcare workers specialize in a domain different from that
of technology workers, and, as our qualitative data highlights, believe that patient care is their
primary job/responsibility. Owing to significant communication gaps between nurses and
technical support (due to different domain expertise), nurses may feel that calling a help desk takes

                                                                                                                         Chapter 10 | 213
time away from patient care, leads to more frustrating exchanges, and in turn lower their positive
psychological responses." (p. 855). In this example, the process of drawing inferences using
abduction produced plausible explanations that could be subjected to additional induction and
deduction (Behfar & Okhuysen, 2018).

Researchers can also ask new research questions, collect, and analyze new data to further examine
conflicting findings (Pluye et al., 2009). By way of illustration, Moffatt et al. (2006), as cited by
Pluye et al. (2009), evaluated the impact of welfare rights advice on health and social outcomes
among a population aged 60 and over. Separate analyses of the qualitative data (n = 14) and
quantitative data (n = 126) revealed divergent findings. Whereas the qualitative findings suggested
the relationship was significant, quantitative findings indicated no significant relationship between
welfare rights advice and health and social outcomes. These divergent findings led them to collect
additional quantitative and qualitative data. They also collected a limited amount of qualitative
data on the perceived impact of resources from all participants who had received additional
resources. The qualitative and quantitative follow-up data verified the initial findings of each
study, suggesting that the positive relationship extended beyond the 14 participants in the initial
qualitative study to all those receiving additional resources. They also examined whether the
outcomes of the qualitative and quantitative components matched, and they discovered that the
outcomes that emerged in the qualitative study contained a number of dimensions not measured in
the quantitative study. In this example, the divergent findings led the authors to collect additional
data and make further comparisons that led to richer insights both about the research design and
about the phenomenon.

Venkatesh et al. (2013) suggest two approaches to develop meta-inferences when qualitative and
quantitative inferences are contradictory. First, researchers may use a bracketing approach.
Bracketing is "the process of incorporating a diverse and/or opposing view of the phenomenon of
interest" (p. 39). Bracketing is appropriate when qualitative and quantitative findings are
irreconcilable and suggest extreme results--e.g., best-case and worst-case scenarios (Pluye et al.,
2009). This approach is consistent with the notion of exploration and exploitation of breakdowns
in which empirical findings cannot easily be explained by available theories. The process of a
breakdown, along with the abductive reasoning approach, can help researchers resolve the
empirical puzzle or anomaly, leading to high-quality meta-inferences. Researchers should use a
bracketing approach if their design is a concurrent mixed-methods research design, as bracketing
allows a side-by-side, simultaneous comparison of qualitative and quantitative findings.

Second, researchers can use a bridging approach--"the process of developing a consensus between
qualitative and quantitative findings" (Venkatesh et al., 2013, p. 39). This approach helps
researchers understand transitions and other boundary conditions related to their research model
and context, and it can be used in any type of mixed-methods design with either deductive,
inductive, or abductive theoretical reasoning. Considering the divergent findings of Califf et al.
(2020), discussed earlier, they used bridging to develop their meta-inferences. After they
reexamined their qualitative data and generated the best possible explanation for their findings,
they bridged the gap and developed a meta-inference based on an integration of the divergent
findings. Their meta-inference was "healthcare workers who do not perceive end-user support as
related to proper and helpful support activities will experience a lowered positive psychological
response" (p. 855). This meta-inference acknowledges contradictory or confirmatory elements of
findings and leads to a new understanding of the phenomenon under study.

                                            Summary

· The overarching goal of developing meta-inferences is to develop in-depth theoretical
    understanding that a single study cannot offer.

· The three most common pathways to develop meta-inferences are: (1) merging of qualitative
    and quantitative inferences  meta-inferences; (2) quantitative inferences  qualitative
    inferences  meta-inferences; and (3) qualitative inferences  quantitative inferences 
    meta-inferences.

· The existing theoretical reasoning techniques, including induction, deduction, the combination
    of induction and deduction, and abduction, can be used to develop meta-inferences.

· Findings from mixed-methods research have three possible patterns: convergence,
    complementarity, and divergence.

· Three strategies that can be used to deal with divergent findings: (1) an appraisal of the quality
    of components of mixed-methods research (i.e., checking for methodological mistakes); (2)
    reanalyzing existing data and revisiting theoretical assumptions; and/or (3) collecting and
    analyzing additional data.

· Two approaches to developing meta-inferences when qualitative and quantitative inferences
    are contradictory are bracketing and bridging.

                                            Exercises

1. Select an article in your field that used a mixed-methods research approach. Discuss how the
    authors developed their qualitative and quantitative inferences. Which theoretical reasoning
    approach did the authors use?

2. Using the same article, answer the following questions:
    a. Did the authors report meta-inferences in their study? If so, what were they?
    b. If they did not, can you generate a meta-inference from the qualitative and quantitative
         findings reported in the article?
    c. Did the authors report any divergent findings? If so, how did they deal with such findings?

Note: You can also use other articles in your field or related fields that discuss various types of
meta-inferences and use different approaches to generating meta-inferences, as discussed in this
chapter, to answer the above two questions.

Despite the growing interest in mixed-methods research, the issue of how researchers should report
their findings in papers, especially for journal submission and subsequent publication, has not been
properly addressed (Creswell & Tashakkori, 2007). Once researchers have conducted research
using a mixed-methods approach and developed their meta-inferences, the challenge is to
effectively communicate the results to the audience. Although there are some guidelines on
disseminating mixed-methods research results, including Bryman (2015), Creswell (2015),
Creswell and Tashakkori (2007), and Teddlie and Tashakkori (2009), these guidelines do not
provide templates on how to organize and structure a paper that uses a mixed-methods approach.

This chapter provides mixed-methods research paper templates that can be used to organize and
structure a paper that uses a mixed-methods approach. We first discuss the construction of a
mixed-methods paper in six sections: introduction, literature review or theory development,
methods, results, discussion, and conclusions--although some variations in the structure of an
empirical mixed-methods paper exist depending on its purpose and designs. The sections
(including subsections) need not be written in the order in which they are discussed. For example,
researchers can go back and forth between the results and discussion sections, or they can combine
the data analysis and results sections when necessary. We then present different strategies for
structuring a mixed-methods paper to ensure the purpose of mixed-methods research is reflected
throughout the paper and importantly, drives the structure. General guidance on writing an
empirical journal article is available through numerous other sources including chapter 4 in
Venkatesh (2021).

            11.1. Overview of the Sections of a Mixed-Methods Paper

Here, we describe each of the sections of a mixed-methods paper, with ties to a traditional
empirical paper and an emphasis on the unique elements of a mixed-methods paper.

11.1.1. Introduction
A distinguishing feature in the introduction section of a mixed-methods paper is that the authors
provide a rationale for the methodological importance (Fetters & Freshwater, 2015). The
introduction section generally establishes the need for the research and the appropriateness of
mixed-methods research. It must consist of at least four aspects of the study: (1) the topic; (2)
research problems (i.e., practical gaps as well as theoretical gaps); (3) research questions; and (4)
the purpose of mixed-methods research. As with all research, it is necessary to establish the
relevance and importance of the topic being studied in the introduction section. This includes
identifying the problem that needs to be addressed using mixed-methods research and discussing
the importance of solutions to this problem (Creswell, 2015). After introducing the topic,
researchers should create a clear picture of the problem or issue that needs to be addressed using
mixed-methods research (Creswell, 2015).

Next, the specific problem is narrowed further into the questions of the study (Dahlberg et al.,
2010). In writing these research questions, researchers can adopt several different approaches: (1)
write separate quantitative and qualitative research questions; (2) write separate quantitative and

                                                                                                                         Chapter 11 | 219
qualitative research questions, followed by a mixed-methods research question; and (3) write only
a mixed-methods research question that reflects the procedures or the content of the study (see
Chapter 4 for details). Researchers should order these research questions to reflect the type of
mixed-methods design used in the study. After researchers formulate the research questions, they
should specifically identify the purpose of the mixed-methods research. Identifying the purpose
will also help researchers refine their research questions, if necessary (Onwuegbuzie & Leech,
2006). Based on this purpose, the claim for contributions to theory and practice should be
articulated and expanded later in the discussion section.

Although the structure of the introduction section is the same for different purposes of
mixed-methods research, the characteristics of the phenomenon being studied under each purpose
can be quite different, and these characteristics should be made clear when researchers identify
their research questions. For example, the aspects of the phenomenon being studied with
complementarity as the purpose are different, indicating that the qualitative and quantitative
strands should be used to examine overlapping aspects of a phenomenon or different aspects of
the same phenomenon (Greene et al., 1989). In contrast, a mixed-methods study with a
completeness purpose is characterized by the use of qualitative and quantitative methods to
investigate two distinct but related aspects of a phenomenon. The characteristics of the
phenomenon examined in a mixed-methods study with an expansion purpose is similar to the
completeness purpose. The difference is, with an expansion purpose, one uses qualitative and
quantitative methods to investigate two somewhat unrelated aspects of a phenomenon (Greene et
al., 1989). The goal is to expand or extend our understanding of a phenomenon using different
methods. The other mixed-methods purposes (i.e., compensation, corroboration, diversity, and
developmental) are often characterized by the use of qualitative and quantitative methods to
investigate the same aspects of a phenomenon in different strands of the mixed-methods study.
Regardless, the purpose(s) should be clearly reflected in the introduction section.

11.1.2. Literature Review/Theory Development
In this section, researchers should be explicit about their worldview (paradigm) and how it informs
their mixed-methods research project (Creswell, 2015). The explanation of worldviews or
paradigms should be clear on how the theory and rationale for the approach influences the selection
of mixed-methods research designs (Dahlberg et al., 2010). The selection of worldviews depends
on the researchers' familiarity with different philosophies and which one seems to resonate with
their research project (Creswell, 2015). However, these worldviews or paradigms should not be
the focus of the discussion in mixed-methods research. Research questions and purposes identified
in the introduction section, not paradigms, should drive mixed-methods research.

As noted earlier in Chapter 3, similar to research in general with some additions/differences, if
authors conduct theory-driven research and their study has an overall theoretical basis, such theory
should be described in this section. However, if authors adopt a data-driven approach or an
inductive technique (e.g., use big data analytics techniques to identify patterns that represent
relationships among concepts), there might not be a strong theoretical basis for the questions being
studied (Maass et al., 2018). Authors are still encouraged to present a relevant literature review
that helps to explain what they seek to find in a study (Creswell & Creswell, 2018) and ground
their mixed-methods work in the context of relevant prior research. However, significant emphasis
on datasets, data analyses, and implications of the findings, rather than on theory development, is
an acceptable practice in mixed-methods research with a data-driven approach.

220 | Paper Templates
As we discussed in Chapter 3, theory in mixed-methods research is used to explain, predict,
generalize, and inform the research questions and hypotheses tested in a study. It is necessary to
make theories and their assumptions explicit, describe them in detail, and suggest how they inform
a particular phase of a mixed-methods study. If the theory (theories) used in the qualitative
component of the study is (are) different from what is used in the quantitative component of the
study, researchers should clearly describe and explain the role of each theory. Further,
understanding and gaining mastery of the prior research including studies related to the
phenomenon under investigation are crucial in making good inferences (Teddlie & Tashakkori,
2009). Regardless of the design approaches to mixed-methods research, a good mixed-methods
paper should also include a comprehensive review of others' responses to similar questions about
the same or similar phenomenon proposed for the investigation (Teddlie & Tashakkori, 2009).

It is common to provide a hypotheses development sub-section in a theory-testing paper. Each
hypothesis should be stated and with sufficient argumentation to support it (Lindgreen et al., 2021).
Hypotheses are, and should be, developed from theory. That is, theory is a precondition for
deductive inferences. Hypotheses should be carefully developed because they lead to correct
operationalization of constructs and choice of research methods (Lindgreen et al., 2021).

11.1.3. Research Methods
The structure of the methods section varies, depending on the purpose of mixed-methods research
and consequent methods used. The other two major design elements that influence the structure of
this section are time orientation (i.e., concurrent and sequential mixed-methods designs) and status
of mixed-methods research (i.e., equal and dominant-less dominant status designs). We will
discuss different structures of the methods section in the Paper Templates Based on Purposes of
Mixed-Methods Research section of this chapter.

The method section should at least include sampling design, data collection, and data analysis
strategies for the qualitative and quantitative strands of the study. A clear rationale for design
decisions appropriate for the research project should be provided. In the data analysis subsection,
authors should describe the steps they took to analyze data obtained through the data collection
strategies. In analytics research, for example, data extraction techniques and algorithms used to
analyze data should be explicitly explained. For mixed-methods research articles, explicitly
discussing the link between qualitative and quantitative data analysis approaches is particularly
important, as it will help establish the strategies for developing meta-inferences at the end of the
study (Dahlberg et al., 2010). If researchers use a monostrand design (e.g., transforming qualitative
data into quantitative data), they should describe the approach they used to transform the data, and
describe how and why such an approach is necessary in the context of their study.

In the method section, authors should explain their mixed-methods research design in detail. A
good rule of thumb to make the methods easy to follow is to describe them in the study phases as
it happened (Fetters & Freshwater, 2015). A general view regarding the method section, which is
widely shared by various bodies including the American Psychological Association (APA), is that
sufficient method details should be provided so that the research can be replicated. To
communicate mixed-methods design to readers, it is helpful to present a diagram of procedures
(i.e., a figure used to convey specific design details and procedures, including data collection and
data analysis techniques) to help readers understand the design. Based on Creswell (2015), there
are five essential parts of a diagram of procedures: (1) boxes that show the data collection and

                                                                                                                         Chapter 11 | 221
analysis for both quantitative and qualitative research; (2) a circle that shows the interpretation
phase of a study; (3) procedures attached to both the data collection and analysis phases, shown as
bullet points positioned alongside the boxes; (4) products that will result from each phase of data
collection and analysis; and (5) arrows that show the sequence of procedures (Creswell, 2015;
Ivankova et al., 2006). Using specific shapes (i.e., boxes, circles, and arrows) to convey specific
designs and procedures are a recommended practice in mixed-methods research (Creswell, 2015).

Consider, for example, a team of researchers that sets out to understand the mechanisms by which
(positive) online reviews influence online purchase decisions. After conducting an initial literature
review, they discover that existing theories are insufficient to explain such mechanisms and
conclude that a mixed-methods approach is needed to uncover different aspects of customers'
online reviews. The purpose of mixed-methods research is complementarity. Here, the qualitative
research question is: how do customers use online reviews to determine which product to buy?
The researchers decide to collect customer review data of 300 selected products from Amazon. To
gain better insights, they also transform the qualitative data into numerical data (i.e., quantitizing)
and use the transformed data to examine how online reviews are associated with numbers of
purchase transactions for products included in their sample.

In order to understand whether a secondary source of reviews will have an impact on customers'
final purchase decisions, the researchers conduct a quantitative study. Specifically, they conduct a
2x2 laboratory experiment by manipulating the number of information sources (one vs. two
information sources) and the degree of consistency of the review content across sources (consistent
vs. inconsistent conditions). Participants in the two information source conditions are asked to
make a purchase decision after they are presented with the first information source. Then, they are
presented with the second information source that could be either consistent or inconsistent with
the reviews from the first information source. Then, they are asked whether they want to modify
their purchase decision. The quantitative research question is: will the presence of competing
reviews influence customers' initial purchase decision?

Given the quantitative strand of the study is not dependent on the qualitative strand, they decide to
conduct the experiment when they are collecting their qualitative data using a data mining
technique (i.e., a concurrent mixed-methods design). After the experiment, they analyze the data
quantitatively by performing various statistical analyses. They then merge the findings and explain
how the findings from the quantitative strand provide additional insights beyond the findings from
the qualitative strand of the study.

The diagram of procedures for this illustrative study is presented in Figure 11-1. The two research
strands in this illustration assess similar but different aspects of customer reviews. The qualitative
study only focuses on the effect of online reviews from one information source on customers'
purchase decisions, whereas the quantitative study assesses different sources of online reviews.
One variation within this complementarity purpose is the use of a different type of method to gain
additional insights beyond the findings from one method (Venkatesh et al., 2013), which can be
characterized with the analogy of "peeling the layers of an onion" (Greene et al., 1989, p. 258). In
this diagram of procedures, in addition to displaying qualitative and quantitative data analysis
procedures, we convey the mixed-methods data analysis procedures (i.e., using side-by-side
comparison, data transformation, and joint display). Such a figure design will be particularly
helpful for readers to understand the mixed-methods research.

11.1.4. Results
The methodology and results section should have parallel structures (Dahlberg et al., 2010). They
share the responsibility for providing information that supports the reliability and validity of the
substantive findings (Bem, 2003). The results section can be organized by adding several
sub-sections that line up with the data analysis description outlined in the previous section
(Dahlberg et al., 2010). Although the content may vary, depending on the type of method
researchers use and how detailed the results description should be, this section should include at
least the sample characteristics (e.g., demographics) and findings of the qualitative and
quantitative data analyses (i.e., qualitative and quantitative results sections). Although separating
the findings of the qualitative and qualitative data analyses is a common practice in mixed-methods
research (Creswell & Plano Clark, 2018), integration should take place at one or multiple points
over the course of the research process (Creswell, 2015). The qualitative and quantitative results
sections help organize the findings, but one or both sections should include some mention of the
other section, or comment on how findings from one strand of the study inform, enhance, refine,
alter, or contradict the findings from the other strand of the study (Dahlberg et al., 2010), as
discussed earlier, and will depend on the purpose of the mixed-methods research.

As discussed previously, integration can happen in several areas of the study: data collection (e.g.,
researchers collected both open- and closed-ended questions during the survey), data analysis (e.g.,
researchers quantified the qualitative data), and results. In a mixed-methods study with a
corroboration or complementarity purpose, it is common for researchers to show the integration of
findings in the results section. Specifically, researchers should bring together the results of the
analyses of the quantitative and qualitative data and then compare them side-by-side. In contrast,
in mixed-methods research with a compensation, developmental, or expansion purpose, we
suggest researchers first present the results of the first strand of the study and use them to explain
the results of the second strand of the study. In mixed-methods research with a completeness or
diversity purpose, researchers should select their integration method based on their selected design
(e.g., if they use a concurrent design, they may integrate their data in the data analysis stage, and
then bring together and integrate the qualitative and quantitative findings in the results section).

Teddlie and Tashakkori (2009) suggested that researchers use visual representations (e.g., figures,
diagrams) to simplify the complex interrelationships among variables or elements inherent in
mixed-methods research. Visual representations can enhance the readability of the study for
audiences not used to seeing complex data collection and analysis procedures and interrelated
findings (Creswell, 2002). The use of visual representations also allows researchers to effectively
communicate their results to practitioners (Teddlie & Tashakkori, 2009).

11.1.5. Discussion
Although the discussion section is a common, standard feature of every social sciences empirical
paper (see Bem, 2003), there are additional sections/sub-sections to be included in a mixed-
methods paper. In addition to the implications and limitations sections, a mixed-methods paper
should include sections/sub-sections on the qualitative inferences, quantitative inferences, and
especially meta-inferences. The qualitative and quantitative inferences can be either combined
with the results section or reported separately. In either case, the inferences section should
highlight the knowledge contribution of mixed-methods research. Inferences should be based on
the findings reported in the results section and interpreted in the context of the research setting
(Teddlie & Tashakkori, 2009). When developing inferences, researchers should explain how and

224 | Paper Templates
why mixed-methods research was needed in order to achieve the initially conceptualized purpose
(Dahlberg et al., 2010). It is important to establish the credibility of these inferences by making
sure they meet the quality standards of qualitative and quantitative research (i.e., validity and
reliability tests) (see Chapters 7 and 8 for details).

One of the most important aspects in mixed-methods research that differentiates it from other
research papers is meta-inferences (see Chapter 10). In developing meta-inferences, researchers
have to integrate the qualitative and quantitative inferences and establish the quality of
meta-inferences by examining at least their design quality and interpretive rigor (see Chapter 8).
These meta-inferences should provide answers to the research questions. If the qualitative and
quantitative inferences are divergent, researchers should investigate the source of the inconsistency
and reconcile the differences. Researchers can highlight the differences or similarities between
their research outcomes and the past literature upon which they are built. Meta-inferences should
advance theory development in the field by adding to the ongoing discussion in the literature on a
topic or providing additional insights that have been overlooked or have not been acknowledged
(Creswell & Tashakkori, 2007; Venkatesh et al., 2013).

Generally speaking, the majority of social sciences journals will seek both practical implications
(i.e., research outcomes relevant to practice) and theoretical implications (i.e., how the findings
contribute to theory development in the field) (Rosemann & Vessey, 2008; Whetten, 1989). The
implications will differ greatly depending on the audience and stakeholders, and the problem
researchers set up as the main context of the study (Dahlberg et al., 2010). These implications
should be consistent with qualitative inferences, quantitative inferences, and meta-inferences
developed previously.

Next, as Bem (2003) suggested, it is necessary to discuss possible shortcomings of the study. In
addition to reporting a study's limitations, researchers should report threats that they encountered
over the course of the research process and discuss how they overcome such threats. Remind
readers of specific characteristics of the methods used and how the use of mixed-methods research
might have strengthened the study's outcomes.

Last, the discussion section should present future research directions. Researchers can identify
questions that remain unanswered and that have been raised by the study, along with suggestions
for research endeavors that would help in answering them (Bem, 2003). Of course, researchers can
also invite others to pick up where they left off (Dahlberg et al., 2010).

11.1.6. Conclusions
This section can begin by stating the most important findings of the work. Researchers should
mention that they have achieved their main purpose of conducting mixed-methods research.
Additionally, as with all conclusion sections, the golden nuggets (including key implications of
the work) should be mentioned and, we might add, with no apologies.

 11.2. Paper Templates Based on the Purposes of Mixed-Methods Research

In this section, we provide templates for structuring a mixed-methods research paper based on the
purposes of mixed-methods research. As discussed in Chapter 4, there are seven possible purposes
of mixed-methods research: (1) compensation; (2) corroboration; (3) diversity; (4) developmental;
(5) complementarity; (6) completeness; and (7) expansion. We use these purposes, along with the

                                                                                                                         Chapter 11 | 225
time orientation and the priority of different strands of mixed-methods research, as the bases for
presenting templates to structure and write a mixed-methods paper. This section is intended as a
summary and overview--and the reader is referred back to the various earlier chapters to best think
through the purpose and consequent design strategies.

Each outline we present here follows the shape of an hourglass (as discussed in Bem, 2003;
Venkatesh, 2021). It begins with broad general statements, then progressively narrows down to
the details of the study, then broadens out again to a more general discussion. To a certain extent,
the major aspects of these templates are similar to a conventional social sciences paper. However,
the order and some detailed aspects in each section are slightly different, depending on the mixed-
methods research purpose and design. These suggested structures are not meant to constrain
researchers, and other structures are indeed possible, and we encourage researchers to explore
these possibilities.

Sections 11.2.1 through 11.2.7 present an overview of the templates for papers based on each of
the seven mixed-methods purposes and the corresponding figures that present the details of the
template are shown in Figures 11-2 through 11-8 (and for better pagination, these figures are shown
after section 11.2.7).

11.2.1. Compensation Purpose
A mixed-methods study with a compensation purpose is generally conducted when the findings
from the initial data collection have been compromised due to weaknesses associated with the
method used. Thus, it is common for researchers to decide to conduct such a mixed-methods study
after the initial study has been conducted. For this reason, our recommended template for this
purpose is based on a sequential mixed-methods design. A suggested outline for mixed-methods
research with this purpose is shown in Figure 11-2. Unlike a study with a corroboration purpose,
which we discuss next, it is not necessary for a study with a compensation purpose to have an
equal status design. If the design is a dominant-less dominant status design, the less dominant
strand of the study typically only provides limited contributions to the overall study. Thus, the less
dominant strand of the study typically contains errors or major weaknesses that can only be
addressed by the dominant strand of the study. We suggest researchers present the results of the
study based on the order of their data collection and data analyses procedures, and then present the
integration of both types of data during the analysis stage. A table or figure to illustrate the
comparison of results will be useful to help readers evaluate whether weaknesses associated with
the first method have been properly compensated by the second method.

11.2.2. Corroboration Purpose
A suggested template for a mixed-methods study with a corroboration purpose is shown in Figure
11-3. Our recommended template for this purpose is to follow the logic of convergence embedded
in the classic conceptualization of triangulation, as suggested by Greene et al. (1989). This requires
the implementation of qualitative and quantitative methods to be different from one another with
respect to their strengths and limitations, and both methods are used to understand the same
phenomenon (Greene et al., 1989). The most effective way to achieve the corroboration goal is by
implementing both qualitative and quantitative methods independently and simultaneously
(Greene et al., 1989; Tashakkori & Teddlie, 2008). For this reason, one common way to structure
the methods section is to report both the qualitative and quantitative methods sections--
researchers can start with either the qualitative or quantitative method, but they should inform the

226 | Paper Templates
readers that both the qualitative and quantitative strands of the study are conducted concurrently.
Although a dominant-less dominant design is possible, we suggest that both strands of the study
be weighted equally (i.e., equal status design) to ensure the strengths of both methods are
optimized. When presenting the results of a mixed-methods study with a corroboration purpose,
we recommend researchers use joint displays or side-by-side comparisons to help readers
understand the source of the results. Researchers can then develop both qualitative and quantitative
inferences based on the results. In general, the goal of the corroboration purpose is convergence.
If the results are divergent, researchers will have to reconcile the inconsistency, as discussed in
Chapter 10.

11.2.3. Diversity Purpose
Our suggested template for a mixed-methods research study with a diversity purpose is shown in
Figure 11-4. Given the goal of a mixed-methods research project with a diversity purpose is to
uncover divergent findings, we suggest the use of multiple theoretical frameworks to maximize
the possibility of uncovering inconsistent findings. Researchers can use either a sequential or a
concurrent mixed-methods design when they conduct such a study. If they use a sequential
mixed-methods design, the order of the study depends on the design investigation strategy (i.e., a
sequential qualitative-quantitative design or a sequential quantitative-qualitative design). For
example, if a researcher's goal is to develop a theory that provides a new explanation of the
phenomenon under investigation, they can start with exploratory qualitative case studies, followed
by explanatory surveys. Researchers can also elaborate the element of priority of methodological
approach (i.e., equal status designs and dominant-less dominant status design). However, we
recommend an equal status design to ensure both qualitative and quantitative data are emphasized
equally when they are used to understand the phenomenon under investigation. Thus, stronger
inferences and the balance in results can be achieved when inconsistency exists.

11.2.4. Developmental Purpose
In a mixed-methods research study with a developmental purpose, the results from one method are
used to help develop or inform the other method (Greene et al., 1989). Thus, we recommend a
template that is based on a sequential mixed-methods research design (see Figure 11-5). By
definition, the first component of the study should be implemented first. We recommend a
combination of the methods and results sections for each component of the study (i.e., qualitative
study and quantitative study sections). The order of the components of the study depends on the
design investigation strategies. If the investigation strategy is a sequential qualitative-quantitative
design, then researchers should start with the qualitative sampling design, qualitative data
collection, and qualitative data analysis procedures sub-sections (e.g., findings from the qualitative
component of the study are used to develop survey items for the quantitative component of the
study). In contrast, if the investigation strategy is a sequential quantitative-qualitative design,
researchers should start with the quantitative sampling design, quantitative data collection, and
quantitative data analysis procedures sub-sections (e.g., findings from the quantitative component
of the study are used to determine the sampling strategy for the qualitative component of the study).
The richness of the methods section also depends on the design status, with greater emphasis
placed on the dominant strand of the study if the design is not equal. Researchers also need to be
clear on how the results of the two components of the study are related. Thus, researchers should
discuss the results of each strand of the study independently and then discuss where the merging
takes place (i.e., quantitative and qualitative results sections). Although the discussion can be
separate, we encourage researchers to integrate the qualitative and quantitative findings using

                                                                                                                         Chapter 11 | 227
figures or diagrams. Next, researchers should develop inferences for each strand of the study and
establish the reliability and credibility of the qualitative and quantitative inferences (i.e.,
quantitative and qualitative inferences sub-sections) before they generate meta-inferences in the
discussion section.

11.2.5. Complementarity Purpose
A suggested template for writing a mixed-methods research paper with a complementarity purpose
is shown in Figure 11-6. As we discussed in Chapter 5, a concurrent design is the best approach
for a mixed-methods study with a complementarity purpose because such a study aims to
investigate different aspects of a phenomenon. Thus, the template we provide for a
complementarity purpose is based on a concurrent design. The paper's structure could also be
influenced by the priority of the two different strands. If researchers use an equal-status design,
both the qualitative and quantitative strands of the study should be emphasized equally. In contrast,
if researchers use a dominant-less dominant status design, they should place greater emphasis on
the dominant strand of the study. In describing each strand of the study, researchers have to
describe how participants are sampled, how data are collected, and how they are analyzed. It is
also important to explain the rationale for selecting a particular sampling strategy (Collins et al.,
2007; Onwuegbuzie & Collins, 2007). Researchers have to explain why they use a specific
sampling strategy, how that sampling strategy is supported by theories, and how it is consistent
with the purpose of the study (Dahlberg et al., 2010). After describing how the samples are
identified/chosen, data collection methods should be explained in this section. Data collection can
be categorized into different types of approaches and each approach has to be described in its own
sub-section (Dahlberg et al., 2010). In the results section, researchers should summarize their data
and report the findings of their analyses. They should address the quantitative, qualitative, and
mixed-methods research questions by reporting the results of their main analyses. After researchers
discuss their methods and results, they should, in the discussion section, generate their qualitative
inferences, quantitative inferences, and meta-inferences. Meta-inferences should be linked back to
the research questions in such a way that meta-inferences are the answers to the research questions.
After that, researchers should provide their conclusions.

11.2.6. Completeness Purpose
A recommended structure of a mixed-methods research study with a completeness purpose is
shown in Figure 11-7. Unlike a study with a complementarity purpose, the qualitative and
quantitative components of a study with a completeness purpose cannot stand by themselves. A
single method alone is especially insufficient to provide a complete picture of the phenomenon.
For this reason, we recommend researchers integrate the qualitative and quantitative data in the
data analysis sub-section. Both sequential and concurrent designs are possible. In mixed-methods
sequential designs, one needs to complete the first strand of the study, generate inferences from
the first strand of the study, and use them to inform the next strand of the study. In contrast, in
mixed-methods concurrent designs, one needs to collect qualitative and quantitative data
simultaneously and discuss the results of the integrated data analysis. Greater emphasis should be
placed on the dominant strand of the study if the different strands are not equal. Meta-inferences
developed from a study with a completeness purpose should provide a complete picture of the
phenomenon (Tashakkori & Teddlie, 2008; Teddlie & Tashakkori, 2003). Thus, researchers should
explain how different research strands help them answer their research questions.

11.2.7. Expansion Purpose
A mixed-methods paper with an expansion purpose can be structured based on a sequential design
(Teddlie & Tashakkori, 2009). The aspects of the phenomenon investigated in the qualitative and
quantitative strands of the study need to be distinct (Greene et al., 1989). Because the second strand
of the study is implemented to expand the findings from the first strand of the study, we
recommend researchers present the methods and results sections of the first strand of their study,
and then use the inferences from the first strand of the study to formulate the research questions in
the second strand of the study (see Figure 11-8). The order is determined by the nature of the
investigation (i.e., a sequential qualitative-quantitative or a sequential quantitative-qualitative
design). For each strand of the study, researchers should report the sampling design strategy, data
collection, and data analysis strategies, with a greater emphasis given to the dominant strand of
the study. Researchers can present the results section after the methods section of each strand of
the study, followed by development of inferences and quality assessment of those inferences.
Although the analyses of qualitative and quantitative data are usually kept separate in a study with
an expansion purpose, a major challenge for researchers is to mix both methods to create
meaningful meta-inferences (Greene et al., 1989). To address this issue, we recommend
researchers collect both qualitative and quantitative data at multiple points during the study and
simultaneously analyze them to gain rich insights into the phenomenon.

                                            Summary

· A mixed-methods research paper should consist of at least six main sections: introduction,
    literature review or theory development, methods, results, discussion, and conclusions.
    However, the specific structure of a mixed-methods paper depends on the mixed-methods
    purpose and related design decisions. Authors should present the details of their mixed-
    methods designs and report the full results of their mixed-methods research.
    o Introduction: Establish the appropriateness of mixed-methods research and relevance of
         the topic being studied. It should consist of at least four components of the study: (1) topic;
         (2) research problems; (3) research questions; and (4) purpose(s) of mixed-methods
         research.
    o Literature review or theory development: Be explicit about worldview(s) or paradigm(s)
         used in the design of a mixed-methods study. If authors use a theory-driven approach, a
         theory should be used to explain, predict, generalize, and inform research questions and
         hypotheses tested in a study.
    o Methods: Include sampling design, data collection, and data analysis strategies for the
         qualitative and quantitative strands of the study. Use a diagram of procedures to help
         readers understand the design.
    o Results: Include at least the sample characteristics (e.g., demographics of respondents) and
         findings of the qualitative and quantitative data analyses (i.e., qualitative and quantitative
         results sections).
    o Discussion: Include qualitative inferences, quantitative inferences, and meta-inferences.
         The qualitative and quantitative inferences can be either combined with the results section
         (earlier) or reported separately in the discussion section. In either case, the inferences
         should highlight the knowledge contribution of mixed-methods research.
    o Conclusion: Summarize the golden nuggets from the work.

· A mixed-methods paper can be structured according to its purpose (i.e., compensation,
    corroboration, diversity, developmental, complementarity, completeness, and expansion), as
    well as its time orientation (i.e., sequential and concurrent design) and status of mixed-methods
    research (i.e., equal status design and dominant-less dominant status design). We presented
    seven templates that can be used to organize a mixed-methods research paper, and each
    template is constructed primarily based on the purpose and consequent design strategies
    underlying the mixed-methods research.

                                            Exercises

1. Develop an outline for your mixed-methods research paper. Discuss and provide the rationale
    for why the phases are ordered in the sequence you propose.

2. Design a mixed-methods research study that places greater emphasis on the quantitative strand
    and less emphasis on the qualitative strand of the study. Discuss a structure for the paper
    (various sections of the paper): introduction, methods, results, and discussion section. Note:
    participants/instructors are encouraged to discuss the variations--in terms of which strand is
    dominant and what the purpose is--as a basis to understand various possible paper structures.

          GUIDELINES FOR EDITORS AND REVIEWERS

In recent years, we have seen a growing interest in mixed-methods research in several fields and,
as we have discussed extensively in earlier chapters, the publication of papers in various journals,
including leading journals, that use mixed-methods research approaches. Many scholars are indeed
conducting mixed-methods research for the first time, often after having been trained and having
experience conducting only either qualitative or quantitative research. Even in teams of
researchers, frequently, and any researcher is likely to have typically been trained and
consequently possess expertise in only one type of method. At the same time, scholars on editorial
boards, who thus may have not conducted mixed-methods research, could be asked to evaluate a
mixed-methods methods paper. To this end, in this chapter, we provide guidelines that will assist
editors and reviewers in reviewing and judging the quality of mixed-methods research papers.
We provide a checklist of questions that editors and reviewers can use when they review a
mixed-methods research paper (see Table 12-1). This checklist is not a rigid standard or
requirement for editors and reviewers to use, but it identifies recommended elements for inclusion
that we believe to be the most important aspects of an empirical mixed-methods research paper.
The checklist provides editors and reviewers, particularly those less familiar with mixed-methods
research, a list of criteria to consider in the review process.

              12.1. Appropriateness of a Mixed-Methods Approach

The first step editors and reviewers should do when they review a mixed-methods research paper
is to check whether mixed-methods research is appropriate for the inquiry (Venkatesh et al., 2013).
For example, if the theoretical or causal mechanisms underlying a submitted manuscript is clear
and the research objective is to replicate an existing finding, then mixed-methods research may
not be a suitable approach or at least not necessary--in such a case, a length to contribution ratio
assessment is warranted for the additional space the reporting of mixed-methods research will
necessarily take. A journal that values the robustness brought forth by a mixed-methods research
approach (purpose: compensation) would value such a paper and likely value it different from a
journal that focuses on novelty and would feel mixed-methods research is appropriate only when
the purpose is something other than compensation or corroboration. Where relevant, it is
appropriate for authors to state quantitative questions, qualitative questions, and mixed-methods
research questions. Editors and reviewers should ensure research questions drive the methodology
selection. For example, if the objective of research is to identify and test theoretical constructs and
mechanisms in a new context, then an exploratory qualitative, followed by an explanatory
qualitative (i.e., sequential design) is appropriate (Venkatesh et al., 2013)--here, the purpose will
be developmental.

Editors and reviewers should further ensure the statements about value and rationale for the choice
of mixed-methods research are included in the paper (Creswell & Creswell, 2018). Editors and
reviewers may not be familiar with different mixed-methods research purposes. We urge them to
review and be familiar with the seven purposes of mixed-methods research described in chapter 4,
and evaluate how the overall research questions and objectives fit with one or more of these
purposes. Absent a clear fit, it is likely that mixed-methods research is not appropriate or at least
not necessary (Venkatesh et al., 2013). In the spirit of writing for the understanding of the readers,
especially until the norms related to mixed-methods research and the templates for how such a
paper is structured are widely understood, editors and reviewers should also make sure that authors
convey the benefits of using a mixed-methods approach.

                                12.2. Paradigmatic Stance

This issue perhaps poses the biggest challenge and associated risk in moving mixed-methods
research papers to publication. Authors for their part should strive to provide information on their
stance, and editors and reviewers should importantly keep an open mind. Given worldviews or
paradigms influence how theory and rationale for a mixed-methods approach influences the
selection of mixed-methods research designs (Dahlberg et al., 2010), editors and reviewers should
examine the appropriateness of paradigmatic assumptions that authors use in their paper. More
importantly, editors and reviewers should understand that each research paradigm has its strengths
and limitations. We encourage them to be open-minded and embrace the use of multiple paradigms
in mixed-methods research. For example, if authors use the paradigm of positivism in their
quantitative strand of the study and interpretivism in their qualitative strand of the study, then their
work should be evaluated based on these multiple paradigms. We underscore that the paradigmatic
stance should not be an obstacle in conducting or publishing mixed-methods research. Authors'
methodological selection that will follow from the paradigm choice should then be evaluated based
on the research questions they are trying to answer (Tashakkori & Teddlie, 1998).

246 | Guidelines for Editors and Reviewers
                12.3. Theory in a Mixed-Methods Empirical Paper

As discussed in Chapter 3, as with most social sciences papers, theory is an important part of a
mixed-methods research paper. If authors use a theory-driven approach, editors and reviewers
should ensure that they include and use prior theory appropriately in their manuscript. Even if a
paper is data-driven (e.g., authors use big data analytics techniques to generate a theory), editors
and reviewers should ensure that an appropriate literature review (any relevant theories and prior
studies), if applicable, is presented--although such prior work may not be sufficient to explain the
phenomenon of interest.

              12.4. Strategies for Mixed-Methods Research Designs

Editors and reviewers should ensure that authors present and explain their mixed-methods research
design and the rationale for choosing it. Although selecting all the elements of mixed-methods
design strategies are not necessary, a detailed discussion of the primary strategies (i.e., time
orientation, priority of methodological approach) should be made clear to readers. Editors and
reviewers should expect authors to name the specific type of design used so the research can be
replicated. Because mixed-methods research is considered a distinct methodological approach,
editors and reviewers should ensure that authors use appropriate, consistent nomenclature in
discussing their mixed-methods design.

It is important to ensure that the mixed-methods design strategies are aligned with the
mixed-methods purpose(s). The purpose(s) of mixed-methods research should inform and guide
the mixed-methods design (Greene et al., 1989). For example, as we discussed in Chapters 5 and
11, if the purpose of mixed-methods research is developmental, then a mixed-methods sequential
design is more suitable than a concurrent design. This perspective stems from the pragmatic
foundation for conducting mixed-methods research--the research problems, purpose, and
questions should drive the design selections. Editors and reviewers should also ensure that authors
explain how one design element decision influences another design element decision (e.g., given
mixing takes place at the inferential stage, authors decide to adopt a partially mixed concurrent
equal status design).

                 12.5. Strategies for Collecting and Analyzing Data

In reviewing the procedures, editors and reviewers should ensure that authors report the strategies
for collecting and analyzing their data in detail. Because multiple types of data are collected,
separate descriptions of methods are needed when they differ. There should be detailed and
thorough descriptions of the separate quantitative and qualitative methods, including specific
forms of quantitative and qualitative data collection and analysis techniques (e.g., procedures,
sample size, types of analysis) (Fetters & Freshwater, 2015). Editors and reviewers should also
ensure that authors develop and report strategies for the mixed-methods data analysis in which
both qualitative and quantitative data are rigorously analyzed so that useful and credible inferences
can be derived from each type of data analysis (Venkatesh et al., 2013). Authors should include a
visual depiction or diagram, such as a joint display, in their paper, especially if it will help readers
better understand the findings (Fetters & Molina-Azorin, 2019).

As part of evaluating data collection and analysis procedures, editors and reviewers should ensure
that authors follow and report the quality metrics tied to each strand of research. For example, for
quantitative research, ensure that authors report at least the reliability, internal and discriminant

                                                                                                                         Chapter 12 | 247
validity; and, for qualitative research, ensure that authors report credibility and dependability
(Teddlie & Tashakkori, 2009). For big data analytics research, it is critical for editors and reviewers
to assess data extraction techniques and algorithms used to analyze data using various validation
techniques (e.g., sensitivity analysis).

Note that the order and structure of a mixed-methods study are dependent on the underlying
mixed-methods design (see Chapter 11). For example, let's say a paper reports mixed-methods
research with a completeness purpose. The authors may have used a large-scale survey to gather
quantitative data and used the survey's findings as a basis for qualitatively interviewing several
informants to further examine the phenomenon under investigation. In this case, it may make more
sense to present the quantitative procedures first. Editors and reviewers should ensure that authors
are transparent in the details of the methods. One way to review the data collection and analysis
strategies is by using a diagram of procedures, as discussed in Chapter 11. A diagram of procedures
provides critical information that portrays the quantitative and qualitative data collection
sequencing, data collection procedures, integration, and outcomes of the various stages or steps
(Creswell, 2015).

                        12.6. Development of Meta-Inferences

Given meta-inferences are the outcomes of mixed-methods research, editors and reviewers should
be aware of the importance of meta-inferences in mixed-methods research. If authors fail to
provide and explain meta-inferences, then the key objective of conducting mixed-methods
research is not achieved (Venkatesh et al., 2013). Because meta-inferences are generated by
integrating qualitative and quantitative inferences, editors and reviewers should ensure all the
generated inferences meet the quality criteria, as discussed in Chapter 8. Specifically, inference
quality should be assessed for the overall findings from mixed-methods research (i.e.,
meta-inferences). Editors and reviewers should ensure that authors provide an explicit discussion
and assessment of how they have integrated findings from the quantitative and qualitative strands
of the study (see Chapter 8).

Authors must explain how inferences are generated. As mentioned in Chapter 10, the process of
developing meta-inferences is conceptually similar to the process of developing theories from
observations. Thus, if authors use any of the theoretical reasoning techniques (e.g., induction,
deduction, abduction), they should explicitly state those techniques. Specifying the use of
theoretical reasoning also helps confirm the role of theory in the paper. Such discussions will help
readers understand whether meta-inferences are consistent with the research objectives and help
the research/paper make substantial theoretical contributions (Venkatesh et al., 2013). We
encourage editors and reviewers to refer to Chapter 10 about how to develop high-quality
meta-inferences.

As we discussed in Chapter 10, when researchers integrate qualitative and quantitative methods,
one of the following three outcomes may arise: (1) qualitative and quantitative results may be
convergent; (2) qualitative and quantitative results may relate to different aspects of the same
phenomenon and thus they may be complementary; and (3) qualitative and quantitative results may
be divergent (Brannen, 2005; Erzberger & Kelle, 2003; Teddlie & Tashakkori, 2009). When the
findings are convergent, meta-inferences strengthen the initial theoretical assumptions that were
used to structure the research process (Erzberger & Kelle, 2003). When the findings are
complementary, meta-inferences provide a more complete picture of the empirical domain under

248 | Guidelines for Editors and Reviewers
study, which cannot be achieved by a single method alone (Erzberger & Kelle, 2003). However,
when the findings are divergent, meta-inferences are means to find new, better, complete and/or
contingent explanations for the phenomenon under investigation (Erzberger & Kelle, 2003).
Editors and reviewers should ensure that authors provide sufficient explanations for divergent
findings (e.g., reanalyzing existing data and/or revisiting theoretical assumptions).

                                12.7. Additional Elements

In addition to the primary aspects of mixed-methods research we discussed earlier, editors and
reviewers should ensure that the narrative structure of the paper is related to the design strategies
(e.g., qualitative and quantitative strands of research should be discussed simultaneously in a
concurrent mixed-methods design). For example, the discussion section should follow the
sequence of procedures used in the mixed-methods design. It should also reflect the implications
of findings from the two different research strands. Editors and reviewers should ensure the
narrative flows logically and makes sense (Fetters & Molina-Azorin, 2019).

Editors and reviewers should ensure that the discussion section articulates how the use of a
mixed-methods research approach advances the understanding of the phenomenon of interest. The
findings should be linked back to the research questions and the discussion should include the
implications of the integrated findings. If authors use a data-driven approach, they are expected to
specify how their contribution has refined existing theory or generated new theory.

                                            Summary

This chapter provides a checklist of questions that editors and reviewers can use when they review
a mixed-methods empirical paper. The criteria include:

· Appropriateness of a mixed-methods approach: Ensure research questions drive the method
    selection and the purpose of mixed-methods research is clearly stated.

· Paradigmatic stance: Ensure an explicit discussion of paradigmatic assumptions.
· Theory: Ensure that there is an appropriate discussion and use of prior theory.
· Strategies for mixed-methods research designs: Ensure the presentation and explanation of the

    mixed-methods research design and the rationale for choosing it.
· Strategies for collecting and analyzing data: Ensure the details needed to demonstrate the

    strategies for collecting and analyzing their qualitative and quantitative data are presented.
· Development of meta-inferences: Ensure meta-inferences that meet quality standards are

    presented.
· Additional elements: Ensure that the narrative structure of the paper is related to the design

    strategies and that the discussion section articulates how the use of a mixed-methods research
    approach advances the understanding of the phenomenon of interest.

      CHALLENGES AND STRATEGIES IN CONDUCTING,
WRITING, AND PUBLISHING MIXED-METHODS RESEARCH

In this chapter, we discuss a number of challenges in conducting, writing, and publishing a
mixed-methods research paper. Despite the various benefits that can be derived from
mixed-methods research, there are some challenges associated with this methodology including:
controversies related to the paradigmatic and philosophical issues in mixed-methods research; the
use of, and rationale for, mixed-methods research; the nomenclature, design, and classification
issues in mixed-methods research; problems with integration; team selection and resource issues
surrounding mixed-methods research; and problems with presentation of findings (Halcomb,
2019; Teddlie & Tashakkori, 2003, 2009, 2010). In this chapter, we detail these challenges and
provide recommendations to address them (see Table 13-1).

252 | Challenges and Strategies in Publishing
  13.1. Paradigmatic and Philosophical Issues in Mixed-Methods Research

Although mixed-methods research allows researchers to combine and integrate different
methodologies, one challenge they will face in conducting mixed-methods research is the debate
over the issues created by the incompatibility thesis--i.e., it is inappropriate to mix qualitative and
quantitative methods due to fundamental differences, e.g., epistemological, between the paradigms
supposedly underlying those methods (Howe, 1988; Salehi & Golafshani, 2010)? The debate is at
the root of mixed-methods research that the quantitative-qualitative dichotomy should remain
intact because each method has distinct assumptions about the phenomenon being studied (Salehi
& Golafshani, 2010; Tashakkori & Teddlie, 2003). True believers of each method (e.g.,
constructivists, interpretivists, positivists) argue that different methods and their findings must
remain independent, claiming, for example, interpretivism is a qualitative paradigm and
"accommodation between paradigms is impossible" as it leads to "vastly diverse, disparate, and
totally antithetical ends" (Guba, 1990, p. 81). "Both sets of purists view their paradigms as the
ideal for research, and, implicitly if not explicitly, they advocate the incompatibility thesis"
(Azorin & Cameron, 2010, p. 97). The quantitative and qualitative debate has been so divisive that
some journals have established their reputation around one specific methodology (either-or, but
not both).

One way to overcome the paradigmatic challenges is to move away from metaphysical paradigms
(i.e., the concept of paradigms used by purists who link assumptions of their chosen paradigm with
methodological traditions) to "paradigms as shared beliefs in a research community" (Teddlie &
Tashakkori, 2010, p. 14). Such a view supersedes the qualitative/quantitative dichotomies of
induction/deduction, subjectivity/objectivity, and context/generality (Morgan, 2007). As we
discussed in Chapter 2, mixed-methods research emphasizes paradigm pluralism--the belief that
a variety of paradigms may serve as the underlying philosophy for the use of mixed-methods
research (Teddlie & Tashakkori, 2010). Among other paradigmatic stances, the paradigm of
pragmatism is the most common philosophical underpinning of mixed-methods research.
Pragmatism rejects the "either-or" decision associated with the paradigm wars (Morgan, 2007;
Tashakkori & Teddlie, 2003); it accepts the use of multiple methods in one research project and
emphasizes the importance of research questions over methodologies (Tashakkori & Teddlie,
2003).

Pragmatism also opens a range of new opportunities for thinking about classic methodological
issues in social sciences (Morgan, 2007). In general, we recommend researchers, editors, and
reviewers adopt a "contingency theory for [a] research approach selection" (Johnson &
Onwuegbuzie, 2004, p. 22) that accepts that qualitative, quantitative, and mixed-methods research
are all superior [or at least appropriate] under different circumstances. It is the researcher's task to
examine the specific contingencies and make a decision about which research approach should be
used in a specific situation (Johnson & Onwuegbuzie, 2004). For researchers wishing to adopt this
approach, we suggest they read about the paradigm of pragmatism discussed in Chapter 2 (see also
Morgan, 2007; Tashakkori & Teddlie, 2003; Teddlie & Tashakkori, 2010).

If researchers try to combine two or more different paradigms, some other concerns include
whether those paradigms and more appropriately, the methods chosen can be given equal weight
(Foss & Ellefsen, 2002). Even if researchers give equal weight and value to both methods by
arguing the weaknesses of one method can be compensated by the strengths of another method, a
challenging issue may arise if the findings from one method contradict the findings from another

                                                                                                                         Chapter 13 | 253
method (Salehi & Golafshani, 2010). One way to overcome this challenge is by taking a
comprehensive, new epistemological position. Such an alternative position suggests that "within a
complex and differentiated reality, we need different and various types of knowledge" (Foss &
Ellefsen, 2002, p. 244). Knowledge gained from the qualitative and quantitative methods should
not be seen as irreconcilable pools of knowledge but as different positions on a continuum of
knowledge. We discuss several different strategies that authors can use to deal with divergent
findings in Chapter 9.

Lastly, the lack of commonality in researchers' standpoints about mixed-methods research can
hinder the research process (Salehi & Golafshani, 2010). For example, some believe that
mixed-methods research is to serve the quantitative paradigm while relegating the qualitative
paradigm to secondary status (Denzin & Lincoln, 2005), whereas others believe that
mixed-methods research should include mixing in all stages of the study. This lack of communality
can cause some confusion about the nature of mixed-methods research. To overcome this
challenge, researchers are encouraged to be more open-minded, reviewing more exemplary
mixed-methods studies, and selecting one or two and using them as "gold standard" for guiding
the research process. Several examples with various purposes have been discussed earlier and are
summarized in Table 13-2, which include the chapters in the book where we use those examples
as illustrations.

    13.2. Research Questions and Rationale for Mixed-Methods Research

Another challenge facing some researchers is assessing the suitability of using a mixed-methods
approach in their work. Some researchers adopt a mixed-methods research approach because they
believe mixed-methods research is a new approach to doing research, although a careful
investigation of their research questions suggests that a mixed-methods approach is not needed to
answer the research questions. As we discussed in earlier chapters, a mixed-methods project must
start with a research question (or a set of research questions) that drives method selection. Social
sciences researchers do consider mixed-methods as a new method to address complex research
questions (Salehi & Golafshani, 2010), but they should provide solid reasons for choosing a
mixed-methods approach and the value it will bring to answer research questions. Some scholars
report using a mixed-methods approach simply to improve the probability of publishing their
manuscripts, while in reality, such an approach is not necessary and may initially create a practical
problem--the rationale given for the mixed-methods approach may not match the actual objective
(Bryman, 2006).

If mixed-methods research is deemed appropriate, another common challenge faced by researchers
is "how to formulate appropriate research questions that leverage the synergy of integrating
quantitative and qualitative data, without expanding the scope of the study beyond the optimal"
(Teye, 2012, p. 385). The combination of both qualitative and quantitative methods can easily
broaden the scope of research. For example, Teye (2012) reported that when he conducted
mixed-methods research to study forest policy formulation and implementation in Ghana, he had
to conduct more in-depth interviews than originally planned because the target group he initially
planned to interview was different from the group he encountered in the field. He had to broaden
the research scope, generate more data, and spend more time to analyze the data. To overcome the
challenge associated with the research scope, researchers should anticipate changes that may take
place in the field and be open to emerging research questions without expanding the scope of the
study beyond the optimal. However, if it is deemed necessary to expand the research scope,
researchers are encouraged to gather more resources, if available, or reallocate existing resources
to accommodate the changes.

  13.3. Nomenclature, Design, and Classification Issues in Mixed-Methods
                                                 Research

Issues regarding the language of mixed-methods research (i.e., nomenclature) (Teddlie &
Tashakkori, 2010), design, and classification have changed over time but still need discussion and

                                                                            Chapter 13 | 255
development (Teddlie & Tashakkori, 2009). For example, although typologies are important (see
section 2, Chapters 4-9), mixed-methods typologies with both overlapping and divergent
components and/or different names and labels can be a challenge to researchers (Teddlie &
Tashakkori, 2010) (e.g., a mixed-methods convergent parallel design is the same as a concurrent
design). Due to a significant number of taxonomies, categorizations, and terminologies
surrounding mixed-methods research, researchers utilizing a mixed-methods approach are faced
with the challenge of examining different types of mixed-methods designs from various resources
(e.g., books, journal articles) and selecting one that suits their research purpose.

We recommend several strategies to overcome this challenge. First, in this book, we discussed
different mixed-methods designs from which researchers can select, and we proposed a more
unified framework that is meant to guide researchers, editors, and reviewers in conducting,
evaluating, and publishing mixed-methods research. We encourage researchers to review different
design elements discussed in this book, select those most salient to their study, and then explain
those dimensions in the mixed-methods design section of their paper. Second, for researchers who
are new to mixed-methods research, this diversity can be overwhelming (i.e., too many options on
how to plan a mixed-methods study). Our approach with a detailed decision choice model (for
example, see Figure 5-7) is systematic and covers most types of mixed-methods research. In our
approach to identify the mixed-methods design, we have treated research questions and purposes
as separate from the design, data collection and analysis techniques, and inferential stages. This
separation is intended to flexibly guide researchers from one stage of the mixed-methods research
to the next stage of the research--often, without being trapped in complex definitions and design
selections.

  13.4. Problems with Integration of Findings in Mixed-Methods Research

Ensuring a proper integration of findings across methods is one of the biggest challenges in
mixed-methods research (Bryman, 2006; Teye, 2012). Results can be integrated at both the
analysis and interpretation stages. In most cases, however, results are integrated only at the level
of interpretation (Bryman, 2006; Caracelli & Greene, 1993; Teye, 2012). Only a few studies have
reported integration at the analysis stage (Uprichard & Dawney, 2019). Effective data integration
requires a well-considered approach that "knows when to synthesize some findings (because they
are equivalent and commensurate) and when to respect and investigate contradictory findings
(because the contradiction reflects epistemologically based differences that cannot be resolved
empirically, only conceptually)" (Fielding, 2012, p. 125). Here, we first discuss the problems
associated with data integration (i.e., integration at the analysis stage).

Instead of "adding up" data, where findings of one method are considered alongside findings of
another, data integration goes beyond just reporting the findings of both approaches and considers
the interaction of data during the analysis (Uprichard & Dawney, 2019). The goal of data
integration is to produce a more comprehensible object--the extent to which data from different
methods can be interpreted together in a meaningful way. Two most common data integration
techniques are: (1) combination of data types within different types of analyses (e.g., using
categorical or continuous variables both for statistical analysis and for comparing coded qualitative
data); and (2) conversion of data (i.e., quantitizing or qualitizing) (Fielding, 2012). Indeed, there
must be a clear rationale for using such techniques.

256 | Challenges and Strategies in Publishing
Data integration can, however, be problematic when objects examined in the qualitative strand of
the study are different from the quantitative strand of the study. As such, different methods may
produce "cuts" (i.e., findings from different methods are completely different and do not fit
together) (Uprichard & Dawney, 2019). For example, Ling and Pang (2021) studied a social justice
problem of poverty in the context of financial education with Hong Kong early adolescent ethnic
minority students. They used a vignette-based methodology to gather data in a mixed-methods
design study. The study consisted of three phases. Phase 1 (baseline) consisted of pre-surveys
using quantitative and qualitative methods and individual interviews. The findings of Phase 1
informed the design of new financial lessons and vignettes, which were piloted and implemented
in Phase 2 (intervention). Phase 3 (follow-up) involved evaluations using qualitative and
quantitative surveys. The authors argued that "[q]ualitative data enable in-depth investigation into
the financial beliefs and behaviors of underrepresented groups", whereas "[q]uantitative data
provide objective evidence for program evaluation" (p. 3). For most parts of the analysis, the
authors conducted a content analysis of the qualitative data and then transformed the results into
quantitative data. They also performed statistical analyses of the quantitative data. Although the
findings revealed the lessons' positive impact (i.e., the intervention group showed a significant
increase in long-term financial planning strategies than the control group did), most students (both
in the intervention and control groups) did not have a budget plan. The mixed-methods data
analyses demonstrated that students in the intervention group did not show any improvement in
their saving behavior although their financial planning strategies seemed to improve. These
findings demonstrate "cuts" that reveal different aspects of the same phenomenon (or multiple
phenomena) that do not cohere and cannot be integrated. The authors explained the conflicting
findings using three perspectives of finance research: traditional finance, behavioral finance, and
cultural finance. Whereas traditional and behavioral finance concerns with individuals' saving
behaviors, cultural finance extends such individual behaviors to the family's saving behaviors. The
authors' intervention in their quantitative strand of the study was designed to directly affect the
students' financial literacy, not that of their families' financial literacy. In other words, the
conflicting findings were due to two different aspects of the phenomenon being investigated in the
same study.

Uprichard and Dawney (2019) recommended a method called diffraction as a way to integrate
qualitative and quantitative data that are not coherent. In diffraction, mixed data, objects, and
methods coproduce one another; "[T]he ontology of the data, the object, and methodological
approach become as important as their epistemologies" (p. 26). Thus, diffraction precludes the
option of using mixed data to illustrate, enrich, or verify each other as an effort to "entail the
`holding still' of one and a refusal to see the research object as a messy, processual entity" (p. 27).
A diffraction approach involves reading data across methods while allowing data to cohere or not.
If not, it will produce seemingly conflicting findings that should be explained using different
narratives. We encourage a careful reading of Uprichard and Dawney (2019) for a more detailed
discussion on diffraction.

                 13.5. Team Selection in Mixed-Methods Research

Team selection issues surrounding mixed-methods research can also create challenges in writing
and publishing mixed-methods research paper. Specifically, mixed-methods research requires
methodological and philosophical expertise in multiple areas--rather than conducting social
impact interviews to learn about individuals' experiences with an intervention program or
conducting a survey to learn about the impact of technology adoption, researchers need to conduct

                                                                                                                         Chapter 13 | 257
both interviews and surveys. We encourage researchers to form a strong research team consisting
of individuals with backgrounds and expertise in different types of methods. Moreover, we
strongly recommend that researchers, especially Ph.D. students, first gain sufficient knowledge in
both qualitative and quantitative research (e.g., by taking courses or attending workshops in
various research methods) before undertaking a mixed-methods research project.

             13.6. Required Resources for Mixed-Methods Research

Collecting two different types of data and/or a subsequent large volume of data means that the
resources required for data collection, management, and analysis are also greater for a
mixed-methods project (Halcomb, 2019; Halcomb & Andrew, 2009). A further consideration is
the time required to complete a mixed-methods project. For example, in a project with a sequential
design, significantly more time is required (compared to a single method project or a concurrent
mixed-methods project) to collect and analyze the first data set prior to commencing the collection
of the subsequent data (Halcomb, 2019). Similarly, in a concurrent project, sufficient time and
resources are required to facilitate collection of two sets of data at the same time (Halcomb &
Andrew, 2009). These logistics challenges can be overcome by careful planning and preparation
(e.g., secure sufficient resources to collect and analyze both qualitative and quantitative data;
create a timeline for data collection and analysis).

           13.7. Presentation of Findings in Mixed-Methods Research

A large volume of data generated by mixed-methods research can create a challenge in the analysis
and reporting process (Halcomb, 2019). To overcome this challenge, we provided a number of
templates for publishing mixed-methods research in Chapter 11. In addition, a challenge can arise
if a manuscript does not fit within a journal's word/page limits, particularly when there is a need
to describe data collection and data analysis in detail for both methods. If that's the case, one
approach is for authors to report details of their study in appendixes or supplementary materials
for review. A second approach, though sub-optimal, is to publish the results of each study
separately, incorporating the meta-inferences into the second study. Finally, we encourage journals
to be flexible regarding their page limits for a mixed-methods research paper, as such papers
necessarily tend to be longer due to the method details, analysis/results details, and
meta-inferences. This will ensure that a mixed-methods study is transparent and can be carefully
evaluated.

                                            Summary

Challenges in conducting, writing, and publishing mixed-methods research include: the
paradigmatic and philosophical issues in mixed-methods research; the use of, and rationale for,
mixed-methods research; the nomenclature, design, and classification issues in mixed-methods
research; problems with integration of findings in mixed-methods research; the team selection and
resource issues surrounding mixed-methods research; and problems with presentation of findings
in mixed-methods research. The key issues in each of these are described below:

· Paradigmatic and philosophical issues in mixed-methods research: move away from
    "metaphysical paradigms" (i.e., the concept of paradigms used by purists who link assumptions
    of their chosen paradigm with methodological traditions) to "paradigms as shared beliefs in a
    research community"; use a contingency approach; take a comprehensive, new epistemological

    address the lack of commonality in researchers' viewpoints about mixed-methods research.
· Research questions and rationale for mixed-methods research: provide solid reasons for
    choosing a mixed-methods approach and the value it will bring to answer the research
    questions.
· Nomenclature, design, and classification issues in mixed-methods research: review different

    execution.
· Presentation of findings in mixed-methods research: use the templates for publishing mixed-
    methods research discussed in chapter 11.

                                            Exercises

1. Among the challenges of conducting, writing, and publishing mixed-methods research
    discussed in this chapter, which challenges do you think are the most commonly experienced
    by researchers in your field? Based on your understanding of your field, propose
    recommendations to overcome those challenges.

2. Select one published mixed-methods article in your field. Did the authors discuss challenges
    they encountered in the paper? If so, what are those challenges? If not, what challenges seem
    likely, given the paper's context and content?

3. By the end of this chapter, you should have designed and maybe even conducted your own
    mixed-methods project. From your own experience, identify challenges you encountered,
    especially those not discussed in this chapter? What is your plan for addressing them (or how
    did you address them)?
