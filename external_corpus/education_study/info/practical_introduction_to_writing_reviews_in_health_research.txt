About the Authors

Associate Professor Dell Horey has qualifications in science and epidemiology and a strong
background in consumer participation. Dell was a journal editor for nearly two decades and is
the author of more than 65 peer-reviewed papers including several different types of reviews.
The primary focus of Dell's research has been to understand and develop support for difficult
health decisions, where evidence is frequently lacking. The importance of social aspects of clinical
procedures and the relevance of public health approaches that includes choice and informed decision-
making are underlying themes in her work.

      Dr Fernanda Nava Buenfil was born in Mexico City, where she trained as a nutrition scientist
and worked in public health. She migrated to Australia in 2006. Fernanda's educational research
aims are to develop supportive teaching and learning environments. In 2022 her work was recognised
by the Council of Academic Public Health Institutions Australasia (CAPHIA), and she was granted
the Scholarship-Informed Teaching and Learning Award. In 2023 she achieved the status of Senior
Fellow (SFHEA) with the internationally acclaimed UK-based Advance HE which developed a
Professional Standards Framework for teaching and learning support in higher education. One area
of focus for Fernanda has been developing international collaborations that allow students and
academics from different countries to work together to develop their cultural competencies.

      Dr Joanne Marcucci has taught in the School of Psychology and Public Health at La Trobe
University for more than a decade. Joanne's PhD focused on breast cancer awareness campaigns.
Joanne's teaching has been recognised with a Vice Chancellor's Teaching Award for her student-
centred approach. Joanne's research interests in public health have a particular focus on qualitative
research methods. She is dedicated to creating inclusive learning environments that promote
engagement and provide students with the support and opportunities they need to succeed.

1: Introduction

Photo by Google DeepMind from Pexels used under Pexels Licence.

This open access textbook aims to help you to write simple narrative reviews, which are commonly
used in the health sciences to synthesise research evidence to guide practice and policy. The book is
an introduction to how to critically evaluate research, how to compare different aspects of research
studies, and how to synthesise and interpret research evidence. In its broad focus, this book reflects
the ways reviews are used across a range of health practices, particularly in non-clinical areas.

      The book is not a definitive text that covers all steps to conduct a thorough narrative review.
Rather, the intention is to address a gap we have observed where students are often asked to
undertake synthesis of health evidence based on assumptions about their skills and knowledge. In
our undergraduate teaching, we have found that by addressing these gaps through worked examples
and activities, we help students to build their understanding of the complex issues involved. You may
find that specific conventions exist in different discipline areas - for example, in particular clinical
areas. This book provides general guidance on common tasks; you will need to look elsewhere for
information about such specific needs.

      The book starts by introducing different types of reviews and then describes the steps required
to undertake a review, with particular focus on detailing methods and considering review findings
or results. A variety of tools, examples and links to other resources are provided to give a practical
guide to writing clearly about health research.

      To get the most out of this textbook, use the links provided in the different sections. These will
take you to published examples, and this should help with your understanding. There are also pop-up
links to remind you of key terms, and some practice examples to help you get started.

                                                                  1

This book introduces the different types of reviews used in health care and describes the common
steps to conducting and writing reviews. It particularly emphasises what to include in the methods
section and how to describe review findings or results. We use a practical approach for those
unfamiliar with conducting reviews and provide a variety of tools, examples and links to other
resources.

            After reading the book and completing the activities, you should be able to:
                  understand different types of reviews and how these are used
                  plan reviews to answer research questions, including developing search strategies,
                    identifying appropriate data to extract and developing appropriate data tables (or grids)
                  synthesise and interpret key aspects of research studies and their findings to answer
                    research questions
                  interpret review findings in the context of the research literature.

            The book continues with the following sections:

3: Why review health research?

Photo by Google DeepMind from Pexels used under Pexels Licence.

Health research, and its associated publications, form a valuable resource for people working in the
health sciences. Reviews of the research literature are commonly conducted as a way to identify and
summarise relevant research to inform healthcare decisions and guide policy development.

      High-quality reviews clearly describe what the review authors have done and justify decisions
in the conduct of the review - for example, why a search timeframe was limited or why particular
studies or populations are included.

      An important aspect of the scientific method is the ability to replicate. For reviews this means
that the methods used should be clearly documented. This ensures transparency and allows readers
to judge the applicability of a review to their needs. This makes documenting the steps followed in
a review an important aspect of the review process. Learning how to write a review clearly can also
improve its quality and help with understanding why reviews are useful.

      There are many reasons for conducting reviews of the health research literature and many ways
that reviews can be done, although the skills used in different types of reviews can be similar. Most
health reviews aim to:

          summarise relevant research evidence to guide health decisions
          identify challenges and solutions for policy development
          gain understanding of a health topic or problem, including possible implications or

            potential impacts
          gain understanding of research that has already been done. This includes assessing

            methodological approaches, potential gaps and weaknesses to generate ideas for future
            studies.
You can build your knowledge of reviews by reading published reviews with a critical eye. This will
develop your understanding of the wide range of approaches that can be taken and how reviews can
be made more useful for those wanting to apply the insights that this work can generate.

                                                                  5

 4: Different types of reviews

   Photo by Google DeepMind from Pexels used under Pexels Licence.

  The number of health-related reviews has grown enormously over recent decades, showing how
  useful this way of synthesising the research literature can be. Over this time, several types of
  reviews have been developed as review methods have been applied to different health questions and
  problems. As this has occurred in different places, in different disciplines and for different reasons, a
  range of names have been applied for review types that have been created.

        One group of information specialists (or librarians) identified 48 distinct review types, which
  they categorised into seven broad review `families':1

            Traditional reviews
            Systematic reviews
            Rapid reviews
            Overviews (reviews of reviews)
            Qualitative reviews
            Purpose-specific reviews (scoping reviews)
            Mixed methods reviews
  These many types of reviews have developed in response to the range of questions that can be
  answered by research studies. While the number of different types of reviews may seem
  overwhelming, they reflect the range of questions that arise in health care and in the development of
  health policy. Moreover, there are generic skills common to most review types, and this book focuses
  on these.
        We will use the framework from Sutton and colleagues to briefly describe the different types of
  reviews. Then we will look at some of the skills you need to conduct a high-quality review - of any
  type.

             Meeting the review family: exploring review types and associated information retrieval
       requirements

    Traditional reviews

    Traditional reviews have been around for many years; they provide summaries of research on
    particular topics. This family includes reviews described as critical or integrative and provides a
    more conventional or narrative exploration of the literature. Until recently, this group of reviews

    Systematic reviews

    Systematic reviews in health care underpin the concept of evidence-based practice by reinforcing the
    value of systematic approaches to synthesising research evidence. Their purpose is to summarise the
    available evidence in existing research based on a comprehensive search of the literature to answer
    specific questions related to health issues. The term `systematic review' has been used somewhat
    loosely for several years to cover any review using a systematic approach. More recently there has
    been a marked shift to tighter use of the terminology.

    interventions essentially ask `Does this work?' Cochrane reviews are considered the gold standard
    for effectiveness reviews, particularly for clinical questions, as they follow formal guidance that
    requires a published protocol, extensive search strategies and a very high level of transparency. These
    reviews are held in the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (CDSR) and cover a range of
    health topics. Cochrane reviews can be very time-consuming, with many taking years to complete.

          The development of systematic reviews raised awareness of the usefulness of reviews to health
    decision-making. Before the 1980s there were relatively few systematic reviews in health care, but
    now more than 10,000 systematic reviews are published every year, including those in the CDSR.3
    Not all of these will influence healthcare practice, but many reviews have had a big impact on the
    provision of care.

          Since the rise in importance of systematic reviews, the range of review types has grown based
    on similar methodological approaches as those used in systematic reviews.4

          Other reviews in the systematic review family are economic evaluations and diagnostic test
    accuracy reviews. While these are important, they are outside the scope of this book.

                                        Examples

          Cochrane reviews have changed the practice of medicine internationally. This review,5 the first
    version of which was published in 1998, supported the use of a single course of steroids for women at risk
    of pre-term birth, significantly improving the survival rate of babies born prematurely.

          Systematic reviews are sometimes referred to as meta-analysis, which, strictly speaking, is the
    statistical process used to combine results from similar studies. However, not all systematic reviews
    include a meta-analysis, for various reasons.

          The next review6 (without a meta-analysis) looked at mobile apps during pregnancy. The authors
    could not draw any conclusions due to the wide range of approaches used in the original studies. These
    varied in terms of how participants and the interventions were described, and the types of outcomes
    measured. Instead, the authors drew attention to this important limitation and recommended that a
    standardised approach be developed to allow comparison.

    Rapid reviews

    Rapid reviews have been increasingly seen in recent years. These essentially use an abridged version
    of the methods of a full systematic review to speed up the review timeline to meet the specific
    needs of the commissioning agent or institution. For example, several rapid reviews were conducted
    in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, to meet the emergency responses needed in policy and
    practice. Like systematic reviews, rapid reviews should start with a protocol or plan. Changes to
    that plan during the conduct of the rapid review, including any identified limitations, must be clearly
    stated in the final report.

                                                   Example

             This rapid review7 looked at the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in studies of cancer survivors in
       rural areas. It included 14 studies using different study designs reporting patient experiences to inform the
       development of future support interventions.

       COVID-19 pandemic

    Overviews

    Overviews - or reviews of reviews - are another offshoot of the rapid growth in systematic reviews.
    Overviews use similar search and report approaches to systematic reviews but, rather than looking
    at primary studies, aim to summarise existing reviews on the same topic. One common alternative
    name for overviews is `umbrella' reviews.

          The development of overviews has only been possible with the growth in the number of reviews
    available. In an overview, it is important to check for any overlap between the included reviews (i.e.
    whether the same studies have been used) so that findings are not unintentionally magnified.

    Qualitative reviews

    Reviews of qualitative studies are less established in the literature compared with those that aim to
    synthesise the findings of quantitative studies; however, these reviews are growing rapidly in terms
    of numbers and the approaches used. Among the many names used to describe qualitative reviews,
    `qualitative meta-synthesis' is possibly the most common.

          Qualitative reviews aim to either aggregate findings from a range of studies or interpret findings
    in new ways - for example, by framing a question differently. In doing so they develop or test
    new theoretical perspectives. Qualitative reviews can also be used to explore existing theories or to
    identify issues for future studies or services to address.

                                                  Examples

             A review by Carlsen and Glenton9 sought to explore public attitudes to swine flu vaccines. The
       review authors raised questions about the conclusions drawn by the authors of the original studies and
       offered an alternative conclusion that could be drawn from the evidence provided in the studies.

     Purpose-specific reviews (scoping reviews)

     Purpose-specific reviews - Sutton and colleagues call them scoping reviews - aim to identify the
     type and extent of existing research literature on a topic.

           `Scoping reviews' are comprised of reviews that include a range of heterogenous studies. Such
     reviews are commonly designed for a specific purpose, so can also be referred to as purpose specific
     reviews. The amount of tailoring needed to meet a specific single purpose makes it difficult to adapt
     this review type for generic use.11

           For some reviews in this family there can be formal guidance on how to approach the review.
     For example, scoping reviews, and their close relative mapping reviews, aim to identify existing
     research related to a question or topic to find potential gaps where future research is needed. Many
     of the skills used in systematic reviews are also used in purpose-specific reviews.

                            Example

           This review12 examined public involvement in human genomics research projects in terms of what it
     looks like, how it happens and what the impacts have been.

     Mixed methods reviews

     As the name implies, a mixed methods review aims to integrate studies that include quantitative
     and qualitative data. Some reviews in this family include only mixed methods studies or studies
     involving the same study population, whereas others will incorporate studies looking at effectiveness

5: Getting started

This section introduces you to key skills for using a systematic approach to writing and conducting
a review that does not involve a meta-analysis. Rather, the focus will be performing narrative
synthesis, which is typically used in all types of reviews.

      Skills used in reviews are highly transferable to other common tasks in professional practice.
Developing skills takes practice; it is not something that is simply switched on after you have done it
once successfully - skills will develop with practice.

      We start by exploring iterative processes to develop a research question (or research objectives)
and the PICO and SPIDER methods.

Developing research questions

Before starting any review, you need to be clear about why a review of the research evidence is
needed. The purpose of a review can be framed as a research question or as research objectives.
These can be broad or specific, depending on the purpose of the review.

      Research questions are often clearest for reviews asking a specific clinical question. For
example, a review can ask about the best drug or right dose to use for particular conditions or for
particular patient groups.

                                                                 15
    16

        Further reading

                Cross and colleagues1 provide a good explanation on developing research questions,
          particularly for clinical questions.

                Asking the right question and finding the right answers

    When the purpose of a review is broader, such as when it is being used to identity different policy
    options or possible approaches in future primary research, the review research question will be
    correspondingly broader.

          A specific question can be easier to answer, but only if there are sufficient studies available. The
    focus on the research question is important, as it determines the purpose of the review, which guides
    how the review is conducted and the results interpreted.

          Without a well-developed research question, it is not possible to know if a review has met
    its purpose. Developing a research question, particularly in new areas of study, can be an iterative
    process in the early stages of a review. This means that questions may be refined after preliminary
    searches are conducted. However, retrofitting a research question after the review process has been
    completed raises issues of bias.

          research question development.

    Research tools

    Over time, researchers have developed tools in the form of mnemonics, which are words to help you
    remember what you need to include. Two commonly used tools are PICO and SPIDER.2

PICO

The PICO mnemonic and its variations PECO or PICOT are useful tools.

PICO               PECO               PICOT
Population/People  Population/People  Population/People
Intervention       Exposure           Intervention
Comparison         Comparison         Comparison
Outcome            Outcome            Outcome Time

PICO, in particular, is increasingly used in health-related studies to help craft research questions or
develop research objectives. As a mnemonic, PICO acts to remind you of the different elements that
need to be considered when thinking about the purpose of a review and subsequent questions or
objectives.

      Note that not all the elements are always present in research questions. For example, research
questions usually include the study population, intervention/exposure and outcome. However, in
broad research questions the comparison element may not be included, although it might be implied
in terms of interpreting the research findings included in the review, in the context of comparison to
the general population or usual practice.

A broad research question could ask what sort of interventions might work for a particular group,
whereas a narrow research question would ask about a specific intervention for a specific group or
setting.

SPIDER

The SPIDER mnemonic is sometimes used as an alternative when only qualitative studies are
included in a review.

         H5P activity: Framing review questions as PICO components

         Table 1 shows how research questions from existing reports and reviews in the grey literature can
   be framed as PICO components. These examples use broad, exploratory research questions. Findings
   from these reviews can be used to frame more specific questions in subsequent studies.

         Sometimes the intervention element can be better framed as an exposure (e.g. experience of mental
   health), and the comparison component is not necessarily included in the research question; rather, it is
   implied, particularly when the comparison group comprises other people without the experience or
   condition that the review intends to explore.

6: Planning a review

Photo by Google DeepMind from Pexels used under Pexels Licence.

A detailed plan for a review is commonly known as a protocol. Developing a plan is an iterative
process that can take some time, especially when you are new to the task. Your first draft is likely
to change as you learn more about what is needed. If you plan to publish your review it is now a
common requirement to either publish or register the protocol before starting the actual review or at
least register the protocol in a public database.

      Prospero is an international database that prospectively registers systematic reviews in health
and social care. The main purpose of databases like Prospero is to minimise duplication of reviews.
These databases also reduce reporting bias by allowing completed reviews to be compared with
planned protocols.

      When planning a review you need to think about how it will be structured. Figure 1 shows the
main components of a review.

                                                                 19

7: What should reviews look like?

Photo by Google DeepMind from Pexels used under Pexels Licence.

Most reviews follow a standard structure with four main sections:
          Background or Introduction
          Methods
          Findings
          Discussion and Conclusion

We will look at each of these in turn.

Background or Introduction

The background provides a brief background on the topic of the review, including any important
details to explain why the review is needed.

          Refer to existing reviews on the topic, if available, and explain what a new review will
            add.

          Include the research question or objectives, as this is an explicit statement on what the
            review aimed to do.

Methods

The methods section, which is what makes a review a systematic review, is vital for rigour and
validity of a review and must be well described.

          Include descriptions of the search strategy, the process used for selecting studies for the
            review, and the process used for critically appraising included studies.

                                                                 21
22

          Describe the data that are intended to be extracted from each study and how these will be
            analysed - for example, a narrative summary of key characteristics and synthesis of
            findings from all studies that address research question.

          Include any post hoc changes - that is, anything different from the intended approach
            described in the protocol.

Key aspects of the methods section are described in Section 8: Methods.

Findings

The findings or results section of a review should include narrative summaries (e.g. key aspects of
study design, study participants, intervention/exposures, outcomes measured and results/findings).

          Summarise the key characteristics from each study in a table or grid, including an
            assessment of the study quality. See Section 9: Data extraction for examples.

          Compare studies and look for similarities, differences, gaps or inconsistencies. See
            Section 10: Interpreting the findings for examples.

          Synthesise findings from the included studies that relate to the review's question or
            objectives.

Summaries of meta-analyses are outside the scope of this book. When included in a review, these
would be found in the findings or results sections.

Discussion and Conclusion

The discussion section reports the answer to your research question or research objectives.
Alternatively, responses can be reported under findings; both approaches are used.

          If you are unable to report an answer, clearly state this.
          Provide an analysis of the strengths and limitations of the review.
          Summarise any identified gaps that may need to be addressed in future studies.
          Recommend actions for future research, including methodological issues.

8: Methods

The methods section is possibly the most important section of a review. It needs to be described in
sufficient detail so that others can replicate the review, and in doing so, also provides you with a
guide for conducting the review.

            Tip: It can help to write the methods in the future tense - what you plan to do - and then
      change to the past tense when complete.

The methods section of a review should detail how the particular studies are found, selected,
appraised and how data extracted from the studies are managed. These steps are important to
establishing the rigour and credibility of the review.
Ideally several steps in a review are conducted concurrently by two review authors independently,
and then their decisions compared once the task is complete to see if there is any disagreement. If
disagreements occur, these need to be discussed; if agreement still cannot be reached, a third person
should be involved. This process reduces bias or systematic error and should be documented in the
methods section where used. However, such steps are commonly omitted in learning exercises, and
are not discussed further here, although you should see references to such approaches as you look at
the reviews linked throughout this resource.

Finding studies

Finding studies for a review includes referring to the type of studies that are to be included and
the process(es) for choosing them. Reviews commonly include research articles published in peer-
reviewed literature, but sometimes studies from grey literature are included. This book confines
itself to peer-reviewed publications, as this is most common.

                                                                 23
24

      Regardless of the scope of the literature to be searched, the methods section of a review needs
to clearly relate to the research question or objective of the review.

      Steps that must be covered in the methods:

          Search strategy: describes how potentially relevant research papers that could answer the
            question (or meet the objectives) will be identified through their titles and keywords, and
            the health databases that will be searched. More than one strategy may be used.

          Study selection: describes the process for choosing the papers to include in the review
            from the broader group of papers that the search has identified.

          Critical appraisal: describes how the quality of each of the selected papers to be
            included in the review will be judged.

          Data extraction: details the information that will be extracted from each included paper.
          Data synthesis: outlines the process to summarise the extracted data to answer the

            research question.

This section will explore search strategies, study selection and critical appraisal, while sections 9
and 10 look at data extraction and synthesis.

Search strategies

The titles of potential papers to be included in a review are identified through a search of electronic
databases. This is where you can call on experts to help you, but you do need to do some work first.
Think about:

          keywords or terms relevant to your topic
          possible databases that could be used
          the time period for the search (i.e. the years to cover; gold standard reviews do not set

            time limits, but these take a lot of time)
          languages (there are no language restrictions on gold standard systematic reviews).

It is important to be realistic about what you can achieve from a search, especially when you are still
developing your review skills. It is more important to understand the search process and how it can
affect the quality of your work.

      Different questions lead to different search strategies, and best practice requires transparency to
minimise bias where possible.

        Further reading

                The following paper,1 in the environmental literature, lists some common sources of bias in
          conducting reviews and the problems bias can cause, such as selection bias when the studies chosen
          for inclusion are not representative of the evidence base available.

    Designing search strategies with STARLITE

    STARLITE2 is a tool that can help you to think about your search strategy and your study selection.
    STARLITE is another mnemonic that provides a framework for reporting search strategies. This tool
    will help you describe the search and study selection parts of the methods section. You can see how
    this was done in this published overview. The elements in the STARLITE tool are explained in Box

                     Selective strategies, which attempt to identify all relevant studies but
                        only within specified limits. This approach is often used in a rapid
                        review.

                     Purposive strategies, which focus on samples of titles from specific
                        disciplines, years or journals. This approach is commonly used in
                        purpose-specific reviews.

T           There are two options for describing the types of studies to be included in a
            review. These are to either:
Type of
studies              Fully report, which means to specify the actual study types (e.g.
                        randomised controlled trials, studies using grounded theory) or
                        study designs to be included in the review.

                     Partially report, where an `umbrella' category such as `qualitative
                        studies' is used without specifying the study designs to be included.

A           This refers to additional search strategies outside of electronic database
Approaches  searches used to find potential studies for the review. These commonly
            include:

             Hand searching specific journals, for when journals are known to

             Citation snowballing, to check where studies that will be included in
               the review have been cited. This can be done using the citation
               records for a published article listed in electronic databases or
               Google Scholar.3

             Checking the reference lists of studies that will be included in the
               review.

                     Partially report, by including start and end dates but only determined

Study selection

Searching the specialist electronic databases in libraries can commonly lead to a long list of titles,
many of which will not be included in the actual review.

      The process used to select the particular studies to include in the review needs to be described
in the methods section. This is for transparency and so that others can be confident that the studies
are chosen fairly - that is, that no `cherry picking' has occurred. Ideally the decision to include or
exclude a particular paper is determined by criteria that are stipulated before the search is conducted.
These are known as inclusion and exclusion criteria.

      For beginner reviewers, particularly those undertaking practice exercises, it can be easier to
understand useful criteria by using an iterative approach and reflecting on the process.

              Tip: Work backwards by thinking about the papers you expect to find. Check how refining
        your question in different ways and changing your selection criteria affects your search strategy.

  As you become more skilled, you should have sufficient knowledge of your area of interest to do
  this prospectively - that is, without anticipating what you will include. A non-iterative approach is
  important to the rigour or quality of a review as it reduces potential skewing bias or the evidence to
  be included.

        Inclusion and exclusion criteria are used to ensure that the evidence you are using in the
  review is relevant to your research question. Common inclusion and exclusion criteria are the study
  population, the type of intervention and even the study design.

        Study selection is an extension of the search process. If these criteria were used as search terms,
  it could confine the search too tightly to yield too few titles. Looser search terms will yield more
  titles but can include titles that are not suitable for the review. Clear criteria about what titles will be
  included or excluded from the review are needed.

 Critical appraisal

  The methods section should describe how the quality of each of the selected papers for inclusion in
  a review will be judged. Such judgements relate to how well the study was conducted and reported.

        Study quality is important to the credibility or trustworthiness of the evidence a study provides.
  There is no single way to make judgements about study quality, as this depends on a range of factors.
  There are different `tools', usually as types of checklists. These include the Critical Appraisal Skills
  Programme (CASP) series, risk of bias assessments and checklists for qualitative and other types of
  studies compiled by the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI).4 5a research and development centre in South
  Australia promoting and supporting evidence-based practice (https://jbi.global/ebp)

 Study Quality Appraisal Tool

  The Study Quality Appraisal Tool (SQAT) is designed to make the critical appraisal process simpler.
  It includes general statements that can be used with different study designs. It was developed for an
  undergraduate applied health research subject.6

        SQAT has nine statements related to different aspects of research studies. Each statement has a
  scale where you indicate your level of agreement in terms of how that statement applies to the study
  in the paper you are appraising. For example, if you strongly agree with a statement, you circle the
  number corresponding to that response (in this case, 7).

        However, you will have to work out exactly how you will apply the tool in your review. Some
  options are suggested below under Summarising appraisals. There is no one way to assess study
  quality and different people will make different judgements using the same tool. This is why it is
  important to describe the process that you use so that others can understand how you approached this
  step.

        Ideally at least two members of the review team should appraise each paper independently. Then
  they compare the ratings they gave each item (or statement) and discuss any differences. After this
  discussion, the rating scores can be adjusted. If consensus cannot be reached, a third member of the
  review team can be consulted.

        When using any appraisal tool, if you find that some issues are unclear, report whether this is
  because the study authors have described something poorly or not at all. Consider too whether any
  perceived lack of clarity possibly identifies a gap in your own knowledge and think what you might
  do to resolve that.

Summarising appraisals

When using appraisal tools like SQAT, you need to think about how you will summarise your
appraisals across the different statements or items and describe the process you use in your review.
This summarising process should be decided before you appraise all the studies. Ideally, judgements
about study quality are reported with other study details. Some options include:

          Summing the scores for each item and allocating ratings for scores that fall within certain
            ranges - for example, if the score falls between 9 (lowest possible score) and 36 you
            could say this was a LOW QUALITY study, with scores between 37 and 50 indicating a
            MEDIUM QUALITY study etc.

          Choosing one or two criteria that you think are particularly important and ranking studies
            on the basis of how they score for those criteria.

          Any other way that makes sense to you and that you can justify.
                                                                                                                                                              31

9: Data extraction

Photo by Google DeepMind from Pexels used under Pexels Licence.

Data extraction refers to the information taken from each included paper. This should include key
information about the study (author(s) name, publication year), important methodological contexts
(study design or study aim, details of the study participants) and key components of the research
question or research objectives.

            You will need information to answer your research question, so PICO components should be
      covered. References to all included studies should appear at the end of the review.

It is common to compile the information extracted from the included studies into a table. In this book,
we refer to these data tables as grids. Such grids provide a useful way to visualise and eventually
summarise the data. Section 10: Interpreting the findings discusses this further.
Grids should be as succinct as possible, and at the same time include all relevant information. There
are two main challenges to setting up an effective grid. The first is working out the columns that you
will need, and the second is working out how to fit the data into the grid without it becoming too
long or too overwhelming. You can find examples in Table 2a and Table 2b and a further discussion
of these below.

      Some research questions will allow a mix of study designs, but others will not. You need to think
about how quantitative and qualitative studies could contribute to answering your research question.
For example, if the research question is to identify different types of responses to statistical anxiety,
both quantitative and qualitative studies could be used to answer this. You also need to think about
what you will do if the information you have decided is important to answer your research question
isn't reported in the included study paper.

          If you include only quantitative studies in a review, you will need to report any numerical
            results (including their 95% CI or p-value), even if no meta-analysis is performed.

          It helps to report studies by study design. Report all cross-sectional studies together, all

                                                                 31
   32

              cohort studies together and so on. Meta-analysis, or statistically combining results from
              more than one study, may be possible, but you will likely need to get advice from a
              statistician on this.
            If you include only qualitative studies in a review, you will need to report the theoretical
              framework used to understand the phenomenon under study, the data collection and the
              analytical methods used.
            If you include a mix of qualitative and quantitative studies, you will need to think
              carefully about how to approach the interpretation of study findings. You could include
              descriptions of the phenomenon under study for each paper in the same column as a
              description of intervention or exposure.
            If a qualitative study starts out looking for specific outcomes (e.g. barriers and enablers),
              you can list these terms in your outcomes column. In the results column you would list
              what the researchers found (e.g. any themes).

 Sample data table

  In this example from Muhamad and colleagues,1 Table 2 reports the theoretical, methodological and
  analytical frameworks used in different studies exploring the same issue.

 What data to extract?

  When thinking about the data to extract when conducting any review, it helps to think about the
  information needed in the final review report. Efforts to improve the quality of published health
  research literature in clinical areas include the EQUATOR Network (Enhancing the QUAlity
  and Transparency Of health Research), an international `umbrella' organisation comprised of
  researchers, research funding bodies, medical journals and others with a shared interest in improving
  quality in research and research publications, largely through the development of reporting
  guidelines. Reporting guidelines for study designs used in clinical research areas, including
  systematic reviews and relative quality research studies, are available through the EQUATOR
  Network website.

        Box 2 shows examples of commonly extracted data. These may be in separate columns or
  combined in ways that make a grid more concise.

Study,        This data is to identify the included study. This is best described in terms of
including     the last name of the first author and the year of publication. The full

author and    should be sufficient information in this column to find the specific paper in
year          the full reference list.

              You do not need to include the title of the paper, as it overcrowds the table
              and makes it difficult to read.

Country/      Information about where the study was conducted is often highly relevant to
setting       interpreting the results of a review. It can be important to record where a
              study was conducted either as the country or countries where it took place
              or the location (e.g. hospital or community).

Study         Study design is important to interpreting study findings and should always
design        be reported in some way. You can include how data were collected, such as
              through a postal or online survey or through interviews or focus groups.

Study         It is useful for readers of a review to know how the research question aligns
aim(s)        with the aims of the included studies.

Sample size   Report the total number of study participants, and if relevant, the sizes of the
              intervention and control groups, or other important differences; e.g. males
              and females or adults and children.

Study         Relevant details of the study participants could include age range or gender,

participants or employment status or background, depending on the research question.

Intervention  This data refers to what happened in the study. It could include an action,
or exposure   such as education or therapy, provided to study participants (or some of
              them), or it could be the situation that the participants were in (such as
              mental health crisis or exposure to a particular phenomenon).

Dose          If the amount of intervention or exposure is potentially relevant, this data can
              be recorded; e.g. this could be the number or type of education sessions.

Outcomes      Study outcomes are the variables that may change in a study; e.g. anxiety
measured      may increase or decrease. The data that needs to be reported relating to the
              outcomes assessed in a study includes how the outcome was measured and
              when; e.g. anxiety can be measured in different ways with different tools and
              at different points in time. Some studies may assess an outcome only once,
              whereas other studies may use multiple assessment points.

Results       The findings or results of a study (sometimes also called the study outcome,
              just to make things confusing) should be reported. Ideally you would include
              any relevant numerical data found in quantitative studies (with the
              corresponding confidence intervals) and any relevant themes from
              qualitative studies.

Author        It can be useful to include a brief summary of the conclusions that the
conclusions   authors made. This can be especially helpful if the results are not
              conclusive.

Limitations   As you are extracting data from a study it is helpful to document any
              reported limitations and any limitations that you observe. This information
              can be used when writing up the review findings. You need to clearly note
              who identified the limitations.

Data item  Description

quality    Again, this can be useful when writing up the review findings.

Data extraction grids

Table 2a and Table 2b are examples of different ways to use grids. They are from a data extraction
activity based on a review looking at the effectiveness of art therapy.2

      This example addresses a question of effectiveness, so all included studies are randomised
controlled trials, and this information is included in the table title. This means that these grids don't
need a column for the study design but, as you will see, include sample size and the sizes of the
control and intervention groups.

      Published reviews do not always include the information that you might expect. In this example,
estimates of effect size are not reported. If enough information is reported from a study, it may be
possible to calculate parameters such as these. It is helpful to be aware of what isn't reported when
reading any study.

      In the second example (Table 2b), the description of the study participants and sample sizes are
combined, and details about the amount of therapy and outcomes measured are grouped within each
cell to show where information may be incomplete. In this example the results column is not shown.

Data synthesis

Reviews provide a way to pull together similar data from different sources to create an ordered way
to look at the information. Figure 2 shows visually how information across a range of studies can
be collated into component data parts. The first step in doing this is to describe the data you have
collated in each column of your grid. In Figure 2 this is depicted by columns built from blocks of
the same colour. This visualisation is one way to think about how similar types of information taken
from different sources can be grouped. The content relating to each type of information (column in
the grid) should be described and summarised in a paragraph. This tells readers about the scope of
the studies that have contributed to the review, which in turn is the evidence base used to answer the
research question.

    There are no fixed rules about exactly what to include in describing different characteristics of
    included studies, although there are reporting guidelines for more experienced reviewers. You can
    look at the EQUATOR Network to find out more about these. EQUATOR stands for "Enhancing
    the QUAlity and Transparency Of health Research", and the Network is an international initiative to
    improve published health research.

          The goal is to understand the need to summarise information across studies and to think about
    how much information should be extracted from the different studies.

          The starting point for any review is to report how many and the types of studies included in the
    review. The best way to explain this process is to work through an example.

                                     Example: Synthesising data

             In this example we will use the art therapy review3 used earlier.
             Using the information in the grids (Table 2a or Table 2b), the included studies could be described as
       follows.
             Four randomised controlled studies, published between 1971 and 1996, assessing the effectiveness of
       art therapy were included in the review.

    Tips for writing narrative summaries

    Still based on the information in the art therapy review, consider the following tips for narrative
    summaries.

4.  See Reynolds et al. (2020).
38

Study sample

Descriptions of the study population should mention the total number (of children, 153). There is
no information given about age but note that one study included adolescents and that two studies
relate to school-age children. One study includes only boys, but there are no other gender breakdown.
Two studies include participants with identified behavioural or health issues (Kymissis, 1996; Rosal,
1993).

      The numbers in brackets under the sample size refer to the numbers in the intervention and
control groups. Rosal (1993) had two intervention groups and a control group.

Interventions used

More information from the original studies would make it easier to write an effective summary. Here
we must assume that all interventions have been judged to be art therapies (ideally you would check
how this was done and include a description of the process used).

      Descriptions of the intervention could mention several things:

          Amount of therapy (the dose). You could categorise the dose in several ways. For
            example, you could calculate the number of sessions in each study or the number of
            sessions per week. You could also compare the length of each session and the duration of
            the different programs.

          What the intervention is compared with.

Outcomes measured

All of the studies use different scales. In the two studies with participants with identified behavioural
or health issues (Kymissis, 1996; Rosal, 1993) these scales focus on health and behaviour
assessments, whereas the other two studies focus on self-evaluations.

Results

Two studies found no significant effects; these were both studies involving participants with
behavioural or health issues. Two other studies found improved self-evaluations in terms of self-
esteem and self-concept. No numerical outcomes are reported so the effect size cannot be reported.

Reframing data

Different studies don't always present data in the same way. Sometimes you need to think whether
you will need to transform the information in some way so that you can compare it more effectively.
                                                                                                                                         39

                                Example: Reframing data

      It is common for studies to present similar data in different ways, which can make comparison across
studies difficult. In the art therapy example, the amount of therapy is presented quite differently in the
four included studies (see Table 2a), which limits how this aspect of the intervention can be compared.
However, it is sometimes possible to overcome problems like this by thinking about how the same
information could be presented in a way that would enable more meaningful comparison. In Table 3,
descriptions of the amount of therapy were considered in terms of the total number of sessions and the
number of sessions per week, thus showing how this might reframe the amount of therapy.

    the Reynolds et al. systematic review of randomised
                              controlled trials

This reframing allows for a summary of the amount of therapy.

5. See Reynolds et al. (2020).
40

            The amount of therapy varied in terms of the number of sessions (from 8 to 40) and their
      duration (from 45 to 90 minutes), although session length was not specified in one study (Kymissis,
      1996). This indicates that for the three studies where this can be calculated (Omizo, 1989; White,
      1971; Rosal, 1993) there was considerable difference in the amount of art therapy offered (from 450
      to over 3,600 minutes). The duration of the art therapy programs offered varied from two to 10
      weeks, giving session frequencies that ranged from two to five per week, where this was possible to
      determine.

This exercise only allows us to make limited judgements regarding the effectiveness of art therapy
based on the data provided. However, this is useful as it could lead to recommendations from
the review for future studies, including guidelines for how art therapy programs are developed or
described or determining consistent time points for outcomes to be measured (e.g. longer programs
could assess outcomes at more than one time point).
                                                                                                                                                              41

10: Interpreting the findings

Once you have described the different aspects of the studies in a review you need to think about
`the bigger picture'. Exactly what this is will depend on the studies included in the review and the
question the review set out to answer. In other words, the next step is to provide an interpretation of
what the findings might mean, and your understanding of what you have found. There are two main
aspects to this:

          addressing the review's question or objectives
          contextualising the review within the existing evidence.
The following questions should help you think about how to interpret a review's findings.

Can you answer the research question?

You must address your research question (or research objectives). If you can't answer the question,
it is important to say so, and to say why you can't.

      You may be only able to answer the question tentatively, so you should include something about
any uncertainties in your answer. If you are fortunate, you may be able to provide a definitive answer
to your question. Frequently it is not possible, particularly if you have had to restrict the number of
included studies for practical reasons.

      It is much more likely that you will need to give a qualified answer in some way. In doing
so, you need to consider the constraints on the review and the quality of the evidence (determined
through the critical appraisal of the included studies). This is important information that can be
used to guide practice and future research.

What similarities and differences did you identify?

Consider each characteristic recorded in your grid, such as the study design, the participants, how an

                                                                 41
    42

    intervention (or exposure) was defined, the way outcomes were measured, the study findings and the
    quality appraisals.

    What are the overall findings?

    Keep in mind that the overall findings of the review are not restricted to the findings reported in the
    included studies. For example, your findings could include the identification of important gaps in
    existing research or practice.

              Did you identify any gaps? (What information was missing that you needed to answer
                your research question?)

              How might the findings affect current practice? Should existing practices change or be
                modified in any way?

              What should future research on this topic consider to address these gaps?

    What is the nature of the evidence?

              What are the strengths of the review? (What is good about the review?)
              What are the limitations of the review? (What are the shortcomings of the review?)

    Example: Answering the review question

          The art therapy example1 has an implied research question in its title:
    Is art therapy effective?

          While this question doesn't specify any population group or the outcomes that will be used to
    determine effectiveness, the information in Table 2a and Table 2b is sufficient to answer the question in
    the following way.

          Four randomised controlled studies, published between 1971 and 1996, assessed the effectiveness of
    art therapy were included in the review. The review found that art therapy may be effective at improving
    self-perceptions among school students, but there was no evidence that art therapy improved behavioural
    or mental health outcomes for children or adolescents experiencing these issues. However, the quality of
    evidence is unclear as quality appraisals were not reported.

    Contextualising the findings

    Ideally the findings of any review should be compared to what is already known about the topic. The

1.  See Reynolds et al. (2020).
                                                                                                                                                              43

best way to do this is to look at findings of existing reviews that have explored the same or similar
questions. While there can be distinct differences in how reviews on the same topic are conducted,
even when the same approach has been used more recent searches are likely to find newer studies
that may affect the overall evidence.

                       Activity: What to look for in other reviews

         It can help to look at another published review on your topic before you start your review to see how
   the other authors have approached the tasks. Published reviews can be used as models for a new review in
   terms of what to do, what to avoid and for ideas on how to present information. Consideration of existing
   reviews can be included in the background section of your review to justify why it is needed.

         In comparing reviews, it is useful to compare the search timeframe used, the databases searched, and
   the inclusion and exclusion criteria used. When comparing your completed review, check to see how, or
   if, the reviews overlap, particularly in terms of the studies included, the data extracted and the
   interpretation of study findings. You should include a comparison of your findings with the findings of
   published reviews in the discussion section of your review.

How does the published systematic review compare
to your proposed review?

The following questions can help you decide if a published review has been done well, what is
unclear and what could have been done better.

          What is the research question or research objectives? How does it compare with the
            question or objectives of your review?

          How are the PICO elements described?
                      What study populations were included? Do you know how many study
                        participants were involved across all studies?
                      What interventions or exposures of interest were included?
                      What comparisons were made?
                      What outcomes were measured or reported?

          What study designs did the authors include? How many studies were included? How
            many of these provided data?

          Were the included studies appraised? If so, how? How does this differ from your
            approach?

          Did the authors of the published systematic review answer their question (or meet the
            research objectives)?

          Apart from the review question were there any other important findings?
          What did the review authors conclude? Did they identify any important gaps in research?
44

          Does the review raise any issues you hadn't thought about?

Strengths and limitations of reviews

The strengths and limitations of the studies included in a review may be reported in the review
findings, particularly if study quality is affected. However, these are different from the strengths and
limitations of the review itself. Reviews are considered one of the strongest sources of evidence, so
it is critical for review authors to reflect and report on the strengths and weaknesses of their actual
reviews.

      Strengths commonly reported in reviews include:

          Extensive search strategies
          The inclusion of high quality studies
          Findings consistent with or building on results of previous reviews
          Findings consistent across included studies
          Transparent review processes that ensure robust and replicable approach
          Provides important overview of topic
          Identifies important policy or methodological issues

Limitations of reviews frequently refer to:

          Inadequate number of study participants
          Differences in definitions and the outcomes measured across included studies
          Poor study quality
                                                                                                                                                              45

11: What can go wrong?

Photo by Google DeepMind from Pexels used under Pexels Licence.

The process of developing a review is complex. This section looks at some common issues that we
have seen in reviews conducted by less experienced reviewers.

Problems with the research question or objectives

          Question cannot be answered - either too broad or too vague.
          Review deviates from initial objectives (lack of protocol) without justification or

            explanation.

Unclear method

          Method not reported in sufficient detail to allow the review to be replicated; lack of
            transparency.

          Studies selected for inclusion not representative of evidence base (selection bias),
            indicating inappropriate search strategy.

Issues with data extraction

          Extracts from study (particularly the abstract) just copied (without understanding that this
            is a form of plagiarism).

          Study design not recorded or problems recognising the study design used (often these are
            poorly described).

          Too little detail extracted from studies so synthesis becomes problematic (e.g. the review
            only reports number of participants).

                                                                 45
   46

            This was an issue with the art therapy example, where the review authors provided too
              little detail, which limited interpretation of the findings. Regardless, there was not
              sufficient evidence to conclusively determine whether art therapy was effective.

            Study outcomes and study findings confused (i.e. mix up study conclusions with what
              researchers measured).

            Relevant, available numerical information not included.
            Lack of consistency in data extracted from different studies.
            Do not record (leave blank) that relevant data is not reported in included study.
            Studies given a name or identifier without a full reference (e.g. just Jones 2012, Article 1,

              Study 2).
            Unable to fit information into table/grid appropriately or effectively.

 Problems with analysis or reporting

            Do not provide synthesis across studies but report summary of each included study.
            Analysis inappropriate (e.g. uses vote counting rather than narrative synthesis, ignores

              study design).
            Assumes because a study is published it must be good (i.e. fail to understand importance

              of critical appraisal, do not consider study quality or do not report quality assessment of
              studies).
  Uttley and colleagues1 looked at 485 articles highlighting problems in published systematic reviews
  and found 67 specific issues, which they grouped into four main areas or domains:
