Introduction

   Jeanne Dyches

Like many teachers, I pull from various textbooks and resources to ensure
my students have access to the readings and ideas essential to the topic at
hand. For the better part of a decade now, I have been teaching a course titled
EDUC 395: Teaching Disciplinary Literacy to teacher candidates at Iowa
State University. Every semester, I strategically cobble together materials that
speak to disciplinary literacy, equity, and justice-oriented literacy instruction,
and fuse them for my students' learning. I have yet to locate a singular text
that helps my students understand how to "do" disciplinary literacy in a
manner that aligns with critical literacy-that is, the notion that all texts
are power-imbued and should be questioned. Textbooks seem to send the
message: you can do standards-aligned disciplinary literacy instruction, or
justice-oriented, equity-minded instruction-but you can't do both.

Because textbooks often isolate disciplinary literacy concepts and issues of
critical literacy, and a text that melds these often isolated fields has yet
to emerge, there is a shared pedagogical need between in-service and pre-
service teachers, as well as teacher educators, for a text that offers readers an
assortment of accessible, ready-to-implement disciplinary literacy strategies
informed by critical lenses-that is, critical disciplinary literacy (CDL)
strategies. This textbook, co-created with students in EDUC 395: Teaching
Disciplinary Literacy, and supported by CDL experts, offers accessible,
research-based, multidisciplinary CDL strategies ready for implementation in
secondary classrooms. Moreover, this text fills a void in the field by showing
educators how they can teach to name and disrupt oppression while meeting
national and local standards (Dyches, Sams, & Boyd, 2020; Dover, 2013).

What is Disciplinary Literacy?

Virtually all national standards for secondary students (grades 6-12) in the
2 |

United States require teachers to facilitate students' disciplinary literacies
(Berry & Aldrich, 2022; Zygouris-Coe, 2012). Disciplinary literacy (Shanahan &
Shanahan, 2008) complicates the one-size-fits-all notion that "all teachers are
teachers of reading," and instead tasks educators with de-mystifying for their
students the unique ways in which disciplines work. In most approaches to
disciplinary literacy instruction, secondary students must consider how field
experts think and perform if they are to flourish in mainstream academic
settings.

But recently emerging scholarship suggests that disciplinary literacy is, by
itself, an incomplete and potentially problematic approach to secondary
literacy instruction (Dyches, 2021; under review; Dobbs, 2020; Moje, 2015;
Wrenn & Gallagher, 2021). Prompting students to "think like" or even "be"
an expert (Berry & Aldrich, 2022) relates implicit messaging about whose
knowledge is-and isn't-valued in secondary spaces. Students, particularly
those belonging to marginalized groups, may feel that their funds of
knowledge are incompatible with those deemed "academic" in nature.
Moreover, research continues to call for generative approaches to disciplinary
literacy that de-neutralize students' thinking of academic knowledges as
static, monolithic, apolitical entities, and instead highlight the ways in which
disciplines, and education more broadly, are always connected to power
structures (Dyches, 2022; Hinchman & O'Brien, 2019; Moje, 2015).

How is Critical Disciplinary Literacy Different?

Critical disciplinary literacy prompts students to name, confront, and analyze
issues of equity and power relative to their respective disciplines. CDL
understands disciplines as unique communities with their own specialized
(and often exclusionary) skills, norms, practices, and discourses, but deviates
from conventional applications of disciplinary literacy by responding to the
ways in which power systems and their attendant analytic skills work
differently based on the disciplines at hand (e.g., Dyches, 2018; 2021; 2022;
Wrenn & Gallagher, 2021). Applying the CDL skills of "reading the word and
the world" (Freire & Macedo, 1987) to understand the power dynamics of, and
inequities involved in, vaccine distributions requires a different skill set and
                                                                                                         | 3

strategy approach than locating textual representations of toxic masculinity
in Romeo and Juliet. CDL acknowledges these nuances across disciplines, and
that students' acquisition of these skills is not an inevitable outcome.

Why Does CDL Instruction Matter?

Multiple state and national organizations require pre-service teachers to
show evidence of their understanding, and ability to create instruction
responsive to, disciplinary literacy and cultural competencies. Supporting
pre-service students as they learn to meld these instructional approaches
prepares them for their work as in-service teachers. Pre-service teachers'
successes will have a direct impact on secondary students in public schools:
as these new teachers enter classrooms, they will be better equipped with
the skills to support students' disciplinary learning in engaging and
sociopolitically relevant ways.

The textbook's objectives are far-ranging, supporting both pre- and in-service
teachers' efforts to confidently approach CDL instruction.

   Objectives

       · To help pre-service teachers apply critical disciplinary literacy;
       · To empower pre-service teachers to create and share instructional

           materials based on research-based best practices;
       · To support pre-service teachers' understandings and applications of

           technology in their critical disciplinary literacy instruction; and,
           ultimately,
       · To provide pre-service, in-service, and teacher educators with a
           multimodal textbook resource filled with CDL strategies they can
           implement in their own classrooms/professional spaces.

Co-Authoring Process

During the CDL project, EDUC 395 students, all of them teacher candidates,
learned about CDL in a scaffolded manner across our 16-week, semester-long
class. The timeline we followed is below:

Weeks  Students record video demos,
15-16  upload video/transcript to YouTube N/A
       and finalize CDL chapters

Throughout the semester, invited guest speakers, each of them a CDL expert
of a particular discipline (science, ELA, math, and social studies), joined
our class to model a CDL-oriented lesson for students, and to answer their
questions. Throughout the project timeline, students submitted various
portions of their project and received feedback before moving on to the
next task. Periodic check-ins, including small group/whole class discussions,
                                                                                                         | 5

provided students with the space to share successes, challenges, and
questions. At the end of the project, students completed a reflection, sharing
their experiences with the project, including successes, challenges, impact on
pedagogy, and lingering questions.

Chapter Format

Each chapter opens with a disciplinary literacy standard that supports the
described lesson. These standards come from the Common Core State
Standards for Math, Social Studies, and ELA; Next Generation Science
Standards; and World Readiness Standards for Learning Languages. Next,
students note which of Lewison, Flint, and Sluys' (2002) four critical literacy
dimension(s) their lesson meets: disrupting the commonplace, interrogating
multiple viewpoints, focusing on sociopolitical viewpoints, and taking action and
promoting social justice. Resources are linked for readers' convenience.

Next, chapters provide a step-by-step guide to implementing the CDL lesson.
A link to student's accompanying video demonstrations (closed captions
provided) follows the step-by-step instructions. Each chapter concludes with
a brief bio about its student author.

Impact

Though equity-oriented instruction is widely valued in education, students
do not always have opportunities to practice justice-oriented instruction
(Ladson-Billings, 2006; 2018), especially in ways that are differentiated to their
own disciplinary norms (Boyd, 2017; Dyches, 2021). Having the opportunity
to develop these ideas during their educator preparation coursework suggests
that CDL practices-ones intended to promote equity, agency, and justice-will
be present in students' future classrooms.

With almost two decades experience in education, creating a textbook with
my students was a new experience for me. I believe deeply in honoring
students' vast funds of knowledge, creativity, and their agency to create. This
project challenged me to think in new ways, and gave me the opportunity
6 |

to learn from my students, who bring a wealth of experiences, ideas, and
approaches to our class. I am honored to, along with my students, have
had the opportunity to move what have been hitherto largely conceptual
understandings of CDL into widely-accessible, practitioner-based
approaches.

In Closing

Co-creating a textbook with my students proved to be challenging, wonderful
work. I treasure the experience and the students whose creativity, passion,
and hard work undergirds the text's creation. Our collective hope is that
readers will find value and merit in this text, and have a deeper understanding
of how to teach disciplinary literacy in ways that reflect justice-oriented
thinking and goals. We hope these strategies are not only applicable and easy
to use, but ones that will increase students' engagement with their discipline
and the world around them.

Residential Segregation and Parable
of the Polygons

   Ridwan Abdi

   Overview

       · Disciplinary Literacy Skill: Common Core 6.NS.C.6.C Convert Fractions
           and Decimals to percent

       · Critical Literacy Skill(s): Focusing on sociopolitical viewpoints (Lewison,
           Flint, & Sluys, 2002)

       · Instructional Resources Needed:
                 "Attacking the Black-White Opportunity Gap That Comes from
                    Residential Segregation" (Black & Kahlenberg, 2019)
                 Parable of the polygons
                 KWL-CL CHART
                 Guided worksheet
                 Google Slides

Step by Step Instructions

 1. This lesson can be done over two days. To start, I will create four student
      groups, give out the KWL-CL CHART, and introduce the topic of
      Residential Segregation by using questions such as What are some of the
      factors that contribute to residential segregation? What are the
      consequences of residential segregation? After introducing the topic,
      give students a couple of minutes and ask them to fill out the first two
      columns of the chart.
8 |

 2. After students are done writing, I will ask students to read the article
      "Attacking the Black-White Opportunity Gap That Comes from
      Residential Segregation" with their group.

 3. Then, students will be given a guided worksheet to fill out as students
      play the game Parable of the polygons to get a deep lesson about
      diversity in a fun way. I will quickly model the activity beforehand. This
      activity makes students consider bias and how it leads to a segregated
      resident.

 4. After all groups are done with their activity as a class, groups will share
      their answers with the whole class and participate in discussions. Then I
      will ask students to complete the rest of the KWL-CL CHART.

 5. We will also talk about what type of mathematics they have seen during
      the reading and activity. At this point, I will reintroduce the
      mathematics used in the article and the gaming activity using Google
      Slides. During the slides presentation, students are expected to answer
      the questions in the slides and take notes simultaneously.

 6. To conclude our activity, students will write a reflection of a minimum
      of two sentences on the relationships between percentages and fractions
      on the back of the KWL-CL CHART. My CDL strategy mini-lesson
      satisfies the CL dimension of focusing on sociopolitical viewpoints by
      reasoning how the smallest of biases can push a whole society past the
      tipping point of residential segregation.

What Can We Do About Climate
Change? A Socratic Seminar in
Biology

   Samantha Andersen

   Overview

       · Disciplinary Literacy Skill: HS-LS2-7: Design, evaluate, and refine a
           solution for reducing the impacts of human activities on the environment
           and biodiversity.

       · Critical Literacy Skill(s) (Lewison, Flint, & Sluys, 2002): Interrogating
           multiple viewpoints

       · Instructional Resources Needed:
                 "Every Place Has Its Own Climate Risk. What Is It Where You
                    Live?" (Thompson, 2020)
                 "What is Climate Change?" (Dunbar 2015)
                 Graphic Organizer

Step-by Step-Instructions

 1. This lesson can be done over two days or the students can be given a
      chunk of class time before the seminar to answer these questions from
      this graphic organizer.

 2. I have provided two pieces of text for the students to read and look at
      before the seminar. "What is Climate Change" (Dunbar 2015) is an
      overview of the concept of climate change. "Every Place Has Its Own
                                                                                                      | 11

    Climate Risk. What Is It Where You Live?" (Thompson, 2020) provides
    the students with a graph that displays the climate change risks that
    each county in the United States is facing. I will encourage students to
    take notes (taking notes requires students to employ their writing skills)
    over both of these readings and ask questions they might have had
    about climate change. I will also provide the questions beforehand on
    the graphic organizer so that the students have time to articulate their
    well-thought out responses for group discussion.
3. I will organize the classroom to be in a circle where students are all
    facing each other. A large part of the Socratic seminar is students asking
    questions and formulating ideas to share with the class. The seminar
    is teacher-facilitated but largely focused on student's conversations.
    Another option to allow each student to speak is to have the lesson be
    student-facilitated. Each student needs to speak. This is where my job or
    the student's job as a facilitator is to call on students who might feel
    overpowered by those with louder voices or call on those who haven't yet
    participated.
4. To have the students analyze the data, I am going to ask questions
    about the graph from "Every Place Has Its Own Climate Risk. What Is It
    Where You Live?" (Thompson, 2020) As well as asking more open-ended
    questions that don't necessarily have a solution. These questions require
    students to employ their critical thinking and problem solving skills.
    These questions are:

        What trends did you notice?
        What climate threat affects your area?
        What threat do you think is the most serious?
        What threats overlap?
        Have you seen other articles or videos about climate change?
        What else do you know is affected by climate change?
        What are you/your community doing to help climate change?
        What could be done to help these issues?
        Where do you think people will be affected the most? Who do you

          think will be affected the most? Why?
        Who is contributing to climate change? Why?
12 |

These questions are meant to get the students thinking about the graph and
the data they saw. It also gets the conversations started, as each student might
have different things that they noticed or were surprised about. The questions
get students to use their classroom talk and listen to their peers.

 5. I want to facilitate discussion or have a student facilitate discussion and
      allow the students to formulate ideas and explanations with creative
      thinking. Science more often than not does not have one clear solution
      or one clear answer. I want to encourage that philosophy and promote
      multiple perspectives.

 6. I will tell each student to write notes on major points that are made
      during the collaboration. At the end, we will reflect over what was said
      and evaluate the ideas.

 7. I will collect the graphic organizer as an exit pass/participation in the
      seminar.

                 Quote from `Mein Kampf': "I know that fewer people are won over

                    by the written word than by the spoken word and that every great
                    movement on this earth owes its growth to the great speakers and
                    not to great writers."
                 TPS Handout

Step by Step Instructions

 1. I will have the students read the following quote: "I know that fewer
      people are won over by the written word than by the spoken word and
      that every great movement on this earth owes its growth to the great
      speakers and not to great writers."

 2. Then students will be given time to write down some thoughts on the
      quote and their own opinion (see 5Cs handout).

 3. Once they have finished writing their thoughts, I will divide them into
                                                                                                      | 15

    small groups and they will talk about their thoughts. They will answer
    questions about if they agree or disagree with the statement, why they
    feel that way, and if they think of any examples of arguments for or
    against the power of speech over writing in their own lives.
4. After this, I will break the class up into a group that agrees and one that
    disagrees. Then they are given time to each articulate why they chose
    their side. I let students switch sides if they want. I ask each side if they
    could be convinced to take the other side.
5. Once debating is over, I reveal that the quote was taken from Mein
    Kampf, and have them discuss how this ideology worked in favor of
    people like Hitler during his reign, and what it meant for the nazis and
    for the people hurt by their being in power.

    Note: In this scenario, interpretive communication works by asking
    students to derive meaning from the quote based on what they know, what
    is happening around them in their own lives, and what the context of the
    quote itself is. In this case it is a scaffolded approach to interpretive
    communication where they give initial thoughts, discuss its meaning with a
    partner, then must defend their stance. Once everyone has had a chance to
    be heard, they are given the opportunity to change their minds. Then they
    are given further context, and are asked to reconcile their stance with the
    way it was put into action in the past, who it hurt and who it helped. In
    doing all this, students get a chance to show their understanding of the idea
    and the way it caused harm in its original context, share their opinions on
    the subject, apply it to current and historical contexts, and demonstrate
    their knowledge of the consequences of the ideology of the given quote. In
    this way students are asked to interrogate their viewpoints, the viewpoints
    of their peers, the viewpoints of people that allowed this ideology to take
    power, and those who were harmed by this ideology.

My name is Erin Brandt. I'm from Central Iowa. I'm studying education,
because I have a lot of passion for my content area, world languages and
cultures. I love languages, and have studied several, including Spanish,
German, French, Russian, Latin and Chinese, and I am currently trying to
learn Korean and Japanese. I'm most particularly interested in teaching
German, as my family is German, and I feel closely connected to the language.
I hope to learn a lot about being a great teacher while teaching, and that I
can use these skills to inspire my students while working towards a career in
higher education.

           meaning in the target language by appropriately engaging in unrehearsed
           conversations and/or correspondence to actively participate in social
           interactions (face-to-face or electronically) as a global citizen.

       · Critical Literacy Skill(s): Focusing on sociopolitical issues
       · Instructional Resources Needed:

                 "Poverty in Latin America and the Caribbean: A Long and Bumpy
                    Road Ahead" (O'Brien & Ñopo, 2022)

                 Poster Carousel Handout

Step by Step Instructions

*Note: This strategy has been adjusted to fit the proficiency of Spanish 4
students*

 1. For the first part of this lesson, students will read the article, "Poverty in
      Latin America and the Caribbean: A Long and Bumpy Road Ahead."
      This article provides information about the current poverty rates in
      Latin America and historical statistics of poverty. It also explains how
18 |

      COVID-19 has affected the poverty rates within the past couple of years.
 2. Then, we will have a whole class discussion about the article.

    Discussion questions:

          · What is the main idea of this article?
          · How much did the poverty rate increase between 2019 and 2021?
          · How much has labor income dropped?

 3. After the discussion, students will be divided into groups of 4, where
      they will each complete a poster carousel activity. During this activity,
      each group is prompted with 4 questions about the article.

 4. There will be one question in each of the corners of the poster (see
      example). The students will be sat at each corner, which will assign them
      each a question. Using their previous knowledge and information from
      the article, each student will reflect on the questions and share their
      opinion using the Spanish language. Every answer must be in Spanish.

 5. After an allotted time, the group members will rotate the poster
      clockwise, and each student will now have a new question.

 6. After 3 full rotations, the students will have answered each question.
      Then, I will ask the groups to discuss their answers in Spanish.

 7. After the groups' verbal discussion, each group will share their answers
      and discussion with the whole class.

 8. While each group shares, the other students will reflect on their own
      answers and discussion and share any questions or comments they have.

 9. Throughout this lesson, students will examine sociopolitical issues in
      Latin America, specifically poverty. The students will reflect on the
      information in the the article and share their own perspectives on
      poverty in Latin America, allowing them to gain a deeper understanding
      of sociopolitical issues in Latin America, while also practicing their
      written and verbal Spanish communication.

Using Cornell Notes to Guide
Students Watching "Music" Episode
of Explained

   Will Douglas

   Overview

       · Disciplinary Literacy Skill: Determine a central idea of a text and analyze
           its development over the course of the text, including how it emerges and
           is shaped and refined by specific details; provide an objective summary of
           the text." (RI.9-10.2)

       · Critical Literacy Skill(s): Integrating multiple viewpoints
       · Instructional Resources Needed:

                 "Music" episode of Vox's Explained
                 Cornell Notes Handout

Step by Step Instructions

 1. I will have students watch the "Music" episode of Vox's Explained. This
      is because the central idea of the episode lines up with the topic nearly
      perfectly, and it integrates another viewpoint (music) into the topic of
      the day (and unit of "what makes us human" as a whole). And the reason
      for the topic is because philosophical questions are asked, and
      potentially answered, to help guide students in answering complex
      questions, which they will likely face no matter what path they take
      post-primary and post-secondary education.
                                                                                                      | 21

2. While they watch the episode, I will have them fill out the Cornell notes,
    with the first column of the Cornell notes (the one with the header of
    "elements of music") pre-filled out with rhythm, pitch, harmony, melody,
    and timbre. The first column is pre-filled out because students might try
    and incorporate other terms that are not the elements of music we want
    to focus on. Furthermore, humans are the only species on Earth that can
    exhibit all five of these elements. Below is an example the headers and
    one element of music, also available in a link to the Google Doc for the
    Cornell Notes Handout above, and here (https://tinyurl.com/2p5yy3ff).
    The purpose of using Cornell notes relates to the standard of
    interpreting the central idea of a text and analyzing its development, as
    the episode highlights its central idea on how humans are unique
    because of the elements, and it develops this idea by comparing and
    contrasting humans to animals. And, the Cornell notes structure, as
    stated and shown, follows the structure of the episode.

Element of Definition  Which Animals Can or Can't
Music                  Use This Element of Music
Rhythm                 (According to the Episode)

                       Can:
                       Can't:

 3. I will have provided students with a place to list which animals can or
      cannot use that element of music, see above. (Hint: humans should be in
      all five of the "can" lists).

 4. The class/activity will conclude with a whole class discussion, on how
      music makes us human. This will use the Cornell notes, as well as
      guiding questions.

Possible guiding questions*

 · Why does the episode make the distinction between humans and
      animals in the elements?
22 |

 · Why are humans the only beings that are known to exhibit all five of the
      elements (in your opinion/best guess)?

 · If another being, either from Earth or not, is known to have the same
      capacity for all five elements, what then? In other words, does that make
      them "human"?

*There are no right or wrong answers for these.

Using RAFT to Analyze Pascal's
"Claim-to-fame"

   Sullivan Fitzgerald

   Overview

       · Disciplinary Literacy Skill: A-SSE.A.1 - Interpret complicated
           expressions by viewing one or more of their parts as a single entity.

       · Critical Literacy Skill(s): Disrupting the commonplace
       · Instructional Resources Needed:

                 History of Mathematics : The History of Pascal's Triangle
                 RAFT activity sheets

Step by Step Instructions:

 1. For the first part of the lesson, I will show students a short video. This is
      to introduce, but more importantly, explain the history of Pascal's
      triangle. Students will take mental or physical notes of the names
      mentioned and their contributions.

 2. After the video is over, we will begin our RAFT activity. Start the
      activity with handing out the four different RAFT activity sheets to
      students. Explain the RAFT and how it works, and then assign each
      student one of the four roles. Once students have an understanding of
      their role and activity, have them group with one of each role to have
      total groups of four distinct roles. Guide the students through how the
      activity will work, reiterate the names of the roles they are researching,
      and explain the goal of the project. Do this by presenting a short walk
24 |

      through/example. Once they have an understanding, give the students
      5-8 min of research time to research their assigned role via the link
      given in their handouts (they are looking for supporting arguments and
      claims to prove their mathematician is deserving of the credit.)
 3. Once students have finished their research, they will begin their group
      discussion. Emphasize that this discussion topic is for students to
      support their roles' "claim to fame." Groups will maneuver their
      discussion from person to person, inviting rebuttals only after the
      speaker is finished with their thoughts.
 4. After about a ~20 min discussion within groups, students will reflect on
      their discussion by writing who they think is most deserving to be
      credited with the discovery of the Triangle and why. This approach
      helps students see a diverse point of view, and analyze who is often
      credited for something, and who is marginalized.
 5. Finally, the teacher will bring the class together and ask students to
      raise their hand for who they think deserves credit. Once people have
      raised their hands, the teacher will call on someone and ask for them to
      explain their reasoning. Do this for all 4 roles, and record thoughts on
      the board for kids to analyze. At the end of class, collect the notes from
      the students.

                    2020)
                 Guiding Questions (Handout)

Step by Step Instructions

 1. First, the class will be split into two groups: Group one will read the first
      article, while group two will read the second in order to gain a better
      understanding of gender inequality and how it occurs in our world.

 2. Everyone will read their assigned article individually before discussing it
      with their group.

 3. Groups will get together to discuss thoughts on the articles by
      completing Guiding Questions

 4. After discussing, students will form two circles, one inner and one outer
      circle.

 5. Group 1 will be in the inner circle first and will discuss their article
      using the guiding questions for ten minutes while the outer group
      listens.

 6. When time is up, the outer group will have time to ask questions.
 7. Then groups will switch, having group 2 be the inner circle and group 1

      be the outer circle.
 8. To conclude, students will write a quick reflection about their own

      thoughts on our discussion and hand it in as an exit ticket.
 9. Through this discussion and reflection, students will gain skills in

      reading comprehension, critical thinking, and making connections.
      Students will unpack sociopolitical issues through reading and
      discussing about people's real life experiences with gender inequality.

      reading with open margins to allow for notetaking and annotating)
 5. Annotating involves:
 6. Underlining any major pieces of information provided by the text.
 7. Highlighting words they do not understand.
 8. Circling keywords in the text.
 9. Writing down their initial reaction to a piece of information (ie. I have

      not thought about this before, why have I not thought about this, etc).
10. Highlighting connections they make between the two texts - this can be

      similar words and definitions, ideas that can be applied to pieces of
      information, or simple observations.
11. The strategy for annotating and close reading helps students think
      critically about the texts they are reading and form a stronger
      understanding while being actively engaged with the reading (Fisher,
      2015).

    Annotation in action - Excerpt from the Vox article

      The idea of anti-racism has been getting a lot of attention in recent days as
      Americans around the country rise up against police violence. But the idea
      is far from new, with roots in decades of civil rights work by black
      Americans, (what are some examples that can be pulled from history to support
      this piece of information) said Malini Ranganathan, a faculty team lead at the
      Antiracist Research and Policy Center.

      In recent years, thanks to the work of Kendi and others, the term itself has
      come to be used to describe what it means to actively fight against racism
      rather than passively claim to be non-racist. Anti-racism involves "taking
      stock of and eradicating policies that are racist, that have racist outcomes,"
      Ranganathan said, "and making sure that ultimately, we're working towards
      a much more egalitarian, emancipatory society."

      Part of that work is acknowledging our own positions in a white
      supremacist system (what are ways that I can be more aware of my position?). So
      I should acknowledge that I am a white woman, and as such, I can't talk
      about what it feels like to experience racism, or to fight against it as a
      person of color. (As a Brown woman, I can talk about how it feels like to
      experience racism, but I can't generalize and expect that to be everyone else's
      experience as well). But it's also not the responsibility of people of color to fix
      racism, or explain to white people how not to be racist. As Dena Simmons, a
      scholar and practitioner of social-emotional learning and equity and author
      of the upcoming book White Rules for Black People, put it, "Don't ask the
      wounded to do the work."

      So I spoke to experts on the topic to help people -- including myself --
      better understand what anti-racism means and what it looks like in practice.
      "White folks always want to know how they can do better," Simmons said. "I
      say, start by doing something." (where can I look more into how to do something?
      What does that look like).
                                                                                                       | 31

The Great Depression: Jigsaw
Method

   Carter Junge

   Overview

       · Disciplinary Literacy Skill: SS-US.9-12.16. Examine labor and
           governmental efforts to reform and/or maintain a capitalistic economic
           system in the Great Depression.

       · Critical Literacy Skill(s): Interrogate multiple viewpoints
       · Instructional Resources Needed:

                 "The Great Depression & The New Deal: A Very Short
                    Introduction" (Rauchway, YEAR, pp. 64-67, 78)

                 Jigsaw Assignment (Handout)

Step by Step Instructions

 1. The first part of the lesson, we will be reading pages 64-67 & 78 of Eric
      Rauchway's "The Great Depression & The New Deal: A Very Short
      Introduction." Reading the book will show students the steps that the
      United States took to help the country through the economic crisis of
      the GD.

 2. After reading, we will have a whole discussion answering discussing the
      following:

         What social programs were implemented to help people, and by
            whom?
                                                                                                      | 33

        Which program do you think was the most important?

3. After the discussion, I will split students up into four groups for them to
    analyze the four different programs that were implemented to help the
    crisis. Those programs are the Agricultural Adjustment Act (AAA), the
    Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC), the Works Progress Administration
    (WPA), and the Civil Works Administration (CWA). Students will be able
    to understand these programs and explain their importance to their
    peers through the jigsaw method. They will complete those questions
    based on the book using textual evidence.

4. Students will be able to disrupt the commonplace by looking at the
    issues everybody had no matter what their jobs status, income, or class
    was. Students will be able to interrogate multiple viewpoints as they will
    be put into groups and find out the answers based on textual evidence,
    as well as discuss the programs and their importance to the government
    and its people. After a determined amount of time, all students will
    come back together to explain/educate their peers about what their
    program/project is and their importance through the answers they found
    in the text.

5. Once students all come together, every group will have a few minutes to
    discuss their answers. In between rotations, we will have a brief
    conversation about the project/program and go over any important
    details that were stated or missed.

6. During each group's discussion, students will take notes on their
    answers and highlight key information.

7. After one rotation (after every group has shared their answers) students
    will have an understanding of each project/program and know its
    importance regarding what it did for the government, the people, and
    how it helped fight the economic crisis.

Sioux City East High School where I first started taking education classes.
Growing up, I learned that I had a soft spot for people, especially kids. I took
care of my cousins frequently and developed strong relationships with them
while still teaching them the right things to do. Education is important to
me because it is more than just students grabbing a pen and paper to write
down notes, it is about building personal connections with the students and
teaching them life skills like communication and organization.

Addressing The Effects of Minimum
Wage Through Collaborative
Conversation

   Overview

       · Disciplinary Literacy Skill: 6.EE-9-Represent and analyze quantitative
           relationships between dependent and independent variables

       · Critical Literacy Skill(s): Focusing on sociopolitical issues
       · Instructional Resources Needed:

                 "What is Minimum Wage?" [YouTube]
                 Iowa Occupational Employment Website (U.S. Bureau Of Labor

                    Statistics, 2022)

                    2022)
                 Jamboard Activity for Collaborative Conversation Strategy:

                    Jamboard Activity: Chapter Outline

Step by Step Instructions

 1. To start the lesson, students will watch a short introductory video that
      covers a general background about minimum wage and how it is
      implemented in society.

 2. Students will use the two texts, the Iowa Occupational Employment and
      the Minimum Wages per state in the U.S (https://tinyurl.com/bd8c852e )
36 |

      websites, to analyze and gather information about the state's (Iowa)
      minimum wage and the average wages per existing occupation in Iowa
      rounded to the nearest dollar.
 3. Students will be divided into groups of four, and each student will
      choose an occupation from the Iowa Occupational Employment website.
      They will show their analysis when completing the class Jamboard
      activity. Instructions for the group analysis include:
 4. Gathering what the occupation responsibilities are and the average
      hourly wage.
 5. Finding the ordered pairs between time (hours worked) and earnings
      (money made) rounded to the nearest dollar for their chosen Iowa
      occupation for one eight-hour work day and post them on their group's
      jamboard.
 6. Once students have finished this task individually for their occupation,
      the group will collaboratively discuss their findings, moving from
      person to person and identify the independent and dependent variables,
      and post those to the jam board page (see section two of the Jamboard
      handout)
 7. Each group will then be given a large sheet of graphing paper to plot
      their points on the x and y axis, which correspond to the independent
      and dependent variables of time and earnings.
 8. The four students will draw all four different wage lines on the same
      graph paper and collectively analyze each other's data. Students will
      collaboratively discuss and write an equation of the line pertaining to
      the relationship between time and earnings for their occupation.
 9. Students will compare these results to the linear line corresponding to
      the Iowa minimum wage on the jam board activity.
10. Throughout the collaborative conversation strategy suited to the
      Jamboard, groups will use their critical thinking and comprehension to
      depict their observations about the relationships between hourly wage
      and the growth of each linear line.
11. From these observations, students will be able to focus on the
      sociopolitical issue of minimum wage by noting the growth differences
      of income that pertain to the population of Iowa residents. Furthermore,
      students will focus on how minimum wage affects how fast or slow
                                                                                                        | 37

      people are able to simply afford the cost of living, which can also link to
      poverty.
12. Students will resonate with how the shapes of the linear graphs pertain
      to the social issue of minimum wage by considering the amount of time
      it may take for one occupation to earn applicable earnings over another.
      This is a sociopolitical issue because minimum wage creates an aspect
      of inequality of income for those who are working minimum wage jobs.
13. During the collaborative jam board discussion/activity, the teacher will
      walk around the room to answer any questions and promote
      participation from all members of each group.

Using the Fishbowl Strategy to
Discuss Book Banning

   Overview

       · Disciplinary Literacy Skill: (RL.8.1) (DOK 1,2,3)
       · Critical Literacy Skill(s): Focusing on sociopolitical viewpoints
       · Instructional Resources Needed:

                 "Pros and Cons of Book Banning"
                 "Book Banning" (Webb, 2009)

Step by Step Instructions:

This mini-lesson provides a way to examine the practice of banning books and
allows students to generate ideas and questions through fishbowl discussion.

 1. The lesson will begin with two groups (numbering them off): pros and
      cons.

 2. Each group will read their articles individually and then come together
      to create questions or comments they have for their time in the mini
      circle. (Pros group will focus on the pros list in their article).

 3. After their discussions, the groups will form a fishbowl discussion with
      a mini circle in the middle and an outer circle.

 4. This creates a way to talk about this sociopolitical issue. Book banning
      creates censorship and removes censored material from the classroom.
      It is a sociopolitical issue because it can target books on racism, slavery,
                                                                                                       | 39

      white supremacy, or other political issues. Cite evidence supporting
      their analysis of the article, and pull key features of the text, so there is
      critical thinking and understanding of the articles.
 5. One group will get into the mini circle and talk amongst themselves,
      asking questions and commenting on the article, while the outer group
      will listen and take notes if needed.
 6. Then, the groups will switch and do the same.
 7. When the fishbowl discussion is finished, we will create a large group
      discussion over the articles and comment on the fishbowl discussion.
      There will be guiding questions that tie into each article and some could
      be pulled from the fishbowl.

I'm from a small town in northeast Iowa called Clarksville. I care about
education because ever since I was in high school, I knew I wanted to be in
the school, whether that was a counselor or teacher. I think that education
is important and much needed, especially when teaching future doctors,
electricians, and other workers. It also gives kids a safe space to learn and be
themselves and provides a way to bring out social skills. My goal is to become
an English teacher for middle school and be able to teach the books that I read
as a kid in school as well as new books for kids can reflect on. An interesting
fact about me is that my uncles signed me up for a little kids' tractor pull in my
hometown when I was a kid. I ended up winning, then placing 1st at State and
ultimately getting 3rd at the Corncob Palace at Nationals. I was also invited
to compete at the World Championships.

Langston Hughes and Walt
Whitman; Venn Diagrams

   Overview

       · Disciplinary Literacy Skill: Determine the meaning of words and phrases
           as they are used in the text. (RL.9-10.4) (DOK 1,2,3)

       · Critical Literacy Skill(s): Interrogating multiple viewpoints
       · Instructional Resources Needed:

                 I Too, Sing America
                 I Hear America Singing

Step by Step Instructions

 1. I will first give students a Venn diagram that focuses on Hughes I Too,
      Sing America and Whitman's I Hear America Singing.

 2. I will assign students to groups of four to work on this activity. As they
      are analyzing, it will be helpful to talk about their ideas with their peers.

 3. Using close reading skills, they will compare and contrast the ideas of
      the poems and how they relate to each other.

         Whitman was a White Male author living in the 1800's and wrote
            his poems based on the pride he had in America.

         Hughes was a Black Male author living in the early 1900's and wrote
            his poem based on his own pride and how black people were treated
            in America.

 4. Students will then analyze the pieces from a modern lens and how they
      could change if the poems were written in modern times.

         Students will notice ideas that are on either Hughes' side of the
            diagram or Whitman's side of the diagram and underline them if
            they could apply to a current modern lense for both authors.

Analyzing "War Girls" using a
TPCASTT Guided Close Reading

   James Mechikoff

   Overview

       · Disciplinary Literacy Skill: (RL.11-12.4) Determining the meaning of
           words & Phrases.

                 "War Girls" (Jessie Pope)
                 TPCASTT Format Guide [PDF]
                 Example Handout

Step by Step Instructions

I will perform an annotated close reading of the poem War Girls, by Jessie
Pope, as an opportunity to teach World War I literature, analyze a poem for
figurative language, and give a voice to an otherwise historically marginalized
group from a period of time they are often forgotten or overlooked. In the
case of this example lesson, this will be analyzing women's voices in World
War I poetry, which is a typically under-recognized group. In this case, this
is disrupting the commonplace as the most famous authors of World War I
poetry are Rupert Brooke, Wilfred Owen, Siegfried Sassoon, etc. All those
examples are men, and thus this will be different than what is commonly read
and analyzed. This annotated close reading will use the TPCASTT format,
with some modifications for the idea of this being also in mind for critical
                                                                                                       | 43

literacy that I am calling a TPCASTT + CL [Example Handout Here], which
is an excellent guided format for how a close reading of a poem can be
performed using a detailed handout that has both guided instructions, and a
table for students to write.

 1. During the first step, I will hand out the poems to the students face
      down, and ask students to hold off on reading any of them till I have
      asked students to turn them over when we work on this together. I
      would also hand out the TPCASTT + CL handout, as is shown just below
      these steps.

 2. T - Title - The first step in the TPCASTT + CL involves analyzing the
      meaning of the title before reading the poem [See Example Handout
      Here].
       a. This is when I'd first ask students to flip over the poem and move
            into the first step of the TPCASTT + CL which focuses on just the
            title, with no reference to the poem. I'd focus primarily on asking
            students what they think about the poem's title "War Girls," and to
            detail their thoughts in the handout section for this. If a poem was
            used without the title, you can skip to the next step!

 3. P - Paraphrase - The second step of the TPCASTT + CL is to paraphrase
      the surface meaning of the poem.
       a. This is when I'd encourage students to read through the poem
            quietly, just one time through, and then right down what they think
            is happening. I'd remind students not to dig into things deep here,
            just read it and write it down. I'd also write my own example while
            they quietly read and write theirs.

 4. C - Connotation - The third step, connotation, invites students to look
      more deeply into the poem.
       a. This is the big step really. Now is when I'd have students identify
            and highlight the parts of the poem with a deeper meaning, or that
            they think is metaphorical. I'd have students all write down one
            line/quote on their TPCASTT + CL handout with what they think is
            the meaning. Whatever they best think is a good example of
            figurative language.

 5. Pause and discuss (Optional)
44 |

       a. This is an optional step, but now would be a great time to stop and
            discuss with students in pairs, small groups, or a whole class
            discussion to both break up the independent work, and to make
            sure students are getting things. The C step really builds into the
            rest of the steps, so it might be a good chance to also informally
            assess where the students are before they start to really work with
            the poem more.

 6. A - Attitude - The Tone and the Narrator
       a. Here I'd encourage students to again, read through the poem and
            focus on the feeling the poem gives. Does our poetic narrator seem
            to have a specific tone in the poem? How do they feel about what
            the poem is kind of about like they identified in the previous step?
            I'd have students detail this under the A section of the handout.

 7. S - Shifts - Looking for when the A step changes.
       a. This is where we will look at things like where the attitude of the
            poem might switch around. This can be especially helpful for more
            common poems like sonnets that are renowned for their shifting
            nature, but also just for general poetry like "War Girls" for this
            example. I'd make sure to emphasize with students not just to note
            where it happens, but also to discuss what it looks like. I might ask
            if the poetic narrator's point of view changes and how?

 8. T - Title - Reevaluate
       a. Now encourage students to step back, and reevaluate the title.
            Before, we did it with no real context, but here, we have the context.
            I'd maybe make sure to focus and ask students, does the title have a
            double meaning? Is the title itself figurative? Or is the title literal?
            All great points you can use to encourage students when they are
            filling out their TPCASTT + CL.

 9. T - Theme - Finally, all the pieces together, what is the meaning here?
       a. This is the final big puzzle coming together. Here is where I'd ask
            my students to take everything we have now, and put it together.
            What is the real theme going on here? What is the final big picture?
            It puts all the pieces that we built up before together, and it will
            help for the next steps.

10. + CL - Critical Literacy - Disrupting the Commonplace
                                                                                                       | 45

       a. This is the final step that I want to talk about since this focuses on
            the big picture of this lesson. Now that we know the big idea of the
            whole poem, I want to shift students' focus to talking about how
            this poem might be different from the standard poems we analyze
            when looking at world war 1 poetry. I'd highlight things like the
            woman author, and how this perspective differs from what is often
            considered the norm. When looking at World War I poetry, figures
            like Siegfried Sassoon, Wilfred Owens, and Rupert Brooke, all of
            whom are males, often come up in discussion. Therefore looking at
            a women's perspective in this case is far from what is often
            considered the commonplace when discussing World War I poetry.
            I will encourage students to address how they think this poem
            disrupts the commonplace of world war I poetry and the era of
            world war I. I am incorporating this lesson as part of a larger series
            of lessons, but this can be done with any poem.

The reason I chose this text in the context of critical literacy is that I wanted
to analyze a perspective that can often be forgotten and overlooked when
looking at this particular era of poetry. When analyzing world war 1 poetry,
the perspective that is most focused on is often the soldiers. I wanted this
lesson to instead disrupt that commonplace and focus on the perspective of
others in the war, in this case, the women back at home.

                 "Still I Rise" by Maya Angelou
                 Response Heuristic Graphic Organizer
                 Audiobook of "Still I Rise"

Step by Step Instructions

 1. First I will discuss with the students the definitions of imagery
      (According to Dictionary.com, imagery means "the formation of mental
      images, figures, or likenesses of things, or of such images collectively")
      and figurative language (According to Dictionary.com figurative language
      means ("language that contains or uses figures of speech, especially
      metaphors.") Are there similes in the poem? Or any metaphors? What
      feelings does the poem bring out? We will discuss what they mean and
48 |

      what to look for in the poem as they listen to the audiobook of "Still I
      Rise" by Maya Angelou.
 2. This lesson focuses on Multiple Viewpoints by "Paying attention to and
      seeking out the voices of those who have been silenced or marginalized
      (Lewison et al.). The Response Heuristic Graphic Organizer will be
      helpful in citing evidence about imagery on the voice of the author and
      how she expresses her perspective of being a Black woman. Students
      have a chance to show their voices as well, sometimes being young, their
      voices or opinions aren't taken seriously. With the Response Heuristic
      students have a chance to share how being a student of color can be in
      society through personal experiences or empathizing.
 3. I will then hand out a Response Heuristic Graphic Organizer that is
      three columns in which students will write down in the first column a
      quote from the poem "Still I Rise" by Maya Angelou that demonstrates
      imagery. In the second column students will explain why it
      demonstrates imagery. (Is the chosen quote a simile or metaphor? What
      feelings does the quote demonstrate?) In the third column students will
      write a connection to the passage chosen.
 4. Then I will ask students to start asking themselves questions to help
      them cite evidence. I will give them time to work on their own to fill out
      their Response Heuristic Graphic Organizer such as What kind of
      figurative language and imagery do we see in this first stanza?What perspective
      is the author trying to demonstrate? How can you relate to this poem in your
      own life?
 5. After filling out the form, students will be asked to share their responses
      to a neighbor to discuss the multiple viewpoints, such as the authors,
      their own, and their neighbors perspective.
 6. The strategy of response heuristic is important because "Response
      Heuristic was designed to foster readers' inferences about an author's
      meaning and create space for the reader's personal interpretation of
      literature (Gillis and Van Wig).

My name is Crystal Millan-Herrera and I am a first generation Latina student
and I am from Northwest Iowa. Education is important to me because
Education opens many doors of opportunity, growth, and learning new skills.
Education is a chance to improve day to day in any material and to
demonstrate that anyone can learn. My goal is to graduate from college and
to find a job as a middle school English teacher. I hope to inspire others,
especially first generation and Latino/a students to show that we can be
teachers and professionals. Education makes anything possible.

Collaborative Discussion About How
Viruses are Spread

   Samuel Peterson

   Overview

       · Disciplinary Literacy Skill: Interpret the parameters in a linear or
           exponential function in terms of a context. (F-LE.B.5)

       · Critical Literacy Skill(s): focusing on sociopolitical viewpoints
       · Instructional Resources Needed:

                 "How are Viruses Spread?" (NCTM.org)
                 Pandemic Activity Handout
                 Pandemic Activity Main Questions
                 5 Practices Model
                 Pandemic Applet

Step by Step Instructions:

 1. I plan for this lesson to be done in two days (or one day under block
      scheduling). At the end of the lesson before this, I will give a Pandemic
      Activity Handout to students either on paper or electronically to give
      them some background information before class. It is also good
      information to have, so I want them to have access to their own copies.

 2. I will begin the lesson by dividing the class into small groups where they
      will be for this whole activity. From there, I will go into the lesson and
      the instructions. I will give the students a scenario for them to discuss
      within their small groups. The scenario is "if one random person in this
                                                                                                       | 51

      school had a new virus with a 5% chance of transmission per contagious
      interaction with others, how many people would get the virus within one
      month?"
 3. I will have the students collaborate to create a mathematical model to
      show and explain their thinking. There is no obvious answer to this
      question. I want the students to get thinking and talking within the
      context of mathematically modeling the spread of viruses.
 4. At this point, I will use the 5 Practices Model to have groups show their
      work and explain their thinking so that other groups see the work of
      others to expand their thinking on this question.
 5. I will introduce the students to this Pandemic Applet and have them
      explore, using collaborative discussion, the effects of what happens
      when they change the population size, days contagious, chance of
      contracting virus per contagious contact, and number of contacts per
      day to familiarize the students with the tool that we will be using.
 6. After this, I will introduce a series of questions (pandemic handout) for
      students to collaborate to complete. I will individually help students that
      are struggling with the technology, and verbally ask guiding questions
      along the way to help students that are struggling to keep pace with
      their group.

Majors: Secondary Education and Mathematics

I am from Walnut, Iowa which is a small town in Southwest Iowa. I am
finishing my undergraduate degree in mathematics and education with the
goal of becoming a high school math teacher. I plan on going to graduate
school for math education. I strongly believe that shaping society begins in
the classroom, so it is important to break away from traditional math settings
and strive to make lessons more interactive and collaborative as math is used
in the real world. Math is used to understand the world around you, so our
lessons should be created in the same way.

Using Read-Write-Pair-Share to
Discuss Housing Insecurity

   Brianna Sander

   Overview

       · Disciplinary Literacy Skill: G-MG.A.3: Apply geometric methods to
           solve design problems (e.g., designing an object or structure to satisfy
           physical constraints or minimize cost; working with typographic grid
           systems based on ratios).

       · Critical Literacy Skill(s): Disrupting the commonplace
       · Instructional Resources Needed:

                 Anthony's Story
                 Homeless Essentials
                 Response Heuristics Chart
                 Overall lesson: Creating a Tiny House

Step by Step Instructions

 1. At the beginning of this mini-lesson, I will give each student the
      Response Heuristic Chart. This chart asks students what items should
      be included in the tiny homes they will build following this mini-lesson.
      Students will write why they chose that item along with the items on the
      chart and provide textual evidence to support their reasoning.

 2. As I give out the chart, I will number the students into two groups The
      students in group one will read Anthony's Story, and the students in
      group two will read the collection of stories on www.homeless-
                                                                                                       | 53

      essentials.com.
 3. As students read their given material, they will individually fill out the

      chart provided.
 4. After the students have read their texts and completed their charts, I will

      pair them with a student who read the same texts to compare their
      items and explain why they chose them. These comparisons will be
      based on the information that the students have put in their charts.
 5. After the pair discussions, I will create groups with a pair from each
      reading. These groups will present their lists based on their readings
      and discuss the items they chose, and why they chose them for the tiny
      homes which they will build following this mini-lesson.

The Read-Write-Pair-Share strategy promotes discussion and engagement
among students. This strategy allows students to share their thoughts with
other students and receive feedback before discussing in a bigger group, thus
making students more comfortable discussing with the bigger group (Frey et
al. 81-82).

This mini-lesson disrupts the commonplace through students reading about
and discussing items that students may take for granted in their everyday
lives. It also exposes students to the reality of homelessness and allows
students to look at and discuss the reality of social classes through the lens of
homelessness.

      Note: This mini-lesson is a part of a project students will complete
      afterward. To view the outline of this project, see Overall lesson: Creating a
      Tiny House. This mini-lesson meets the empathize and define steps of this
      project.

Brave New World: Using the
Character Anatomy in Critical
Literacy

   Elijah Strong

   Overview

       · Disciplinary Literacy Skill: Analyze how complex characters (e.g., those
           with multiple or conflicting motivations) develop over the course of a text,
           interact with other characters, and advance the plot or develop the theme.
           (RL.9-10. 3) (DOK 2,3)

       · Critical Literacy Skill(s):
                 Interrogating multiple viewpoints
                 Focusing on sociopolitical viewpoints

       · Instructional Resources Needed:
                 Brave New World, Audiobook by Steve Parker
                 Character Anatomy worksheet

Step by Step Instructions

 1. Students will be placed into four groups and given a character to
      analyze.
       a. Group 1: Bernard Marx
       b. Group 2: John
       c. Group 3: Lenina Crowne
56 |

       d. Group 4: Mustapha Mond
 2. Pass out Character anatomy sheet (One for each group).
 3. Students will record aspects of their assigned character and apply them

      to its corresponding body-part located on the "Character anatomy
      sheet." The goal is for students to analyze alternating, and sometimes
      opposing viewpoints of the characters. What exactly do each of the
      characters think of the position of government and, in turn, how does
      that affect them?
       a. By now, students should be on the 12th chapter in the novel.
       b. As students are writing, walk around the classroom and offer

            assistance to those who need it, as well as listening in on group
            discussions to make sure students understand the assignment and
            the material.
 4. Students will record their thoughts and components on the sheet for 15
      minutes with their groups. After recording, students will be asked to
      select a spokesperson for their group to share their findings with the
      class.
       a. Students will also be asked to record their favorite components of
            their character analysis on the board. It will help to categorize the
            character better and allow students to see what the main themes of
            each character are.
       b. One individual from each group will make sure each students' name
            is written at the top of the "character anatomy sheet," and then turn
            it in at the front of the class, before leaving.

Giving students the opportunity to discuss characters' viewpoints in the novel
will offer insight into the roles of government, hierarchy, and the general
consensus of how the world inside of Brave New World works. The goal is for
students to utilize this knowledge to create their own inferences toward the
sociopolitical situations inside the novel, and hopefully in the real world.
