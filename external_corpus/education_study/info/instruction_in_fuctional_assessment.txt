About the Textbook

Instruction in Functional Assessment introduces learners to functional assessment (FA), which
includes a variety of assessment approaches (indirect, observational, and experimental) for
identifying the cause of an individual's challenging behavior for the purpose of designing
effective treatments. FA is mandated by federal law and is a recognized empirically based
approach to treatment of individuals with challenging behaviors (e.g., disruptive, self-
injurious, and aggressive behaviors). Instruction in FA is essential for students who will
one day enter professions as educators, psychologists, social workers, counselors, or mental
health professionals.

    The purpose of this textbook is to provide instruction in FA skills for pre-professionals
in the fields of education and psychology. This supplemental resource provides the context,
background, and knowledge to facilitate students' acquisition of the methods, decision-
making, and skills involved in conducting FA. Each chapter begins with focus questions
designed to promote reflective thinking and ends with discussion questions. To promote
application of FA in diverse situations and teach important lessons, case studies of indi-
viduals with challenging behaviors, interactive activities, and opportunities for practice are
embedded in the chapters. Moreover, the text includes the ingredients to facilitate students'
role play and rehearsal of appropriate FA skills while working in cooperative groups and
using performance-based training.

Reviewer's Notes

Instruction in Functional Assessment is a resource for students who plan to pursue a career
in education, mental health, and related disciplines. Dr. Marcie Desrochers has expertise in
the area of functional assessment, applied behavior analysis, and treatment of behavior dis-
orders. Dr. Moira Fallon possesses expertise in the area of inclusive education and curricula
design. Together, they have been able to combine their knowledge and skills to describe the
application of functional assessment in educational settings. The resulting work expertly
details a complex clinical procedure, functional assessment, by providing important in-
troductory material such as the cause and prevalence of behavior disorders, the behavioral
principles that underlie functional assessment, and practical considerations for conducting
a functional assessment. The material is based on empirically-supported research, and the
authors present the information in a well-written and easy to follow format. In addition, the
text offers focus questions to serve as identifiers for critical information presented within
each chapter. Case examples and role-play scenarios are also included to facilitate student
acquisition of the material. Unlike other reviews or functional assessment, this book is very
process-focused and places an emphasis on linking assessment outcomes to intervention
development--a socially relevant outcome for any child or educator who is affected by
challenging behavior. This is a highly recommended text and one that I plan to use in my
own practice.

                Preface

A background in functional assessment is critical for all pre-professionals who are entering
educational and mental health service fields and preparing to work with children and adults
with developmental disabilities. Functional assessment (FA) includes a variety of assess-
ment approaches (e.g., indirect, observational, and experimental) for identifying the cause
of the individual's challenging behavior in order to design effective treatment. FA is man-
dated by federal laws for use in schools (IDEIA, 2004) and is an approach based on several
decades of research demonstrating its effectiveness (Beavers, Iwata, & Lerman, 2013). As
new professionals enter applied settings with initial training, they must demonstrate the
knowledge and skills to work with all persons, including those whose behaviors are dif-
ferent and challenging. Children and adults whose behaviors are challenging deserve the
opportunity to develop to their full potential (Fallon & Brown, 2010). FA procedures give
professionals the tools to analyze and remediate those challenging behaviors that stand in
the way of healthy development and high quality of life.

    As inclusion continues to evolve in public school classrooms, work sites, and residen-
tial communities, psychologists, social workers, educators, counselors, and mental health
professionals need to know FA procedures well and apply them with a variety of client
characteristics and in multiple settings. The authors of this book believe that all interdisci-
plinary professionals and the families of persons with challenging behaviors need expertise
in the professional skills of assessing and managing challenging and unique behaviors.

    What is the purpose of this book? The purpose of this book is to teach interdisciplinary
professionals about the process of functional assessment (FA). As inclusion continues to
evolve in public school classrooms across the United States, those professionals' beliefs
and practices are challenged by the changes in the students who make up their classroom
communities (Shapon-Shevin, 2007). As many more people with challenging behaviors
and unique characteristics enter new inclusive or heterogeneous settings, professionals may
be ill-prepared to manage their behaviors. As new, pre-service level professionals enter
their disciplines of education and psychology with initial training, they must demonstrate
the dispositions, knowledge, and skills to work with all persons, including those whose
behaviors are challenging. Children whose behaviors are challenging deserve the opportu-
nity to develop to their full potential (Fallon & Brown, 2010). The emphasis of this book
is on empirically-based strategies for teaching functional assessment to pre-professionals
who will work in inclusive settings. The intended audience for this book is students who
will be future teachers, therapists, and practitioners in the disciplines of psychology, mental
health, counseling, social work, and education. The book may be used as the main textbook
for teaching FA techniques, a supplementary text, or as a reference source for new profes-
sionals working in the field. Although methods to effectively teach various aspects of a
FA approach have been studied (e.g., Iwata et al., 2000; Wallace, Doney, Mintz-Resudek,
& Tarbox, 2004), none have put it all together in a comprehensive package that guides
college students and pre-professionals through the research, theory, and practice needed
to perform this useful and effective method that is the cornerstone of practice in many
professional disciplines today.

    One of the unique features of this book is the integration of both psychological and
educational perspectives embedded into the content. For instance, a psychologist may en-
counter a situation in which an individual's challenging behavior is presented in the school,
home, vocational rehabilitation site, or work setting. An educator or counselor may find
instances of challenging behaviors with children in kindergarten through 12th grade and
across academic and social areas.

    What features will the learner find helpful and useful in this book? Focus questions are
presented at the beginning of each chapter to assist the reader in understanding the critical
content of the chapter. Case studies of persons with challenging behaviors, interactive activi-
ties, quizzes, and practice activities are embedded in several chapters. Sample blank forms
pertaining to tasks in the FA process are contained within the final chapter for duplication
and use by readers as resources within their own settings. Terminology is defined within
the context of each chapter. At the end of each chapter, discussion questions are available
to use for reflective thinking in either a written, online format, or in-person oral discussion.

Understanding Developmental and
Intellectual Disabilities

    Children and adults with developmental or intellectual disability require the assis-
tance of interdisciplinary professionals and parents to support their full development across
adaptive areas. There are often many areas of need seen in a changing context across the
individual's lifespan. A developmental disability (Developmental Disabilities Assistance
and Bill of Rights Act of 2000 PL 106-402) is a chronic mental and/or physical condi-
tion that occurs between 5 and 22 years-of-age and is likely to occur indefinitely [www.
govtrack.us/congress/bills/106/hr4920] (Brown & Felce, 2007). For a diagnosis of develop-
mental disabilities, the individual shows functional limitations in three or more categories
of: self-care, receptive and expressive language, academic learning, mobility, self-direction,
independent living, and economic self-sufficiency. The ability of individuals with develop-
mental disabilities to interact with others in an appropriate manner, to take care of one's
self and one's needs, and to maintain focus and active learning are critical skills. Failure
to perform in a general education classroom is often linked to poor social skills (Salend,
                Instruction in Functional Assessment                              Chapter 1

                2005). The related services, care, and treatment required to provide the individually tailored
                support needed may span professional areas such as: medical, speech-language pathology,
                special education, psychology, occupational therapy, physical therapy, counseling, and social
                work among others (http://www.acl.gov/Programs/AIDD/Index.aspx).

                    The current diagnostic criterion for developmental disabilities is based more on func-
                tion (limitations and capabilities) than category. As seen in Table 1, the main developmental
                disabilities include intellectual disability, autism spectrum disorder (ASD), cerebral palsy,
                and seizure disorder (Odom, Horner, Snell, & Blacher, 2007). Some individuals may have
                social, emotional, and behavioral issues within the definition of the disability (Vaughn &
                Bos, 2009). A functional diagnostic system provides information for treatment possibilities
                and deemphasizes labels that may produce negative connotations and reactions by others
                (Panek & Smith, 2005; Scior, Connolly, & Williams, 2013).

                    According to a survey of over 100,000 parents, approximately 14% of American
                children have a developmental disability (Boyle et al., 2011). In this study, developmental
                disability was very broadly defined and included learning disability, stuttering, and Atten-
                tion Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) in addition to the categories listed in Table 1.
                The most common developmental disabilities include learning disability and ADHD with
                the prevalence of autism and ADHD increasing from 1997-1999 to 2006-2008 (Boyle et
                al., 2011). A recent United States nationally representative telephone survey of over 60,000
                households with children found that the prevalence of autism spectrum disorder (ASD)
                was 2% among children ages 6-17 years in 2011-2012, an increase from 1.16% found in
                2007 (Blumberg et al., 2013).

Behaviorally Defining & Measuring
Challenging Behaviors

    In addition to deficits in academic performance and adaptive behaviors, individuals
with developmental disabilities often engage in challenging behaviors (Lowe et al.,
2007; Poppes, Van der Putten, & Vlaskamp, 2010). Emerson (2001) defines challenging
behavior as, "culturally abnormal behavior(s) of such intensity, frequency or duration that
the physical safety of the person or others is likely to be placed in serious jeopardy, or
behavior which is likely to seriously limit use of, or result in the person being denied access
to, ordinary community facilities" (p. 3).

    General categories of challenging behaviors include aggression, stereotypy, self-
injurious, or disruptive behaviors. These categories require additional description to allow
reliable assessment and treatment procedures to be performed. More specifically, self-
injurious behavior (SIB) may consist of the individual forcibly (loud smack sound) hitting
one's own body with open or closed hand, or banging head against self or objects. A more
specific and objective description of the behavior is necessary because one person's defini-
tion of a general category of behavior, such as aggression, may differ from another's, which
is a problem in reliability. For instance, in one study in which 120 teachers were asked to
define "disrespectful" behavior, over 17 different behaviors were given (e.g., talking back,
not following teacher's directions, interrupting adults) (Landers, Servilio, Alter, & Haydon,
2011). A behavior category would be inaccurately measured if it means one thing to one
person and quite another to someone else.

    A behavioral definition must be objective, clear, specific, and complete such that two
observers naïve to that person could read the definition and independently and reliably
identify instances of the same behavior (Hawkins & Dobes, 1977). This approach to deter-
mining the accuracy of measurement and adequacy of definitions is called interobserver
reliability. Accurate measurement of the behavior is necessary for assessment purposes, to
implement treatment procedures accurately, and to evaluate treatment effectiveness (Martin
& Pear, 2011). For example, one behavioral definition of self-injury involves biting self by
upper and lower teeth making contact with skin resulting in pink marks or indentations
on skin (see Matson, & Turygin, 2012 for additional definitions of self-injury). Likewise,
tantrumming is inadequate as a description of challenging behavior since it refers to a
general category of behavior that would be open to interpretation. More specifically and
objectively, tantrumming might be defined as screaming above a normal conversational
level and forcefully banging one or both fists on the table. Aggression might be defined
as making contact with an open hand, fist, or foot to any body part of another person. See
Table 2 below for a list of questions to determine if your behavior definition is adequate.

Checklist To Determine If The Behavior Of Interest, Challenging Or
                Desired Behavior, Is Appropriately Defined

    Can you count or time the behavior, or measure how long it takes before it occurs?
    Did you use observable and measurable terms in defining the behavior?
    Will a stranger know exactly what behavior to look for after reading your
    definition?
    Can you explain what the behavior is not (i.e., give non-examples of the behavior)?
    Can you break the behavior into smaller specific, and more observable units?

    In addition to defining the behavior accurately, behavior measurement procedures must
be specified. Behavior can be observed and measured in terms of how many times it occurs
or its frequency (e.g., number of coughs, instances of throwing chairs, or interruptions), how
long the behavior occurs or its duration (e.g., duration of screaming, out-of-seat, or off-
task), the form or topography of the behavior (e.g., how a yoga move is made, or how hair
is brushed), or how long it takes for the behavior to occur following a stimulus or its latency
(e.g., how long before someone walks to school after being told to go, or does their home-
work after it has been assigned). A behavior can also be measured in terms of its remnants,
called permanent product (e.g., throwing items can be measured by counting the items
on the floor, destroying furniture may be measured by counting the disconnected pieces).
The frequency or duration of behavior within a larger period of time can be measured (See
Miltenberger & Weil, 2013 for more). This is termed continuous recording.

    Reliable identification of the challenging behavior will facilitate assessment of its func-
tion so that effective interventions can be designed. We will review environmental reasons
for challenging behavior after considering prevalence and associated factors.

Prevalence, Risk Factors, and
Psychosocial Implications of Challenging
Behaviors

    The likelihood of professionals encountering individuals displaying challenging behav-
iors is fairly high. One prevalence estimate of challenging behaviors displayed by people
with intellectual disabilities ranges from 15-17.5%, according to Koritsas and Iacono's
(2012) review of 22 frequently-cited studies. It should be noted that estimates of prevalence
of challenging behaviors for individuals with developmental disabilities varies depending on
the methodology used (e.g., variations in definitions, assessment measures) and population
addressed (e.g., institutional, residential, nationalities). When focusing on self-injurious

                                                 4
Instruction in Functional Assessment     Chapter 1

behavior, a 19.1% prevalence rate was found in one state-wide parent survey of children
with developmental disabilities (MacLean & Dornbush, 2012).

    There are many co-occurring factors (such as diagnostic category and level of func-
tioning) that may compound the difficulties that the individual with challenging behaviors
and others around that individual face. Children with autism are more likely to show be-
havior problems compared to children without autism and more individuals with severe
conditions are more likely to engage in challenging behaviors compared to those with
less severe conditions (Totsika, Hastings, Emerson, Lancaster, & Berridge, 2011). In their
sample of over 1,300 North American children and adolescents with autism, Felce and Kerr
(2013) found that 88% of individuals with autism engaged in mild to severe aggression,
with those cases mostly occurring to caregivers (56%). However, even with a sample of high
functioning children with autism spectrum disorder, 72-86% had some sort of behavioral or
emotional problems (Yoon, Ze, Tze, & Min, 2011).

    Similarly, more severe levels of intellectual disability and autism have been found to be
associated with the occurrence of challenging behaviors in a sample of adults with disabili-
ties in Sweden (Lundqvist, 2013). More than half (62%) of these individuals had at least
one challenging behavior as gathered through administration of the Behavior Problems
Inventory (Rojahn, Matson, Lott, Esbensen, & Smalls, 2001) via interview method.

    Multiple challenging behaviors and/or comorbid psychiatric conditions may be
more likely to be present with individuals who display challenging behaviors (Rosenberg,
Kaufmann, Law, & Law, 2011). Based on the use of the Self-Help and Behavior rating scale
administered to 943 children with severe disability, Oliver, Petty, Ruddick, and Bacarese-
Hamilton (2012) found that high frequency repetitive or ritualistic behavior was associated
with a greater risk of severe self-injury. Moreover, low mood of people with severe and
profound intellectual disabilities has been associated with challenging behaviors (Hayes,
McGuire, O'Neill, Oliver, & Morrison, 2011). A higher rate of challenging behaviors
was found with young children with atypical development and no ASD and comorbid
psychopathology (e.g., anxiety behaviors, conduct problems, eating/sleeping problems,
inattention/impulsivity) as measured by the Baby and Infant Screen for Children with
Autism Traits (Matson, Mahan, Sipes, & Kozlowski, 2010). Likewise, higher rates of chal-
lenging behavior have been found with a sample of adults with developmental disabilities
and symptoms of depression (Turygin, Matson, MacMillan, & Konst, 2013).

    The presence of communication deficiencies has also been linked to the occurrence
of challenging behaviors (Kevan, 2003; Matson, Boisjoli, & Mahan, 2009). In one inter-
esting study examining the relationship between communication skills, social skills and
challenging behaviors with 109 children with ASD though, the presence of challenging
behaviors was associated with more impaired social skills than difficulties in communica-
tion (Matson, Hess, & Mahan, 2010).

    It is important to note that the studies cited above examining associated risk factors with
the occurrence of challenging behaviors involved some form of descriptive/correlational
research method, which merely provides information about the type of association and its
strength. Correlational results do not provide information about causation or cannot tell if
one variable causes another; such as the proposition that poor communication skills cause
challenging behaviors to occur. It may be that poor communication causes challenging

                                      5

behavior, challenging behaviors cause poor communication, or quality of early home
environment causes both poor communication and challenging behaviors. The careful ma-
nipulation and control of confounding variables involved with an experimental research
method rules out alternative explanations and that methodology is not present with cor-
relational research designs. Correlational research simply portrays the relationship between
two variables (e.g., positive relationship where both variables increase, negative relationship
where one variable increases as the other decreases). In the research cited above, due to
the nature of the variables studied (e.g., type of disability and occurrence of challenging
behavior), only descriptive/correlational research is possible.

    The ramifications of challenging behavior are pervasive. Severe behaviors such as ag-
gressive, self-injurious, and disruptive behaviors can be some of the most intractable and
troublesome to deal with, contributing to staff and teacher stress and burnout (Hastings &
Brown, 2002; Male & May, 1998). Parenting stress has been associated with higher levels
of child behavior problems (Rezendes, & Scarpa, 2011). Totsika et al. (2011) found that
mothers of children with autism are more likely to have emotional problems compared to
mothers of children without autism. The occurrence of challenging behavior by the indi-
vidual may also negatively affect attachment with support staff (De Schipper, & Schuengel,
2010). Staff may see themselves as less able to control the individual's behavior if it is severe
and thus less likely to step in to intervene to improve it (Dilworth, Phillips, & Rose, 2011).

    The occurrence of challenging behaviors may lead to the use of restrictive procedures to
curb those behaviors (Matson & Boisjoli, 2009). Allen, Lowe, Brophy, and Moore (2009)
reviewed social service agencies' plans for 901 individuals with developmental disabilities
in South Wales, UK, and found that more severe aggressive behavior was associated with a
higher use of restrictive procedures (e.g., seclusion, emergency restraint, medications).

Applied Behavior Analysis

    Applied behavior analysis (ABA) principles and techniques provide a means of ad-
dressing the challenging behaviors of individuals with developmental disabilities. ABA
consists of a variety of environmentally-based procedures to increase socially significant
behaviors (Cooper, Heron, & Heward, 2007). ABA is based on learning principles and
procedures, and many of the techniques used in this field have been empirically validated
to be effective at changing overt (observable) and covert (e.g., thoughts, feelings, images)
behaviors. The use of ABA has led to a greater understanding of the occurrence of both
normal and abnormal behaviors and has resulted in the development of many empirically-
based treatment procedures for challenging behaviors (Fisher, Piazza, & Roane, 2012).

Environmental Factors Maintaining the
Individual's Challenging Behavior

    The main factors that contribute to the occurrence of challenging behavior include the
immediate environmental consequences that follow that behavior and the cues or anteced-

                                      6
Instruction in Functional Assessment     Chapter 1

ents that signal those desired consequences. A recent meta-analysis of over 170 empirical
studies found that, in most clinical cases, a clear environmental reason for the individual's
challenging behavior was identified (Matson et al., 2011).

    Positive reinforcement and negative reinforcement are the basic environmental func-
tions or maintaining variables for individuals' challenging behavior (e.g., Beavers, Iwata,
& Lerman, 2013; Lancioni, Singh, O'Reilly, Sigafoos, & Didden, 2012; Matson, 2009).
positive reinforcement is a term used when events, objects, or sensory stimuli presented
immediately following a behavior result in an increase in that behavior in similar situations
(Martin & Pear, 2011). For instance, an adolescent who has severe intellectual disability
and is in a wheelchair may grab at staff 's clothes resulting in much negative attention from
the staff member (e.g., a stern look and statement to, "Please don't do that!"). Although
the staff member may be attempting to decrease the individual's behavior, if the grabbing
behavior is increasing and occurring when someone is around, then that behavior may be
maintained by positive reinforcement in the form of attention. positive reinforcers are
the specific consequences that increase the individual's behavior, and can include attention,
toys (tangibles), or food (edibles). It should be recognized that there are many consequences
that are positive reinforcers for a child and what is a positive reinforcer for one may not be
for another. Attention (even in the form of reprimands), objects (e.g., toys, food, electronic
devices), and specific events (e.g., seeing a show, going for a walk) can be positive reinforcers
when they increase the behavior that preceded it.

    Reinforcement may also be produced by engaging in the behavior itself without any
mediation by others, termed automatic positive reinforcement. For instance, the indi-
vidual might be engaging in excessive finger tapping as a function of the sensory stimulation
produced by that behavior. Likewise, thumb sucking may occur because of the sensations
it produces on the skin.

    Another major function of challenging behavior is negative reinforcement (Lancioni,
Singh, O-Reilly, Sigafoo, & Didden, 2012). negative reinforcement refers to stimuli
or events that when removed or avoided immediately after a behavior increase its rate in
similar situations (Martin & Pear, 2011). A negative reinforcer is an object or event that
when it is immediately removed (escape conditioning) or prevented (avoidance conditioning)
following a behavior results in that behavior being more likely to occur in similar situations.
For example, a child at the dinner table may scream at the top of her lungs leading to the
parent sending the child to her room. If that child screams at dinnertime more often, then
negative reinforcement, in the form of "escaping" from the dinner table, may be occurring.
As another example, a child who is having difficulty with his homework talks to nearby
classmates to avoid completing the work. See the Table 3 below for additional examples of
challenging behaviors maintained by positive and negative reinforcement.

                                      7

The individual may receive one of the following after the        One of the following may be removed or avoided after the
behavior resulting in its increase:                              behavior resulting in its increase:
Attention (e.g., reprimands given after a child screams)         Demands/tasks (e.g., tantrums result in unpleasant task or
                                                                 situation being removed)
Tangible (e.g., hitting anther child to get a toy, grabbing
someone's food)                                                  Attention (e.g., running away to remove undesired
                                                                 attention)
Automatic (nonsocial sensory-based) (e.g., sucking fingers
due to the sensation it produces, regurgitation to stimulate     Automatic (nonsocial sensory-based) (e.g., hitting head to
the esophagus, screaming because of the sound produced,          relieve pain, being aggressive to remove noise or get out of a
rocking due to inner ear stimulation)                            crowd)

    As is the case with positive reinforcers, a stimulus that is a negative reinforcer for
one individual may not be so for another. The best way to determine if something is a
negative reinforcer is to test whether the rate of a behavior increases when certain events
are removed immediately after that behavior compared to a condition in which no conse-
quences are delivered following the behavior. To ensure consistency in the results and rule
out confounding factors, this test should be replicated or repeated in an A-B-A-B fashion
where A = no consequence and B = a consequence for behavior is provided.

    A history of reinforcement for the occurrence of challenging behavior in addition to
the presence of certain antecedent stimuli or conditions that "set the stage" or increase the
likelihood for the behavior (e.g., difficult work assignment, certain person) should be iden-
tified. The purpose of assessment is to identify the reason or function for the individual's
challenging behavior. An analysis of the function of behavior entails breaking the situation
into smaller units to allow a clearer understanding and determination of the behavioral
principle (positive reinforcement or negative reinforcement) involved in controlling the
individual's behavior (Martin & Pear, 2011). The motivational condition, antecedent stim-
ulus, behavior, immediate consequence, and long term effects should be identified to reveal
the behavioral principle that is involved, as illustrated in the box below. A motivational
operation refers to a temporary state or condition that changes the value of the reinforcer
and the probability of behavior that leads to that reinforcer (Michael, 2000). For instance,
after not drinking water for several hours while out in hot weather, the value of a drink as a
positive reinforcer will increase and there is a greater likelihood of the individual asking for
something to drink. Additional examples of how the individual's situation can be broken
down, and thereby better understood by analyzing the motivational condition, antecedent
stimulus, behavior, and immediate consequence is shown in the Table 4 below.

    Determining the function of an individual's challenging behavior can, at times, be
difficult. For a small percentage of cases, the individual's behavior may be controlled by
multiple functions or be unable to be specified (Beavers & Iwata, 2011; Mueller, Nkosi, &
Hine, 2011). The challenging behaviors of 521 participants reviewed by Beavers and Iwata
(2011), showed only 16.9% had multiple functions with most behaviors involving multiple
response topographies. In a small percent of cases (roughly 4-12%), the individual's chal-
lenging behavior may be maintained by idiosyncratic variables or, particular antecedents
or consequences specific to that case (Schlichenmeyer, Roscoe, Rooker, Wheeler, & Dube,
2013). As Schlichenmeyer et al. (2013) note in their review of the research literature, idio-
syncratic variables such as preferred conversation (Roscoe et al., 2010), instructional style
(Borrero et al., 2004), or the therapist leaving the room (Edwards et al., 2002) may be
involved in setting the context for increased likelihood of the occurrence of the individual's
challenging behavior. These idiosyncratic variables may be difficult to pinpoint unless as-
sessment procedures are tailored to the individual's circumstances. Additional factors that
may contribute to the individual's challenging behavior can be seen in Table 5 below.

           tional responses (fear, anger, anxiety)

      · Medication effects and side effects (e.g., lethargic)

           lighting, unclear directions, unpredictability, inadequate help, unclear
           expectations

      · Events, holidays, certain activities (e.g., dances), visitors

Special Education Perspective

    Many children with behavior disabilities (BD) including challenging behaviors are
served in general education classroom settings. Approximately 25% of all school age chil-
dren identified with a disability are labeled as having a behavior disability (Vaughn & Bos,
2009). Twice as many males as females are labeled as having BD and more children who are
African American are labeled than any other ethnicity (Vaughn & Bos, 2009).

    School districts and agencies often lack personnel trained in the professional decision
making process to handle these difficult situations and so must hire experts to provide
training at high financial cost (Hall & Hall, 2003). It is of critical importance to develop
partnerships between schools that lack the expertise and colleges and universities that can
train teachers to manage challenging behaviors ( Johns & Carr, 1995).

    The movement for inclusion of students with disabilities in public schools has had
a major impact on the way teachers are trained to work with all students and on the
way students learn in the classroom setting (Mastropieri & Scruggs, 2010). The inclu-
sion movement, which began in the early 1990's after decades of integration of students
with disabilities into the least restrictive environments (LRE) for learning, redefines the
philosophy of teaching and learning so that all learners, regardless of abilities, have the
opportunity to work on their academic and social skills alongside of their peers. Inclusion is
the process of teaching so all students can process and understand the material in whatever
way is best for them. Inclusive education is a core belief and set of teaching practices that
supports the tenet that all students should be full members of the community (Shapon-
Shevin, 2007, p. xii). However, students with challenging behaviors are often found to be
segregated due to those behaviors. Professionals and families must work together to ensure

                                      10
Instruction in Functional Assessment      Chapter 1

that the effects of challenging behavior are addressed in inclusive educational settings that
provide heterogynous groupings for students.

    As inclusive classrooms across the United States continue to evolve according to legal
mandates, teachers' beliefs and practices are still being challenged by the changes in the
students who make up their classroom communities (Shapon-Shevin, 2007). As new, pre-
service level teachers enter the field of education with training, they must demonstrate the
dispositions, knowledge, and skills to work with all students. The instructional demands
for teachers are staggering; many classes have students for whom English is not their pri-
mary language, students who have experienced trauma, students who are years behind their
classmates, and students who lack basic experiences for understanding their world. For
teachers, the demands are to assist students and their families in the identification and
remediation of challenging behaviors that prevent full inclusion placements. However, the
movement may not be successful especially for those students with significant behavioral
needs if educators cannot find a way to identify, assess, and intervene in these significant
behavioral challenges in classrooms. A strong need exists for effective methods to decrease
the challenging behaviors of individuals with developmental disabilities.

Summary

    Individuals with developmental disabilities may display a broad array of challenging
behaviors and lack the social and adaptive behaviors that are necessary for functioning
in everyday life. However, students with disabilities have the right to be educated in set-
tings that are heterogeneous. Inclusion has been used to describe the education of students
with disabilities in general education settings or inclusive settings with peers who can act
as role models. Co-occurring conditions for the individual may be present and increase
the difficulty and complexity of that case for the professional addressing the individual's
needs. The first step when attempting to help the individual is to behaviorally define that
person's challenging and desired behaviors, which can assist in its measurement, assess-
ment, and treatment. Environmental factors, such as positive reinforcement and negative
reinforcement, are major reasons for the occurrence of challenging behaviors and must be
addressed in on-going assessment and treatment procedures. Applied behavior analysis is
an empirically-based approach that can be used to teach adaptive and desirable behaviors
and decrease the challenging behaviors observed in various settings with this population.
Chapter 2 will review FA methods as a means to identify the function of individual's chal-
lenging behaviors.

    important when prioritizing which of several challenging behaviors should be targeted?

2. Discuss whether risk factors are likely to cause challenging behaviors. Explain why it
    is difficult to know what the cause or challenging behaviors is (hint: draw from your
    knowledge of research methods).

3. Why is it important to understand the function of an individual's challenging behavior?

Exercise 1: Behavior Definition

1. What are the characteristics of a well-defined behavior?

2. Are each of the following definitions of behavior adequate? If not, then revise the
    definition to improve it.
                a. Non compliance = a child does not complete the instruction delivered by
                       the experimenter within 6 s of presentation of the instruction

                b. Stereotypy = flapping hands or arms, rocking torso, jumping and turning in
                       circles, waving, mouthing

                c. Aggression = firmly grabbing and pulling on the experimenter or cursing

3. Read the following behavioral definitions and determine if you think the problem be-
    havior in bold is well-defined. If your answer is "no," change the problem behavior by
    defining it appropriately.
                a. Tomika is very disrespectful in that she sasses her teachers when she does
                       not want to do what they ask.

b. Paula engages in inappropriate interactions with her peers by being quiet
       and disagreeable.

                c. Inappropriate vocalizations that Ternia says include loud or high-pitched
                       statements such as "No!" and "I want to go home."

4. Define teasing.

Exercise 2: Identifying, Defining, and Measuring
Behavior

    With a partner, go to a public location (e.g., cafeteria, library, building hallway or court-
yard) and identify a behavior that one or many individuals are displaying. Be sure that the
behavior occurs fairly frequently (e.g., at least once per min).
1. Behaviorally define the behavior.

2. Indicate how to measure it (e.g., frequency, duration, latency, permanent product).
    Select a data sheet from Chapter 7 templates.

3. You and your partner should independently measure it.

                                                14
Instruction in Functional Assessment                          Chapter 1

4. Compare your data with your partner's. Did you agree on all occurrences of the be-
    havior? Why or why not? How could you improve your definition of the behavior?

Principles

What is Functional Assessment?

    Functional assessment (FA) refers to a variety of approaches, including indirect, ob-
servational, and experimental/functional analysis procedures (Hanley, Iwata, & McCord,
2003; Hagopian, Rooker, Jessel, & DeLeon, 2013; Iwata, Dorsey, Slifer, Bauman, &
Richman, 1994; Mueller, Nkosi, & Hine, 2011). FA has been found to be useful with a wide
range of behaviors and populations, such as feeding disorders (Gale, Eikeseth, & Rudrud,
2011; LaRue et al., 2011), chronic hand mouthing (Roscoe, Iwata, & Zhou, 2013), off
task behavior of children in the classroom (Meyer, 1999), social avoidance (Harper, Iwata,
& Camp, 2013), aggression and self-injurious behaviors (Fritz, Iwata, Hammond, Bloom,
2013), elopement (Tarbox, Wallace, &Williams, 2003), hand flapping of children (Mueller,
Sterling-Turner, & Scattone, 2001), hair twirling (Deaver, Miltenberger, & Stricker, 2001),
and rumination (Lyons et al., 2007). The spring 2013 issue of the Journal of Applied Behavior
Analysis is devoted to FA-related research reflecting the strong empirical foundation that
has contributed to the development of this approach. Furthermore, FA is a relatively versa-
tile approach that, following instruction, has been implemented by parents (Gale, Eikeseth,

experienced individuals or under the supervision of a qualified individual (e.g., a Board Certified
Behavior Analyst®)

& Rudrud, 2011; Shayne & Miltenberger, 2013), students (Iwata et al., 2000), teachers
(Wallace, Doney, Mintz-Resudek, & Tarbox, 2004), and staff (Moore & Fisher, 2007).

    The main reason for conducting a FA is to identify the possible causes of an indi-
vidual's challenging behavior so that an effective treatment can be designed (Chander &
Dahlquist, 2010). Identification of the variables maintaining the challenging behavior prior
to designing treatment is necessary since certain treatments can be contra-indicated or
ineffective, depending on the function of the behavior (Iwata, Pace, Cowdery, & Milten-
berger, 1994; Newcomer & Lewis, 2004).

    Other reasons for using a FA include that it:

         · Is required by federal law (IDEIA, 2004)

         · May provide convincing evidence for treatment team decision-making and
              provide accountability

         · May result in less use of a punishment procedure (Pelios, Morren, Tesch, &
              Axelrod,1999)

         · Is recommended by professional associations (National American School
              Psychologists)

    A FA approach is used to gather data regarding why the individual's challenging
behavior is occurring. Challenging behaviors may serve a purpose or function for the in-
dividual and are often a function of environmental conditions (Hanley, 2012). After the
reinforcers maintaining the individual's challenging behavior are clearly identified, it should
be possible to predict the circumstances under which the behavior is likely to happen and
what is causing it to recur. The motivating conditions and antecedents for the individual's
challenging behavior may be altered to decrease that behavior. For example, if Mary cries
and hits herself due to fatigue when her bedtime approaches, then an earlier bedtime can
be arranged. Similarly, Darrell's hitting and screaming for candy at the grocery store may be
prevented by bringing some of his favorite snack on the shopping trip and keeping the trip
short. Additionally, more appropriate behaviors that achieve the same result may be taught,
called functional replacement behavior. For example, Nija's crying when she wants her
doll can be decreased by teaching her to make the sign for doll in situations where she cried
to get it in the past. To decrease the likelihood that Caden runs out of the classroom when
reading class begins (a difficult skill for Caden), his teacher provides additional one-on-one
instruction to establish his reading skills.

FA Methodology

    There are three main categories of functional assessment approaches--indirect (e.g.,
questionnaires, rating scales), observational, and experimental/functional analysis. Gath-
ering information about the conditions surrounding the behavior, asking relevant individuals
questions about the behavior are initial steps. If the results of indirect and observational
assessment are unclear, testing the possible maintaining variables for the individual's chal-
lenging behavior would next be performed. See Figure 1 of the FA process for an outline of
this overall way to proceed when addressing the individual's challenging behavior.

Indirect Functional Assessments

    An indirect functional assessment is a procedure in which information about the
challenging behavior is gathered from persons who are closest to the individual, such as
parent(s), teachers, service providers, and aides. Rating scales, questionnaires, and inter-
views are used to gather information on potential factors that contribute to the individual's
challenging behavior (e.g., O'Neill et al., 1997). One example of an indirect assessment
method is the Functional Analysis Screening Tool (FAST). The FAST is a 16-item ques-
tionnaire that can be administered to individuals who know the person with challenging

                                      19
Instruction in Functional Assessment      Chapter 2

behavior well to identify antecedents and consequences correlated with the behavior (Iwata,
DeLeon, & Roscoe, 2013).

    When using an open-ended FA interview, persons who are the closest to the individual
with challenging behaviors are asked to describe in detail the circumstances occurring
before and after the challenging behavior, the conditions under which it occurs most and
least, its characteristics, and more (Hanley, 2012; O'Neill et al., 1997). Correlated variables
noted from the information gathered during the interview can then be further examined
with other types of FA. Additionally, an indirect functional assessment may be helpful
with initially defining the challenging behavior since the relevant individuals are asked to
describe exactly what the individual does when performing the challenging behavior.

    There are limitations of using an indirect FA. Since the type of data gathered with
indirect methods is not based on objective direct observation, it may be laced with differing
perspectives and subjective viewpoints and be prone to memory errors. For example, inter-
view data can provide much information, but can also be biased. A parent may relay during
an interview that her child's challenging behavior only "occurs when his dad is taking care
of him." In this example, the parent seems to identify the father as part of the problem. In
a recent study, Iwata et al. (2013) found that reliability, or the agreement between raters,
using the FAST was 71.5%. The validity of the FAST, or an outcome comparison of FAST
to an experimental analysis of behavior, was found to be 63.8% across 69 cases. These results
suggest that although indirect methods, such as the FAST, can be a quick means of ob-
taining preliminary information about the nature of the individual's challenging behavior,
additional corroborating evidence about the function of the behavior is necessary. This ad-
ditional evidence may be obtained by the therapist or teacher conducting an observational
FA.

Observational Functional Assessment

    In an observational functional assessment, the professional directly and unob-
trusively observes the individual's challenging behavior in the natural environment, and
records the circumstances surrounding the behavior (Lalli, Browder, Mace, & Brown,
1993). One method of collecting observational assessment information is to use a time
chart, where a mark is made in the appropriate cell to indicate the time period and day in
which a particular behavior was observed (Touchette, MacDonald, & Langer, 1985). From
this information, certain activities, events or people correlated with the occurrence of the
challenging behavior can be identified as possible causes of that behavior. For example, as
seen in Table 6 below, if it is found that Sally consistently runs around and screams at 10
am, then the activity and conditions that usually occur at that time, say, during spelling, can
be explored as somehow being associated with her behavior (e.g., difficult, noisy, boring,
peer attention) and possibly contributing to it.

X = at least one instance of the behavior

     Data is collected on the antecedents, behavior, and consequences (the ABCs of be-
havior) as they unfold in the situation where the challenging behavior most often occurs.
This procedure of writing down in as much detail and objective a manner as possible is
called ABC functional assessment. An ABC functional assessment often takes place
in multiple settings or under different conditions (e.g., during math, language, or physical
education instruction) so as to provide similar and contrasting information about the situ-
ations where the challenging behaviors are likely to occur. The degree of consistency in
co-occurrence of certain antecedents and/or consequences with the challenging behavior
across 30-60-min sessions held across 5 or more days is analyzed. These data may also
serve as baseline information to compare the effects of later implementation of treatments
to decrease the individual's challenging behavior. Teachers, families, or staff may record
the circumstances surrounding the individual's challenging behavior. For instance, Annette
may scream when adults around her are talking and when she does this, an adult typically
asks her to be quiet. Examples of antecedents within the learning environment may include
instructional content, teacher proximity, and peer interactions. Positive reinforcers for the
challenging behavior may include certain language, gestures, removal of demands, physical
touch, or eye contact by teachers or other students. See Table 7 for an example of an ABC
recording data sheet.

    A direct observational FA can provide an objective means of gathering information
that may help to substantiate indirect assessment findings. The data generated from an
ABC recording procedure can be subjected to a conditional probability analysis of
the correlated observed antecedent and consequence events to determine which events are
most likely to be associated with the challenging behavior (e.g., frequency of X antecedent
co-occurring with behavior divided by the total number of times X occurred multiplied by
100). However, it should be recognized that observational methods are correlational and so
causal conclusions are not possible. There may be other factors involved in contributing to
the occurrence of the individual's challenging behavior that are involved and have not been
identified.

Functional Analysis (FAn)

    Functional Analysis involves an experimental test of the different possible functions
for the client's problem behavior (e.g., attention positive reinforcement, tangible positive
reinforcement, demand/negative reinforcement). FAn has been established as a clinically
effective method of identifying the function of challenging behavior and treating it based
on several decades of accumulated research (Beavers, Iwata, & Lerman, 2013). Using a
standard FAn, attention, demand, tangible, and alone conditions are compared to a play/
recreational control condition (e.g., Iwata, Dorsey, Slifer, Bauman, & Richman, 1982/1994).

                                         22
Instruction in Functional Assessment      Chapter 2

    The attention condition is conducted to determine if the individual's problem behavior
is due to attention positive reinforcement. Under conditions of social deprivation and in
the presence of one or two adults, eye contact, physical contact, reprimands, and verbal
interaction "No, don't do that" or similar comments that typically are given by others in
the individual's natural environment are delivered immediately after the individual's chal-
lenging behavior. Note that this condition may be tailored to the specific stimuli found to
correlate with the occurrence of the individual's challenging behavior based on indirect and
observational FA.

    The demand condition is conducted to determine if the individual's problem behavior
is due to escape/avoidance of task demands or activities (i.e., negative reinforcement). The
therapist or teacher presents an activity or instruction to complete a task that the individual
has in the past (based on interview or observational data) had difficulty in completing even
when physically guided to do so. If the individual engages in the challenging behavior at
any time, then the therapist immediately turns away from the client for 30 s.

    The tangible condition is conducted to evaluate whether tangible positive reinforcement
is maintaining the individual's challenging behavior. Based on information gathered from
other assessments (e.g., indirect, observational), preferred objects are placed out of reach
(e.g., on a shelf ). When the individual engages in the challenging behavior, that preferred
item is delivered for 30 s.

    In the alone condition, the client is in a room by him/herself with no toys or activi-
ties. Note that, as is the case in each of these conditions, all safety concerns should be
addressed and appropriate precautions taken. The therapist observes the client's behavior
for the purpose of data collection from a one-way mirror or video camera. This condition
involves a situation in which low levels of stimulation are present in order to test whether
self-stimulation or automatic reinforcement is maintaining the client's problem behavior.
The client is placed in the therapy room alone, without any toys or materials that would
provide a source of stimulation.

    In the play condition, toys or activities are presented and the therapist interacts socially
with the client. This condition serves as a comparison or control condition to rule out
confounding variables such as the challenging behavior due to variables present in the at-
tention, tangible, or demand conditions (e.g., the presence of the therapist, materials, social
interaction). The therapist and client are in a room with a variety of toys or leisure activities
present. The therapist provides social praise and brief physical contact contingent on the
client's appropriate behavior at least once every 30 s.

    Evidence regarding the function of that behavior is provided when levels of the chal-
lenging behavior are higher in one condition compared to the other conditions. For instance,
if the level of client's behavior is consistently (e.g., across 5 sessions or more) greater in
the demand condition than that in the other conditions, the function of the challenging
behavior would be negative reinforcement. See Chapter 6 for additional information about
FAn and a description of the conditions.

                                      23
Instruction in Functional Assessment  Chapter 2

Research Design & Functional Analysis

    A FAn compares the effects of various conditions using single participant experimental
research designs. Commonly used research designs when conducting FAn include multiele-
ment and ABAB designs as defined below. The duration of presentation of each condition
is typically at least 5 min with a brief (e.g., 5-min) break between conditions if several are
presented on one day.

    When implementing an ABAB Research Design, or a reversal-replication research
design, the first step involves measuring the dependent variable (the individual's challenging
behavior) during the baseline phase (A), when no treatment is applied (Martin & Pear,
2011). Once stability of the behavior has been achieved, the treatment or the independent
variable (B) is applied and its effect on behavior is observed. Lastly, these two phases are
repeated or replicated. A convincing demonstration of the effect of the independent vari-
able on the dependent variable is provided if the behavior changes only when treatment
is present and not when it is absent. In other variations of this design different treatment
conditions can be compared as opposed to including a baseline comparison.

    In the graphed data presented in Figure 2 below, the use of an ABAB research design
in a FAn to test the effects of easy versus difficult school work on the off-task behavior of a
child in the classroom is illustrated. The levels of off-task behavior are greater when difficult
school work is presented compared to when easy school work is presented. Intervention
can be designed to provide the child with greater assistance or teach the child to ask for
assistance when difficult school work is given.

                                                    Figure 2

     An example of an ABAB research design to test the effects of easy versus difficult school work

school work on the off-task behavior with one child.

    With a multielement research design two or more conditions or treatments (i.e.,
independent variable) are alternated rapidly (e.g., treatments A and B are conducted in

                                                24
Instruction in Functional Assessment  Chapter 2

one day or during the same hour). This design is also known as alternating treatment or
simultaneous treatment research design (Martin & Pear, 2011). The conditions are alter-
nated across days (e.g., Day 1: attention, demands, alone, play; Day 2: demands, alone, play,
attention, etc.) to reduce the confounding effects of order. Like an ABAB research design,
the purpose of the multielement research design is to determine which of several condi-
tions or treatments produce a change in the behavior of interest. The difference in levels
of the challenging behavior between conditions is evaluated to determine which condition
affects the behavior most. In the following graphical presentation of FAn seen in Figure 3,
the frequency of aggressive behavior is highest in the attention condition compared to the
other conditions providing experimental evidence that attention positive reinforcement is
maintaining the individual's aggressive behavior.

Instruction in Functional Assessment  Chapter 2

· Present 10 min of alone condition
· On day 2, repeat above with randomized order of conditions.
· Repeat for 3 more days or more depending on the stability of the data

Data Analysis

    At least five data points are collected for each condition so that trends, levels of the
problem behavior, and non-overlapping data points across conditions can be compared.
Graphed data are examined to identify differential levels of the individual's behavior across
conditions. The data patterns are analyzed by examining stability, trends, overlapping data
points, and magnitude of effect observed for the test conditions compared to the control
(play/recreation) condition (Martin & Pear, 2011). If variability in the data pattern and/or
overlapping data patterns are observed, then additional sessions may need to be conducted
until stability and differentiation of the levels of behavior in each condition is reached to
allow an interpretation of the results (see Bourret & Pietras, 2013 for more).

Advantages and Disadvantages of FAn

    Like the other FA methods, there can be advantages and disadvantages to using a
functional analysis approach. The major advantage of FAn is that it provides the most
accurate information about the function of the individual's behavior (Floyd, Phaneuf, &
Wilcynski, 2005; Iwata et al., 2013). FAn is the only method that yields a "cause and effect"
interpretation of the findings. Since this approach uses an experimental method that in-
volves manipulating conditions (attention, alone, demand, or demand conditions) while
controlling or holding constant other potentially confounding factors (play condition), the
results from a FAn can be used to identify the specific factors maintaining the problem
behavior. In a comparison of indirect, observational, and FAn methods to identify the func-
tion of the challenging behavior of seven children with autism, Tarbox et al. (2009) found
that indirect and FAn methods produced more conclusive findings for all seven children
than an observational method did. In contrast, Alter, Conroy, Mancil, and Haydon (2008)
found one-to-one correspondence between FA observational methods and FAn and less
correspondence with indirect FAn methods when identifying the function of challenging
behavior with four young males. Additionally, in Taylor and Romanczyk's (1994) study, the
functions of students' challenging behavior based on observations of teachers' interaction
with their students in the classroom predicted experimentally verified functions of those
behaviors.

    There are notable limitations to using a FAn. When the problem is multiply deter-
mined or low rates of occurrence of the challenging behavior exist, then interpretation
of the results of a functional analysis may be difficult. Another disadvantage is that the
function of the challenging behavior may not always be readily identified using the stan-
dard functional analysis conditions (i.e., attention, tangible, demand, control). In which
case, tailoring the conditions used in a functional analysis to the individual's circumstances

90% of 176 inpatient cases of individuals with intellectual disability and severe challenging
behaviors were identified as a result of conducting a series of more individually-tailored or
idiosyncratic FAn.

    Researchers have attempted to address the difficulties with conducting FAn, such as
the ethical issues when targeting harmful behaviors (Hanley, 2012). As one approach, pro-
cedures may be modified to reduce the threat of harm to the individual due to provocation
of the challenging behavior during the assessment conditions. For instance, conditions may
be a single trial (rather than 5-min sessions) and embedded in naturally-occurring ongoing
activities in the individual's environment (Bloom et al., 2011; Bloom, Lambert, Dayton,
& Samaha, 2013). Other approaches entail measuring precursor behaviors instead of the
actual challenging behavior (Fritz et al., 2013) or latency to engage in the challenging be-
havior (Neidert et al., 2013). A summary of the different types of FA and their advantages
and disadvantages can be seen in the Table 8 below.

Family Contribution to Assessment of the
Individual's Challenging Behavior

    Families play an essential role in providing necessary information for early detection
and diagnosis, assessment, and are often involved in implementing interventions (Friend
& Cook, 2007). Early detection followed by intervention provides the best chance of long-
term beneficial outcomes for children with challenging behaviors (Shapiro & Batshaw,
2013). Understanding the family and their culture is necessary when assessing an individ-
ual's challenging behavior. Cultural differences may involve any combination of age, race/
ethnicity, social class, sex, language, religion, sexual orientation, ableness (special needs),
regionality, and nationality. For instance, a family may come from cultural contexts with
very different viewpoints about education and appropriate child behaviors and this may be
involved with the occurrence of the individual's challenging behaviors. The more different
the cultural background of the family, the more likely that the individuals involved will
face cultural conflicts resulting from those differences (Brown, 2010). This is especially true
when sensitive topics or cultural incidents occur. Understanding the family and the cultural
context of the family is critical to a comprehensive assessment and treatment. Professionals
must ensure that families are part of the process and strive to build a positive, strong part-
nership with the family.

Ethical Considerations

    A number of ethical issues should be considered before undertaking an FA. Ethical
principles or procedures refer to rules that professions or organizations have specified to
ensure survival of the culture (Skinner, 1953). Abiding by ethical considerations protects
the client and others and can contribute to high quality care for the person. The overarching
ethical considerations are: do no harm, right to privacy, and informed consent. Several
federal laws mandate assessment, evaluation, and interventions with persons with disabili-
ties, including Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, Americans with Disabilities
Act, the Buckley Amendment of Families Equal Right to Privacy Act (FERPA) and other
state and local policies. Professionals should be well-versed about these laws and policies
and act accordingly. Other ethical factors specific to the FA process include: informed
consent from the individual and family to perform FA and determine acceptability of
treatment procedures, competence of the professional, adequate and appropriate behavior
measures of baseline, treatment, and post-treatment to allow objective and fair evaluation
of treatment effectiveness, the choice of a least restrictive alternative or intervention path,
and the right to effective treatment based on research based intervention practices. Table
9 lists professional organizations in psychology and education that describe ethical guide-
lines, principles, and procedures.

    According to Friend and Cook (2007), all assessment procedures must meet the fol-
lowing ethical guidelines:

         · Must be nondiscriminatory on a racial, cultural, and linguistic basis.
         · Instruments must be valid and reliable.
         · Administration is by trained professionals.
         · Testing format must take into account possible impact of the suspected

              disability.
         · Testing must be in the language with which child is most comfortable.
         · Include a variety of assessment tools and techniques.

Exercise 1: Case Study Simulation

    Jimmy is a fifth grade student who has been in and out of five foster homes over the
course of his life. Jimmy does not have many friends, due in part to his frequent transitions
to new schools and homes. Jimmy is currently placed with a loving older couple who want
to stabilize his daily life. Jimmy is very quiet and shy, often described as sullen by previous
teachers. He participates in noxious behaviors, such as vomiting and spitting, when asked
to complete a task that he doesn't like or want to do. Using the approaches described in this
chapter, evaluate Jimmy's problem behavior by answering the following questions:

1. Propose a behavioral definition for Jimmy's challenging behaviors. Ad lib as needed.

      Treatment Implications
    Based on the Functional

             Assessment

Focus Questions:

         · What treatment approaches challenging behaviors and increase appropriate
              behaviors?

         · Explain how knowledge of the function of problem behaviors can impact treatment
              decisions.

    Treatment choices to decrease an individual's challenging behavior are based on many
factors, such as the function of behavior, empirically-based practices, ethical considerations,
likelihood of the desired behavior being supported long-term by others in the natural
environment, and the particulars for the case in question (e.g., context, quality of the en-
vironment, severity of the problem behavior, people present, resources available, setting,
level of functioning, communication skills, etc.) (Spencer, Detrich, & Slocum, 2012). The
severity and persistence of the individual's challenging behavior may influence treatment
decisions in terms of number of components in a treatment program, reinforcer magnitude
or frequency, and staff/teacher training.

    A primary factor considered in the design of effective treatments is the function of the
challenging behavior (Kurtz et al., 2003; Repp, Felce, & Barton, 1988; Lancioni, Singh,
O'Reilly, Sigafoos, & Didden, 2012; Matson, Neal, & Kozlowski, 2012; Mueller, Kosi, &
Hine, 2011). Treatments based on the function of behavior, as analyzed from FA data, are
more effective than non-function-based approaches to decrease individual's challenging
behavior (Carr & Durand, 1985). Incorrect selection of a treatment or design of a program
based on an uninformed or faulty function of behavior may not help the individual learn
new desired behaviors and/or may even make the problem worse, in some cases (Iwata,
Pace, Cowdery, & Miltenberger, 1994). Thus, an ethical responsibility exists for the profes-
sional to make an informed decision based on all available assessment and background
information, and a review of empirically-based intervention strategies.
Instruction in Functional Assessment      Chapter 3

    Based on over a half century of research conducted since ABA was initiated, many
empirically-based interventions have been developed and evaluated. Major treatment
components for a well-designed Behavior Intervention Plan (BIP), or a written treatment
document to address the individual's challenging behavior include:

         A. Preventative efforts or antecedent-based treatment

         B. Actively increasing or teaching functionally equivalent replacement and other
             desirable behaviors

         C. Reactive procedures or, what to do when the challenging behavior occurs

    These treatment components should be tailored to the specific function of the individ-
ual's challenging behavior (e.g., tangible positive reinforcement, automatic reinforcement,
negative reinforcement, attention positive reinforcement), consider contextual factors (e.g.,
available assistance, history factors, etc.), and ethical considerations. Specific procedures
related to these treatment components will be briefly reviewed below and then more spe-
cific functionally-related treatments will be noted. This review only highlights the main
treatment possibilities that have received a fairly extensive empirical support and is not
exhaustive of the various treatment possibilities available. Also note that to be competent
in delivering treatment, additional knowledge and experience is needed (see the Behavior
Analyst Certification Board® for more at http://www.bacb.com/)

A. Prevention Efforts or Antecedent-
based Treatment

    The individual's situation can be altered in ways that will eventually reduce the chal-
lenging behavior, potentially avoiding the need for reactive strategies. Prevention efforts
can entail reducing the individual's motivation for engaging in the challenging behavior
and changing antecedent stimuli in the individual's natural environment.

    noncontingent reinforcement (NCR) is a procedure to reduce the individual's mo-
tivation for engaging in the challenging behaviors whereby the reinforcers for that behavior
are provided freely according to a set time (e.g., every 5 min) before the individual engages
in that behavior (Marcus & Vollmer, 1996; Vollmer, Marcus, & Ringdahl, 1995). NCR is
an empirically validated approach for decreasing challenging behavior (Carr, Severtson, &
Lepper, 2009) and may be one of the most frequently used reinforcement-based procedures
(Matson et al., 2011). For example, if a student is acting out in the classroom to gain the
attention of his classmates then, at the beginning of class before he acts out, give him a
classroom job that garners a lot of attention to foster his desirable behavior (e.g., passing out
handouts). This approach may reduce the individual's motivation to engage in the undesired
behavior and thereby make it less likely to occur. When using NCR, initially the reinforcer
that is controlling the challenging behavior is delivered continuously or more frequently
than the average baseline occurrence of the challenging behavior. Once the challenging
behavior is reduced, then the frequency of presentation of the reinforcer can be gradually
decreased to typically occurring levels (Tucker, Sigafoos, & Bushell, 1998).

                                        Summary of NCR Procedure

 1. Identify the reinforcers currently maintaining the individual's challenging behavior
      (e.g., positive reinforcement, negative reinforcement) by conducting a functional
      assessment

 2. Schedule a frequent delivery of reinforcer according to time alone or independent of
      behavior

 3. Include an extinction component for when the problem behavior occurs

 4. Initially use a rich schedule of reinforcement and adjust it to lean as the challenging
      behavior decreases

Changing Antecedent Stimuli in the Natural
Environment

    A quick method of preventing the individual's challenging behavior is to manipulate
antecedent stimuli that control behavior (i.e., prompts). Antecedent stimuli include events,
objects, or people that are present before the individual's challenging behavior occurs.
Stimuli in the environment that consistently precede the behavior can either be eliminated
or changed to affect the likelihood of the behavior (Martin & Pear, 2011). For example, if
the individual typically resists doing chores or is noncompliant then providing a choice of a
variety of different chores for that person to choose from may be an effective solution (Call,
Wacker, Ringdahl, Cooper-Brown, & Boelter, 2004). If the individual is escaping from
difficult work or material because the reading level is too difficult (i.e., negative reinforce-
ment), then provide more assistance or better instruction, or make the work easier (Sanford
& Horner, 2013). Also for escape-maintained behavior, the demands or requests could be
delivered less frequently (e.g., presenting demands once an hour instead of 20 times) and
then, as the levels of the challenging behaviors remain low, gradually returned to typical
levels (Lalli, Casey, & Kates, 1995). There is research to support the effectiveness of this
procedure for decreasing the number of requests, known as demand fading, for escape-
maintained challenging behaviors (see Pace, Iwata, Cowdery, Adree, & McIntyre, 1993;
Penrod, Gardella, & Fernand, 2012).

    Another strategy is to add stimuli into the situation in which the challenging behavior
occurs to prompt or cue the individual's desirable behaviors. For example, the likelihood of
the desired behavior occurring may be increased by presenting preferred curricular activi-
ties (Foster-Johnson, Ferro, & Dunlap, 1994), background music (Desrochers, Oshlag, &
Kennelly, 2014), activity choices (Rispoli et al., 2013), or models demonstrating desired
behavior (Stokes & Kennedy, 1980).

    Another method to change the antecedent stimuli involves an overall improvement
of the quality of the individual's environment, known as environmental enrichment
(EE). EE entails increasing individuals' access to preferred activities, people, or objects and
providing a variety of choices available in their everyday environment. One of the ear-
liest demonstrations of how EE can decrease problem behavior was conducted by Horner
(1980). More recently, in a controlled randomized experiment, it has been shown that
increasing sensorimotor experiences can have a beneficial effect on children with autism

                                      36
Instruction in Functional Assessment               Chapter 3

(Woo & Leon, 2013). Moreover, Ringdahl, Vollmer, Marcus, and Roane (1997) showed
how three children with developmental disabilities chose an enriched environment over the
opportunity to engage in self-injurious behavior when able to do either. Table 11 below il-
lustrates how antecedent-based treatments can be geared to the function of the individual's
challenging behavior.

B. Actively increasing or teaching
functionally equivalent replacement and
other desirable behaviors

    A main component of any treatment plan involves reinforcing a desirable behavior that
serves the same purpose as the challenging behavior, called functionally equivalent re-
placement behavior. For instance, an individual's vocal stereotypy that is maintained by
sound may be decreased by encouraging play with auditory toys, a functionally equivalent
replacement behavior (Rapp, 2007). An important consideration when selecting the func-
tionally equivalent behavior is to ensure that the individual's social community will support
it or the individual is able to recruit reinforcement from others in his or her natural environ-
ment. Functional Communication Training (FCT) is an empirically validated treatment
approach (Kurtz, Boelter, Jarmolowicz, Chin, & Hagopian, 2011) that involves teaching
the individual to ask for stimuli, events, or people that serve the same function as the
problem behavior (Carr & Durand, 1985; Falcomata, Wacker, Ringdahl, Vinquist, & Dutt,
2013). Teaching the individual to request the item that typically was delivered followed his
or her challenging behavior in the past can be an effective strategy to decrease that behavior
(Kurtz et al.; O'Reilly et al., 2012). The form of the verbal behavior should be tailored to
the individual and easy to perform, with possibilities including vocal, sign, picture-card,

                                      37

gesture, or use of assistive technology devices (Mancil & Boman, 2010). For example, the
individual may be taught to say "Stop" instead of engaging in self-injury during nonpre-
ferred grooming activities (Steege et al., 1990). More examples of how a communication
replacement behavior can be taught can be seen in the Table 12 below.

    Consequence-based interventions work to decrease problem behavior by manipulating events
and/or stimuli that occur immediately after particular behaviors. Since every treatment program
should include positive reinforcement, the procedures used to identify positive reinforcers
will be described. Then, commonly used practices schedules to administer reinforcement
and extinction procedures to decrease challenging behavior will be reviewed.

Identification of Effective Reinforcers

    The main ingredient for an effective behavior change program is positive reinforce-
ment. A positive reinforcer is an object or event that increases the behavior it follows. As
reviewed in Chapter 1, the principle of positive reinforcement states that when a positive
reinforcer is delivered immediately after a behavior, that behavior is more likely to occur
in future similar situations (Martin & Pear, 2011). Without consideration of positive
reinforcement, the factors responsible for the individual's challenging behavior may still
maintain it, despite efforts to curtail that behavior. Additionally, programming reinforcers
to increase the individual's desirable behavior may result in the challenging behaviors being
`supplanted' or over-ridden since increasing one behavior will naturally eliminate the likeli-
hood of engaging in other behaviors that are reinforced less or cannot occur at the same
time. Application of a positive reinforcement procedure is not only an effective practice
but also an ethically sound step to include in any intervention program. There are several
considerations when using a reinforcement procedure, including: (a) incorporating knowl-
edge of the function for the individual's challenging behavior into treatment design; (b)
validating that the consequence is indeed a reinforcer (be-it positive reinforcer or negative
reinforcer); and (c) maximizing the individual's motivation for that reinforcer.

    It is important to demonstrate that the consequence you believe acts as a reinforcer
does indeed do so. The most accurate way to ensure that you have identified an effective

                                      38

positive reinforcer is to conduct a reinforcer test. A reinforcer test involves experimen-
tally comparing levels of the behavior in phases where the item being evaluated is delivered
immediately after the behavior to that in another phase where the consequence is provided
just according to a set time such as every 5 s or noncontingently (Cooper et al., 2007).
This test may entail using an ABAB research design (Martin & Pear, 2011) where the A
phase consists of a series of sessions where noncontingent delivery of the item being tested
occurs and in B phase consists of a series of sessions where the consequence is provided
following each occurrence of that behavior. These phases are alternated in an ABAB fashion
to rule out confounding variables or alternative explanations for the findings. If levels of
the behavior are higher when the item is delivered contingently (phase B) compared to
when it is not (phase A), then that item has been demonstrated to function as a positive
reinforcer. See the Table 13 below for an example of how the effectiveness of treatment can
be evaluated using an ABAB research design.

                                                    Table 13

     Example of graphed data with an ABAB research design demonstrating that the reinforcer
delivered immediately after the behavior during the treatment or B phase increases that behavior

               as compared to the noncontingent delivery condition or baseline phase.

     A preference assessment is an efficient method to identify a potential reinforcer
by evaluating the individual's choice for a variety of objects, events, or stimuli (Cooper et
al., 2007). One type of preference assessment is a paired-stimulus assessment (Fisher et
al., 1992). A paired-stimulus assessment involves identifying the stimulus the individual
chooses most when pairs of stimuli are presented across trials (See the Table below for the
preference assessment procedure).

                               Example of a preference assessment procedure

 1. Identify 5-8 items that you think the individual might prefer based on interviews
      with that person or people in that person's life or from observations of activities that
      the individual engages in most frequently.

 2. Design a data sheet that lists all possible pairs of the items and alternate the sides that
      each item is presented on to counterbalance side preferences the individual might
      display e.g., A B and B A

 3. Sitting at a desk or table, present each pair of items approximately 2 ft apart from
      each other and 1 ft in front of the person, making sure the person's hands are not near
      either item so that a clear test of what the person selects can be made.

 4. Wait 5 s for the person to pick one. Do not provide any praise because this may affect
      the person's choice on subsequent trials. Allow 5 s to manipulate the item.

 5. Once all pairs have been presented, calculate the percent each item was selected by
      counting the number of times each item was selected by the person and dividing by
      the total number of times it was presented and multiplying by 100.

 6. Rank order the items from most to least preferred and use the most preferred items
      for training purposes.

 Note: If the person has never had the item before, allow the person to `sample' the item before
 the preference assessment is conducted.

 Note: Preferences will vary from time to time and so conducting a brief preference assessment
 before every training session will ensure that your preference-based procedures are maximally
 effective.

    Reinforcers may vary in their effectiveness in increasing desired behavior depending on
whether the individual has had recent access to them (North & Iwata, 2005; McGinnis,
Houchins-Juárez, McDaniel, & Kennedy, 2010). Motivating conditions, such as satiation
(having too much of something) or deprivation (having too little of something), can alter
the probability of behavior that leads to that reinforcer (Michael, 2000). For example, you
really liked a particular song when it first came out and used to change the station to locate
it, but now that it has been playing on the radio for several weeks, you no longer enjoy
listening to it. Instead, you turn to another station to avoid having to listen to it one more
time. Likewise, if a child, who typically is disruptive in a certain class to garner the attention
of his peers is provided with ample social interaction with peers prior to that class, he may
not engage in the disruptive behavior to achieve the same ends.

    Through use of an FA approach, the reinforcer maintaining the challenging behavior
can be identified. Once it is known what that reinforcer is, it can be incorporated into a be-
havior intervention program to increase desired behavior. However, as Carter (2010) found
with an adult male being treated for escape maintained noncompliance, a highly preferred
positive reinforcer may also reduce that behavior even without the use of extinction (no
longer providing the negative reinforcer).

    differential reinforcement procedures can be used to eliminate or decrease the indi-
vidual's challenging behavior. This type of reinforcement schedule, or rule when to provide
reinforcement, consists of the application of both positive reinforcement and extinction

                                                40
Instruction in Functional Assessment      Chapter 3

procedures. Extinction refers to the removal of the usual reinforcer following the behavior,
which decreases future occurrences of that behavior (Martin & Pear, 2011). differential
reinforcement of zero rates (DRO) involves providing a reinforcer when no instances
of the challenging behavior occur during a period of time. For instance, to decrease thumb
sucking, every 10 min when the child does not engage in thumb sucking, he gets his favorite
toy. differential reinforcement of incompatible behavior (DRI) involves reinforcing
a desired behavior that cannot occur at the same time as the challenging behavior (Martin
& Pear, 2011). For instance, the therapist can provide a reinforcer when the person speaks
in normal conversation level and does not scream. If a specific incompatible behavior that
the individual performs cannot be readily identified, differential reinforcement of
alternative behavior (DRA) may be used where a desirable behavior displayed by the
individual is reinforced. For example, turning pages of a magazine could be reinforced to
decrease the likelihood of an individual engaging in self-injury by hitting her head with
her hand. Both turning pages and self-injury could be done at the same time, but that is
unlikely to occur.

    There are also differential reinforcement schedules to reduce, but not necessarily com-
pletely eliminate a behavior altogether, that can be used when some amount of behavior is
alright. differential reinforcement of low rates--spaced responding (DRL-spaced
responding) entails providing the reinforcer after a period of time when no instances of
the challenging behavior have occurred and then the behavior occurs. For instance, to slow
down someone's rate of eating, she could be allowed to take a bite after 3 s of the previous
bite of food. differential reinforcement of low rates--limited (DRL-limited) is when
the challenging behavior is less than a specified amount following a set time period (Martin
& Pear, 2011). A child in the classroom may excessively raise her hand to ask to use the
restroom every half hour where instead, once after two hours of not asking is reinforced.

                Reinforcer is delivered provided that the # of behaviors that
                occurred was < some maximum #. e.g., delivering a reinforcer
                when five or less instances of throat clearing occur in an hour.

    Differential reinforcement has been shown to be a highly useful treatment choice. Dif-
ferential reinforcement may be just as effective as NCR in decreasing challenging behavior
(Allison et al., 2012) and can be applied in the classroom (LeGray, Dufrene, Mercer, Olmi,
& Sterling, 2013). Differential reinforcement, in conjunction with other treatments, has
been effectively used to decrease a variety of behaviors, such as sensory reinforced eye brow
plucking (Nuernberger, Vargo, & Ringdahl, 2013) and pica, or the ingestion of nonedible
substances (Hagopian, González, Rivet, Triggs, & Clark, 2011). Differential reinforcement
has been shown to be as effective as a punishment procedure (response cost) in reducing tics
of children with Tourette syndrome and, as such, would ethically be the preferred treatment
(Capriotti, Brandt, Rickftts, Espii, &Woods, 2012). See the Table 16 below for the steps
involved in conducting a differential reinforcement procedure.

C. Reactive procedures or what to do
when the challenging behavior occurs

    An extinction procedure involves no longer providing the reinforcer maintaining the
challenging behavior such that the behavior is less likely in future similar situations (Martin
& Pear, 2011). The reinforcer maintaining the individual's challenging behavior must be
identified and no longer provided. Thus, when the individual's challenging behavior is being
maintained by attention then attention extinction should be used. For escape-maintained
behavior, escape extinction, or not removing the task or demand (and, possibly, using guided
assistance for the individual to engage in the task) is employed. An FA to determine what
is maintaining the individual's challenging behavior is essential to be able to accurately
remove the reinforcer maintaining the challenging behavior and thereby effectively use an
extinction procedure. Iwata, Pace, Cowdery, and Miltenberger (1994) describe how not
correctly removing the reinforcer maintaining the individual's challenging behavior can
actually worsen it.

    A known phenomenon that occurs when implementing an extinction procedure is
extinction burst whereby the behavior being extinguished gets "worse before it gets
better." That is, emotional behaviors and aggression, in addition to an increase in severity
of the challenging behavior may occur (Martin & Pear, 2011). It is important to inform
others about this phenomenon to ensure that they continue implementing the program and
do not inadvertently reinforce the individual's problem behavior and make it worse (i.e.,
treatment integrity is maintained).

    An effective and ethical approach is to combine extinction with positive intervention
strategies (e.g., differential reinforcement). Out of a sample of 42 cases of treatment for
individuals with challenging behavior, Lerman, Iwata, and Wallace (1999) counted the
number in which an extinction burst was identified and examined whether positive proce-
dures included in the treatment package lessened the likelihood of extinction bursts. The
researchers found substantially fewer cases of extinction burst (i.e., 15%) when positive
procedures were incorporated as compared to when only an extinction procedure was used
(i.e., 62%).

    Although there are ethical concerns with using any decelerative procedure, sometimes
extinction must be used to effectively decrease the individual's problem behavior. In a study
by Patal et al. (2002) two types of differential reinforcement procedures were not effec-
tive until escape extinction was added with three children receiving treatment for feeding
disorders. See Table 17 below for methods to increase the effectiveness of an extinction
procedure.

                       Steps to increase the effectiveness of an extinction procedure

           1. Assess the function of the problem behavior and do not provide that reinforcer
                following the problem behavior.

           2. Combine extinction with a differential reinforcement procedure and use the
                reinforcer that was maintaining the problem behavior to increase a desirable
                behavior.

           3. Inform others involved in the program about the possibility of extinction burst
                and how not to provide a reinforcer following the behavior.

each main environmental reason for challenging behavior.

Generalization & Maintenance of Treatment Effects

    generalization and maintenance of treatment effects is an essential component to
address once: (a) the individual's desired behavior is occurring at desired levels; (b) the
problem has been reduced; and (c) treatment has been removed. There are three impor-
tant types of generalization or spill-over effects that occur once treatment or training has
ended (Martin & Pear, 2011). stimulus generalization is the extent to which the desired
behaviors occur across stimuli, setting, and people. For example, after successfully learning
how to ask for help when faced with a difficult task at work, the individual is now able to
do likewise when at home. Response generalization is the extent to which behaviors other
than the taught behavior occur. For example, after the resident of a group home has been
taught to greet visitors with a "Hello" and a handshake (instead of a hug), she also has
begun appropriately asking visitors to enter the house and to sit in the living room. Lastly,
response maintenance is when the desired behaviors taught occur long after the training
has been completed (e.g., weeks, months, or years).

    Stokes and Baer (1977) wrote their pivotal review of the published research examining
generalization and concluded that generalization needs to be planned for during interven-
tion to ensure that it occurs. Although much research on ways to promote generalization
of treatment gains has occurred over the years, more remains to be done (Falcomata &
Wacker, 2013). A review of methods to promote generalization is beyond the scope of this
book. The reader is encouraged to consult other sources such Baer (1981) or Goldstein and
Martens (2000) for more information.

Evaluation of Treatment Effectiveness

    A comprehensive evaluation of the effectiveness of treatment for a particular client/
student case should include the following:

         · Client/student's behavior change in the desired direction compared to baseline

         · An increase in reinforcers or enriched experiences for the individual, such
              as more community experiences and a less restrictive environment for the
              individual

         · Generalization of desired behaviors and continued reduction of challenging
              behaviors across time (response maintenance)

         · social validity or the treatment is acceptable to the individual and significant
              others in terms of goals, procedures, and outcome (Wolf, 1978)

         · Cost-effectiveness or whether the benefits associated with treatment imple-
              ment outweigh the costs

Designing a Behavior Intervention Plan
(BIP)

    To "put it all together," it is useful to carefully consider the components of a com-
plete behavior intervention plan. Cautilli, Riley-Tillman, and Thomas (2001) detail the
characteristics and content for a well-written, high-quality behavior intervention plan and
describe many of the following as essential components:

1. A statement of the objectives and goals of the program

2. Behavior definition of the challenging behavior and any desired behavior that will be
    specifically reinforced

3. Assessment procedures used (e.g., functional assessment, assessment of adaptive be-
    haviors, reinforcer or preference assessments) with a brief description of the findings

4. Data collection and analysis procedures (e.g., the behavior recording and sampling
    procedures used and graphical analyses included)

5. Functional hypothesis or maintaining variable(s) for the challenging behavior should
    be described with the following noted:

6. Antecedent & setting events for the problem behavior

7. Maintaining variables for the challenging behavior (e.g., attention positive reinforce-
    ment, escape from demands)

8. Functional replacement behavior defined and procedures used to increase or teach it

9. A step-by-step plan of how and when the following procedures will be performed and
    by whom:

10. Antecedent-based interventions

11. Consequence-based interventions (e.g., differential reinforcement of incompatible
    behavior/alternative behavior/other behavior)

                Example of a Behavior Intervention Plan (BIP)

Student: Tobin                            Date: January, 2014

    Background: The problem concerns the high rate of off-task behavior of a 12-year-old
male with autism spectrum disorder. No previous BIP. Teacher made the referral. Chal-
lenging behavior has been occurring for past 6 months. This challenging behavior interferes
with Tobin's learning and that of other children in the classroom.

    Past strategies: Teacher talked to him about his behavior, sending him to the principal,
separating him from other students--all of these were ineffective at decreasing Tobin's
problem behavior.

    Behavioral Definition: Off-task behavior defined as talking with peers, walking around
room, or engaging in activities other than those that have been assigned (e.g., singing in-
stead of reading, playing with objects in his desk when he should be completing a written
assignment).

    Behavioral Objective: To increase on-task behavior to 90% of intervals during aca-
demic periods (e.g., reading, math, social studies) for 7 consecutive days.

Assessments

    Baseline Data: Observations occurred during two 30-min observations in the class-
room where during every 30 s, the presence or absence of the challenging behavior is noted
(known as an interval recording procedure).Tobin engaged in on-task behavior during 20%
and 27% of observed intervals, respectively.

    Function of the Behavior: During classroom instruction and individual assignments,
Tobin engages in off-task behavior to gain peer attention (attention positive reinforcement)
and escape task demands (negative reinforcement--activity).

    Past Research: Differential reinforcement procedures has been successfully used to in-
crease desirable behavior for children in the classroom (Kodak, Miltenberger, & Romaniuk,
2003; Neidert, Iwata, & Dozier, 2005; Vance, Gresham, & Dart, 2012).

    Intervention Procedure: The intervention procedures for Tobin will consist of changing
the antecedent conditions by providing Tobin with positive reinforcement for on-task be-
havior and attention extinction for off-task behavior.

    Preventative:

1. Tobin will be moved further from the group of students with whom he usually social-
    izes during class.

2. When he enters the classroom, Tobin's teacher will remind him of the consequences of
    staying on-task.

3. Tobin's teacher and teacher's aide will provide attention (e.g., "Wow, you are sitting
    nice") every 2 min (noncontingent reinforcement).

                                      47
Instruction in Functional Assessment      Chapter 3

    Positive reinforcement for on-task behavior (replacement behavior):

1. Tobin and his teacher will prepare a written plan (known as a behavior contract) speci-
    fying that Toby will earn 5 extra min to interact with peers when his on-task behavior
    during a class period is at or above 80% of observed intervals.

2. When Tobin is on-task,Tobin's teacher will provide verbal praise (quietly and unobtru-
    sively) at least four times during each class session (DRI)

    Reactive: When Tobin is off-task, he will have no access to socializing with peers during
individual assignments, and he will be redirected to complete his assignments (attention
extinction and escape extinction).

    Planning for Generalization: Once Tobin meets the behavioral objective, the rein-
forcement schedule will be weaned by successively increasing the requirement to 85% and
then 90%, of intervals of on-task behavior. Reminders will also be delivered less and less.

    Evaluation of Effectiveness: Tobin's percent on-task behavior during intervention was
85% of the intervals compared to 27% during baseline.

    A best practice when designing a behavior intervention plan to address an individual's
challenging behavior is to use current research-based assessment practices and inter-
ventions to guide the approach selected. The Individuals with Disabilities Education
Improvement Act (IDEIA, 2004) and ethical practices require that professionals who
work with students with disabilities maintain currency with empirically-based assessments
and interventions. As the field progresses new and more effective procedures are discovered
and revealed to better care for the needs of individuals with developmental disabilities.
As one resource to consult, the "What Works Clearinghouse" serves as an online review
of evidence-based interventions in education as evaluated by the Institute of Education
Science (http://ies.ed.gov/ncee/wwc/news.aspx?sid=8). In this resource, published research
concerning common intervention approaches are reviewed according to a standard and
report outcomes (e.g., effect size) in relation to the scientific strength of the evidence so
that informed selections about treatment practices can be made.

Special Education Perspective: Positive
Behavioral Support and Response to
Intervention

    Positive Behavior Support (PBS) is generally the first and most appropriate choice
at a school-wide level for intervention in schools for children with challenging behaviors.
PBS has long been recognized as a prevention approach to undesirable behaviors (Vaughn
& Bos, 2009). PBS is often taught in teacher education training programs as the preferred
treatment approach in public school classrooms, rather than the use of punishment. Quite
simply, PBS is a focus on the desired behavior, rather than focusing on the undesirable or
challenging behavior. PBS requires the teacher and other related professionals to system-
atically look for positive behavior. This is generally accomplished with the use of social,
tangible, or verbal reinforcers specific to the desired behavior, such as saying when Mary has
her head down and is quietly reading the passage, "Thank you for your attention to the task,
Mary." Teachers in the classroom can use such positive reinforcers to encourage positive
behavior and to focus attention on a model of appropriate behavior. As another example, a
token economy in the classroom can be employed where children can accumulate points
or tickets for desirable behavior that can be turned in for free time, a special lunch with a
friend, a free pass on one homework assignment, or other positive reinforcers. Other pre-
vention approaches include teaching children conflict resolution and interpersonal problem
solving. Some curricula include aspects of character education and principles for teaching
social skills (Vaughn & Bos, 2009).

    Within recent years, professionals in public school settings have also used an approach
called Response to Intervention (RTI). RTI was mandated by federal law (IDEIA, 2004)
as a means of not allowing children to fail either behaviorally or academically without
access to a variety of research-based interventions individualized for that particular child.
RTI requires all professionals to monitor academic and social skills on an ongoing basis,
collecting data on performance of every child, and reviewing that data with a team of re-
lated professionals. The intent of RTI is to prevent problems or to quickly intervene before
a child loses skills. Monitoring occurs at three levels or tiers. Those tiers are:

    Tier 1: screen for behavior problems, introduce interventions, convey expectations

    Tier 2: provide supports and feedback for students with similar behavior problems

    Tier 3: provide more specific and intense interventions for students whose behavior has
not improved (Vaughn & Bos, 2009)

    PBS and RTI work in conjunction with one another and the focus of both approaches
is on prevention of problems or preventing the severity of a problem existing without re-
search based responses individualized to the child.

    Completing an FA will assist in identifying the function of the student's challenging
behavior resulting in the design of the best treatment for that situation. The knowledge
gained by implementing an FA will provide the basis for an effective behavior intervention
plan which is an essential component of the student's Individualized Education Program

                                                49

(IEP). The Individualized Education Program (IEP) serves as the foundation of the edu-
cational plan for each student with disabilities. The IEP is a strategic planning document
that should be far reaching in its educational impact. An IEP identifies a student's unique
strengths and needs and how the school will strategically address those needs (New York
State Department of Education, 2010, p.3). It is a legal document, designed and agreed
upon by all members of the educational team, including the family of the student with
disabilities. The key components of the IEP rest upon the concept of individualization. As
stated in the Council for Exceptional Children (CEC) professional standards:

         ...special educators are active and resourceful in seeking to understand how primary
    language, culture, and familial backgrounds interact with the individual's exceptional
    condition to impact the individual's academic and social abilities, attitudes, values, in-
    terests, and career options. The understanding of these learning differences and their
    possible interactions provide the foundation upon which special educators individu-
    alize instruction to provide meaningful and challenging learning for individuals with
    exceptional learning needs. CEC, 2011, Content Standards, Standard 3

    One essential component of the IEP is listing the positive behavioral supports needed
by the child. A careful FA analysis is critical to identifying those positive behavioral sup-
ports that will help guide the professional to developing the child's desirable behaviors in
the classroom, clinics, in social environments, and at home.

Summary

    The design of effective intervention is based on identification of the maintaining vari-
ables for the individual's problem behavior as gathered from a FA. The core of a treatment
package should include preventative measures, teaching a replacement behavior that serves
the same function as the challenging behavior, reinforcing desirable behavior, and a proce-
dure in place for when that behavior does occur. A behavior intervention plan provides a
written form of the treatment for others in the individual's natural environment to follow
to assist the individual with learning desirable behaviors.

Exercise: Complete the Behavior Intervention Plan
(BIP)

    Instructions: Read the teacher's referral below and complete a BIP based on the infor-
mation. You can add details as needed to fully address the components of the BIP. Speculate
on the function of Juan's challenging behavior and design a plausible treatment based on
that function.

    Teacher Referral Report: Juan is a 13-year-old boy with cerebral palsy and intellectual
disability. He is in an 8 to 1 classroom. His communication skills are very basic. When he
does talk, he whispers. Almost all of his speech repeats what was just said to him (echo-
lalia). Even when he engages in echolalia his intelligibility is poor because he whispers.
Occasionally he will kick me or other adults at a table (during groups), but it is lightly and
infrequent. He will sometimes also throw things but this has only happened about three
times this year. I am most concerned about his lack of any participation in any class activi-
ties or conversations. When he is asked to do something he will often just sit there and, less
often, he will sometimes rock and hum during the morning meeting when it is his turn to
come to the front of the class to review the day, he will come to the front of the classroom,
but will then just stand there.

       Teaching Functional
    Assessment Content and

               Process

Focus Questions:

         · How can knowledge of functional assessment (FA) best be taught?
         · How can the decision-making involved in completing a FA process best be taught?

    The complex repertoire involved in using FA when designing interventions to decrease
challenging behaviors of individuals with developmental disabilities requires knowledge
and skills across diverse topic areas. Learning goals, objectives, desired behaviors, and
criteria must be specified to pave the way for identification of appropriate instructional
methodology and assessment approaches (Hendrix & Tieman, 1971; Vargas, 2009). An
instructional analysis should clearly identify the requisite subareas and the prerequisite
knowledge and skills to attain those learning goals and objectives (Dick, Carey, & Carey,
2009).

Sources for the Content Domains for
Assessing and Treating Challenging
Behaviors

    A solid grasp of basic behavioral principles and procedures is essential to understanding
the underpinning of challenging behaviors and the ways in which they can be modified.
Since the individual's behavior and environment are being manipulated, ethically, the col-
lege student must have a well-established knowledge-base of both the theoretical basis for
behavioral approaches and how to correctly implement effective practices. Important topics
for college students to know include behavioral principles and procedures, behavioral defi-
nitions, ethics, methods of recording behavior, analyzing graphs, single participant research
designs, functional assessment, intervention strategies, and evaluating treatment effective-
Instruction in Functional Assessment      Chapter 4

ness, to name a few. Additionally, selection of effective interventions by professionals must
occur in response to varying client characteristics and situations and so programming for
generalization must be included in the curriculum. These topics were briefly reviewed in
Chapters 2 and 3.

    Well-established, defined content in the area of FA that reflect applied behavior anal-
ysis (ABA) and how to use it to teach others socially significant behaviors can be found
in multiple sources including textbooks, research articles, and professional body's resources.
Essential topics can be gleaned from a review of the table of contents of the many textbooks
available in the area (e.g., Cooper et al., 2007; Fisher, Piazza, & Roane, 2011; Martin &
Pear, 2011; Miltenberger, 2012; see Chapter 7 for more). Likewise, training programs have
carved out relevant topics to teach direct-care staff members that cover the gamut of ABA
and how to apply it in various contexts to teach individuals desirable skills and decrease
challenging behaviors (Luiselli, Bass, & Whitcomb, 2010). Common topics include char-
acteristics of ABA, a history of its development and philosophical roots, defining behavior
and measuring it, positive reinforcement, negative reinforcement, prompting and fading,
shaping, chaining, stimulus control, single participant research designs, ethics, schedules of
reinforcement to increase and decrease behavior, designing programs, self-control strate-
gies, and more.

Assessment of Professionals'
Competency in Assessing and Treating
Challenging Behaviors

    The Behavior Analyst Certification Board®, Inc. (BACB®) provides standardized as-
sessment of applicants' knowledge of the requisite topics to determine if a professional is
competent to deliver ABA assessment and treatment procedures to those who need it. The
BACB® is a nonprofit organization founded in 1998 to evaluate whether professionals have
the appropriate coursework, knowledge, and experience to meet the high standards needed
to provide quality care to the students/clients whom they serve (see www.bacb.com for
more). For example, to obtain certification at the Master's level, or become a board certified
behavior analyst (BCBA), current requirements include a Master's degree in a relevant dis-
cipline (e.g., psychology, special education), 225 hours of approved coursework, 1500 hours
of supervised experience, and successfully passing a standardized exam. The BACB® Task
List, now in its 4th edition, was created by content area experts and Job Task List surveys
of representative certificants to guide BACB® course development, exam content, and ap-
plication preparation (see http://www.bacb.com/newsletter/BACB_Newsletter_05_2011.
pdf for more). Thus, a clearly specified content task list and assessment procedure exists to
evaluate whether an applicant demonstrates knowledge of the relevant information.

Instruction in Assessing and Treating
Challenging Behavior

    To teach someone the complex repertoire involved with addressing an individuals' chal-
lenging behaviors involves a variety of instructional methods (e.g., readings, cooperative
group activities, case presentation) to achieve the desired learning outcomes (e.g., factual
knowledge, synthesis, application, problem-solving in verbal or written forms). There are
a variety of instructional approaches available including traditional instructional methods,
course systems, and simulations.

Traditional Instructional Approaches

    Instruction in ABA content, including FA, to provide the basic background knowledge
can be delivered by textbooks, courses, and programs (see Chapter 7 for a resource list).
There are also many undergraduate and graduate programs offered by universities with
curriculum that meet approval from the BACB® based on a review of their content and
experience requirements (http://www.bacb.com/index.php?page=100358). Institutions
of higher education around the world are increasingly offering this certificate program
(Shook, 2005; Shook & Neisworth, 2005). The current list of BACB® approved programs
can be found at http://www.bacb.com/index.php?page=100358.

Course Instructional Systems

    To ensure that college students become proficient in behavioral principles and proce-
dures, effective instruction may involve clearly stated objectives, competent models, frequent
responding opportunities, immediate feedback, self-pacing, and mastery-based learning
(Fredrick & Hummel, 2004). Two course systems that incorporate these components and
are empirically-supported are WebCAPSI and Interteaching.

    Computer-Aided Personalized System of Instruction (CAPSI) uses a Keller's Personal-
ized System of Instruction to interactively generate a high rate of student responding and
review of course material (Pear & Crone-Todd, 1999; Pear & Kinsner, 1988). The instructor
divides course material into small, manageable units (e.g., approximately 10-15 units for a
typical college course) and creates short answer study questions that tap into a full range of
difficulty level (factual, synthesis, analysis, application). After the student studies a unit of
material and answers the study questions regarding it, he or she is able to take the quiz. Sit-
ting in front of a computer, the CAPSI software presents the student with three randomly
assigned questions and the student types answers to each into designated boxes on the
computer screen (Pear & Crone-Todd, 1999). After submission of the completed quiz, the
instructor and/or two students randomly assigned by CAPSI to be peer proctors provide
typed feedback concerning the quality of the test-taker's answers, typically within 24 hours.
Each short answer question is provided with feedback on accuracy and completeness, and
the quiz is assigned a pass or restudy by the proctor. If the student's quiz is designated

                                                56
Instruction in Functional Assessment  Chapter 4

a restudy then the student receives another set of randomly assigned questions for that
unit when the student retakes that unit quiz after a 24 hour period to allow for additional
studying. A pass designation on a quiz by a proctor allows the student to take the quiz for
the next unit. In addition to immediate feedback, another important feature of this system
is that the student can progress through the material at his or her own rate, taking quizzes
once prepared to do so. Mastery learning of written answers to questions and repeated
exposure to the material is the heart and soul of this approach. Learning the material
well before the student proceeds to the next unit ensures a solid knowledge-base to draw
from when learning advanced concepts. Teaching critical thinking in a nonpunitive social
environment allows students to acquire pivotal skills that will help them in other situations
(e.g., reading carefully, critical thinking, formulating arguments). Past research supports
the instructional effectiveness of the CAPSI approach for use with college students (Pear,
Schnerch, Silva, Svenningsen, Lambert, 2011; Svenningsen & Pear, 2011) and also may
be useful for teaching how to use applied procedures (Oliveria, Goyos, & Pear, 2012). See
http://home.cc.umanitoba.ca/~capsi/index.html for more.

    Interteaching is another method that involves immediate feedback and frequent testing
to increase college/university students' acquisition of course content (Saville, Lambert,
& Robertson, 2011). Like CAPSI, a study guide with a range of question difficulty and
covering small amounts of material is completed by students. During half of each class,
students come to class prepared to discuss the answers to these unit questions in small
groups and earn quality points for their effort. Students also evaluate the quality of their
own session and note any difficulty with the material which is addressed by the instructor
at the start of the next class. Single participant research evaluating interteaching has found
greater active student responding compared to traditional class instruction with a class
of 24 master's level special education students (Mason, 2012). Moreover, Saville, Pope,
Truelove, and Williams (2012) found higher exam scores when interteaching was used
compared to lectures when the two methods were alternated across classes.

Teaching the Clinical Decision-making
Underlying Functional Assessment

    The FA process requires many decision-making steps such as: What characteristics of
the individual's challenging behavior best define and describe it? Which types of FA should
be used to gather information about the function of the challenging behavior? How can
the FA data be analyzed and interpreted to arrive at a functional hypothesis for the indi-
vidual's challenging behavior? What is the quality of the evidence, based on the advantages
and disadvantages of each assessment method and the degree of corroborating assessment
outcomes? Which treatments are best for the client's circumstances (e.g., characteristics,
situation, significant others) given the results of the FA?

    Simulation is one method of programming educational experiences that may help to
bridge the gap between classroom or online instruction and the application of relevant
clinical knowledge, decision-making, and skills in the target environment (Vyas, Ottic,
& Caligiuri, 2011). Simulations involve the life-like presentation of the relevant variables
found in a complex situation to allow the learner to manipulate, problem solve, actively

                                                57
Instruction in Functional Assessment      Chapter 4

engage in, and experience the consequences typical of those actions in the real-world
(Brown, 1999). Simulations may be an effective approach for teaching the decision-making
skills associated with using the results of functional assessment to select effective treatments.

    Simulations have been used to teach medical procedures (Stather, Mac Eachern,
Chee, Dumoulin, & Tremblay, 2012), pharmaceutical skills (Vyas, Ottis, & Caligiuri,
2011), functional assessment (Desrochers, Clemmons, Grady, & Justice, 2000; Desrochers,
Crone-Todd, & Conheady, 2006; Desrochers, House, & Seth, 2001) and social work skills
(Smokowski & Hartung, 2003), among others. Simulations have been effectively used to
teach staff complex skills such as discrete trial training (DTT), which is a one-on-one
method of teaching new skills to individuals with developmental disabilities (Eldevik et
al., 2013). In Eldevik et al.'s computerized training system an interactive virtual child with
autism provides both assessment and training in declarative and procedural knowledge of
DTT. As another example, Second Life, an online multi-layer game was utilized to provide
education students with practice using the decision-making required to respond to disrup-
tive students in a simulated classroom (Mahon, Bryant, Brown, & Kim, 2010). Preliminary
subjective evaluations by 16 undergraduate teacher education students were generally
favorable regarding the effectiveness of the simulated classroom experience in providing
experience in how to engage in classroom management. No information was collected on
whether these students could implement these skills in actual classroom situations.

    Simulations in Developmental Disabilities: SIDD is an example of a multimedia com-
puter program designed to provide students and staff with the opportunity to acquire
and practice the clinical decision-making skills to decrease clients/students' challenging
behaviors. During the computer simulation, the student assumes the role of a clinician
whose professional duties involve use of functional assessment and treatment of the severe
problem behavior (i.e., aggressive, self- injurious, or disruptive behaviors) displayed by an
individual with developmental disabilities. The college student proceeds through referral,
problem definition, assessment, functional hypothesis, and treatment stages. The results of
experimental studies suggest that SIDD can be an effective method of providing students
with practice in the decision-making involved with FA (Desrochers, Clemmons, Grady, &
Justice, 2000; Desrochers, House, & Seth, 2001).

    Advantages to using simulations include that it can be cost-effective, safe, and ethical
compared to real world field experiences. Simulations can also be structured to expose
the student to the full range of real-life possibilities in a relatively short time to maximize
learning. When using simulations, students are actively involved in completing the training
task and engaged in clinical decision-making. Moreover, some research indicates that high
fidelity human simulation assessment may be related to critical thinking (Fero et al., 2010).

    Direct and specific instruction is necessary to ensure that the teacher/therapist is pro-
ficient in engaging in the skills that lead to the individual's behavior change (Neef, 1995).
How to teach someone to conduct a functional analysis is the focus of Chapter 5.

 Referring Agent: School Nursing staff

 Client: Andrew McGaff

 Age: 12 years

 Diagnosis: Profound intellectual disability, communication skills deficits,
 nonambulatory or wheelchair-bound

 What is the problem? Andrew spits on the floor, causing germs to be spread. A lot of
 the kids crawl around on the floor and then put their hands in their mouth. It is nasty
 stuff.

 How long has the problem been occurring? He has been doing this ever since I can
 remember.
 How severe would you consider the problem behavior? Because of how colds and other
 illnesses spread, I think that this is a real big problem.
 What are your present methods of dealing with it? We constantly tell him not to do
 this and wipe his mouth so that no spit is available but somehow he always gets it out
 and it soon goes onto the floor.
The following FA data were collected. Three conditions, as described below, were tested to
determine the maintaining variable(s) for Andrew McGaff 's challenging behavior.

in front of Andrew and says, "Point to the ball."). If Andrew fails to respond or responds
incorrectly then the therapist removes the task materials, turns away for 6 s, re-presents
the task, and provides successive degrees of assistance until a correct response is made (e.g.,
gestures, modeling, and physical guidance to provide Andrew with the cues to perform the
correct responses). After prompted or unprompted correct responses, the teacher delivers
social praise. After an occurrence of the problem behavior the teacher turns away, removes
the materials, and ignores Andrew for 30 s.

    Social disapproval condition: Andrew and teacher are in the therapy room together.
Andrew is provided with a variety of activities. The teacher sits several feet away from
Andrew and pretends to be busy at work. After each occurrence of Andrew's challenging
behavior, the teacher presents a negative comment (e.g., "You shouldn't spit, good boys
don't do that," "Please don't do that!"). The teacher ignores any other behavior displayed by
Andrew.

    Alone condition: Andrew is placed in the therapy room alone without any reinforcers.

 Referring Agent: Teacher
 Client: Laurie Anne Harish
 Age: 15 years
 Diagnosis: Profound intellectual disability, communication skills deficits, autism
 spectrum disorder
 What is the problem? Laurie Anne is very difficult to work with. Whenever I give her
 a sorting task, which she can do when she wants to, she throws a fit! I cannot get her to
 do a lick of work.
 How long has the problem been occurring? She has been doing this for the past 3
 months and it has been steadily getting worse.
 How severe would you consider the problem behavior? Well, she is not meeting her
 goals for the week and I end up having to work with the other kids since she is not
 getting anywhere.
 What are your present methods of dealing with it? I tell her at the start of the day what
 we will be doing, but then once we get at our work station she immediately builds up
 for her typical fit of hollering and fussing and I can't get anything done with her. I end
 up just letting the session go because her behavior is just too bad to work with and I
 don't want anyone getting hurt.

    The following FA data were collected. Three conditions, as described below, were tested
to determine the maintaining variable(s) for Laurie Anne Harish's problem behavior.

    Demand condition: Laurie and the therapist are seated at a table in the therapy room.
Laurie is presented with educational tasks from her Individualized Education Plan (IEP).
These tasks should be those that Laurie has not learned. The therapist presents the task
materials and an instruction for Laurie to perform the task (e.g., placed a ball and cup

                                                62

in front of Laurie and says, "Point to the ball."). If Laurie fails to respond or responds
incorrectly then the therapist removes the task materials, turns away for 6 s, re-presents
the task, and provides successive degrees of assistance until a correct response is made (e.g.,
gestures, modeling, and physical guidance to provide the client with the cues to perform
the correct responses). After prompted or unprompted correct responses by Laurie, the
therapist delivered social praise. After an occurrence of the problem behavior the therapist
turns away and ignores Laurie for 30 s.

    Social disapproval condition: Laurie and therapist are in the therapy room together.
Laurie is provided with a variety of preferred activities. The therapist sits several feet away
from Laurie and pretends to be busy at work. After each occurrence of the challenging
behavior by Laurie, the therapist presents a negative comment (e.g., "You shouldn't do that"
"Please don't do that!"). The therapist ignores any other behavior displayed by Laurie.

    Alone condition: Laurie is placed in the therapy room alone without activities or other
reinforcers.

 Referring Agent: Evening staff
 Client: Andy Smith
 Age: 18 years
 Diagnosis: Profound intellectual disability, communication skills deficits, visual
 impairment
 What is the problem? In the middle of the night, at about 2:00 a.m., Andy comes out
 of his room and begins hollering. He can't be quieted very easily. Sometimes he flops on
 the floor and bangs his head on the floor in a temper tantrum.
 How long has the problem been occurring? He has been doing this for the past 6
 months and it has been steadily getting worse.
 How severe would you consider the problem behavior? These fits wake up the other
 residents. Andy sometimes breaks open the skin on his head and hurts himself. So I
 believe it is very severe.
 What are your present methods of dealing with it? I generally call the supervisor who
 comes to the residence. He can often stop his fits by giving him pudding. It seems to
 really calm him down.

    The following FA data were collected. Three conditions, as described below, were tested
to determine the maintaining variable(s) for Andrew McGaff 's challenging behavior. The
following FA data were collected by your assistant. Three conditions, as described below,
were tested to determine the maintaining variable(s) for Andy Smith's challenging behavior.

    Demand condition: Andy and the therapist are seated at a table in the therapy room.
Andy is presented with educational tasks from his Individualized Education Plan (IEP).
These tasks should be those that Andy has not learned. The therapist presents the task
materials and an instruction for Andy to perform the task (e.g., placed a ball and cup in
front of Andy and says, "Point to the ball."). If Andy fails to respond or responds incorrectly
then the therapist removes the task materials, turns away for 6 s, re-presents the task, and

provides successive degrees of assistance until a correct response is made (e.g., gestures,
modeling, and physical guidance to provide Andy with the cues to perform the correct re-
sponses). After prompted or unprompted correct responses by Andy, the therapist delivers
social praise. After an occurrence of the challenging behavior the therapist turns away and
ignores Andy for 30 s.

    Social disapproval condition: Andy and therapist are in the therapy room together.
Andy is provided with a variety of preferred leisure items. The therapist sits several feet
away from Andy and pretends to be busy at work. After each occurrence of the challenging
behavior by Andy, the therapist presents a negative comment (e.g., "You shouldn't tantrum,
don't do that," "Please don't do that!"). The therapist ignores any other behavior displayed
by Andy.

    Alone condition: Andy is placed in the therapy room alone without activities or other
reinforcers.

    Tangible condition: A preferred item (in this case pudding) is placed out of reach in
the room where Andy is located. When an instance of the challenging behavior occurs, the
preferred item is delivered to Andy for several seconds and then placed out of reach again.

       Teaching Functional
               Analysis

Focus Questions:

         · What are empirically-based methods to teach college students the skills involved with
              conducting functional analysis?

         · How can generalization of functional assessment skills be promoted?
    To implement functional analysis (FAn) and treatment procedures specific, well-
defined skills are required by the college student to deliver antecedents and consequences
for the client's behavior accurately and reliably. Although college students may be able to
describe a procedure in verbal or written form, that does not mean they can do it (Iwata et
al., 2000; Wallace, Doney, Mintz-Resudek, & Tarbox, 2004). Role play and performance-
based teaching are two strategies to establish the necessary skills.

Role Play

    A role play strategy is a more physically active manner of participation in the learning
situation than computer simulation. Role play teaches procedural behaviors by the individual
reenacting the situation while assuming another person's identity. For instance, Jones and
Eimers (1975) taught two teachers to use a behavior management approach to decrease the
disruptive behavior of children in their classroom. Disruptive behaviors including talking to
neighbors, out-of-seat behaviors, and inappropriate talk were behaviorally defined. A single
participant research design was used to evaluate the effectiveness of the classroom behavior
management procedure on students' disruptive behaviors. In this multi-component training
package, the teacher training procedures entailed a combination of role playing student
and effective teacher behaviors, feedback, self-reflection on what went well or not, group
discussion, until mastery learning. The results of this teacher training approach led to less
student disruptive behavior and higher student academic performance.

    Gardner (1972) compared role play versus lecture instructional methods to teach
paraprofessionals behavioral skills. Using a simple experimental research pre-test, post-test
Instruction in Functional Assessment  Chapter 5

design, 20 staff members were randomly assigned to either role play or lecture instructional
methods. The results suggest that a role-play method improved proficiency scores more
than lectures when teaching positive reinforcement, shaping, and stimulus control proce-
dures. However, proficiency was assessed by a paper-and-pencil, 30-item test rather than
observations of staff implementation of procedures or effects of training procedures on
clients' behaviors.

    Wallace, Doney, Mintz-Resudek, and Tarbox (2004) demonstrated that a high degree
of accuracy in implementing FAn may also be achieved using just role play in a workshop
format. One of the three teachers participating in this study needed additional feedback
on specific steps performed incorrectly. One teacher in this study was able to use FAn in
the classroom with a student 12 weeks after the workshop, demonstrating both stimulus
generalization and maintenance of learning. Although role play is useful for the learner to
engage in the desired behavior, additional instructional elements may be needed to promote
students' correct responding and shape the desired behavior.

Performance-Based Training to Teach
Functional Analysis

    performance-based training is a strategy that systematically teaches the individual
to engage in specific desired behaviors to a mastery criterion by the learner practicing or
rehearsing skills with modeling and feedback provided by the teacher (McGimsey, Greene,
& Lutzker, 1995). Prior to training, the task to be taught is operationally defined, broken
down into smaller, specific steps (called a task analysis), and a learning criteria is set.
A baseline measure of the learner's current level of proficiency is gathered from multiple
assessment sessions. Next, training is designed to focus on the areas that the learner has
not mastered. During performance-based training, the trainer completes the following
phases with the learner: (a) trainer describes the learner's skills in verbal and textual form;
(b) trainer models the behaviors to be performed or a video presentation of the desired skills
is provided; (c) learner role plays or rehearses the skills; and (d) trainer provides immediate
feedback provided to the learner until a mastery criterion is attained (Seiverling, Williams,
Sturmey, & Hart, 2012). Generalization of skills across situations, materials, people, and
time (maintenance) should be assessed and, if not present, additional training is provided
to ensure the occurrence of the behavior in the desired circumstances.

    Some research has demonstrated that receiving didactic instruction (e.g., lecture, reading
material, and/or video/live modeling) and demonstrating mastery on a knowledge test was
insufficient for students to be able to implement the antecedent and consequence procedures
involved in conducting FAn with a high degree of accuracy (Erbas, Tekin-Iftar, & Yucesoy,
2006; Iwata et al., 2000; Moore & Fisher, 2007; Wallace, Doney, Mintz-Resudek, & Tarbox,
2004). Only after immediate feedback was provided for learners carrying out functional
analysis procedures to mastery criterion were students able to perform the traditional FAn
conditions (e.g., demand, attention, play, alone) to a high degree of accuracy, demonstrating
that performance-based training with role play can effectively be used to teach FAn (Iwata
et al., 2000;Wallace et al., 2004). Iwata et al. (2000) demonstrated that FAn procedures
could be taught to a high degree of proficiency to inexperienced undergraduate psychology

                                                70
Instruction in Functional Assessment      Chapter 5

students who had previously completed only one applied behavior analysis course. Fol-
lowing review of written and video-taped model presentations descriptions of the FAn
conditions and passing a knowledge test, students did not correctly perform the FAn steps
when presented with simulated clients. The next phase entailed the researcher providing
feedback with video-taped review of errors and, within 10-30 min, near perfect accuracy
in conducting the procedures involved in the FAn conditions was achieved. The results of
Iwata et al.'s study are revealing and help to quell arguments that FAn is difficult to perform
and unable to be taught to novices as the participants were college students enrolled in their
first ABA course. Generalization to real-life situations and retention measures were needed
in this study but other researchers have now examined these areas.

    Performance-based training can be used to teach teachers to conduct FAn with chil-
dren in their classroom. For example, Moore et al. (2002) replicated the Iwata et al. (2000)
study with teachers who, after training, applied FAn with students in the classroom. Moore
et al. (2002) demonstrated that performance-based training led three teachers to correctly
perform the steps involved in conducting a FAn to a greater degree compared to that when
only reading the procedures and demonstrating mastery of that knowledge on a test. In
another extension of this instructional approach, teachers conducted the FAn conditions
with children in their classrooms during part of the training phase and then performance-
based training while reviewing those video-taped sessions with the researcher was provided
(Erbas, Tekin-Iftar, & Yucesoy, 2006).

    In another demonstration of use of performance-based training to establish skills, Noell
et al. (2000) taught teachers to use a peer tutoring program with their students. Despite
being given information on the program and knowing what needed to be done, the five
classroom teachers in this single participant research design study did not fully implement
the procedures until performance-based training and brief meetings were provided. The
researchers measured the teachers' students reading scores and found concurrent improve-
ment in those scores as the teachers' implementation of the procedures increased.

    Performance-based training has been demonstrated to be an effective method to teach
people how to implement other training skills as well (Codding, Feinberg, Dunn, & Pace,
2005; Gardner, 1972; Ducharme & Feldman, 1992; Hundert & Hopkins, 1992; Jones
& Eimers, 1975; Nigro-Bruzzi & Sturmey, 2010). This method can lead to changes in
behavior that are not just due to the learner being observed, but as a function of the in-
struction provided (Codding, Livanis, Pace, & Vaca, 2008). Isaacs, Embry, and Baer (1982)
experimentally demonstrated the effectiveness of performance-based training for therapists
to learn how to train parents to increase task compliance with their child. Even when other
methods, such as video modeling are first used to teach a new skill, performance feedback
can be used to effectively "top off " skill acquisition (DiGennaro Reed, Codding, Catania,
& Maguire, 2010).

    A combination of strategies may be used to enhance training. Procedural checklists,
role play and performance-based training have been used by six supervisors to teach nine
residential staff members to conduct trial-based FAn (Lambert, Bloom, Kunnavatana, Col-
lins, & Clay, 2013). A single participant experimental research design demonstrated that
the training procedures were effective, although periodic feedback was required to maintain
skills following the original training sessions.

                                      71
Instruction in Functional Assessment      Chapter 5

    Typically performance-based training is conducted in a face-to-face format (e.g., Ryan,
& Ilemmes, & Sturmey, 2004), although there have been efforts to evaluate the potential
of online instruction with webcams and communication software (Desrochers & DiC-
esare, 2013). Initially, the learner's training typically occurs with the instructor during role
play simulations and once a mastery criterion has been met, skill training with the learner
working with the client may occur. Advantages to structured role play are that a wider array
of contextual possibilities (e.g., various client characteristics, functions, settings, etc.) can be
presented to enhance the learner's acquisition and generalization of skills. See the Table 20
below for an example of a performance-based training data sheet.

Steps that need correction:

    The type of consequences for correct implementation of procedures taught using
performance-based training may be important. DiGennaro, Martens, and Kleinmann
(2005) conducted a study in which classroom teachers were taught procedures to decrease
the problem behavior of their students. These researchers compared goal setting and daily
written feedback delivered to teachers to another condition in which teachers were provided
with performance feedback and could avoid a consultation meeting (i.e., a negative rein-
force) if all of the procedural steps were performed correctly. The latter condition resulted

                                                      73
Instruction in Functional Assessment  Chapter 5

in more accurate implementation of the treatment procedure by the teachers and improved
outcomes for their corresponding students. In general, the reinforcer delivered to increase
someone's behavior should be tailored to the individual; that is, holding meetings may be
a reinforcer to some while avoiding meetings may be reinforcing to others. The feedback
delivered by the instructor should occur immediately after the learner's performance and
include praise given regarding multiple specific areas that the learner performed well and
then corrective feedback concerning areas to improve. Initially, during the early instruction
sessions, feedback should be immediately delivered after the learner's performance; how-
ever, later in training, feedback should be delivered in a more delayed fashion to increase
generalization to real-world situations where delayed feedback is typically the case (Lee &
Belfiore, 1997).

Generalization of FA Skills to the Natural
Environment

    generalization refers to whether the desired skills occur across non-training behav-
iors, setting, time (or maintenance), and people as mentioned in Chapter 3 (Stokes & Baer,
1977). Generalization of learners' skills across these various domains may not automati-
cally occur (Finn, Patten, & McLachlan, 2010), so strategies to promote it may need to be
programmed into the instructional approach. The occurrence of professionals' assessment
and intervention skills across different contexts (e.g., different individuals, topography of
problem behavior, maintaining variables) and long-term maintenance of those skills are
important.

    A major approach to facilitate stimulus generalization is to incorporate into the training
situation stimuli or events that are comparable to that in the natural environment (Duch-
arme & Feldman, 1992). For example, Finn, Patten, and McLachlan (2010) compared test
scores for 82 medical students when they wore scrubs versus no scrubs following learning
gross anatomy (which involved dissection and wearing scrubs in both conditions). Higher
test scores occurred when the students were tested in a similar context (with scrubs) com-
pared to dissimilar context (no scrubs) to training. These results suggest that incorporating
common stimuli in the training situation may aid in transfer of knowledge. For example,
professionals working in inclusion settings may generalize these results by arranging events
in which students act as scientists using tools and equipment so students act as if they are
performing scientific tests.

    case-based learning, also known as guided inquiry approach, involves presentation
of a real-world problem for students to define and solve during instruction. The trainer/
teacher provides a supportive role guiding the student down the correct path, delivering
feedback, and probing for additional information (Srinivasan, Wilkes, Stevenson, Nguyen,
& Slavin, 2007). Srinivasan et al. (2007) compared case-based learning to problem-based
learning, which is a less structured approach, and found that medical students preferred
case-based learning. Cifuentes, Mercer, Alverez, and Bettati (2010) describe how pre-
senting problems for students to solve provides a meaningful learning experience likely
to be encountered in future job settings. This method of instruction is versatile, and has
even been effectively used in large university classes of 100 students working in groups of

                                                74
Instruction in Functional Assessment      Chapter 5

5 or 6 to address a problem situation (Nicholl & Lou, 2012). There is also some research
to suggest that gradually transferring instructional approaches from lecture to case-based
learning may be more effective than using case-based learning alone (Baeten, Dochy, &
Struyven, 2013). Additionally, providing structure (i.e., comparison of cases, prompts) to
promote students' focus on underlying principles related to the material presented may
facilitate their learning (Harkrider et al., 2013). When teaching students to employ a FA
method including multiple case exemplars of clients exhibiting a variety of challenging
behaviors in various situations is important.

    In a more extensive manner of programming common stimuli, general case strategy
can be an effective method of programming for generalization or increase students' learning
occurring in new situations (Ducharme & Feldman, 1992). General case strategy entails
carefully identifying the relevant aspects of a situation and including a representative sample
of those characteristics in a training program.

    To promote generalization of skills, Bolton and Mayer (2008) evaluated a staff training
procedure involving performance feedback training with general case strategy and program-
ming common stimuli. The general case strategy used in this study involved participants'
review of 10 examples of the implementation of the skills taught and training materials
used that were similar to that found in the field. All three paraprofessionals who partici-
pated in the experiment generalized the instructional skills taught with different children.
Applying these strategies (general case strategy and programming common stimuli) when
teaching college students to use a functional assessment approach would entail presenting a
broad range of client cases with characteristics and examples of challenging behavior likely
to be encountered in the professional situation.

    Similarly, the necessary therapist behaviors involved with conducting FAn (e.g., what
the therapist should do following a client's correct versus incorrect response during the
demand condition) must be represented when designing instruction for college students.
Should all therapist behaviors be depicted or can only a sample be shown for optimal
student learning? Moore and Fisher (2007) addressed this research question by comparing
complete video modeling versus partial video modeling procedures that differed in the
number and range of therapist's behaviors presented to teach FAn. The staff members who
participated in this study performed FAn steps best following the complete video modeling
condition (all possible therapist behaviors were presented) under simulated conditions
compared to partial modeling (half of the possible therapist's behaviors were presented)
and lecture training conditions. Moreover, generalization of procedural skills following the
complete video modeling condition by the three participants occurred when working with
actual clients during follow-up probe measures.

    Field experiences, internships, or practicum courses are often offered as a feature of
university curricula in mental health professions to develop and hone students' procedural
and practical decision-making skills common in professional settings. Moreover, supervised
experience is one part of the requirements to be eligible for board certification as a behavior
analyst. These hands-on experiences allow students to practice skills and increase their like-
lihood of transferring the training to other situations. Given that such instruction entails
work with actual individuals who are often in need of services, ethical constraints exist, the
leeway for errors is small, and the breadth of exposure to different experiences (e.g., clients/
students, problem behaviors, etc.) may be limited. Grey, Honan, Mcclean, and Daly (2005)

                                      75
Instruction in Functional Assessment      Chapter 5

provided 90 hours of classroom instruction and supervision to teachers working with a
child with autism. Desirable changes in the children's behavior and positive evaluations of
the program by teachers and parents were found in this descriptive study.

Summary

    Realistic case examples need to be presented to provide the context for learning how to
use FA and to design treatment implemented in the target situation. Multiple examples of
a wide variety of cases involving children and adults displaying various problem behaviors
in different settings may increase college students' generalization of the skills acquired. In-
structional methods to present cases in the college classroom under controlled and ethically
safe conditions include simulations, role play, case-based learning, and general case strategy
and may be used prior to supervised field experiences.

    The instructor's method of instruction should be geared to the type of behavior tar-
geted for training. Different instructional approaches are required for establishing students'
knowledge versus skills. Performance-based training can be used to teach and refine the
skills needed to conduct FA. Additionally, promoting the generalization of college students'
acquisition of the procedural and decision-making skills involved in FA may be facilitated
by use of case-based learning and general case strategy to expose students to a variety of
situations and client cases representative of that found in a professional setting. Moreover,
these procedures can be acquired in a relatively short period of time and generalize to real-
life situations even though role play under simulated conditions typically is used during
training. Another necessity involves teaching the broader array of steps in the FA process
(e.g., decision-making, hypothesis identification, data analysis, treatment selections) to
ensure adequate preparation of a professional who will be working in the field, which is the
focus of Chapter 6.

Discussion Questions

1. Discuss how teaching skills differs from teaching content.

2. Name and describe four methods to teach skills.

3. Describe how you would specifically teach another professional or family member how
    to use positive reinforcement to increase a child's desired behavior.

Exercise: Case Study

    Carly is a new teacher's aide in an elementary school classroom who has been assigned
to work with Allen. Allen is a 6 year-old boy with autism who frequently tantrums in the
classroom. His treatment program includes administration of differential reinforcement
of zero rates 5 min (DRO-5 min) and attention extinction. Carly must be taught how to
employ this behavior intervention plan to reduce Allen's tantrums, which are occurring at
high rates throughout the day (i.e., 20-40 times per day on average).

1. Behaviorally define tantrum.

Focus Questions:

         · How can functional analysis best be taught?
         · What are the components that need to be taught in the functional assessment process

              as a whole?
         · What is FACT and how does it differ from previous approaches to teaching func-

              tional assessment?

A Plan to Teach the Process of Performing
a Functional Assessment

    FA is a complex subject that requires an extensive knowledge-base, clinical decision-
making skills, and performance components. In Chapter 2 the different types of FAs were
described. In Chapter 3 treatment procedures were covered. Chapter 4 reviewed instruc-
tional approaches to establish students' knowledge and clinical decision-making skills.
Lastly, Chapter 5 addressed how performance-based training could be used to teach the
skills involved with conducting functional analysis. The focus of this chapter is to provide a
method to practice the process of FA and the multiple steps that comprise it. See Table 21
below for a list of the steps involved in conducting a FA.
Instruction in Functional Assessment  Chapter 6

                                                  Table 21
                                    Steps involved in conducting a FA

    To conduct a functional assessment the professional must:

1. Behaviorally define the client's challenging behavior
2. Review referral form and records
3. Conduct indirect and/or observational functional assessments
4. Evaluate the reliability and validity of the data
5. Develop a functional hypothesis regarding the maintaining variable for the problem

    behavior
6. Design a functional analysis; indicate advantages and disadvantages of this approach
7. State the ethical issues and considerations for assessment
8. Test hypothesis by implementing functional analysis conditions, and collecting data
9. Graph the data collected, and interpret findings
10. Determine function of the individual's challenging behavior
11. Design behavior intervention plan based on function of the individual's problem

    behavior and other factors (e.g., context, quality of the environment, severity of the
    problem behavior, people present, resources available, setting, etc.)
12. Select a functionally-equivalent replacement behavior, prevention approaches, active
    teaching procedures; and reactive procedures for when the problem behavior occurs
13. State the ethical principles and procedures involved in the treatment phase

Comprehensively Teaching the Functional
Assessment Process

    Descriptions in the research literature of efforts to teach a comprehensive set of practi-
tioner skills have been few. One early demonstration of a comprehensive training program
to teach undergraduate psychology students to provide clinical or in-home consultative
services was described by Keeley, Shemberg, and Ferber (1973). This training program in-
volved: (a) content and practice in observing and recording behavior, (b) interventions, and
(c) professional and ethical skills. The instructional approach involved lectures, role plays,
and problem-solving client cases. The authors report positive results of this program to
teach 37 senior-level psychology students how to deliver services to individuals with devel-
opmental disabilities and their families; however, no systematic evaluation of the program
was performed.

    In a more recent research evaluation of a comprehensive therapist training program,
Chok, Shlesinger, Studer, and Bird (2012) describe a curriculum that involves teaching four
components including: (a) conducting FAn sessions, (b) interpreting graphs, (c) responding
to undifferentiated data, and (d) designing treatments. Participants completed assignments

                                                80
Instruction in Functional Assessment      Chapter 6

and were provided with feedback for answers along with the other knowledge components
until mastery was achieved. Training was tailored to the component taught with perfor-
mance feedback provided to participants when conducting FAn conditions. The researchers
used a concurrent multiple-baseline design across participants to evaluate the training pro-
gram. Participants acquired the skills at a near-perfect accuracy with generalization across
training stimuli and 3 month maintenance occurring. Some limitations noted in this study
were that participants' application of procedures to actual client behaviors was not assessed.
Additionally, the gamut of clinical skills were not addressed, such as ethical issues, defining
target behavior, and identifying a measurement system. Nonetheless, Chok et al.'s (2012)
study provides a good example of how a systematic and comprehensive method can be used
to teach the complex conglomeration of skills necessary for professionals to apply a FA
method.

A New Proposed Instructional Approach:
Functional Analysis Case-based Training
(FACT)

    Functional analysis case-based training (FACT) may be an effective method to
teach a comprehensive set of skills required to perform functional analysis (Desrochers,
2012). A FACT method incorporates a case-based learning approach, role play, simulation,
and performance-based feedback as major instructional methodologies to establish and
hone college students' knowledge-base and skills required to implement a FA process. Stu-
dents are given brief descriptions of cases described in published research to draw upon for
realistic and clinically validated approaches to solving an individual's challenging behavior.
Based on primary source material, effective assessment methods and intervention outcomes
can be identified and reviewed as a group exercise. Both performing the functional analysis
conditions, using role play, and employing the decision-making skills to arrive at an effec-
tive behavior intervention plan are practiced by the student in simulated clinically-relevant
situations with empirically-validated results.

FACT Components

    The major FACT instructional components embedded in this learning activity include
students working collaboratively to solve and re-enact problem situations for individuals
in clinical/school/home settings. The case examples are drawn from published research to
provide realistic characteristics of individuals and their assessment and treatment data.

Team-work

    This exercise is a collaborative learning, team-based approach. Working in separate
groups of three, college students are asked to assume key roles such as client/student, thera-
pist/teacher, or director. The other groups serve as actively participating audience members
during the presentation of each group's case.

    Skills that are interpreted, simulated, or acted out in a role play include: (a) behav-
iorally defining the individual's challenging behavior; (b) identifying the function of the
individual's challenging behavior (c) conducting the conditions for a FAn; (d) analyzing
graphical presentations of behavior; and (e) identifying function-based treatments for that
case. Once the scenarios have been practiced, teams present their case to other students/
audience members who must complete the following tasks: (a) behaviorally defining the
challenging behavior; (b) determining how to assess and record the challenging behavior
during the various functional analysis conditions; (c) analyzing the function of the client's
challenging behavior; (d) determining the most effective treatment based on that function
of the challenging behavior; and (e) reviewing the ethical issues that may exist in the situ-
ation presented. Feedback concerning audience members' answers to questions is provided
by the trainer/director presenting the case.

                   Part I: Provide immediate performance feedback concerning client and therapist
                   behaviors using the behavior integrity checklist

                   Part II: Provide audience with the context for the case (e.g., age of client, setting,
                   etc.)

                   Present questions and provide feedback to the audience to facilitate active
                   engagement in the case, such as:

                   · How would you behaviorally define the challenging behavior?

                   · What recording method and aspect of behavior is measured?

Director/Trainer   · What would a graph of the challenging behavior and its current maintaining
                         variable look like?

                   · What features would you note to analyze the data collected?

                   · What is the function of the challenging behavior?

                   · What are your treatment recommendations in areas of prevention, active
                         training, and reactive?

                   · What ethical issues are present in this situation?

                   · What types of generalization are applicable in this case (stimulus
                         generalization, response generalization, maintenance)? How would you
                         program for generalization to occur?

                   · What information would you include in a BIP?

Audience  Be able to:
          · Behaviorally define the challenging behavior
          · Identify recording method and aspect of behavior measured

          · Make treatment recommendations
          · State the ethical issues present in this situation
          · Program for generalization
          · Write a BIP

    In this role play situation the audience is actively involved and practicing many of the
decision-making skills involved in the FA process. The audience is asked by the director of
the performing group to respond to key features of the case by: (a) defining the challenging
behavior; (b) determining the measurement approach (i.e., frequency, duration, etc.); (c)
recording levels of the problem behavior in various conditions (attention, demands, tan-
gible, alone, play); (d) identifying the maintaining variable for the individual's challenging
behavior; and (e) designing effective interventions to decrease the challenging behavior
based on the function of the challenging behavior and ethical considerations. The director
provides immediate feedback for the audience's answers in each of these topic areas.

Programming for Generalization of
Functional Assessment Knowledge and
Skills

    This interactive exercise allows students to practice performing most of the steps in-
volved in completing the FAn (see Chapter 2) and the overall FA process such as review of
client case, administration of functional analysis, interpretation of data, designing effective
intervention. Furthermore, use of multiple case scenarios (based on general case strategy)
representing multiple perspectives (e.g., audience, and role playing a therapist, client, or
director) may facilitate college students' generalization of skills beyond the boundaries of
the training cases presented (Moore & Fisher, 2007).

Summary

    The process of FA is complex and so instructional methods to teach it must incorporate
multiple strategies to ensure adequate coverage of this topic to thoroughly teach it. A FACT
method is one step toward a comprehensive approach to teaching pre-professionals how
to effectively assess and treat the challenging behaviors of individuals with developmental
disabilities.

FACT Hand-Outs for Students

Purpose of the Activity:

         · To provide you with invaluable hands-on experience with an assessment/treat-
              ment approach that has been experimentally-validated for use with a variety of
              populations and problems.

         · To provide you with the tools that will be useful to you in your career.

         · To provide you with the skills and knowledge that potential employers seek!

Instructions:

1. You and your group members should first carefully read your selected research article
    and summarize the main points. Pay close attention to the client's behavior, procedure,
    and results of the functional analysis conditions. Review those areas with your group
    members once everyone has read the article or its summary.

2. Assign roles (alternate roles so that everyone has an opportunity to perform each role)
    including client, researcher/practitioner, and trainer.
         · Client Role: Read the participant description section of the article you are as-
              signed and simulate the behaviors that are described. Scrutinize the graphical
              presentations of the data and be prepared to approximately portray those levels
              of the client's behavior in each condition (e.g., demands, alone, attention, etc.).

         · Teacher/Therapist Role: Read and review the procedure for each functional
              analysis condition. You will be implementing that procedure with your simu-
              lated client and collecting data on that person's behavior.

         · Director/Trainer Role: Your duties are to describe the client to your "audience,"
              announce conditions, score the researcher's behavior and provide performance-
              based feedback to your researcher/practitioner evaluating his/her completion
              of the steps involved in completing each FAn condition.

3. Practice conducting the functional assessment with performance-based feedback.
         · Director/Trainer introduces the problem situation and describes the client and
              the setting.

         · Teacher/Therapist conducts the brief sessions and collects data on the client's
              behavior.

         · Director/Trainer announces the condition and collects data regarding re-
              searcher's/practitioner's performance.

         · For each functional analysis condition (conduct it for only 5 min maximum),
              the client and Teacher/Therapist simulate the process.

         · Review the procedures to conduct the condition. Conduct the condition. At the
              end of simulated experience trainer provides constructive feedback to Teacher/
              Therapist (i.e., praise aspects of the procedure done well and indicate areas
              needing improvement). If needed (<80% correct procedural performance),
              rehearse again.

                                      84
Instruction in Functional Assessment      Chapter 6

         · Reflect and evaluate your performance as to whether you engaged in all steps
              required to conduct FA. Some research suggests that self-reflection can en-
              hance one's performance (Fallon, Ackley, & Brown, 2003).

    For instructional purposes, perform the functional analysis live in-class or video-taped
for your classmates! Your audience will be required to "collect data" as you perform the
conditions using the checklist for determining treatment fidelity (see below) and so be sure
to make the conditions in keeping with the data and as realistic as possible.

Experimental Functional Analysis Procedural
Description and Reliability Checklist

    A functional analysis is performed to experimentally identify the maintaining variable
for the individual's problem behavior. This exercise is designed to maximize your acquisition
of how to perform this assessment approach.

1. Behaviorally define the problem/target behavior:

2. Identify the recording procedure used to measure the client's problem behavior:

3. Indicate the ethical issues that may be present when conducting a functional analysis
    and state how each issue will be addressed.

    A FAn is typically conducted using a multielement research design (i.e., alternating
treatment design), involving concurrently presenting two or more conditions on the same
day (Martin & Pear, 2011). All conditions are presented for at least 5 min on an assessment
day, with a brief 5-min break between them. The order of conditions is alternated across
days (e.g., Day 1: attention, demands, alone, play; Day 2: demands, alone, play, attention,
etc.). At least 4-5 data points are collected so that trends and levels of the problem behavior
across conditions can be determined. Graphed data are examined to identify differential
levels of the individual's behavior across conditions.

    For the purposes of this role play simply demonstrating a single session for each condi-
tion will suffice. Inform your audience that this session is representative of the client's
average responses that occurred across multiple sessions.

    Review the description, purpose, and procedure for each functional analysis condition
described.Then, in your small group: (a) review the client case together; (b) assign roles (i.e.,
client, therapist, director); (c) plan how to represent the case; and (d) practice performing
the conditions that simulate the client's level of problem behavior as depicted in the graph
until mastery performance is achieved in conducting the functional analysis conditions.

Attention Condition

    These are the standard experimental functional analysis conditions as described by
Iwata, et al., 1994/1982, JABA, 27, 197-209 and Iwata et al., 2000.

Description & Rationale:

    The purpose of this condition is to determine if the individual's problem behavior is
due to attention positive reinforcement. Under conditions of social deprivation and in the
presence of one or two adults, eye contact, physical contact, reprimands, or verbal interac-
tion may be contributing to the individual's problem behavior. The therapist presents verbal
statements, such as "No, don't do that"or similar comments that typically are given by others
in the individual's natural environment immediately after the individual's problem behavior.
Although it may seem counter-intuitive, even telling the individual not to do something
may increase the likelihood that the behavior occurs or serves as a positive reinforcer! Note
that this condition may be tailored to the specific stimuli found to correlate with the occur-
rence of the individual's problem behavior based on descriptive and observational functional
assessments. Attention positive reinforcement is when social reinforcers are delivered (e.g.,
verbal, eye contact, gestures) immediately after the behavior and the behavior is more likely
to occur in similar future situations (Martin & Pear, 2011).

    If the individual's problem behavior is worse under the attention condition compared
to other conditions or the control conditions then this result suggests that attention posi-
tive reinforcement is maintaining their behavior.

Procedure:

    Set the timer and begin. The therapist tells the client to play with toys and then ignores
the child (i.e., no verbal interaction, eye contact, nor any other consistent reaction to the
child's behavior). The therapist ignores the child's appropriate behavior or inappropriate
behavior that is not the target behavior. The therapist can be reading a magazine or talking
to another adult. If the child engages in the problem behavior, then the therapist provides
attention (e.g., eye contact and "Please do not do that, you are going to hurt yourself ") and
physical contact (e.g., hand on shoulder) for 3 s. All occurrences of the client's behavior are
recorded by the therapist.

    Purpose                           Summary Of Attention Condition

Social positive  2 adults talking/        R+ -> Ø
reinforcement    Adult reading magazine   R- -> Attention

    Note: R+ = desirable behavior; R- = problem behavior; Ø = no response

    An example of what the client's graphed levels of the problem behavior that is being
maintained by attention positive reinforcement is as follows:

                                      87
Instruction in Functional Assessment      Chapter 6

    As can be seen in the graph, frequency of the client's aggressive behavior is greater
in the attention condition compared to the demands and play conditions. This provides
experimental evidence that the client's problem behavior is being maintained by attention
positive reinforcement.

Demand (Escape) Condition

    These are the standard experimental functional analysis conditions as described by
Iwata, et al., 1994/1982, JABA, 27, 197-209 and Iwata et al., 2000.

Description and Rationale:

    The purpose of the demand condition is to determine if the individual's problem
behavior is due to escape/avoidance of task demands or activities (AKA negative reinforce-
ment). A negative reinforcer (escape) is when an unpleasant stimulus is present and an
instance of the problem behavior removes that stimulus (Martin & Pear, 2011). The prob-
ability of an individual's behavior that results in a negative reinforcer increases in similar
future situations. Avoidance is when a threat of presentation of an aversive stimulus is
present and an instance of the behavior removes that threat. Across the functional analysis
conditions, if the individual's problem behavior is worse when the demand condition is in
effect compared to that in the other conditions then the problem behavior may be main-
tained by negative reinforcement.

Procedure:

    Set timer and begin. The therapist, on repeated trials throughout the 5-min session,
presents an activity or instruction to complete a task that the individual has in the past
(based on interview or observational data) had difficulty in completing even when physi-
cally guided to do so.

    Specifically, the therapist and client are seated at a table and the therapist presents an
instruction to complete a task. The therapist waits for 5 s for the client to initiate a response.

    If no response occurs to this first instruction then the therapist: (a) repeats the instruc-
tion; (b) models or demonstrates the correct response; and (c) waits 5 s for a response by
the client = LEVEL 1 PROMPT

    If no response occurs after the second instruction, then the therapist: (a) repeats the
instruction; (b) physically guides the client through the response using the least amount of
guidance required = LEVEL 2 PROMPT

    If the client emits a correct response, prompted or unprompted, the therapist provides
praise ("Nice work").

    If the client engages in the problem behavior at any time, then the therapist immedi-
ately turns away from the client for 30 s, with additional 30 s for any repeated instances of
the problem behavior.

    An example of what the client's graphed levels of the problem behavior that is being
maintained by negative reinforcement (specifically, escape from task demands) is as follows:

    As can be seen in the graph, frequency of the client's aggressive behavior is higher
in the demands condition compared to the attention and play conditions. This provides
experimental evidence that the client's problem behavior is being maintained by negative
reinforcement.

Play Condition

    These are the standard experimental functional analysis conditions as described by
Iwata, et al., 1994/1982, JABA, 27, 197-209 and Iwata et al., 2000.

Purpose and Rationale:

    In the play condition, toys or activities are presented and the therapist interacts socially
with the client. This condition serves as a comparison condition to rule out confounding
variables or that the problem behavior is due to variables present in the attention, tangible,
or demand conditions (e.g., the presence of the therapist, materials, social interaction). The
amount of the client's problem behavior in the play condition is compared to that in the
other conditions. For example, if across experimental sessions the client's problem behavior
is consistently better in the play condition compared to that in the attention condition, then
attention positive reinforcement may be maintaining the client's problem behavior.

Procedure:

    The therapist and client are in a room with a variety of toys present. The therapist is
within 3-5 ft of the client and occasionally presents toys, with no demands. The therapist
provides social praise and brief physical contact contingent on appropriate behavior at least
once every 30 s. Any problem behavior is ignored unless the severity is of concern due to
physical harm.

Alone Condition

    These are the standard experimental functional analysis conditions as described by
Iwata, et al., 1994/1982, JABA, 27, 197-209 and Iwata et al., 2000.

Purpose & Rationale:

    In the alone condition, the client is in a room by him/herself with no toys or activities
(Note all safety concerns should be addressed and appropriate precautions taken). The ther-
apist observes the client's behavior for the purpose of data collection from a one-way mirror
or video camera. This condition tests whether self-stimulation or automatic reinforcement
is maintaining the client's problem behavior by creating a situation in which low levels
of stimulation exist and measuring whether the problem behavior occurs. If levels of the
client's problem behavior are worse in the alone condition compared to the other functional
analysis conditions or do not differ across all conditions then automatic reinforcement may
be maintaining the client's problem behavior.

Procedure:

    The client is placed in the therapy room alone, without any toys or materials that would
provide a source of stimulation. The client's problem behavior is measured.

                  Purpose                     Summary Of Condition

    As can be seen in the above graphs, frequency of the client's behavior is either greater
in the alone condition compared to the attention, demands, and play conditions (A) or high
in all conditions (B). These data configurations provide evidence that the client's problem
behavior is being maintained by automatic positive reinforcement.

The Case of the Cough!

From Watson, T. S., & Sterling, H. E. (1998). Brief functional analysis and treatment of a
        vocal tic. Journal of Applied Behavior Analysis, 31, 471-474.

    Client Description & Background: Vivian, a 4-year-old typically developing girl who
presented with a 4 month occurrence of a vocal tic in the form of repeated coughing. Just
before originally exhibiting the cough, she had a respiratory infection that had since cleared
up. She had been seen by her pediatrician who did not find a medical cause for her behavior.
Vivian's parents stated that her cough "was `annoying' and `intrusive' in their conversations"
(Watson & Sterling, 1998, p.471). Her coughing generally only occurred during meals.

    Behavioral definition: "loud barking or metallic sound coming from the mouth"
(Watson & Sterling, 1998, p. 471).

    Parent Interview Questions:
         · When does the behavior occur?
         · What are your reactions to the coughing behavior?
         · What other times or places that the cough occurs?
         · Does it occur when you are out? Is it only certain foods?
         · Does it occur with one parent or both?
         · When she doesn't want to eat?
         · Do certain things occur during the day associated with its occurrence or non-
              occurrence (e.g., school, longer day, daycare, visits)?

    Parent Interview and functional assessment observational data collected by parents on
ABCs during meals, snacks, watching TV in bed, at drawing table, suggested that either
attention or tangibles (food items) was being delivered immediately after Vivian's cough
during mealtimes.

    Procedure: Functional analysis was conducted using a multielement research design
with both 5-min conditions occurring each meal.

    Attention condition: "...one parent made brief comments within 2-5 s after Vivian
coughed" (Watson & Sterling, 1998, p. 472).

    Tangible condition: "...one of the parents immediately presented Vivian with one small
Sweet Tart candy (a preferred item, according to the parents) but made no comment con-
tingent upon coughing..." (Watson & Sterling, 1998, p. 472).

The Case of the Delusional Statements

From Travis, R., & Sturmey, P. (2010). Functional analysis and treatment of the delusional
        statements of a man with multiple disabilities: A four-year follow-up. Journal of
        Applied Behavior Analysis, 43, 745-749.

    Client Description and Background: "Mr. Jones, a 26-year-old man who lived in an
inpatient forensic facility who engaged in delusional statements that negatively affected his
relationships with peers. His peers teased him daily, both in residence and workplace, and
these statements prevented him from participating in several community-based vocational
activities" (Travis & Sturmey, 2010, p. 745-746). Following an injury, Mr. Jones was diag-
nosed with traumatic brain injury for which he received Geodon and Depakote daily. His
communications did not include any delusional statements prior to his car accident that
occurred when he was 16 years old.

    Based on staff and family interviews, delusional statements were defined as utterances,
separated from the previous one by 3 s, that were had no relationship to what was currently
happening or being discussed (e.g., "Elton John and I are going for coffee").

    Procedure: Functional analysis was conducted using a multielement research design
with the following conditions which were 12 min in duration.

    Attention condition: Immediately after a delusional statement by Mr. Jones, the thera-
pist said, "That's not an appropriate topic right now" or something similarly corrective is
said for 10 s.

    Demand condition: A vocational task presented that involved sorting similar items,
counting them, and placing them in plastic bags. When Mr. Jones engaged in a delusional
statement then 10 s of escape from demands was provided. Correct responses, prompted
or unprompted, to demands resulted in delivery of praise.

    Alone condition: "Mr. Jones was alone in the observation room with no planned rein-
forcement for delusional statements" (Travis & Sturmey, 2010, p. 746).

    Control condition: "...the therapist gave Mr. Jones access to favored reading materials,
noncontingent attention every 30 s and no consequences for nondelusional or delusional
statements" (Travis & Sturmey, 2010, p. 746).

A Case in the Classroom

From: Moore, J. W., & Edwards, R. P. (2003). An analysis of aversive stimuli in classroom
        demand contexts. Journal of Applied Behavior Analysis, 36, 339-348.

    Client Description & Background: "Edgar was a 9-year-old boy who attended a gen-
eral education fourth-grade classroom with 17 other students. Edgar had been referred
for yelling in class. When he attended school in a different state the previous year, Edgar
received a special education ruling of severely emotionally disturbed. Edgar's academic and
cognitive abilities fell in the average range of academic functioning, and he received 100%
of his academic instruction in a general education classroom" (Moore & Edwards, 2003, p.
340).

    "Edgar's teacher was in her 6th year of teaching. She held a BS degree and an MA
degree in elementary education" (Moore & Edwards, 2003, p. 340).

    "Yelling was defined as vocal utterances above a normal tone of voice" (Moore & Ed-
wards, 2003, p. 340).

    "Task demands were defined as verbal instructions and written academic work deliv-
ered by the teacher" (Moore & Edwards, 2003, p. 340).

    Procedure: Functional analysis was conducted using a multielement research design
with the following conditions which were 10 min in duration.

    Demand condition:

         The teacher presented learning trials to the student every 30 s throughout the
    session. All demans were presented in worksheet form. A sequential vocal, gestural,
    and physical (i.e., hand-over-hand) prompting hierarchy was employed to present
    demand trials. Hand-over-hand prompting included placing the pencil in the student's
    hand and positioning the pencil lead on the worksheet. The teacher delivered praise
    if the student complied with the verbal or gestural prompt, continued the prompting
    sequence if the student did not comply, and terminated the trial (by removing the
    worksheet and moving to the other side of the room) if the student engaged in the
    target problem behavior at any time during the trial. (Moore & Edwards, 2003, p. 341)

    Attention condition:

         The student was given access to several nonpreferred leisure activities throughout
    the session. The teacher ignored the child except to deliver attention in the form of
    a statement of disapproval or concern (e.g., "Stop that; you are disrupting the class")
    and brief physical contact (e.g., a pat on the back or touching the arm) following each
    occurrence of the target problem behavior. All other appropriate and inappropriate
    behaviors were ignored. (Moore & Edwards, 2003, p. 341)

The Case of "You Already Said That!"

From Rehfeldt and Chambers (2003). Functional analysis and treatment of verbal perse-
        verations displayed by an adult with autism. JABA, 36, 259-261.

    Client Description & Background: "Vince was a 23-year old man who had been
diagnosed with autism and mild mental retardation. He also experienced seizures that
were controlled medication" (Rehfeldt & Chambers, 2003, p. 259). Medications that Vince
took included Phenytoin, Sertraline, Bisoprolol, and Trazedone. Vince attended a sheltered
workshop on a daily basis and this is where the majority of his problem behavior was ex-
hibited. When interacting with others, his conversation included perseveration on specific
topics.

    Perseverative speech was defined as Vince's repeated comments. One occurrence of
an utterance was distinguished from another of the same if there was no speech for at
least 3 s. Common perseverative topics included talk about sirens, alarms, dentist or doctor
appointments.

    Procedure: A functional analysis was conducted using a multielement research design
with the following conditions lasting 10 min in duration.

    Attention condition: Following verbal perseverations 10 s of attention immediately
was given by the therapist. This attention included both acknowledgment statements (e.g.,
"You sure do like those sirens, don't you?") and mild reprimands (e.g., "Don't talk about
sirens. There are none here.").

    Demand condition: A work task such as filing or sorting paper was given to Vince.
Following verbal perseveration, the task was immediately removed by the therapist for 30 s
who looked away and did not interact with Vince. If an incorrect or no response occurred
then the instruction was represented and the therapist modeled the correct behavior. If an
incorrect or no response occurred to the level 1, then a level 2 prompt or physical assistance
was provided for him to complete the correct response.

    Alone condition: Vince was in room alone. The therapist stood outside the door to
observe and collect data on Vince's behavior.

    Tangible condition: Immediately following verbal preservation Vince was provided
with 30 s of access to preferred activities (writing about sirens, fire drills, etc.).

The Case of #@&*!

From: Dwyer-Moore and Dixon (2007). Functional analysis and treatment of problem
        behavior of elderly adults in long-term care. JABA, 40, 679-683.

    Client Description & Background: "Carmen was an 89-year-old woman who had
been diagnosed with vascular dementia with mood disturbance; referred for high rates of
disruptive vocalization (e.g., obscenities)" (Dwyer-Moore & Dixon, 2007, p. 680). She lived
in a large (159-bed) residential care facility.

    Procedure: Functional analysis was conducted using a multielement research design
with the following conditions lasting 10 min in duration.

    Attention condition: "In the attention condition, the participant was told that the
therapist had work to do and would be sitting across the room. No consequences were
provided for any behavior other than the identified target behavior, which resulted in the
experimenter approaching and providing approximately 5 to 10 s of social attention. Atten-
tion was similar to that noted from naturalistic observations of staff-resident interactions
(e.g., `It's OK, you're fine,' `Grandma, don't say that,' `Derek, tell me about the priesthood,'
`How are you doing today?')" (Dwyer-Moore & Dixon, 2007, p. 680).

    Demand condition: "In the demand condition, the experimenter presented demands in
the form of questions or gross motor tasks. Carmen was given demands such as clapping,
raising their arms in the air, and knocking and lifting their legs these were similar to the
gross motor tasks used in the facility's occupational therapy program... Compliance resulted
in approximately 3 to 5 s of praise and presentation of the next demand. No response or in-
correct responses resulted in least-to-most prompts. Problem behavior resulted in removal
of the demand for 30 s (Dwyer-Moore & Dixon, 2007, p. 680-681).

    Alone condition: "In the alone condition, the participant was alone in the family room
while the experimenter observed unobtrusively through a 2.5 cm gap in the door. No social
consequences were provided, and no leisure items were available" (Dwyer-Moore & Dixon,
2007, p. 681).

The Case of Bye, Bye, I am Gone!

From: Lang, R., Davis, T., O'Reilly, M., Machalicek, W., Rispoli, M., Sigafoos, J., Lan-
        cioni, G., & Regester, A. (2010). Functional analysis and treatment of elopement
        across two school settings. Journal of Applied Behavior Analysis, 43, 113-118.

    Client Description & Background: "Joe, a 4-year-old boy who had been diagnosed
with Asperger syndrome participated," (Lang et al., 2010, p. 114) runs out of the classroom
10-20 times per day, no matter the goings-on. John is in a regular classroom with 20 other
children 2 teacher's aides, and 1 teacher.

    Problem Behavior: Elopement from the classroom. Define this behavior so that it can
be measured and observed reliably:

    Procedure: Functional analysis was conducted using a multielement research design
with the following 5-min conditions:

    Attention condition: "The therapist sat next to Joe in her chair at the table, assumed
the appearance of reading a notebook, and instructed him to play. Joe had free access to
toys. If he eloped, the therapist retrieved him and provided verbal and physical attention,
which continued for 5 s after the therapist had guided Joe back to the table" (Lang et al.,
2010, p. 114).

    Escape condition: "The therapist delivered task demands based on Joe's individualized
education plan. If he did not respond to the demand within 5 s, the therapist provided a
gestural or model prompt indicating the correct response. If he still did not respond, the
therapist used a physical prompt. Following elopement, the therapist retrieved him using
a minimal amount of physical contact (e.g., guiding lightly by the arm) and refrained from
providing verbal attention. The therapist delayed presentation of the next demand for an
additional 5 s once she returned Joe to the table" (Lang et al., 2010, p. 114-115).

    Tangible condition: "In the tangible condition, a television and DVD player, which the
class used frequently, were present. The therapist played Joe's preferred DVD for 10 s prior
to the session, turned off the TV via remote control to start the session, and turned on the
TV with the remote following elopement. After the TV was turned on, Joe would either
return to the area or the therapist would retrieve him in the same manner as described for
the escape condition" (Lang et al., 2010, p. 115).

    Play condition: "Joe had unrestricted access to toys. The therapist did not present task
demands, maintained close proximity to Joe, provided verbal praise and physical contact
about every 10 s, and ignored elopement" (Lang et al., 2010, p. 115).

The Case of Hair Today, Gone Tomorrow

From: Rapp, J. T., Miltenberger, R. G., Galensky, T. L., Ellingson, S. A., & Long, E. S.
        (1999). A functional analysis of hair pulling. Journal of Applied Behavior Analysis,
        32, 329-337.

    Client Description & Background: "Kris was a 19-year-old female with severe mental
retardation and mild cerebral palsy. She was able to ambulate, follow simple instructions,
and communicate with single words. Due to a childhood stroke, Kris walked with a limp
and could not open her left hand. Consequenctly, she pulled and manipulated her scalp
hair with only her right hand. Her mother reported that Kris had pulled scalp hair since
approximately age 3 and that the behavior would occasionally remit for periods up to a
month. In the past, Kris' hair pulling was unsuccessfully treated with Trazohone and pa-
rental scolding. According to her mother, Kris usually pulled scalp hair while watching
television and in bed. After pulling a hair, she rolled it between her thumb and index
finder, rubbed the hair on her lips, and then chewed on the hair while pulling it with her
fingers. Her mother reported that periods of increased baldness seemed to be correlated
with constipation, which may indicate that Kris was ingesting hairs. Kris did not appear to
ingest hair during either phase of this investigation. Hair pulling produced an obvious area
of baldness 5 cm in diameter on the top of her scalp" (Rapp et al., 1999, p. 331).

    "Hair pulling was defined as any contact of the fingers of her right hand with her scalp.
Hair manipulation was defined as rolling of pulled hair between any fingers, gazing at
pulled hair, and any contact of hair with the lips or mouth. Hair manipulation onset always
occurred within 3 s of hair pullong offset" (Rapp et al., 1999, p. 331).

    Procedure: Functional analysis was conducted using a multielement research design
with the following conditions:

    Attention condition: "Kris and a therapist were seated side by side in the room. Kris
was given a video to watch on the television while the therapist shuffled papers and wrote in
a notebook. No interaction took place between them unless Kriss pulled hair. Contingent
on hair pulling, the therapist reached over and gently pressed Kris' arm down from her head
and provided disapproving statements (e.g., `Don't pull your hair')" (Rapp et al., 1999, p.
332).

    Demand condition: "During this condition, a therapist stood behind Kris, who was
seated at a large table. The therapist presented a task (from her prevocational curriculum)
that involved taking single pieces of different colored paper off 4 piles in a sequential order
and placing the collated papers into a specified envelope. Kris was shown the correct se-
quence for the papers and then prompted every 20 to 30 s in a 3-step sequence (verbal
prompt; verbal prompt and pointing; verbal prompt, pointing, plus manual guidance) to
stack the papers accordingly. Praise was provided for 2 to 3 s contingent upon completing
the correct paper sequence and filling the envelope. If hair pulling occurred, the therapist
removed the materials and suspended all interactions with Kris for 30 s" (Rapp et al., 1999,
p. 332).

    Alone condition: "Kris was seated alone in the observation room to watch a video on
the television" (Rapp et al., 1999, p. 332).

                                      112
Instruction in Functional Assessment  Chapter 6

    Control condition: "Kris was seated across from a therapist in the research room and
was given continuous access to toys that her mother identified as being preferred. Therapist
praise and pats to Kris' arm were provided at least once every 10 s, and there were no social
consequences for hair pulling" (Rapp et al., 1999, p. 332).

Focus Questions:

         · What templates and resources are available to use when attempting to replicate this
              skill based approach to learning functional assessment?

    The authors of Instruction in Functional Assessment hope that this text will equip learners
with the knowledge and skills to perform functional assessment. One of the unique fea-
tures of this book is the integration of both psychological and educational perspectives
embedded into the content and skills of FA. Such an endeavor can be challenging as the
two fields utilize different vocabularies and often alternative perspectives in viewing and in-
tervening with students with challenging behaviors.The following Table may help illustrate
the vocabulary differences among professionals in psychology and those with educational
backgrounds.

General Description

Behavior is often defined as the way in which one behaves or acts with others. This
can be an action or a reaction. Behavior is also a method of controlling yourself, your
actions, and your responses.

Instruction in Functional Assessment       Chapter 7

 For the purposes of this book, we have chosen to take an inclusive and interdisciplinary
 approach. We view challenging behaviors as the focus of professionals' analysis and
 intervention. Clients or students are not problems, but rather coping as best as possible
 in their environment. Most often these challenging behaviors serve a communication
 function. These individuals need interdisciplinary professionals who assist them and
 their families to effectively learn new desirable behavior. This blended, interdisciplinary
 approach is person centered and proactively supports the family and the child using
 effective functional assessment processes and approaches.

    The following materials may be helpful either as secondary sources of information for
teaching FA, or as performance-based resources that go further in depth in developing
students' FA knowledge and skills.

    The authors of this textbook have based Instruction in Functional Assessment on cur-
rent and seminal research literature. We have made every effort to reference materials to
the originators of the primary research. In some cases, we have extended and adapted the
research information to be more student-friendly. This means that the audience of college
students and pre-professionals may more easily understand how to implement the research
into the process of FA and the practice of FA performance skills. It has been our intent
throughout the textbook to uphold all aspects of copyright in an ethical and legal manner.
