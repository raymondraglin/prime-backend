Early Childhood Educational Programming is fundamentally grounded in developmentally
appropriate practices and is supported through theoretical foundations woven throughout a
curriculum. Various types of programs may emphasize one theory over another or take on
more of an array of theories by combining approaches to achieve program goals.

How Young Children Learn: What Science Reveals

Children play in order to figure things out, much like scientists who experiment and investigate
in order to figure things out. Scientists who study how infants and young children think and feel
describe them as small scientists (Gopnik, Meltzoff, and Kuhl 2000) who spend their days
actively gathering and organizing information about what objects and people are like. As they
play, children investigate how one object relates to another or how people relate to each other.

According to Gopnik, Meltzoff, and Kuhl (2000), children actively build knowledge as they
interact with the world around them.

In the early twentieth century, scientists and theorists--such as Jean Piaget and Lev Vygotsky--
developed widely studied theories to explain how young children acquire knowledge. Scientists
have continued to study children's ways of knowing by care- fully observing and listening as
children pursue new skills, explore materials, solve problems, work together with others, and
encounter experiences that prompt them to think and reason (Shonkoff and Phillips 2000.)
Young children's actions and their explanations provide clues about how they develop ideas,
master skills, and build knowledge. This research illuminates a key finding--infants and young
children actively construct concepts and build skills by interacting with objects and with people,
much of it occurring in the context of play. By nature, children are active participants in making
meaning and constructing knowledge.

The body of research on the developing mind of the young child also adds to our understanding
of what it means to teach and to plan curriculum for infants and young children. The long-
standing image from K-12 education of an active, talking teacher who imparts information to
passive, quiet children does not fit with what is known from the science of early learning and
development. Young children seated at desks and quietly listening, not interjecting their ideas,
represent an image that diverges from the image generated by developmental science: that of
young children who seek to participate actively in an experience to build concepts, ideas, and
skills. Studies show that infants and young children are highly motivated to explore new
materials and to take on new challenges (Bowman, Donovan, and Burns 2000.)

Robust scientific evidence provides a starting point for guidance on planning and implementing
early childhood curriculum. Reviews of research point clearly to three principles with respect to
how young children learn (Bowman, Donovan, and Burns 2000; Hirsh-Pasek et al. 2009;
Schonkoff and Phillips 2000):

     Children actively construct concepts like numbers, spatial relations, causality, and story.
     Children actively build skills like drawing, moving with ease, negotiating conflicts, and

         confidently and respectfully communicating ideas and feelings.
     Children actively develop dispositions such as thoughtfulness, empathy, and

         responsibility.

These principles guide the approach to early childhood curriculum described in this chapter.
Children's thinking, their feelings, and their dispositions are the center of the curriculum and
inform the planning and implementation of educational experiences. This approach contrasts
with a subject-matter approach to curriculum, commonly used with older children and adults,
in which the subject of study (such as science, literature, or mathematics) is placed at the
center of the curriculum and used to organize the daily schedule of learning experiences and
the learning environment. When the curriculum is organized around children's thinking, their
feelings, and their dispositions to learn and to relate with others, the focus is on providing
contexts in which children have rich opportunities to build concepts and skills through
meaningful exploration and active experimentation.

For example, for a group of three- and four-year-olds fascinated by the heavy equipment
vehicles passing outside the yard, a teacher might use a construction site next to the school as
the context for study or focus of the curriculum. The children's excitement about the ongoing
construction inspires an investigation with the children of the events underway in this
neighboring lot. In considering the study of the construction site, teachers can envision ample
opportunity for children to build concepts related to science, mathematics, literature, the arts,
and social studies. The teachers create learning contexts that engage children in finding out
more about the events underway in the neighboring construction project. Such an investigation
offers many possibilities for the children to explore concepts from various domains or subject
areas addressed in the three volumes of the preschool learning foundations such as size,
number, spatial relations, causality, story, song, drama, visual representation, and much more.
With the preschool learning foundations and curriculum framework as guides, teachers can
within this study tap multiple domains--social science, natural science, physical science,
language arts, visual arts, physical development, and mathematics.2

           Figure 1.2: Construction vehicles in the sandbox could be one opportunity teachers could provide.3

Theoretical Foundations

Early Childhood Educators rely on theories to provide evidentiary support to their program
goals, philosophies and methods felt throughout their programs. While there are numerous
theories, a few are highlighted in this chapter in how they relate to creating programs for
learning for young children.

Cognitive Theory

Jean Piaget explained learning as proceeded by the interplay of assimilation (adjusting new
experiences to fit prior concepts) and accommodation (adjusting concepts to fit new
experiences). The to-and-fro of these two processes leads not only to short-term learning, as
pointed out in, but also to long-term developmental change. The long-term developments are
really the main focus of Piaget's cognitive theory. After observing children
closely, Piaget proposed that cognition developed through distinct stages from birth through

the end of adolescence. By stages he meant a sequence of thinking patterns with four key
features:

             1. The stages always happen in the same order.
             2. No stage is ever skipped.
             3. Each stage is a significant transformation of the stage before it.
             4. Each later stage incorporated the earlier stages into itself. Basically this is the

                  "staircase" model of development mentioned at the beginning of this chapter.

Piaget proposed four major stages of cognitive development, and called them (1) sensorimotor
intelligence, (2) preoperational thinking, (3) concrete operational thinking, and (4) formal
operational thinking. Each stage is correlated with an age period of childhood, but only
approximately. In Early Childhood Education, we primarily consider the first two stages as they
are most common for children ages 0-8 years.

The Sensorimotor Stage: Birth to Age 2

In Piaget's theory, the sensorimotor stage is first, and is defined as the period when infants
"think" by means of their senses and motor actions. As every new parent will attest, infants
continually touch, manipulate, look, listen to, and even bite and chew objects. According
to Piaget, these actions allow them to learn about the world and are crucial to their early
cognitive development.

                                            Figure 2.3: Sensorimotor learning in action.4

The infant's actions allow the child to represent (or construct simple concepts of) objects and
events. A toy animal may be just a confusing array of sensations at first, but by looking, feeling,
and manipulating it repeatedly, the child gradually organizes her sensations and actions into a
stable concept, toy animal. The representation acquires a permanence lacking in the individual
experiences of the object, which are constantly changing. Because the representation is stable,
the child "knows", or at least believes, that toy animal exists even if the actual toy animal is
temporarily out of sight. Piaget called this sense of stability object permanence, a belief that
objects exist whether or not they are actually present. It is a major achievement of

sensorimotor development, and marks a qualitative transformation in how older infants (24
months) think about experience compared to younger infants (6 months).

During much of infancy, a child can only barely talk, so sensorimotor development initially
happens without the support of language. It might therefore seem hard to know what infants
are thinking, but Piaget devised several simple, but clever experiments to get around their lack
of language. Piaget's findings suggest that infants do indeed represent objects even without
being able to talk (Piaget, 1952). In one, for example, he simply hid an object (such as a toy
animal) under a blanket. He found that doing so consistently prompts older infants (18-24
months) to search for the object, but fails to prompt younger infants (less than six months) to
do so. (You can try this experiment yourself if you happen to have access to a young infant.)
"Something" motivates the search by the older infant even without the benefit of much
language, and the "something" is presumed to be a permanent concept or representation of
the object.

The Preoperational Stage: Age 2 to 7

In the preoperational stage, children use their new ability to represent objects in a wide variety
of activities, but they do not yet do it in ways that are organized or fully logical. One of the most
obvious examples of this kind of cognition is dramatic play, the improvised make-believe of
preschool children. If you have ever had responsibility for children of this age, you have likely
witnessed such play. Ashley holds a plastic banana to her ear and says: "Hello, Mom? Can you
be sure to bring me my baby doll? OK!" Then she hangs up the banana and pours tea for Jeremy
into an invisible cup. Jeremy giggles at the sight of all of this and exclaims: "Rinnng! Oh Ashley,
the phone is ringing again! You better answer it." And on it goes.

Children immersed in make-believe may seem to have an inaccurate understanding of the
world, in that they do not think realistically. But at some level, Ashley and Jeremy always know
that the banana is still a banana and not really a telephone; they are merely representing it as a
telephone. They are thinking on two levels at once--one imaginative and the other realistic.
This dual processing of experience makes dramatic play an early example of metacognition, or
reflecting on and monitoring of thinking itself. As we explained previously, metacognition is a
highly desirable skill for success in school, one that teachers often encourage (Bredekamp &
Copple, 1997; Paley, 2005). Partly for this reason, teachers of young children (preschool,
kindergarten, and even first or second grade) often make time and space in their classrooms for
dramatic play, and sometimes even participate in it themselves to help develop
the play further.5

                   Pause to Reflect
                   As a lab school, students often visit children's classrooms to observe the
                   environments and interactions to connect theory with practice. One day, I
                   decided to take a small group of students to observe the environment in one
                   of our preschool classrooms. As we opened the door, I heard a young child
                   (age 3 years) say to her caregiver, "Why are all the mommies here?" The
                   caregiver acknowledged the child's observation, but explained that the visitors
                   were there to learn about the classroom. The child continued to watch us as
                   we walked through the classroom. 7

                   How does this example provide evidence of Piaget's Cognitive Theory?

Children grow and develop through stages, and so does their play. Children's earliest play
experiences are highly sensory driven and simple exchanges with caregivers and materials
within their environment. Many of the early play experiences promote a sense of discovery and
lead to positive interactions among children and adult caregivers. As the child develops more
complex play develops too. Infants observe and interact with materials through the use of the
five senses. As the infant develops, he or she continues to observe, explore and experiment
with materials within the environment, thus obtaining knowledge.

Sociocultural Theory

Lev Vygotsky (1978), whose writing focused on how a child's or novice's thinking is influenced
by relationships with others who are more capable, knowledgeable, or expert than the learner.

Vygotsky made the reasonable proposal that when a child (or novice) is learning a new skill or
solving a new problem, he or she can perform better if accompanied and helped by an expert
than if performing alone--though still not as well as the expert. Someone who has played very
little chess, for example, will probably compete against an opponent better if helped by an
expert chess player than if competing against the opponent alone. Vygotsky called the
difference between solo performance and assisted performance the zone of proximal
development (or ZPD for short)--meaning, figuratively speaking, the place or area of immediate
change. From this social constructivist perspective, learning is like assisted performance (Tharp
& Gallimore, 1991).

During learning, knowledge or skill is found initially "in" the expert helper. If the expert is skilled
and motivated to help, then the expert arranges experiences that let the novice practice crucial
skills or construct new knowledge. In this regard, the expert is a bit like the coach of an
athlete--offering help and suggesting ways of practicing, but never doing the actual athletic
work himself or herself. Gradually, by providing continued experiences matched to the novice
learner's emerging competencies, the expert-coach makes it possible for the novice or
apprentice to appropriate (or make his or her own) the skills or knowledge that originally
resided only with the expert.8

Psychosocial Theory

Erik Erikson suggested that our relationships and society's expectations motivate much of our
behavior. Humans are motivated, for instance, by the need to feel that the world is a
trustworthy place, that we are capable individuals, that we can make a contribution to society,
and that we have lived a meaningful life. Erikson divided the lifespan into eight stages. In each
stage, we have a major psychosocial task to accomplish or crisis to overcome. Erikson believed
that our personality continues to take shape throughout our lifespan as we face these
challenges in living.9

In planning a developmentally appropriate curriculum, Erikson's stages can be used as
inspiration for interactions between children, children and adults (teachers/families) and for
emphasizing quality environments, which promote trust, autonomy, initiative and industrious
interactions.10

                          The infant must have basic needs met in a consistent way in
                          order to feel that the world is a trustworthy place.

Initiative vs. Guilt (3-5)
                              Preschoolers like to initiate activities and emphasize doing
                              things "all by myself."

Industry vs. inferiority (6-  School aged children focus on accomplishments and begin

Identity vs. role confusion   Teenagers are trying to gain a sense of identity as they
(adolescence)                 experiment with various roles, beliefs, and ideas.

Intimacy vs. Isolation        In our 20s and 30s we are making some of our first long-term
(young adulthood)             commitments in intimate relationships.

Generativity vs. stagnation   The 40s through the early 60s we focus on being productive at
(middle adulthood)            work and home and are motivated by wanting to feel that
                              we've made a contribution to society.
Integrity vs. Despair (late
adulthood)                    We look back on our lives and hope to like what we see-that
                              we have lived well and have a sense of integrity because we
                              lived according to our beliefs.

Behavioral Theory

In classrooms, behaviorism is most useful for identifying relationships between specific actions
by a student and the immediate precursors and consequences of the actions. It is less useful for
understanding changes in students' thinking; for this purpose we need theories that are
more cognitive (or thinking-oriented) or social, like the ones described later in this chapter. This
fact is not a criticism of behaviorism as a perspective, but just a clarification of its particular
strength or usefulness, which is to highlight observable relationships among actions, precursors
and consequences. Behaviorists use particular terms (or "lingo," some might say) for these
relationships. One variety of Behaviorism that has proved especially useful to educators is
operant conditioning.

Operant conditioning: New Behaviors Because of New Consequences

Operant conditioning focuses on how the consequences of a behavior affect the behavior over
time. It begins with the idea that certain consequences tend to make certain behaviors happen
more frequently. If I compliment a student for a good comment made during discussion, there
is more of a chance that I will hear further comments from the student in the future (and

17 | I n t r o d u c t i o n t o C u r r i c u l u m f o r E a r l y C h i l d h o o d E d u c a t i o n
hopefully they too will be good ones!). If a student tells a joke to classmates and they laugh at
it, then the student is likely to tell more jokes in the future and so on.

The original research about this model of learning was not done with people, but with animals.
One of the pioneers in the field was a Harvard professor named B. F. Skinner, who published
numerous books and articles about the details of the process and who pointed out many
parallels between operant conditioning in animals and operant conditioning in humans (1938,
1948, 1988). Skinner observed the behavior of rather tame laboratory rats (not the unpleasant
kind that sometimes live in garbage dumps). He or his assistants would put them in a cage that
contained little except a lever and a small tray just big enough to hold a small amount of food.
At first the rat would sniff and "putter around" the cage at random, but sooner or later it would
happen upon the lever and eventually happen to press it. Presto! The lever released a small
pellet of food, which the rat would promptly eat. Gradually the rat would spend more time near
the lever and press the lever more frequently, getting food more frequently. Eventually it would
spend most of its time at the lever and eating its fill of food. The rat had "discovered" that the
consequence of pressing the level was to receive food. Skinner called the changes in the rat's
behavior an example of operant conditioning, and gave special names to the different parts of
the process. He called the food pellets the reinforcement and the lever-pressing the operant
(because it "operated" on the rat's environment).

Operant Conditioning and Students' Learning

Since the original research about operant conditioning used animals, it is important to ask
whether operant conditioning also describes learning in human beings, and especially in
students in classrooms. On this point the answer seems to be clearly "yes." There are countless
classroom examples of consequences affecting students' behavior in ways that resemble
operant conditioning, although the process certainly does not account for all forms of student
learning (Alberto & Troutman, 2005). Consider the following examples. In most of them the
operant behavior tends to become more frequent on repeated occasions:

     A kindergarten child raises her hand in response to the teacher's question about a story
         (the operant). The teacher calls on her and she makes her comment (the
         reinforcement).

     Another kindergarten child blurts out her comment without being called on (the
         operant). The teacher frowns, ignores this behavior, but before the teacher calls on a
         different student, classmates are listening attentively (the reinforcement) to the student
         even though he did not raise his hand as he should have.

     A child who is usually very restless sits for five minutes during a group time (the
         operant). The teacher compliments him for working hard (the reinforcement).11

The Behavioral Theory is most visible in an ECE classroom through modeling of expected
behavior, reinforcing pro-social behavior expected and through the daily routines and
schedules. (See Environments, Chapter 5 for further review of routines).13

Multiple Intelligence Theory

Howard Gardner, a researcher, has studied the mind and created a theory called, The Multiple
Intelligence Theory. The theory represents the idea that children are individuals with a variety
of strength in different intelligences and states that one's intelligence is not better than another
persons'. Teachers can use this theory to create a curriculum to respect the individual way in
which children process information and provide experiences that allow children to engage in all
the intelligences.

The intelligences include:
     Verbal-Linguistic - ability to use language well
     Logical-Mathematic - ability to reason
     Musical-Rhythmic - ability to create and understand music
     Visual-Spatial - ability to image and manipulate the arrangement of objects in the
         environment
     Bodily-Kinesthetic - sense of balance and coordination in use of one's body
     Interpersonal - ability to discern others thoughts and feelings and understand and
         interact effectively with others
     Intrapersonal - sensitivity to one's own thoughts and feelings
     Naturalist - sensitivity to subtle differences and patterns in the natural environment
     Existential (still under study) - sensitivity and capacity to tackle deep questions about
         human existence14

Additional Considerations: Learning Styles

Children are unique and learn at their own pace in their own way. One-size does not fit all and
learning styles and preference vary. In a group of children, a teacher can encounter children
who learn best through visual, auditory, or hands-on interactions. And sometimes a child may
learn best in a particular domain or area with one style, and with a different style in another
domain or area.

Tactile/kinesthetic

Implications for teachers include identifying the child's style of learning and creating a program
for learning that reflects the variety of learning styles present in a classroom. It's important to
offer learning experiences in all styles, which is referred to as multimodal.16

Interaction and Conversation as Curriculum

Interactions and conversations throughout the day model for young children the expected ways
of communicating with and being with members of the group or community. Through the ways
in which they interact and talk with young children and guide children's behavior, teachers
support children in learning the code of behavior and the language of the education and care
community. Children rely on family members and teachers to provide the experience of
expected patterns of behavior, interactions, and language. At home, children experience
interactions and language that are grounded in their family's culture. In the early care and
education setting, they encounter what might be a different expected pattern of behavior,
interaction, and language from what they experience at home.

The following vignette offers an opportunity to observe and listen to learning from the
children's point of view and to see what the teacher intentionally does to guide the children's
thinking.

                       Mr. Ravi and his group of preschool children enter the play yard on Monday
                       morning. As several children run to the sandbox, Vicente shouts with
                       dismay, "Oh, look! Somebody ruined our fort and messed up all the hiding
                       places we dug for our food! That was mean!" Mr. Ravi comes over quickly
                       to join them. He surveys the logs and boulders strewn around in the sand
                       and notes the children's distress and sense of outrage.

                       Mr. Ravi responds sympathetically, "You all spent so much time working
                       together to build this last Friday. It does seem unfair that it has been
                       destroyed. Do you have ideas about what to do?"

                       Vicente suggests, "I know! We can make it over again and then you can
                       write a sign that says, `Keep Out. This is OUR fort.'" The other children
                       agree.

                       Mr. Ravi says, "It sounds like you have a plan to rebuild and protect your
                       project. I know that Marcos can write words and likes to make signs. Why
                       don't you ask him if he would be willing to make the sign you need?" The
                       children agree with this idea, and Mr. Ravi accompanies them to talk to
                       Marcos, who sits alone on the stairs. "This is going to take a lot of
                       teamwork," comments Mr. Ravi.

                       "Yeah, but we're getting really good at teamwork," responds Vicente
                       confidently.17

This experience illustrates what is referred to in the California Preschool Curriculum Framework
as a teachable moment. It was not planned, and the teacher had no way of knowing that it was
going to occur. It was a spontaneous encounter, but when planning at an earlier time, the
teacher had wondered whether one like it would occur and had considered how he would
respond in such a moment. Having in mind how to respond to various situations, especially
moments of conflict or misunderstanding, emerges from the reflective curriculum planning that
early childhood teachers do. It also allows the teacher to think about how to include a child
who was not participating with other children and may not have had the social skills to join the
group on his own. Knowledge of group dynamics helped the teacher be aware of opportunities
to connect Marcos with his peers.

Here is another example of how a teacher is supporting learning. In this classroom, the children
speak four different languages.

              Vignette
              All the children are playing outdoors, and the teachers have set up a board
              with openings in different shapes (e.g., circle, square, triangle, rectangle).
              Jasmine, a child who speaks Farsi, is looking toward the board and appears
              interested. Mr. Li gestures to Jasmine to come closer and picks up a
              beanbag. He models for Jasmine how to throw the beanbag toward the
              board at the different openings. While he throws the beanbag with an
              underhand motion, he simultaneously says, "Look, Jasmine, I swing my arm
              and throw the beanbag." Mr. Li repeats the physical action several times
              while simultaneously describing his actions. He then encourages Jasmine to
              try it. When Jasmine picks up the beanbag, Mr. Li smiles and repeats,
              "Swing your arm and throw. That's the way to do it, Jasmine!"18

This type of reflective curriculum planning may not show up in daily or weekly posted written
plans. Through planning, teachers are able to anticipate interactions and conversations in which
they may help children think about how to solve a problem or resolve a dispute, or support
children in learning a new language. Early childhood curriculum includes principles and
approaches for how teachers can support young children in learning English, when their home
language is not English (CDE 2010a, 177-223.)

Early childhood curriculum also includes principles and approaches for intervening when
conflicts between children arise (CDE 2010a, 67-68.) Some of what teachers do to plan such
curriculum is written into the daily or weekly plans, but much of it occurs during teachable
moments, in which teachers already have in mind a clear plan for what to do, how to do it,
and when to do it. Even so, the moments that teachers apply their plans are not known to
them in advance. The principles and approaches addressed in the frameworks necessarily go
beyond a series of planned activities.

For Example:

              A teacher watches an infant who is on the verge of being able to crawl. The child
              focuses her gaze on a desired yet distant object and attempts to move toward it.
              In spite of her effort, she barely budges. The teacher watches the infant's
              expression of delight change to a frown and tears welling up in the baby's eyes.
              The teacher knows to move closer to the child and offer words of
              encouragement. The teacher's attentive presence, calm voice, and look of
              encouragement reassure the child, help her focus her attention, and prompt her
              to sustain her efforts. Feeling connected with the teacher and emotionally secure,
              the child is ready to try again, moves forward on all fours, and looks at the
              teacher with an expression of glee and surprise.19

These examples illustrate how teachers support children in negotiating projects, in building
language skills, or in trying a challenging physical movement. Such examples are integral to
daily life in an early childhood education and care setting. Teachers keep in mind concepts and
skills described in the foundations and apply strategies and approaches presented in the
frameworks, as they engage in interactions and conversations that occur within unplanned yet
curriculum-rich teachable moments. In the two preceding examples the teachers supported
children's learning in an intentional way, yet their responses and strategies were not spelled
out ahead of time in their written plans. Nevertheless, the teachers know that such interactions
and conversations are important components of the curriculum in early childhood settings.20

Incorporating 21st Century Technology in the Early
Childhood Education

The rapid development of technological devices such as computers, smart- phones, tablets, and
gaming systems has dramatically changed people's daily lives at home and at work. New
technologies and electronic media provide tools for communication and social-networking, for
searching and documenting information, and for learning and entertainment. Young children
are growing up surrounded by technology and electronic media. At least two-thirds of homes
with children (birth to age six) have computers and Internet access (Gutnick et al. 2010; Roberts
and Foehr 2008). Moreover, according to a national survey by Common Sense Media in 2011,
52 percent of young children (birth to age eight) have access to smartphones or tablets
(Rideout 2011). Young children are active media users (Roberts and Foehr 2008). They
acclimate with ease to digital devices and show confidence in using software (Clements and
Sarama 2008). With the prevalence of technology and electronic media in their environment,
young children are spending an increasing number of hours in front of screen technologies,
particularly television, but also computers and other devices, with an average of 2.2 hours per
day of screen time for children between the ages of two and five (Roberts and Foehr 2008).

Children from low-income families, families with less education, and black, Hispanic, and rural
families are less likely to have access to the newest technologies and to broadband connections
to the Internet (U.S. Department of Commerce 2011). Inequality in access to technology has
narrowed over the years, but the "digital divide" still exists (Roberts and Foehr 2008).

The pervasiveness of electronic media in the lives of many young children makes educators,
parents, and advocates question the value of technology in children's development. Some
electronic media such as certain television programs, videos, and DVDs are non-interactive and
involve passive viewing. Other forms of electronic media such as software programs, appli-
cations, the Internet, e-books, and certain television programs facilitate active and creative use
by young children. These latter forms are referred to as interactive media (NAEYC and FRC
2012). There is limited research on the impact of newer technology, such as computer

software, handheld devices, interactive applications for mobile devices, and wireless technolo-
gy, on children's development. Most of the research on the impact of media on young children
has focused on television and video. Studies of infants and toddlers suggest that videos have no
language benefits for infant and toddlers.

Young children learn much better from real-life experiences than from watching videos.
Moreover, excessive exposure to electronic media may have a negative effect on attention
development, particularly for children younger than two (Kirkorian, Wartella, and Anderson
2008). Research indicates that the impact of electronic media on older children depends on the
age of children, the context in which they use media, the content of the media, and the amount
of time they spend with screens (Kirkorian, Wartella, and Anderson 2008; Campaign for
Commercial-Free Childhood, Alliance for Childhood, and Teachers Resisting Unhealthy
Children's Entertainment 2012).

By age three, children can benefit from well-designed, age-appropriate electronic media,
especially when a caring adult views the program with the child and is actively involved in the
child's experience Research emphasizes the importance of developmentally appropriate
content being offered to children, whether on television or other interactive media software.
Educational television programs that were designed around a curriculum with a specific goal to
communicate academic or social skills were linked to various cognitive and academic
enhancements, with potentially long-lasting effects (Fisch 2004). For example, research
demonstrates a positive association between early exposure to Sesame Street television
episodes and school readiness (Zill 2001). However, television and videos with entertainment
content, particularly violent content, were associated with poor cognitive development and
lower academic achievement (Kirkorian, Wartella, and Anderson 2008).

Studies of preschool children's computer play demonstrated that young children can use
computers and software to support their learning. Children can understand, think about, and
learn from their computer activity (Clements and Sarama 2008). Research has shown that in
children's computer play with interactive media software there is a period of discovery, which is
then followed by involvement, self-confidence, and creativity (Bergen 2008). Computer-play
software can offer children various possibilities, including practice (self-directed repetition to
achieve mastery), pretense (symbolic play in a "pretend to be" world), and games (challenge
and competition, either with a peer, with oneself, or with an imaginary opponent) (Kafai 2006).

There is limited research on how educational computer software may enhance preschool
children's academic-readiness skills. Some research suggests that software with an educational
curriculum may have a positive influence on learning (Din and Calao 2001). Overall, studies
indicate that, when used appropriately, technology and media can enhance children's cognitive
and social abilities (Kirkorian, Wartella, and Anderson 2008). Even so, additional research is
needed to confirm the positive outcome of technology on children's language and vocabulary,

25 | I n t r o d u c t i o n t o C u r r i c u l u m f o r E a r l y C h i l d h o o d E d u c a t i o n
understanding of math concepts, self- regulation, and social-skills development (NAEYC and FRC
2012).21

Technology and Interactive Media in the Preschool Environment

Technology has many uses in early childhood settings. On any given day, teachers may use
technology to support children's learning, to record and document children's development, to
expand their own knowledge in different areas, to maintain ongoing communication with
families, and to link homes with school. The focus in this chapter is on the use of technology
and interactive media in pre school settings for the purpose of supporting and enhancing
children's learning.

A growing number of early childhood educators use technology and interactive media in their
programs as tools to support children's learning and development (Wartella et al. 2010). In a
recent survey by the Fred Rogers Center (Wartella et al. 2010) about technology in the lives of
teachers and classrooms, nearly 60 percent of early childhood teachers reported having a
computer, and 45 percent have computers with Internet access in their classrooms. More than
half of the early childhood teachers indicated that children should be introduced to technology
in the classroom between ages three and four, and about one-third of the teachers reported
using computers with children on a daily basis (Wartella et al. 2010). With the increasing
interest and use of technology in preschool settings, early childhood educators need guidance
on how to use technology and interactive media wisely and effectively. Several important ques-
tions come to mind:

     Which technology and media tools are effective tools for learning?
     In which domains of development can the use of technology be most effective?
     How do early childhood educators appropriately integrate technology and media into

         preschool settings?
     How can technology be used to support children's learning?

   Figure 1.7: How programs will include technology in their curriculum is something that should be thoughtfully
                                                               considered.22

A joint position statement issued in 2012 by the National Association for Education of Young
Children (NAEYC) and the Fred Rogers Center (FRC) offers guidance. Based on research, the
statement addresses both the opportunities and the challenges related to using technology and
interactive media in early childhood programs. The following section presents key messages
from the NAEYC/FRC position statement on technology. A set of strategies consistent with the
approach articulated in the position statement is provided to guide administrators and teachers
in integrating technology and interactive media into preschool programs.23

The Benefits and the Challenges of Using Technology and Interactive
Media

Technology and interactive media have the potential to make many contributions to early
childhood education. Technology can provide children with additional ways to explore, create,
communicate, problem-solve, investigate, and learn. Computer technology, for example, offers
young children a range of learning opportunities--from solving math problems to listening to
interactive stories, taking a photo, recording a story, creating a digital book, making music, and
engaging in other age-appropriate learning activities (Blagojevic et al. 2010). Many educational
applications for young children are designed to help children develop skills and knowledge in
specific domains, particularly in areas such as language, literacy, and mathematics (Buckleitner
2011). Such programs can provide individualized learning opportunities for children. In
mathematics, computer programs present children with tasks, give feedback, and help young
children develop concepts and skills in areas such as counting, number relationships and
operations, sorting and patterning, measurement, and geometry (Clements and Sarama 2008;
McCarthy, Li, and Tiu 2012). In language and literacy, computer software can enhance
vocabulary learning (Segers and Vermeer 2008) and support learning of listening, speaking,
writing, and reading skills (Guernsey et al. 2012). Dual language learners can also use
computers to enhance their home language and acquire English (Blagojevic et al. 2010; Nemeth
2009).

The use of technology can also enrich the science curriculum. Cameras and recording devices
provide valuable educational experiences by allowing children to take photos and videos to
document objects and events and track changes in objects and materials. Digital microscopes
allow children to save images of objects they explore and to share and discuss such images with
their peers. Robotics with manipulative motors and gears engage young children in designing
their own robotic creations, providing them with opportunities both to be creative engineers
and to explore abstract mathematical and science concepts in concrete ways (Bers 2008).

The use of technology in preschool settings also creates opportunities for equitable access to
technology tools and interactive media experiences for children from different economic
backgrounds, including children in families with few resources and little or no access to the
latest technologies (NAEYC and FRC 2012). Furthermore, technology has many potential

benefits in supporting inclusive practices for children with disabilities or other special needs
(Mulligan 2003).

A variety of assistive and adaptive technologies (e.g., electronic communication boards, switch-
activated toys, recordable devices) enhance children's participation and learning with peers.
For example, a child who enjoys playing with bubbles can operate an electronic bubble-blower
for other children to chase (Mistrett 2004). Another child can let a peer know which game she
wants to play by indicating it on the electronic tablet that has photos taken by her teacher. By
using assistive technology, early childhood educators can help children with disabilities or other
special needs become more independent. Children with special needs can use technologies to
support their ability to communicate and interact with others, move throughout the
environment, manipulate objects, and participate in daily routines and educational activities.

    Figure 1.8: Technology can help children with disabilities participate in the environment and communicate.24

Overall, effective uses of technology and interactive media can enhance and augment children's
learning in different domains, extending children's access to new content. However, technology
is effective only when used appropriately. Although the use of technology and interactive me-
dia provides programs with opportunities to enhance quality and optimize young children's
development, early childhood educators should understand the limits of technology and be
aware of the challenges of using technology and interactive media in the preschool
environment. As stated in the NAEYC/FRC position statement, "Technology and interactive
media are tools that can promote effective learning and development when they are used in-
tentionally by early childhood educators, within the framework of developmentally appropriate
practice, to support learning goals established for individual children" (NAEYC and FRC 2012, 5).

Technology and interactive media should only supplement, not replace, existing play-based
materials and active play, engagement with other children, and face-to-face interactions with
adults. Several professional and public health organizations have raised concerns about
whether young children should have access to technology and screen media in early childhood
programs (e.g., Campaign for a Commercial-Free Childhood, Alliance for Childhood, and
Teachers Resisting Unhealthy Children's Entertainment 2012). The American Academy of

Pediatrics recommends avoiding any media other than video-chatting until 18 months, limiting
2 to 5-year-olds to one hour per day of high quality programming, and for ages 6 and older,
placing consistent limits on time and types of media. These recommendations are focused on
preventing media use from displacing physical activity, hands on exploration, and face-to-face
social interaction in the real world, which are critical to learning.

This chapter follows the recommendations of the NAEYC and the Fred Rogers Center (2012) and
is aligned with the public health community in discouraging the use of screen media for
children under the age of 24 months in early childhood programs. Such guidance for educators
working with infants and toddlers may change in the future as more research on very young
children's active use of interactive media and its effect on children's learning and development
continues to emerge (e.g., Zack et al. 2013).

Monitoring the content of interactive media is as important as setting limits on the time young
children spend with technology. Although there are valuable software, websites, and other
forms of interactive media for young children, some have limited educational value or may
include content that is not safe or appropriate for children. The challenge for early childhood
educators is "to make informed choices that maximize learning opportunities for children while
managing screen time and mediating the potential for misuse and overuse of screen media"
(NAEYC and FRC 2012, 3). Educators should have the knowledge, skills, and experience nec-
essary to select and use technology tools and interactive media that suit the age and
developmental level of children and can be integrated effectively in the environment (NAEYC
and FRC 2012).

The following guidelines identify key considerations for programs and teachers selecting,
evaluating, integrating, and using technology in preschool programs.25

Selecting Technology and Interactive Media to Enhance Children's
Learning

The rapid development of technology platforms, including computers, laptops, multitouch
tablets, and other handheld devices, and the growing selection of available educational
applications, Web sites, and software present educators with many choices for integrating
technology into the preschool environment. However, technology and media-based products
may vary widely in quality. Intentionality is important. Thoughtful, advance planning is essential
for a responsible investment in technology in early childhood settings. Early childhood
educators should apply their expertise and knowledge of child development in selecting
appropriate technology and media for the classroom in the same way that they select any other
instructional materials (NAEYC and FRC 2012). Educators should take the time to evaluate and
select technology, to observe children's use of the materials, and to make appropriate

adoptions based on their observations. The Fred Rogers Center (2012) proposed a framework
for quality in digital media (FRC 2012), recommending that educators take into account the
child, the content, and the context in the selection of digital media for young children.

    · Consider children's developmental level, interests, abilities, and cultural and linguistic
         backgrounds. Teachers must be intentional in selecting the technology and interactive
         media they offer children in their classroom. In selecting appropriate technology and
         interactive media, educators make decisions that are informed by developmentally
         appropriate teaching practices, which means that early childhood educators consider
         the age, developmental level, needs, interests, linguistic backgrounds, and abilities of
         individual children in the group (NAEYC and FRC 2012).

    · Ensure equitable access to technology and interactive media experiences. In selecting
         technology and interactive media, educators provide opportunities for all children to
         participate and have access to these learning tools. Educators should consider the
         cultural and linguistic backgrounds of the children in their classrooms. Technology
         resources can provide access to children's home language and culture, especially when
         there are no other ways to obtain such information (NAEYC and FRC 2012). For example,
         children can listen to electronic books in their home language, record songs and stories,
         and create digital stories in their home language and English (Blagojevic et al. 2010).
         Educators can collaborate with family members and colleagues who speak children's
         home language to gain access to appropriate interactive media in children's home
         language.

Materials and equipment selected for children with disabilities or other special needs should be
evaluated. Adaptive and assistive technologies are available to support individual children in
their classrooms. Programs should consider the level of technology necessary and the child's
individual needs to ensure that the technology is best suited to the child's unique disabilities
and to the demands of the environment (Mulligan 2003). Not all assistive devices are
necessarily "high tech" or custom designed for a particular child. In fact, the Individuals with
Disabilities Education Act defines an assistive technology device as any item, piece of
equipment, or product system, whether acquired commercially off the shelf, modified, or
customized, that is used to increase, maintain, or improve functional capabilities of a child with
a disability (Mistrett 2004).

    · Identify the underlying objectives of the technology. Most electronic media targeted at
         preschoolers are intended to entertain rather than to teach. Technology in the
         preschool environment should be used only for educational activities. In evaluating any
         software programs, applications, or other forms of interactive media, educators should
         be able to identify the overall goals or purpose of the product: Is it to educate or to
         entertain? Is it interactive? Is it to develop particular skills, to introduce children to new
         information, or maybe a combination of these (FRC 2012; Campaign for Commercial-
         Free Childhood, Alliance for Childhood, and Teachers Resisting Unhealthy Children's
         Entertainment 2012)? Understanding the intent of a digital program and the learning
         goals for different children in the program should guide educators' intentional decisions
         in selecting materials of interactive media (FRC 2012).

30 | I n t r o d u c t i o n t o C u r r i c u l u m f o r E a r l y C h i l d h o o d E d u c a t i o n
    · Evaluate the quality of the content. First and foremost, educators should evaluate the
         quality of the content to ensure that the use of such materials would not harm young
         children's overall development or well-being in any way (NAEYC and FRC 2012; FRC
         2012). Interactive media products can be used as tools to fulfill the needs of individual
         children and to expand children's access to new content in areas of interest to them. In
         the selection process, program administrators and teachers should have information
         and resources regarding the nature of these tools and the implications for use with
         children. Program administrators and teachers should also have hands-on opportunities
         to explore and directly experience the technology that is being considered for use with
         children. Educators can apply their expertise and knowledge of child development to
         ensure that digital materials are developmentally and culturally appropriate for the
         children in the group. They should examine the educational content, format, and
         features and carefully consider any implicit messages communicated during the use of
         the software/application. Some undesirable messages (e.g., stereotypes, negative
         images or actions) may be biased and fail to promote social and emotional under-
         standing in the early years (Tsantis, Bewick, and Thouvenelle 2003).

    · Select technology and interactive media that support children's creativity, exploration,
         and problem solving. In selecting activities with technology and interactive media, early
         educators should ask themselves: Does it encourage children to explore, to think, to
         experiment and predict, to be creative, and to problem solve? Does it offer a range of
         experiences and a high level of interactivity? Is it open-ended or focused on skills?
         Experiences with technology and other media that engage children in redundant
         practice and rote learning or involve passive use by children are not desirable. Effective
         technology and media empower children by giving them control, offering challenges
         through "leveled" experiences, and providing them with feedback and adaptive
         scaffolds (Clements and Sarama 2008).

    · Use the best available evidence in the selection process. More research is needed to
         understand what young children are able to do with different digital devices and to
         assess the short- and long-term effects of new technologies on children's learning.
         Educators are encouraged to make their decisions about the quality of interactive media
         products based on the best available evidence for any given product (FRC 2012).26

Integrating and Using Technology in the Preschool Environment

Once the desired software or appropriate technology devices for the program are selected,
educators should apply their expertise and knowledge of child development to make thoughtful
decisions on how to introduce and integrate the selected forms of technology into the learning
environment. The teacher's role is critical in ensuring that technology is implemented in ways
that serve the teaching goals and support children's learning appropriately and effectively.

    · Technology and interactive media are used within the framework of developmentally
         appropriate practice. Developmentally appropriate practice encourages hands-on
         exploration; empowers children to reflect, question, and create; and honors the value of

         relationships between children and the adults in their lives (NAEYC 2009). Professional
         knowledge of developmentally appropriate practice informs and guides decision making
         about how to introduce and integrate any form of technology and interactive media into
         early childhood programs. Technology and media should not replace preschool activities
         such as real-life exploration, physical activity, social interactions, outdoor and indoor
         play, and arts. Instead, they should be used as additional tools to encourage children's
         problem solving, exploration, and creativity. They can also support children's rela-
         tionships with both adults and their peers and foster children's autonomy (NAEYC and
         FRC 2012; Donohue and Schomburg 2012; Nemeth and Simon 2012), particularly for
         some children with disabilities (Mistrett 2004).
    · Technology and interactive media are integrated into the environment, curriculum,
         and daily routines (NAEYC and FRC 2012). True integration of technology and media
         into the preschool environment involves the use of different technology resources
         throughout the classroom. No period is set aside in the daily schedule for "computer
         time," when technology and media are used as isolated activities. Technology and
         interactive media are woven into the fabric of the day and are used as tools for learning,
         rather than as the focus or the goal of a learning activity. Technology is one of many
         ways to support curriculum goals and needs, and the program offers a balance of
         activities to support children's development in all domains of learning. In using a
         particular application or software, teachers should consider how it supports objectives
         for individual children in the group, how it fits into the classroom's current curriculum
         project or theme of study, and how it extends other activities in ways not possible
         otherwise (Nemeth and Simon 2012).
    · Time spent with technology and media is limited. Setting limits on the time young
         children spend with technology and interactive media is important. As previously
         indicated, the public health community discourages the use of passive screen media for
         children under two years of age and recommends limited screen time daily for children
         older than two (American Academy of Pediatrics 2011). Some of the public health
         concern is that the overuse of media takes time away from other activities that involve
         physical exercise. Sedentary activities are potentially a risk factor for childhood obesity
         (Wartella and Heintz 2007). The position statement by the NAEYC/FRC points to the
         following recommendation in the Early Childhood Obesity Prevention Policies: "child
         care [and preschool] settings limit screen time to fewer than 30 minutes per day for
         children in half day programs or less than one hour per day for those in full day
         programs (Birch, Parker, and Burns 2011)." Teachers play a critical role in establishing
         clear boundaries on the use of technology and screen time in the preschool setting.
         They are also encouraged to share information with families on how to promote
         children's healthy use of technology at home (Campaign for a Commercial-Free
         Childhood, Alliance for Childhood, and Teachers Resisting Unhealthy Children's
         Entertainment 2012).
    · The use of technology and interactive media facilitates social interactions and
         relationship building. Effective use of technology and interactive media in the
         classroom environment allows joint engagement, specifically viewing and participation
         by both children and adults and children and their peers (NAEYC and FRC 2012). Studies

32 | I n t r o d u c t i o n t o C u r r i c u l u m f o r E a r l y C h i l d h o o d E d u c a t i o n
         on the social dimension of preschool children's computer play found that preschoolers
         observe each other while playing, comment on others' actions, share and help with
         software-related problems, and have conflicts over turn-taking (Heft and Swaminathan
         2002). The computer and other digital devices should be located in spaces that allow for
         joint engagement of a group of children. Some children may select technology such as
         the computer because it is familiar or even as a way of avoiding interaction. Careful
         observation is needed to monitor the use of technology and determine individual appro-
         priate use. Effective use of technology and interactive media can promote
         communication and collaboration among children (Wright 1994). It often provides the
         context for information sharing, language development, and collaborative decision
         making (Tsantis, Bewick, and Thouvenelle 2003). Tech-savvy children may also become
         computer mentors for their peers (Blagojevic et al. 2010).

                       Figure 1.9: This teacher is monitoring children using the computer together.27

    · Teachers provide support while children use technology and interactive media. As
         with any learning activities, teachers play an important role in facilitating children's
         involvement with technology and media. The teachers introduce children to the
         computer or another device (e.g., digital camera, printer, touch-screen), and explain
         how it works. They observe what individual children do and learn about children's ability
         to use technology. Children vary in the ability to use technology and interactive media.
         Teachers also give children time to freely explore new technology tools, model
         appropriate use of technology, and help children become familiar with any new
         software activity. They establish rules and routines with children to guide appropriate
         handling and use of computer and other technological devices (Blagojevic et al. 2010;
         Campaign for a Commercial-Free Childhood, Alliance for Childhood, and Teachers
         Resisting Unhealthy Children's Entertainment 2012). During technology-related
         activities, teachers carefully observe and document what children do and assess
         children's learning. Teachers identify problems or opportunities for teachable moments,
         extending the media experience to other learning opportunities, and facilitating the
         experience through language-rich interactions. In addition, teachers determine when

         the child is ready to progress to the next level of knowledge or skill development (FRC
         2012). They consider children's varying abilities to control and operate technology and
         media and support children's "technology-handling" skills, as needed. Teachers make
         appropriate adaptations, based on their observations, to promote positive outcomes for
         individual children.28

Children are born observers and are active participants in their own learning and understanding
of the world around them from the very beginning of their existence. Today's children are
active participants in their own learning, not just recipients of a teacher's knowledge.
Developmentally Appropriate Practice (DAP), as outlined by NAEYC (National Association for
the Education of Young Children), challenges early childhood professionals to be intentional in
their interactions and environments to create optimal experiences to maximize children's
growth and development. Under this umbrella of DAP, knowledge is based upon discovery and
discovery occurs through active learning and abundant opportunities for exploration! Through
a "hands-on" approach and using play as a vehicle, children will develop skills in domains
necessary for positive growth and development.

Why Play?

Play:
     Inspires imagination
     Facilitates creativity
     Fosters problem solving
     Promotes development of new skills
     Builds confidence and higher levels of self-esteem
     Allows free exploration of the environment
     Fosters learning through hands-on and sensory exploration

It is now understood that moments often discounted as "just play" or as "fiddling around" are
actually moments in which children are actively learning (Hirsh-Pasek et al. 2009; Jones and
Reynolds 2011; Zigler, Singer, and Bishop-Josef 2004; Elkind 2007.) While engaged in play,
children explore the physical properties of materials and the possibilities for action,
transformation, or representation. Children try out a variety of ways to act on objects and
materials and, in so doing, experiment with and build concepts and ideas. This active
engagement with the world of people and objects starts from the moment of birth.

This description of the young child as an active participant in learning informs the role of the
teacher who works with young children birth to five. Early childhood teaching and learning
begins with teachers watching and listening to discover how infants and young children actively
engage in making sense of their everyday encounters with people and objects. When teachers
observe and listen with care, infants and young children reveal clues about their thinking, their
feelings, or their intentions. Children's actions, gestures, and words illuminate what they are
trying to figure out or how they attempt to make sense of the attributes, actions, and responses
of people and objects. Effective early childhood teaching requires teachers to recognize how
infants and young children actively search for meaning, making sense of ideas and feelings.

        Figure 2.2: This teacher has an opportunity to discover how this child is understanding her experience.2

When teaching is viewed in this light, children become active participants alongside teachers in
negotiating the course of the curriculum. Families who entrust their children to the care and
guidance of early childhood teachers also become active participants in this process. Shared
participation by everyone in the work of creating lively encounters with learning allows a
dynamic exchange of information and ideas--from child to adult, from adult to child, from adult
to adult, and from child to child. The perspective of each (child, family, teacher) informs the
other, and each learns from the other. Each relationship (child with family, child with teacher,
child with child, and family with teacher) is reciprocal, with each participant giving and receiving
from the other, and each adding to the other's learning and understanding.3

                                          Figure 2.3: Each perspective informs the other.4

The Educators' Guide to the Framework For School Age Care In Australia discusses the benefits
of play:

         Play is a valued process, not only for enjoyment and leisure, but also for learning.
         Through play, children develop a sense of identity and an understanding of their social

and cultural worlds. Children use play to explore and understand cultures, communities
and friendships. We gain a lot through playing, not just as children, but also as adults.

Recent brain research has heralded the benefits of a stimulating play-based
environment in encouraging the brain to grow and develop (Diamond 1988). Low stress
levels and high engagement combine to nourish neural development. Research by
Vandell and others (2005) demonstrates how school-aged care environments achieve
this through the combination of high intrinsic motivation and challenge, effort and
enjoyment. Lester and Russell (2009) identified the flexibility and plasticity of the brain,
which develops through play and increases potential for learning later in life.

The intellectual and cognitive benefits of playing have been well documented. Children
who engage in quality play experiences are more likely to:

    · Have well developed memory skills and language development,
    · Have the ability to regulate their behavior, leading to enhanced adjustment to

         school and academic learning.

Play also provides children with an opportunity to just `be'.5

Pause to Reflect
What does it mean to just be? Consider a time either as a child or an adult,
where you had an opportunity to just be. What facilitated the opportunity?
What feelings did you experience? What might this mean for young children?

Educators observe stages of play experiences children navigate in their programs. Educators
use these observations of children to plan for environments, set individual objectives and
create appropriate curricular experiences.

In addition to the stages of play described by Piaget, there are also a variety of types of play
children use when interacting within our ECE Programs.

Types of Play

Mildred Parten (1932) observed two to five year-old children and noted six types of play. Three
types she labeled as non-social (unoccupied, solitary, and onlooker) and three types were
categorized as social play (parallel, associative, and cooperative). The table below describes
each type of play. Younger children engage in non-social play more than those older; by age five
associative and cooperative play are the most common forms of play (Dyer & Moneta, 2006). 11

                 Children's behavior seems more random and without a specific goal. This

Solitary Play    Children play by themselves, do not interact with others, nor are they
                 engaging in similar activities as the children around them.

Onlooker Play
               Children are observing other children playing. They may comment on the
               activities and even make suggestions, but will not directly join the play.

Parallel Play  Children play alongside each other, using similar toys, but do not directly
               interact with each other.

Associative Play Children will interact with each other and share toys, but are not working
                       toward a common goal.

Cooperative    Children are interacting to achieve a common goal. Children may take on
Play           different tasks to reach that goal.

The Role of Play in Children's Learning and Development

Consider the learning under way in the following excerpt volume 2 of the California Preschool
Curriculum Frame- work (CDE 2011b, 15).

Imagine four young children--eager and engaged in play amidst an assortment of wooden
blocks. They may appear to be "just playing"; however, upon closer inspection, this moment of
play reveals a web of ideas, theories, and hypotheses under construction, as well as an
energetic debate. We may observe that the children are negotiating how to connect the blocks
to make roads that will surround their carefully balanced block structure. The structure has
walls of equal height, which support a flat roof, from which rise 10 towers, built using
cardboard tubes. Resting on each tube is a shiny, recycled jar lid, each one a different color.
Two children are figuring out between themselves when to add or take away blocks in order to
make a row of towers that increases in height. As we listen and watch, we witness the children
building a foundation for addition and subtraction. To make each wall just high enough to
support a flat roof, they count aloud the number of blocks they are using to make each wall,
showing an emerging understanding of the math concept of cardinal numbers. When they hear
the signal that lunch is about to be served, one child finds a clipboard with pen and paper
attached, draws a rudimentary outline of the block structure on the paper, and then asks the
teacher to write, "Do not mess up. We are still working on our towers."

In this example, children show evidence of emerging concepts of social studies through their
construction of a small community from blocks; of physical science and mathematics as they
experiment with how to make objects balance; and of reading, writing, and drawing as they
request the teacher's help with making a sign to protect their work. They work together to
create their play and cooperate in carrying out agreed upon plans. Each is fully engaged and
manages his behavior to cooperate in a complex social situation. The concepts under
construction in the minds of these children and the skills they are learning and practicing closely

match several desired learning outcomes for children at this age. Anticipating the variety of
concepts and skills that would emerge during the play, the teachers stocked the
blocks/construction area with collections of blocks, props, and writing materials to support a
full range of possibilities.

Young children's ways of learning require an approach to curriculum that allows them to build
concepts and skills in integrated learning contexts. Such an approach supports children with
analyzing a problem to discover a possible solution, experimenting with and testing ideas,
exchanging ideas with others, thinking creatively and cooperating with others to reach a goal,
and focusing their attention and organizing their behavior as they play with others. These skills
and dispositions work together to give children a foundation that enhances development and
learning in all the domains.13

Preschool programs use numerous strategies to support children's play, such as planning the
learning environment, providing engaging and appropriately challenging materials, and being
responsive to children's interest in engaging in play.

Through observations of children's play, teachers can deepen their appreciation of the value of
play in early learning. For example, imaginary play is an important means of exploring ideas and
social behavior and roles among preschool-age children. While older infants and toddlers
engage in solitary imaginary play, such as feeding a stuffed animal or making a roaring sound
while pushing a toy truck across the carpet, preschoolers engage with one or more peers in the
more complex and elaborate form of imaginary play called "sociodramatic" play. In this type of
play, children cooperate with one another to create a story and "script," assume various roles,
figure out appropriate "costumes" and "props," and negotiate new ideas for play, such as, "I
want to be a wolf, not a dog!"

Because imaginary play holds such rich potential for promoting children's cognitive, linguistic,
social, and physical development, high-quality preschool programs recognize play as a key
element of the curriculum. Children's spontaneous play is a window into their ideas and feel-
ings about the world. As such, it is a rich source of ideas for curriculum planning (Lockett 2004).
For example, if a teacher observes a group of children repeatedly engaging in imaginary play
about illness or hospitalization, she or he might decide to convert the playhouse area into a
veterinary clinic for a week or two. The teacher might also read children stories involving
doctors, hospitals, getting sick, and getting well. The teacher's observations of children's
resulting conversations and activities would suggest ways to deepen or extend the curriculum
further. In thinking of ways to extend the curriculum, it will be important that teachers ensure
that the materials used and themes built upon are culturally familiar to the children and value
children's cultural heritage.

While involved in play, children are challenged to meet the language, problem- solving, and
social competencies of their peers. When play is interesting and important to children, they are

eager to learn the new vocabulary, new physical skills, and new social behaviors that will allow
them to stay engaged in play (Jones and Reynolds 2011). Many three-year-olds, for example,
have not yet mastered socially appropriate ways to enter other children's play. Coaching by a
sensitive, observant teacher on appropriate language for asking to join play can help a child
overcome this hurdle, thereby opening a new area for learning.

When teachers regularly observe and document brief, subtle moments of children's learning
through play, those records can help parents and others understand how useful and important
play is in helping children to learn and grow. For example, a teacher might report a child's
language and social development to the parent of a three-year-old: "I watched Sarah standing
outside the playhouse area today. Instead of just watching the other children or wandering
through their play without getting involved as she often does, she brought the children a book
to read to the `baby' in the family. They asked her if she wanted to be the big sister, and she
said yes and joined right in. I have been thinking about ways to help her learn how to use her
language to get involved in play with other children, but she figured out her own, creative way
to join them."

During the preschool years, children grow markedly in their knowledge and skills in all areas of
development. The dramatic increase in their emotional, social, cognitive, and language knowl-
edge and skills occurs hand in hand with development of key areas of the brain, particularly the
prefrontal cortex and its connections with the limbic system. Preschool-age children are
naturally curious and driven to learn about the way the world works and often develop and test
hypotheses through observation and experimentation. Children's learning and development in
all domains progresses well when they are provided with appropriately challenging
opportunities for play and exploration, with the support of skilled teachers who scaffold
learning experiences.14

Role of the Teacher: Being Intentional with Children

Teachers play a pivotal role in children's active construction of knowledge. They intentionally
provide the environments and experiences that support children in actively building concepts
and skills. The role of the teacher who works with young children birth to age five is to support
children's active construction of knowledge. In a sense, early childhood teachers serve as
research supports as the children sense, discover, and construct meaning about the world
around them. Young children's natural impulse to learn by investigating (1) what things are like
and what they can make them do, and (2) how people create and share meaning shapes the
role of the early childhood teacher. The early childhood teacher is responsible for: offering
children well-stocked play spaces where they can construct concepts and ideas, preferably in
the company of friendly peers; designing daily routines that invite children to be active
participants and to use emerging skills and concepts; supporting children's learning through

interactions and conversations that prompt using language and ideas in new ways and that
promote sharing meaning with others.

In carrying out those responsibilities, teachers create contexts in which young children can:
     Wonder about what things are like and what they do
     Investigate a variety of ways of relating one thing to another
     Invent problems and solutions with others; construct, transform, and represent with the
         materials at hand
     Create and share meaning, and collaborate in learning
     Try new challenges and practice emerging skills
     Express their emotions, feel secure to explore, and regulate their emotions and behavior
     Manage conflicts in ways that support the development of social skills
             o Advocating for one's own needs, safety, and feelings
             o Learning how to connect with their peers in mutually beneficial ways
             o Learning how to walk away or disengage from their peers when they feel the
                  need to
             o Learning how to cope with feelings of rejection or exclusion. And in turn,
                  learning how to seek out positive relationships, rather than dwelling on
                  unsatisfying ones.

Early childhood teachers see and support children as scientists and thus design the play
environment to serve the children's inquisitive minds. Teachers also provide the materials
children need to construct concepts and ideas and master skills in the natural context of play.
Children learn from opportunities to discover materials that they may be seeing for the first
time and need time to explore and get to know the properties of these materials. It means
offering children materials that they can organize into relationships of size, shape, number, or
function and time. Children can investigate what happens when they put these materials
together or arrange them in new ways, experiencing the delight of discovering possibilities for
building with them, transforming them, or using them to represent an experience.

Early childhood teachers also design the daily routines as rich opportunities for children to
participate actively and to use their emerging skills and ideas in meaningful situations. Equally
important are the ways in which teachers use interactions and conversations with children to
support learning. Many interactions occur spontaneously, with the teacher being responsive to
an interest or need that a child expresses. Many other interactions focus on co-creating or co-
constructing meaning as the teacher and a child or small group of children focus on a specific
topic or activity.

Some interactions may include providing guidance to help children learn to regulate their
emotions and behavior or may involve an intervention in which the teacher helps children
explore how to negotiate a solution to a conflict.

43 | I n t r o d u c t i o n t o C u r r i c u l u m f o r E a r l y C h i l d h o o d E d u c a t i o n
Other interactions and conversations teachers have with children are more predictable.
Teachers anticipate and organize some interactions and conversations as group discussions, in
order to prompt children's thinking and understanding. Sometimes these groups are small, and
sometimes, at preschool age, they are somewhat larger. Teachers also guide some activities in a
context that allows children to encounter new information and build skills. All interactions are
embedded in contexts in which the children are actively engaged in exploring their own
developing skills, learning from each other, and acquiring knowledge.15
While play occurs naturally, teachers must consider the following responsibilities when
facilitating appropriate and purposeful play:

Spaces (See further detail in Chapter 5)
     are safe places to explore
     reflect the mission and core values of the program
     include culturally sensitive materials to explore
     include open-ended materials for multi-use

Routines
     Are consistent and predictable
     Provide ample time for unstructured play to occur (recommendation is 45 minutes
         minimum) If children aren't provided enough time to become immersed in play, they
         will be less likely to engage enough to receive the benefit of the activity.

Interactions
     Stimulate creativity by asking open-ended questions or reflective observations
     Respect individual differences in play and interactions
     Encourage Cooperation

The Educators' Guide to the Framework For School Age Care In Australia elaborates on
intentionality:

         To be `intentional' is to act purposefully, with a goal in mind and a plan for
         accomplishing it. Intentional acts arise from careful thought and in consideration of the
         potential effects. For example, when offering dress-ups, educators provide a wide
         selection. This is intentional in the following ways:

              Not having enough may be challenging to children who find sharing and waiting
                  difficult and could lead to unnecessary conflict over the limited resources.

              If only one or two children could dress up, it would limit opportunities to
                  stimulate rich group play.

              If the dress-ups were all the same, respect for diversity and choice are not
                  promoted.

              Providing variety allows children to mix and match and experiment through
                  varied role play.

              Providing variety encourages children to share, collaborate and negotiate.
              Providing educators who are able to interact with the children fosters skill

                  development in this area (through scaffolding).

         Intentionality is about educators being able to explain what they are doing and why they
         are doing it. . . Educators purposefully (and perhaps in collaboration with children)
         establish routines, set up the environment, select resources, and appoint educators to
         work with the children. This approach reflects the educator's understanding of the
         context, individual personalities and group dynamics.

         Educators who are deliberate and purposeful in what they do:
              Promote children's learning through worthwhile and challenging experiences
                  and interactions which foster high-level thinking
              Seize opportunities during experiences and conversations to extend children's
                  thinking and learning
              Model and demonstrate active listening skills
              Utilize varied communication strategies, such as open questions, explanations,
                  speculation and problem-solving
              Move flexibly in and out of various roles and draw on different strategies as the
                  context changes
              Draw on contemporary theories and research for their knowledge and practices
              Monitor children's wellbeing, life skills and citizenship, and use the information
                  to guide program planning
              Monitor children's needs and interests and incorporate them into program
                  planning
              Identify `teachable moments' as they arise and use them to scaffold children's
                  learning and development.

         As educators it is always good to reflect on your own childhood:
              What were your favorite play spaces as a child?
              What did you enjoy doing?
              How might you incorporate some of your childhood play ideas into your setting?
              What role did the adults play when you were a child?
              What are your beliefs about play?
              How do you think play might have changed over the past forty years?
              What impact do you think this might have on children and the adults of the
                  future?16

                   Pause to Reflect
                   "First Day!"

                   Shortly after completing my ECE degree, I had been hired as Preschool Teacher
                   for a New Corporate Sponsored Early Childhood Education Program. With
                   three weeks to prepare the environment and complete my training, before the
                   children were to start. I spent hours organizing (and reorganizing multiple
                   times) the materials, learning areas and extensively planning for our first day!

                   The Friday prior to the opening of the program was pretty standard, all of the
                   children's files were up to date, tours had occurred, environment was set and
                   the lesson plans were carefully examined and neatly posted. Everything was in
                   place-Perfection!

                   With joyful excitement and a little anxiety we welcomed 8 new children to our
                   program Monday morning. As the children trickled in, one by one, their eyes
                   focused on the newness of the environment. My preconceived ideas and
                   expectations were shattered as I stood and observed the children moving
                   quickly from one area to the next and touching everything in sight. I had
                   erroneously thought they would sit and play with puzzles, paint at the easel
                   that was so aesthetically set up or build with the blocks that were strategically
                   placed on the carpet.

                   Instead, the children avoided those areas and aimlessly walked around the
                   classroom, looked through the cubbies, examined each shelf loaded with
                   learning materials. One item captured their attention more than any other- a
                   water dispenser with little Dixie cups, placed at their level. Each child was
                   fascinated by the ability to press the button and see water come out.

                   Much of the day was spent tirelessly cleaning up the water and trying to
                   redirect the children to play with the toys that were out rather than the water
                   dispenser. At the end of the day, when the children left, the teachers sat and
                   reflected on what worked and what didn't work during the day. In unison, we
                   all said the water was an issue and we should remove it.

                   Then from across the room, our wise director intervened. He challenged us. It
                   appeared to him that we should focus on the children's interest in the
                   dispenser. It provided children a new sense of independence (they could
                   access their own water when they were thirsty), and they were practicing
                   important problem solving skills and the concept of cause and effect while at
                   the same time mastering the fine motor skills of pushing the button. The
                   children were learning and mastering their new environment through active
                   exploration and using play as a technique to acquire new knowledge about the

46 | I n t r o d u c t i o n t o C u r r i c u l u m f o r E a r l y C h i l d h o o d E d u c a t i o n
                   water dispenser. The children were most excited to come back the next day
                   and show their parents the water dispenser and how to operate it.

                   We changed our curriculum to additional activities to enhance this interest
                   such as using measuring cups to fill and dump water using our small water
                   table. After a week, their excitement for the dispenser dwindled and it became
                   routine and the children discovered the easel, the blocks and other materials
                   in their environment. I stop sometimes to recall this day and know that it
                   wasn't what I taught the children, but rather what the children taught me
                   about how they want to learn.

                   Reflect
                   Consider an experience when you witnessed a child exploring a toy, learning
                   material, or a play space. Was there anything about the observation that
                   surprised you? In which ways, could you consider intentionality in relationship
                   to the observation. What types of play or stage did you witness during the
                   observation?

Developmentally Appropriate Practice

According to the National Association for the Education of Young Children's Position Statement,
"The core of developmentally appropriate practice lies in...intentionality, in the knowledge that
practitioners consider when they are making decisions, and in their always aiming for goals that
are both challenging and achievable for children." In order to do this they must use
developmentally appropriate practice (DAP). DAP includes three areas of knowledge:

    1. Age-appropriateness - using what is known about child development and learning in
         general

    2. Individual-appropriateness - using what is known about each child as an individual to be
         responsive to each child

    3. Social- and cultural-appropriateness - using what is known about the social and cultural
         context in which children live17

Head Start has guiding principles that reflect developmentally appropriate practice by an
intentional teacher.

     Each child is unique and can succeed
     Learning occurs with the contexts of relationships.
     Families are children's first and most important caregivers, teachers, and advocates.
     Children learn best when they are emotionally and physically safe and secure.

Planning Happens in a Cycle

To begin to understand how to plan effective, developmentally appropriate curriculum for
children, we must look at the context in which that planning should happen. Planning
everything, from the flow of the day, to how teachers design and stock the classroom
environment, to the way the spontaneous (unplanned) experiences of children are recognized
and valued, to the experiences teachers thoughtfully plan and intentionally implement,
happens in a continuous cycle. As we will discuss in this chapter that cycle begins with
observing and continues through documenting what was observed, reflecting on what it means
and how to plan to best support children, and then implementing those plans, before returning
back to observing.1

Planning curriculum for young children begins with teachers discovering, through careful
listening and observation, each child's development. Observation is an essential skill for a
teacher. When teachers mindfully observe, they discover how individual children make
meaning in everyday moments of play and interactions and how to deepen their relationships
with children. Observing for the purpose of assessing individual children's learning means
carefully watching and listening, with thought and reflection. In doing so, teachers find the
knowledge, awareness, and strategies that individual children have formed during their
experiences. It may be evidence that pertains to individual children's emotional, social,
cognitive, or physical development. If the evidence is clear and significant, teachers can
preserve it through, for example, a note, a photo, or a sample of a child's work.

Consider this example in which teachers found various ways in which the children's
engagement in learning about snails related to the developmental profiles of different children:

         As the children's interest in the snails continued, the teachers looked for ways to expand
         learning opportunities and integrate them into the multifaceted experience. The
         teachers also reviewed individual children's developmental profiles to be mindful of
         children's developmental progress in different areas. In addition to the many counting
         opportunities in the environment, the teachers decided to integrate counting into the
         children's exploration of snails. Younger children who were making progress with
         learning to count objects between five and ten were invited to set up a specific number
         (less than ten) of trays and snails.

         Before the children started, the teachers reminded them of an earlier conversation about
         how to care for snails. In response, one of the children asked to show the others how to
         handle the snails gently. (Learning about counting was happening at the same time as
         learning about controlling the impulse to handle other creatures roughly instead of being
         gentle with them.) Teachers suggested to other children who were continuing to make
         progress with counting to count out a quantity of sticks, bark, or leaves greater than ten.
         Other children were asked to divide the snails evenly between the trays. The children
         kept saying to themselves, "Be gentle," and handled the snails with great care.

                                                    Figure 3.1: Handling the snail carefully.2

         As teachers observed each group, they helped children develop mathematical thinking
         by prompting them and asking questions. For example, at one table, a teacher noticed
         that children were counting some sticks twice. She said, "I wonder what would happen if
         we put each stick on the other side of the tray after counting it." The children tried out
         this idea. Teachers noted children's efforts and placed the notes, with the date recorded,
         into the children's individual portfolios to be used as evidence for later reference when
         considering developmental progress relating to number sense and impulse control.

As teachers observe children's play and interactions, they discover ways to support children's
learning. Ideas for the next steps in curriculum planning emerge as teachers reflect on how they

might extend or expand children's thinking, language, and interactions. Observation, reflection,
and documentation in the moment simultaneously launch an ongoing assessment of each
child's progress in learning as well as the curriculum planning cycle.3
Here is a visual representation of the Curriculum Planning Cycle

                                            Figure 3.2: The Curriculum Planning Cycle.4

Let's explore each part of the cycle.

Observe

Observation means being present with children and attentive as they play and interact with
others and the environment. This mindful kind of presence is different from participating in
children's play or directing their play. Whether for one minute or five, an attentive, mindful
presence means waiting to see what unfolds in order to gain a complete picture of children's
play. A teacher who observes children as a first step in supporting learning discovers small
scientists at work--experimenting, comparing, making assumptions, evaluating assumptions

through their actions. Over time, children build mastery of a wide range of concepts and skills.
The vignette about the snail exploration illustrates the role of the teacher as observer:

         During small-group time with the snails, the teacher noticed a child who had been
         reluctant to hold a snail. This child had a visual impairment. As the teacher gently placed
         a snail on this child's hand, two children watched and listened as the teacher
         commented, "He's sticking his head out now, and he's turned toward your fingers. Can
         you feel him crawling toward your fingers?" The other children who had been watching
         intently began to repeat the teacher's encouraging words, saying, "He's sticking his head
         out. He's going toward your fingers!"

         The teacher wrote down her observations and added an interpretive note that the
         children's behavior may be a growing sign of empathy as measured by the DRDP, and
         the other child's willingness to hold the snail, a growing sign of curiosity and initiative,
         also a DRDP measure.5

Observation Happens Through Lenses

It takes practice to become a good observer. An important aspect of being a good observer
involves becoming aware of what is noticed and how observations are interpreted. Children
may be influenced by many things. Culture, temperament, personal experiences, professional
knowledge, and even community values and messages in the media affect how teachers see
and experience children. These "lenses" through which teachers observe and interpret are at
work even though they may not always be conscious of them.6

The Importance of Accuracy

Observations about children should be factual and objective to be useful and meaningful.
Teachers should document only what they see and hear (the facts) and avoid using words that
communicate judgment about a child's feelings, intentions, and motivations; are ambiguous
and open to interpretation; or describe an opinion. One way teachers may think about their
own objectivity is to ask themselves: Am I describing this child's behaviors and interactions in
the same or a similar way that someone else observing this child would describe them?
Interpreting the meaning of children's behaviors and interactions is important, and impressions,
feelings, and insights about children are extremely valuable to the individualizing process.
However, teachers first need accurate, factual information in order to draw conclusions later on
about children's skills, behavior, interests, and needs.7

                   Pause to Reflect
                   Think about yourself as an observer. What do you think will come most easily
                   to you? What do you think will be more challenging?

Document

Documenting means gathering and holding evidence of children's play and interests for future
use. A common form of documentation in early childhood settings is a written note, often
referred to as an observation anecdote. Anecdotal notes, along with other forms of
documentation, in particular photos, video recordings, and work samples, serve a dual purpose.
First, they preserve a teacher's observations of children's expressions of feelings, their thinking,
and their learning. These documentations are guides to the next steps in day-to-day curriculum
planning. And second, anecdotal notes and other evidence can be used to support a teacher's
periodic assessment of a child's progress. An episode during the snail exploration highlights the
dual purpose of documentation:

                                                      Figure 3.3: Holding a snail.8

         During their initial encounters with the snails, the children asked questions and made
         comments about the snail shells, the way the snails moved across the tray, and what the
         snails ate. Although several children were reluctant to pick up the snails, others were
         challenged by having to wait. The teachers recorded children's distinct responses, writing
         down significant elements of what children said or did. For example, for a child with
         identified special needs related to self-regulation, a teacher noted: "Jasmine pushed
         aside Yuri in order to pick up the snail crawling off the tray. Yuri stumbled, fell, and
         began to cry. Jasmine continued to focus on the snail, saying nothing to Yuri." For the

         teacher, Jasmine's behavior was significant. This anecdotal note provided some evidence
         of Jasmine's struggles with impulse control. It added to the growing evidence that
         Jasmine was still developing impulse control and empathy. Later, as the teacher shared
         her observation with her co-teacher and with Jasmine's father in a conference, they
         discussed how the small group work around keeping the snails safe might support
         Jasmine as well as other children in reading cues of others and in thinking before acting
         in order to keep people safe.9

Documenting What is Observed

Teachers must be intentional about capturing and recording what children do and say by
setting up a system for carrying out observations. There is no one right way to do this. Systems
will look different from program to program, and even classroom to classroom. Additionally,
observation systems are not static; they should be revisited as teachers become more
proficient in observing children and as children grow and develop. However, there are some
general strategies that should be considered when developing a system.

     Plan times to observe each child regularly and over time. This should include observing
         children
             o Across settings (e.g., indoor and outdoor) and times of the day (morning,
                  afternoon)
             o During routines (e.g., mealtimes, naptime, arrival/departure, transitions)
             o As they engage in spontaneous play experiences and planned activities and
                  experiences
             o As they interact with other children and adults.

     Plan for spontaneous observation opportunities, too.
     Have materials at hand to capture unexpected, but valuable observations of children.
     Decide how to organize and store observations with the system that works best for the

         individual teacher or teaching team. For example:
             o A file folder for each child kept in hanging files in file cabinet, large box, or crate
             o Index cards in file box with a section for each child
             o A 3-ring binder notebook for each child
             o An accordion folder for each child
             o Hanging shoe bag, with pockets labeled for each child

     Decide how often to review observations. A system for using the valuable date from
         observations is an important part of the curriculum cycle. Some curriculum planning
         may be easy to implement based on just casual observation. But deeper analysis of
         observation of individual and groups of children will likely lend valuable insight in what
         teachers can plan to support optimal development.

     Include families in this process. Invite them to share what they observe about their
         children verbally, through pictures and photographs, or in writing.11

                       Portfolios
                       One way to document children's development and learning are portfolios.
                       Portfolios are collections of children's work, notes and photographs from
                       families, checklists and other print recording tools, and other items that
                       document what children know and can do. Written observation notes,
                       photos, and audio and video files may be included as part of the portfolio.
                       Portfolios may be physical, virtual (some online assessment tools allow
                       users to input observation notes and upload photos, video, and audio files
                       for each child), or a combination of both.

                       To be useful, portfolio items should:
                            Be dated and filed in order
                            Represent various parts of the program (e.g., routines, play
                                experiences, transitions)
                            Present a balanced view of the child's growth in all developmental
                                domains.

                       Over time, the portfolio collection serves as a concrete record of the child's
                       progress toward individual goals as well as the program's school readiness
                       goals, so it should be reviewed regularly with families. Teachers should
                       explain what they include in the portfolio and why they include it. They
                       should also actively encourage families to contribute information and items
                       to their child's portfolio.12

                   Pause to Reflect
                   As you think about how to document children's learning, what systems do you
                   find most appealing? Which do you think would be most effective? Which are
                   least appealing or do you think would be least effective?

Reflect & Plan

As teachers reflect on children's play, they discover possibilities for designing curriculum to
sustain, extend, and help children's play to be more complex and, consequently, support the
children's continuing learning.13

Teachers ask themselves questions about what the information they have documented in
observations of children says about the children's development, interests, and needs. The
answers to these questions lead to individualizing care and learning. There are many questions
that teachers may ask themselves. For example:

     What developmental skill or activity does the child appear to be working on?
     What strategies does the child use to play with different toys?
     Does the child engage with objects or people differently than a month ago? What has

         changed? What has not changed?
     Do my actions/the actions of other adults who interact with the child affect the

         outcomes of the child's experience? How so?
     How does the information relate to goals for the child? The family's goals? The

         program's school readiness goals?
     What other information do I need?
     What questions do I have for the child's family?

It is during the reflective process that interpreting the meaning of children's behaviors and
interactions becomes important. These interpretations and insights give rise to each child's
story. Each child's story informs responsive practice.
Teachers use what they know about each child to

     Adapt the environment
     Modify the daily schedule and/or routines
     Make decisions about how to guide the children's learning based on what the child

         knows and can do as well as what the child is ready to try.14

That process of reflections then informs possible next steps in the curriculum. Possible steps
might include adding materials to interest areas, books to read with large or small groups,
activities to do in small groups, or a topic to investigate over time with the children. With clear

ideas or objectives in mind, teachers plan curriculum that includes strategies to enhance the
learning of all children in a group, as well as strategies to support the learning of individual
children. Here is how reflection, discussion, and planning worked in the snail exploration:

         While the children were exploring snails, teachers met each week to reflect and plan for
         the next steps in the children's explorations. They decided to schedule time for small
         groups of children to explore the snails in a more focused way, hoping to extend the
         children's learning and add complexity. The teachers planned a series of walks that
         would allow all the children to find snails in natural habitats.15

                                                         Figure 3.5: Teachers meeting.16

                   Pause to Reflect
                   Think back to something in your childhood that you were passionately
                   interested or engaged in that someone observing you could have documented.
                   What questions could your teachers have asked themselves about your
                   experiences? How could they have planned?
                   (If it's easier or more relevant, you can think of a child you know and consider
                   what you can ask yourself and plan around what you know about that child.)

Implement

Once a plan is written, teachers implement it. While implementing a plan, teachers observe,
reflect, and document. The curriculum-planning cycle begins again (or continues) as teachers
watch to discover how children respond to the planned curriculum and how children show
evidence of their development during the planned learning encounters. Teachers often

approach this step with a sense of wonder, for they may be surprised and amazed by the
children's responses.

To hold the responses in memory, teachers may record notes, take a photo, or label, date, and
keep a work sample, all of which they can later review to assess the impact of the curriculum
plans. The evidence collected will help teachers to come up with ideas for supporting and
assessing the children's learning. Teachers might ponder the following questions:

     Are children responding as predicted, or were there surprises?
     What do the children's responses tell us? How might we name the children's interest(s)

         or intention(s)? What concepts and ideas are the children forming within their play?
     How might children who are English learners and children who speak English collaborate

         in small groups to learn from one another?
     Are children showing evidence of progress on any of the measures of the DRDP?

Here is what happened when the teachers implemented their idea of going on walks with the
children to find snails in natural habitats:

         Before going on their snail hunt, a small group of children gathered on a blanket with
         the teacher. Each child was provided with a clipboard with paper for taking "notes"
         while the teacher explained how the walk would be a way to find snails that lived outside
         their classroom. Some children pretended to write while the teacher talked, while others
         drew pictures of snails. In this group, teachers included two children who were fluent in
         Spanish and learning English. The teachers anticipated much conversation among
         children during the search for the snails and wanted to give these children a chance to
         converse in their home language as well as to share experiences with peers who spoke
         only English.

                                        Figure 3.6: Children watching the teacher write.17

         Before heading off on the hunt, the teacher suggested, "Let's estimate. How many snails
         do you think we will find? Each of you can guess." On a large sheet of paper that the

         children could easily see, she wrote each child's name, saying each letter as she did so,
         and next to each name, the number guessed by that child.

         Armed with magnifying glasses, the children went off to collect snails. There were many
         discoveries along the walk, not just snails. As children found snails, they carried them to
         a large examination tray set up on a table. Some children took a break from their snail
         search to examine, touch, and draw the snails already collected. At the end of the hunt,
         the children lined up the snails on a small log and counted them. The teacher suggested
         that they compare the number they counted with their estimates.

         Before returning to their classroom, the children put the snails back into their natural
         habitats. The children were excited about sharing their experiences with other teachers
         and peers when they returned.

         The teachers examined and reflected on what they saw in the children's writings and
         drawings on the clipboards. They decided that some of the work samples were
         significant in showing how individual children were developing an idea, concept, or skill.
         They filed those samples in the children's portfolios as evidence of developmental
         progress.18

                   Pause to Reflect
                   What happens when implementation goes differently than expected? What
                   would have happened if the children had discovered and become fascinated
                   with dandelions on their hunt for snails (and subsequently lost interest in the
                   snails)? Does curriculum have to go as planned? Why or why not?

Partnering with Families in Curriculum Planning

As the snail-exploration vignette illustrates in several places, teachers also include the
children's families in supporting children's learning. Teachers find it particularly helpful to share
documentation of children's learning with children's family members. When families and
teachers reflect together on documentation of children's play and learning, family members
offer insights into the children's behavior and ideas, as well as share expectations of their
children at home or in the community. Teachers also provide resources to families in order to
bridge children's experiences in preschool with experiences at home and in the community. For
example, the teachers used the children's interest in the snails to support family members'
participation in creating learning opportunities in the following way:

         During the snail exploration, teachers posted near the entry a note with a photo of
         children exploring snails at the science table.

                                          Figure 3.7: Taking a closer look at the snails.19

         They suggested to families to consider doing a snail hunt on the way to school, in a park,
         or in a yard. A stack of copies of the snail diagram with the words eyes, tentacles, and
         shell written in Spanish, English, and Russian was available for family members to take
         with them.20

How It's All Connected

The snail vignette illustrates how teachers can help children make connections and thereby
make meaning. This exploration allowed children to investigate and learn about creatures from
the outdoor environment in the classroom. In doing so, the children were able to make
meaning about snails' natural habitats while encountering opportunities to engage in
integrated learning in every domain.

Young children's experiences at home and in their communities are a powerful source of
connections. Teachers nurture children's appetites for learning and making meaning by building
upon the knowledge children bring to the preschool setting. For example, children may come to
preschool with knowledge of many family stories. Their teachers may have observed that the
children used the stories in the dramatic play area. However, the children did not seem to be
aware that their stories could be written down and then read by someone else. In such a case,
teachers can partner with families to create a story dictation study. In planning the snail
exploration, the teachers and family members may ask:

     Would the children be interested in seeing their family stories written down, and would
         such experiences help them increase their awareness of print in the world around
         them?

     What strategies or adaptations might help a child who is nonverbal to become engaged
         in family storytelling?

61 | I n t r o d u c t i o n t o C u r r i c u l u m f o r E a r l y C h i l d h o o d E d u c a t i o n
     Would children in the group who are English learners make the connection to print
         more easily if they can dictate their stories in their home language to family members or
         community volunteers?

     What topics may be interesting and engaging for children to dictate? What kinds of
         questions would help individual children, English learners, or children with diverse
         cultural experiences to get started with dictation?

     How might the activity be adapted to accommodate children with disabilities or other
         special needs?

     Would asking children about how their family helps them get ready for preschool
         encourage them to dictate a meaningful experience?

     Would a child who likes to draw pictures have an easy time dictating a story about a
         drawing?

Teachers can explore these questions and see where the exploration leads.21

Conclusion

When teachers embed children's learning into their lives, into contexts that they have
experienced, teachers make everything more comprehensible for them. Teachers also engage
children's emotions, making the experience both cognitive and pleasurable. The key is to find
out which connections are meaningful for each individual child. When teachers discover what
may be personally meaningful for a child, there is a good chance of fully engaging that child in
making meaning and learning.22

Chapter 4: Developing Curriculum for a
          Play Centered Approach

                          Figure 4.1: There are a variety of ways to organize planning experiences.1

Chapter Objectives

At the end of this chapter, students will be able to:
     Identify curriculum models for developing curriculum
     Connect child development theories to the various models
     Explore samples of a variety of forms for planning (Specific Activity Plan, weekly
         environmental plans, project plans, etc...)
     Review vignettes of classroom experiences to inspire development of curriculum

Curriculum Models

Curriculum Models provide a framework to organize planning experiences for children. In
previous chapters, the planning cycle has been introduced and in accordance with best
practices, the models identified in this chapter represent a variety of ways to use the planning
cycle within these models.

Bank Street Model

Lucy Sprague Mitchell founded Bank Street, an Integrated Approach also referred to as the
Developmental-Interactionist Approach.
In this model, the environment is arranged into learning centers and planning is organized by
the use of materials within the learning areas (centers).

     Art
     Science

     Sensory/Cooking
     Dramatic Play
     Language/Literacy
     Math/Manipulative/Blocks
     Technology
     Outdoors: Water and Sand Play

The Bank Street Model of curriculum represents the ideology of Freud, Erikson, Dewey,
Vygotsky, and Piaget. This model draws upon the relationship between psychology and
education. By understanding developmental domains and creating interest centers with
materials that promote specific areas of development, children's individual preferences and
paces of learning are the focus.

"A teacher's knowledge and understanding of child development is crucial to this approach.
Educational goals are set in terms of developmental processes and include the development of
competence, a sense of autonomy and individuality, social relatedness and connectedness,
creativity and integration of different ways of experiencing the world" (Gordon).2

Creative Curriculum Model (Diane Trister Dodge)

In the Creative Curriculum model, the focus is primarily on children's play and self-selected
activities. The Environment is arranged into learning areas and large blocks of time are given for
self-selected play. This model focuses on project-based investigations as a means for children to
apply skills and addresses four areas of development: social/emotional, physical, cognitive, and
language.

The curriculum is designed to foster development of the whole child through teacher-led, small
and large group activities centered around 11 interest areas:

    · blocks
    · dramatic play
    · toys and games
    · art
    · library
    · discovery
    · sand and water
    · music and movement
    · cooking
    · computers
    · outdoors.

The commercial curriculum provides teachers with details on child development, classroom
organization, teaching strategies, and engaging families in the learning process. Child
assessments are an important part of the curriculum, but must be purchased separately. Online
record-keeping tools assist teachers with the maintenance and organization of child portfolios,
individualized planning, and report production.3

High Scope Model (David Weikert)

The High Scope Model focuses on developing learning centers similar to the Bank Street Model
and emphasizes key experiences for tracking development. The key experiences are assessed
using a Child Observation Record for tracking development and include areas of:

     Creative Representation
     Initiative
     Social Relations
     Language and Literacy
     Math (Classification, Seriation, Number, Space, Time)
     Music and Movement

The High Scope Model also includes a "Plan-Do-Review" Sequence in which children begin their
day planning for activities they will participate in, followed by participation in the activities and
engaging in a review session at the end of the day. Teachers can use this sequence format to
help children learn how to organize choices of activities and to reflect upon what they liked or
would do different at the end of the day. The High Scope Model reflects the theories of Piaget,
Vygotsky and Reggio Emilia by way of emphasis on construction of knowledge through hands-
on experiences with reflection techniques.

Montessori Approach (Dr. Maria Montessori)

The Montessori Approach refers to children's activity as work (not play); children are given long
periods of time to work and a strong emphasis on individual learning and individual pace is
valued. Central to Montessori's method of education is the dynamic triad of child, teacher and
environment. One of the teacher's roles is to guide the child through what Montessori termed
the 'prepared environment, i.e., a classroom and a way of learning that are designed to support
the child's intellectual, physical, emotional and social development through active exploration,
choice and independent learning.

The educational materials have a self-correcting focus and areas of the curriculum consist of
art, music, movement, practical life (example; pouring, dressing, cleaning). In the Montessori
method, the goal of education is to allow the child's optimal development (intellectual,
physical, emotional and social) to unfold.

3 The Creative Curriculum for Preschool, Fourth Edition by the U.S. Department of Education is in the public
domain

A typical Montessori program will have mixed-age grouping. Children are given the freedom to
choose what they work on, where they work, with whom they work, and for how long they
work on any particular activity, all within the limits of the class rules. No competition is set up
between children, and there is no system of extrinsic rewards or punishments.4

Waldorf Approach (Rudolf Steiner)

The Waldorf Approach, founded by Rudolf Steiner, features connections to nature, sensory
learning, and imagination. The understanding of the child's soul, of his or her development and
individual needs, stands at the center of Steiner's educational world view.

The Waldorf approach is child centered.5 It emerges from a deep understanding of child
development and seeks to support the particular developmental tasks (physical, emotional and
intellectual) children face at any given stage. Children aged 3-5, for example, are developing a
keen interest in the world, supported to a large extent by freedom of movement and must be
supported to follow and deepen their curiosity through the encouragement of their sometimes
endless asking of questions (Van Alphen & Van Alphen 1997). This approach to supporting
children's naturally blossoming curiosity, rather than answering the teachers' questions. At this
stage, children's play becomes increasingly complex, with children spontaneously engaging in
role plays, as they construct and act upon imaginative situations based on their own
experiences and stories they have heard. Thus, in Waldorf schools, ample time is given for free
imaginative play as a cornerstone of children's early learning.6

The environment should protect children from negative influences and curriculum should
include exploring nature through gardening, but also developing in practical skills, such as
cooking, sewing, cleaning, etc. Relationships are important so groupings last for several years,
by way of looping.

Reggio Emilia Approach (Loris Malaguzzi)

The Reggio Emilia approach to early childhood education is based on over forty years of
experience in the Reggio Emilia Municipal Infant/toddler and Preschool Centers in Italy. Central
to this approach is the view that children are competent and capable.

It places emphasis on children's symbolic languages in the context of a project-oriented
curriculum. Learning is viewed as a journey and education as building relationships with people
(both children and adults) and creating connections between ideas and the environment.
Through this approach, adults help children understand the meaning of their experience more
completely through documentation of children's work, observations, and continuous teacher-
child dialogue. The Reggio approach guides children's ideas with provocations--not

predetermined curricula. There is collaboration on many levels: parent participation, teacher
discussions, and community.
Within the Reggio Emilia schools, great attention is given to the look and feel of the classroom.
Environment is considered the "third teacher." Teachers carefully organize space for small and
large group projects and small intimate spaces for one, two, or three children. Documentation
of children's work, plants, and collections that children have made from former outings are
displayed both at the children's and adult's eye level. Common space available to all children in
the school includes dramatic play areas and worktables.
There is a center for gathering called the atelier (art studio) where children and children from
different classrooms can come together. The intent of the atelier in these schools is to provide
children with the opportunity to explore and connect with a variety of media and materials. The
studios are designed to give children time, information, inspiration, and materials so that they
can effectively express their understanding through the "inborn inheritance of our universal
language, the language that speaks with the sounds of the lips and of the heart, the children's
learning with their actions, their signs, and their eyes: those "hundred languages" that we know
to be universal. There is an atelierista (artist) to support this process and instruct children in
arts.7

Webbing

The Reggio Emilia Approach is an emergent curriculum. One method that many Early Childhood
Educators use when planning emergent curriculum is curriculum webbing based on observed
skills or interests. This method uses brainstorming to create ideas and connections from
children's interests to enhance developmental skills. Webbing can look like a "Spider's Web" or
it can be organized in list format.
Example:

                                               Figure 4.2: An example of webbings.10

Webbing can be completed by:
     An individual teacher
     A team of teachers
     Teachers and Children
     Teachers, Children and Families

Webbing provides endless planning opportunities as extensions continue from observing the
activities and following the skills and interests exhibited. As example demonstrates a web can

begin from a skill to develop, but it can also be used in a Theme/Unit Approach such as
transportation; friendships; animals, nature, etc...

Project Approach

The project approach is an in-depth exploration of a topic that may be child-or teacher-initiated
and involve an individual, a group of children, or the whole class. A project may be short-term
or long-term depending on the level of children's interests. What differentiates the project
approach from an inquiry one is that within the project approach there is an emphasis on the
creation of a specific outcome that might take the form of a spoken report, a multimedia
presentation, a poster, a demonstration or a display. The project approach provides
opportunities for children to take agency of their own learning and represent this learning
through the construction of personally meaningful artefacts. If utilized effectively, possible
characteristics may include: active, agentic, collaborative, explicit, learner-focused, responsive,
scaffolded, playful, language-rich and dialogic.11

In the project approach, adults and children investigate topics of discovery using six steps:
Observation, Planning, Research, Exploration, Documentation, Evaluation.

    1. Observation: A teacher observes children engaging with each other or with materials
         and highlights ideas from the observations to further explore.

    2. Planning: Teachers talk with children about the observation and brainstorm ideas about
         the topic and what to explore

    3. Research: Teachers find resources related to the topic
    4. Explore: Children engage with experiences set around the topic to create hypotheses

         and make predictions and formulate questions
    5. Documentation: Teachers write notes, create charts and children draw observations and

         fill in charts as they explore topics/questions
    6. Evaluate: Teachers and children can reflect on the hypotheses originally developed and

         compare their experiences to predictions. Evaluation is key in determining skills
         enhanced and what worked or what didn't work and why.

The benefits of a project approach are that young learners are directly involved in making
decisions about the topic focus and research questions, the processes of investigation and in
the selection of the culminating activities. When young learners take an active role in decision
making, agency and engagement is promoted.

As young learners take ownership of their learning they, `feel increasingly competent and sense
their own potential for learning so they develop feelings of confidence and self-esteem' (Chard,
2001).12

Culturally Appropriate Approach

The Cultural Appropriate Approach has evolved over the years and the practice of valuing
children's culture is imperative for children to feel a sense of belonging in ECE programs.
Sensitivity to the variety of cultures within a community can create a welcoming atmosphere
and teach children about differences and similarities among their peers. Consider meeting with
families prior to starting the program to share about cultural beliefs, languages and or
traditions. Classroom areas can reflect the cultures in many ways:

     Library Area: Select books that represent cultures in the classroom
     Dramatic Area: Ask families to donate empty boxes of foods they commonly use, bring

         costumes or clothes representative of culture
     Language: In writing center include a variety of language dictionaries;
     Science: Encourage families to come and share a traditional meal13

Creating Effective Curriculum

Children reveal their thinking through their behavior in play and interactions with others. The
thinking children reveal informs the reflective curriculum planning process. As described in the
introductory chapter of this book, the Curriculum-Planning Process begins with observation and
reflection of children's play and interactions. Teachers document significant moments they wish
to remember about what they see or hear, in order to share their observations with others.
They discuss and interpret the documentation in order to plan what to do next to support the
children's thinking and learning. A plan is then put into writing and implemented, and as it is
implemented, teachers continue to observe, reflect, document, and interpret. This ongoing
process generates a cycle of curriculum planning that incorporates the essential components of
observation, documentation, interpretation, planning, and implementation.

Curriculum for young children is most effective when it is dynamic, co-constructed, and
responsive.14

The Dynamic Process

Curriculum planning for young children is a dynamic process that takes into account children's
ideas and interests. As stated earlier, infant/toddler and preschool curriculum should reflect the
unique context of each group of children, families, and teachers. The curriculum plan that
works well for one group of children may generate little interest in another group of children.15

For Example:
                  A group of children living near a large urban park may have the opportunity to
                  experience several trips to check on a nest with eggs laid by one of the ducks

                  living at the pond nearby. The ducks, their habitat, and the eggs become the
                  object of study for several weeks, as the children discuss, tell stories, plan ways to
                  protect the eggs from danger, and count the days of waiting. The teachers did
                  not anticipate this curriculum prior to the discovery of the duck nest, yet the duck
                  nest became part of their curriculum plans. Another group of three- and four-
                  year-olds in a different program in the same city might be developing the same
                  emerging skills and learning the same concepts yet be focused on their classroom
                  pet--a tree frog--exploring his food likes and discovering how to maintain his
                  habitat in a way that keeps him healthy and thriving. Like most journeys, early
                  childhood curriculum follows a course that is unique for each group of children,
                  with unpredictable content from group to group and from setting to setting.16

What is constant and predictable in a dynamically generated curriculum is the foundation of
concepts and skills that teachers support as children pursue ideas and topics of interest.
Through professional preparation, teachers who work with young children understand how to
recognize the concepts and skills described in California's early learning foundations. Teachers
look for opportunities to engage the minds of young children in meaningful play, interaction,
conversation, and investigation--creating curriculum that nurtures the inquisitive minds of the
children and connects with their experiences and developing knowledge and skills. Dynamic
curriculum emerges throughout the year and changes each year as teachers respond to the
unique teaching opportunities that present themselves.17

Co-Constructed Curriculum

Early childhood curriculum is co-constructed with input from family members, teachers, and
the children themselves. Teachers and families observe and reflect together on children's
experiences and generate many possible ideas for what new experiences or materials might
extend and render more complex and coherent children's thoughts, feelings, and ideas. In
volume 2 of the California Preschool Curriculum Framework (CDE 2011b), the story of children's
investigation of fresh food from the garden illustrates the dynamic and co-constructed nature
of early childhood curriculum. In this excerpt from a vignette in volume 2 (CDE 2011b, 17), the
teachers describe how they generate possibilities for exploring this topic with a group of three-
and four-year-olds:18

                       Vignettes
                       In this project, both parents and teachers wanted to find ways to support
                       children's health and nutrition, a desire that emerged during a presentation
                       at a parent meeting on nutrition and obesity prevention in young children.
                       Many of the parents were surprised to learn that "picky eating" is a stage
                       that can evolve into long-term resistance to eating fruits and vegetables
                       and that one way to prevent children from becoming resistant is to
                       encourage them to try a variety of fresh produce.

                       An idea that emerged from the discussion was to give children a series of
                       opportunities to explore and taste fresh fruits, vegetables, and other edible
                       plants in their natural, preprocessed state. Parents and teachers together
                       began to think about the varied smells, textures, colors, and tastes of locally
                       grown fruits, vegetables, and edible plants that young children could
                       explore.

                       In this particular vignette, the teachers and families co-construct an idea for
                       a curriculum project. In other situations, an idea that becomes the topic for
                       an ongoing investigation might come from a child. When an idea for a
                       curriculum project is proposed, teachers generate possibilities for how that
                       idea might be explored, being mindful of how, within the investigation or
                       project, children might have an opportunity to use emerging foundational
                       skills and concepts. The teachers invite families to join them in coming up
                       with ideas for the investigation. In the investigation of fresh foods from the
                       garden, the following planning question guided discussions among teachers
                       and families: How might we give children an opportunity to explore and
                       learn about fresh fruits and vegetables grown in the garden?

                       Reflecting on different possibilities, the teachers became curious to see
                       what children would do if given the chance to explore root crops such as
                       carrots, beets, or onions that still had stems and leaves attached. Teachers
                       shared this idea with children's families through a note near the sign-in
                       sheet. Soon after the note was posted, one of the parents brought in big
                       bunches of fresh mint that she was ready to remove from an overgrown
                       section of her yard. Other families responded to the note by offering to
                       bring in cucumbers, apples, and lemons from local gardens or farmers
                       markets. Teachers began to anticipate the ways in which children might
                       build emerging skills, concepts, and ideas in exploring these plants.

                       In the preceding example, teachers are aware of how this topic holds
                       possibilities for children's learning to extend to multiple domains of study.
                       Children will have opportunity to use foundational concepts in mathematics
                       and science, story comprehension and language, as well as skills in drawing

74 | I n t r o d u c t i o n t o C u r r i c u l u m f o r E a r l y C h i l d h o o d E d u c a t i o n
                       and painting, among others. Teachers will also look forward to sharing and
                       naming for families their children's learning, as the investigation directly
                       connects with key concepts and skills children are acquiring in each of the
                       domains of learning.19

Responsive Approach

Early childhood curriculum planning is responsive to the interests and opportunities that exist
in a group of children, families, and community. This means that as they plan, teachers observe
and listen to children's ideas. Curriculum plans that are dynamic, collaboratively constructed
with children, and responsive put children's thinking at the center of the curriculum planning
process. Teachers should be reflecting on what is meaningful to the children within their
community. Rinaldi (2006a) offers this advice on how to approach curriculum planning that is
responsive to children's thinking: "What kind of context, what kind of possibility can you offer
to the children for the next step and the next step, not because you know the next step, but
because you want to offer [them] a possibility for going deeper and deeper in their research?"

A written plan that is responsive is seen as holding "possibilities" for children's inquiry, rather
than delivered as an activity focused solely on a particular skill. A responsive plan may be
proposed as a question--"What might happen if we . . .?" or, "In what ways will the children
explore . . .?" When posed as a question, the plan prompts teachers to observe what ensues
and to record what delights, surprises, amazes, or puzzles the children. Mindfully noting
children's responses adds to teachers' understanding of how children are thinking and making
sense of the experience. A responsive plan is more than simply the proposed activity written on
a planning form. It includes observations of what occurs and teachers' interpretations of what
children appear to be thinking and feeling during the experience. The following table illustrates
how teachers might create a plan that offers possibilities for children to explore, along with
examples of observations and interpretations of how children engage with the materials. The
interpretations will inform what might come next in the curriculum as well as inform the
ongoing assessment of children's learning.20

an infant's learning. The Plan of Possibilities was adapted and used with permission (Maguire-
Fong 2015).

It is the careful observation and documentation of what children do and say as they play that
generates ideas for the next steps in the investigation. The next step might simply be to change
or add materials, as a way of extending or adding complexity to the play and to offer children
opportunities to build and to use emerging concepts and skills. Teachers look for moments in
which the children are amazed or surprised. Documentation of what children found unexpected
not only provides evidence of their sense of wonder about what people and things are like and
the way things work, but it also guides what to plan next in the curriculum.22

Contexts for Written Plans

Early childhood teachers write plans sometimes for an individual child, sometimes for a small
group of children, and sometimes for the entire group of children.23

Individual Plans

One-on-one moments of teaching and learning play a major role in early childhood settings.
Early childhood teaching requires that teachers be present to guide individual children when
needed, adapting their teaching to support each child's individual learning. For example, some
children may be somewhat cautious in joining others in play, but may become excited about
the possibility if the teacher accompanies them into the area where a group of children are
playing together. An early childhood teacher will note this cautious aspect of a child's
temperament. The teacher may make a plan to include watching for opportunities to be a
"social bridge" of support for the child who tends to be cautious, helping that child with joining
the other children's ongoing play. The following vignette taken from volume 1 of the California
Preschool Curriculum Framework (CDE 2010a, 76) illustrates the teacher's role.

                       Vignette
                       Lucas stands close to his caregiver, Ms. Mai, who is sitting in the block area.
                       Ms. Mai observes Lucas watching his peers at play as they build a large
                       train. "This train is getting really big," she comments to Lucas with a soft
                       smile and a gentle hand on his back. Lucas nods his head slowly. "I wonder
                       if Martin needs a helper. He said he is the engineer, but an engineer needs
                       a conductor. Would you like to hand out and collect tickets?" Lucas nods his
                       head again and reaches for Ms. Mai's hand as she gets up to move closer to
                       the train. Ms. Mai provides Lucas her hand and another reassuring smile.
                       "You could let Martin know you want to help. Tell Martin `I can collect the
                       tickets.'' Lucas pauses and then mumbles (or signs), "Martin, I can collect
                       tickets." "You all look like you are having fun over here. Lucas wants to help
                       too. Where are the tickets for Lucas to pass out to your riders?" restates
                       Ms. Mai. "Oh! Over there," responds Martin, pointing over to the basket of
                       torn pieces of paper.

                       "Thanks, Martin, for your help. Lucas, let's go get the tickets and hand them
                       to our friends. I think these builders will want to fill the train with
                       passengers," observes Ms. Mai excitedly."

In this vignette, the teacher is aware of Lucas' caution in entering the play, yet his strong
awareness and most likely his desire to enter the social play become part of his individualized
curriculum plan. Because such individualized curriculum is a component of early childhood
teaching, the teacher-children ratio must be kept sufficiently low to allow the teacher to know

23 The Integrated Nature of Learning by the California Department of Education is used with permission

in depth how each child is developing and learning. In infant/toddler programs, assigning a
primary care teacher who stays with three or four children throughout infancy, makes it
possible for teachers to know each child well and tailor individualized plans to support each
child's learning and development.

Many programs use a child portfolio system to record ongoing individualized curriculum plans.
A portfolio tells the story of a child's developmental progress. It may include periodic
psychometric assessments of the child as well as planning notes specific to the child. It may also
include notes of what the child did in response to the plans, photos, or work samples that give
insight into the child's progress. A child's portfolio allows a teacher to track a child's individual
needs, keep a record of what is planned to support those needs, and document progress in
learning. Such individualized planning is not posted, like the plans designed for groups of
children, but the plans in each child's portfolio are regularly reviewed and shared with families.
Here is an example of an individualized curriculum plan:

         Observation Notes
         Observation: Lucas is somewhat cautious in joining others in play. He stands to the side
         and watches others as they play.

         Interpretation and Plan: Lucas appears to want to join the play, but may need just a little
         bit of support. I plan to watch for moments when he is on the side- lines of play, find
         ways to invite him into the social play, and stay with him to support him in his
         encounters with the other children.

In this example, the teacher knows about temperamental differences and knows how to
assume the role of "social bridge" to assist the child to join other children's ongoing play.
Planning to be a "social bridge" for a child with a cautious temperament is part of a larger
individual plan. Lucas' teacher recognizes that Lucas will have opportunities to learn various
skills in an integrated way when he joins the social play. The teacher watches for ways in which
this social context prompts the child to express and manage emotions, to understand and use
language, to collaborate with others, and to solve problems. Individualized planning applies to
all areas of learning and tends to highlight those concepts and skills that children would
otherwise miss the opportunity to build if teachers developed plans only for the large group of
children.

Another of the over-arching principles from the California Preschool Curriculum Framework
states that individualization of learning includes all children. Of course, some children have
individual plans developed by specialists to address the children's developmental needs. For
children under age three, those plans are called Individual Family Service Plans (IFSPs), and for
children over age three they are called Individualized Education Programs (IEPs). For children
who have one of these, it is helpful for the teacher to know how to support the identified goals,
outcomes, or objectives in the early childhood setting. With parental permission, the teacher
can either be a part of the planning process or communicate with the team that developed the

plan. More information on this process can be found in chapters 1 and 5 of Inclusion Works!
(CDE 2009b).24

Group Plans

Teachers also regularly prepare written plans to organize experiences for the full group of
children in a classroom or program. These plans are posted in a predictable place and
referenced throughout the day or the week by the teachers and the families. These group plans
may be daily or weekly plans. Group plans describe possibilities for experiences that relate to
either a small group or a large group of children. A small group is typically a teacher-guided
experience with four to eight children. The following vignette from volume 1 of the California
Preschool Curriculum Framework (CDE 2010a, 17) illustrates how teachers plan for a small-
group context:

                       Vignette
                       During one of their discussions about their observations of the children's
                       interest in the snails, the teachers . . . decided to do focused exploration of
                       snails, with small groups of four to six children. In a small group, children
                       would have an easier time building relationships with each other and with
                       the teacher, a learning goal for the whole class. With each small group, the
                       teacher helped the children create a snail habitat in the science interest
                       area. The children could return to the interest area throughout the day for
                       exploration. The teacher and small group worked together over days to
                       transform a glass terrarium into a habitat for snails, with dirt, plants, and
                       enough space for other small creatures.

                       Planning for a Large Group Context:
                       The /s/ sound in the new and now popular words-- snails and slugs--
                       "slippery snails and slugs slowly slithering make slimy stripes." She knew
                       how much the children enjoyed chants, songs, and finger plays. She also
                       knew the value in helping children to hear and make distinct sounds of oral
                       language.

                       In the large group, the teachers pointed out that a new kind of helper had
                       been added to the helper chart. Now, two of the children would be "snail
                       helpers." From then on, each day during large-group time, children checked
                       to see whose name cards had been placed next to the snail photo on the
                       helper chart. In the large group, children reported on some of the things
                       they had been doing in their small-group explorations of snails.

Posting the daily or weekly group plan is important. What teachers record on the posted daily
or weekly curriculum plan organizes the possibilities for that day or that week and makes the

plan for learning visible to anyone who reads it. The posted plan should serve as an organizing
tool for teachers to know easily what comes next. In an early childhood setting, unless the
program is a small family child care home, there are typically two or more staff members who
care for the children. A written plan posted in a central location serves as a useful reference
throughout the day for all those involved in supporting the children's learning.

Some parts of the day that support children's learning remain the same each day. For example,
in preschool washing hands before meals, inviting the children to notice or to count who is
present and who is absent, or setting up the outdoor painting

To build upon the children's interest in snails, the teachers announced to the children during
large- group circle time that the snail trays would be available for exploration. The teachers also
used the large-group circle to read books and tell stories about snails. One teacher invented a
simple clapping chant to play with easels, which usually occurs each day. These routine
experiences do not need to be written into each daily plan. Rather, a record of these regularly
occurring opportunities for learning can be included in a description of the program schedule,
along with a description of the distinct interest areas set up inside and outside. For example,
the California Preschool Curriculum Framework (CDE 2011b, 16-19) provides a guide for the
design of specific interest areas that support children's learning as they enjoy self-initiated play.
Written descriptions of how teachers plan for each interest area should be included in the
program handbook and shared with families when they enroll in the program.

Teachers write on the posted daily or weekly plan what they expect to do to supplement the
ongoing learning experiences built into the well-supplied interest areas, the thoughtfully
designed daily routines, and the interactions and conversations that lead to "teachable
moments" that occur spontaneously during the day. The posted curriculum plan for preschool
typically includes the following items:

     Topics to discuss or books to read at group time
     A focus of small-group activities planned for the day
     Materials to add new challenges and experiences to the interest areas both inside and

         outside

Similarly, the curriculum plan for infants and toddlers includes the following items:
     Books to look at or read with children
         Songs, finger plays, and rhyming games that will occur during the day
     Materials to add new challenges and experiences to the environment both inside and
         outside25

                   Pause to Reflect
                   "Being in the Moment with Children"

                   Meaningful experiences are also created spontaneously in the moment with
                   children. Sometimes teachers must act in the moment, without a preexisting
                   plan, to foster the ideas of children.

                   For example, I was observing a child building a structure with blocks. After
                   observing the child and talking to him about his work, the child said to me "I
                   need more stuff for my project!" So I simply asked him what he needs and
                   how I could help. He listed some items (glue, popsicle sticks, pipe cleaners,
                   tape, cardboard). We went on a 'mission' together and gathered all of his
                   materials, which he went on to build with for quite some time. He was proud
                   and satisfied with his work, which he took home.

                   There are countless ways that teachers can be in the moment with children
                   and foster their ideas without a "plan." Plans often times don't go the way we
                   expect. When we are flexible we can honor the decisions and ideas of the
                   children.

                   Reflect
                   Why is it important to follow the child's lead in their play? How can teachers
                   reflect on these spontaneous experiences, and document the learning that
                   took place for the children involved in these spontaneous experiences?26

Family Focus
Children's experiences with their families also inform the curriculum. Teachers look for ways to
connect the children's learning in the early childhood program to their experiences at home.
The following moments in the investigation of fresh foods that come from the garden illustrate
how teachers make connections to the children's lives at home (CDE 2011b, 33):

                       Vignette
                       Once the investigation of fresh fruits and vegetables from the garden was
                       under way, the teachers from the four-year-olds' room wondered whether
                       they might tap the life experiences of the families for stories that related to
                       fresh fruits and vegetables from the garden. The teachers decided to place
                       a photo documentation of the children's cucumber-tasting experiences
                       near the classroom's entryway. They added a note and a clipboard. The
                       note was an invitation for families whose home language was other than
                       English to write down in their home language the name for cucumber (or a
                       similar vegetable eaten in their culture). Once gathered, the teachers added
                       these names to the laminated photo cards of cucumbers stored in the food
                       box in the writing area. If a family had described a vegetable that was
                       similar but distinct from the cucumber, they were invited to bring a picture
                       of this vegetable, or even the vegetable itself, for children to compare with
                       the cucumber.27

From the perspective of developmental scientists who study how the mind of the child
develops, early childhood curriculum is most effective when teachers provide generous
opportunities for children to engage in meaningful play, well supported by materials and
experiences that fascinate them and engage their natural ways of making meaning (Gopnik
2009; Hirsh-Pasek et al. 2009; Rinaldi 2001; Singer, Golinkoff, and Hirsh-Pasek 2006; Zigler,
Singer, and Bishop-Josef 2004). When early childhood teachers are asked or attempt to follow a
prewritten scope and sequence of instructional activities, the essential features of an
integrated curriculum--co-constructed, responsive, and dynamic--are often lost.

However, even when using a prewritten scope and sequence of activities, early childhood
teachers can find ways to modify the planned activities to respond to the unique cultural and
family context of their program and their unique group of children. For example, the
investigation of fresh foods that come from the garden could be implemented within a
curriculum that includes a theme about plants or spring.28

Connecting Families to Curriculum Planning
Documentation is an invitation to families. Family and community partnerships create
meaningful connections. Documentation not only guides curriculum planning and provides
evidence of children's learning, it also offers an easy and effective way to engage families in
participating in planning for children's learning. A note, a photo, or a work sample serves as an
invitation to families to participate in interpreting the observed play and exploration made
visible by the documentation. The following example illustrates how teachers use
documentation to invite families to join them in the work:29

                       During the small-group face-drawing activity, Clayton was picking out
                       pencils for his skin color when his mother arrived to pick him up. She knelt
                       near the table as Connie read the name printed on the colored pencil that
                       Clayton had selected. "This one says, `sienna brown.' What do you think,
                       Clayton?" Connie asked, as she moved the tip of the pencil near his arm. "Is
                       that your color?" Clayton smiled at his mother, "I'm sienna brown, mommy.
                       Which one do you want to be?" A few minutes later, when Clayton was
                       retrieving his things from his cubby, his mother confided in Connie how
                       much she had enjoyed picking out her skin color with Clayton. She had
                       been uncertain about how to talk with Clayton about skin color, because
                       she was of European-American background and Clayton's father was
                       African American, and most of the family members living nearby were
                       Caucasian. They discussed the possibility of doing an activity at the next
                       parent meeting in which all the parents could explore the variety of flesh-
                       toned colored pencils and even to blend different tints of homemade play
                       dough that they could take home to enjoy with their children.

         transitions

The environment is often labeled as a "teacher" in Early Childhood Education. The meaning
behind this label is that if an environment is intentionally created with developmentally
appropriate practice in mind, it will serve to assist with learning as well as classroom
management. A quality early childhood educational environment, whether it is indoor, outdoor
or temporal, should encourage engagement, stimulate learning and promote growth in all areas
of development.
The effective preschool teacher recognizes, understands, and respects the values of children's
families and communities and attempts to make the preschool environment as congruent with
those values as possible.2

Creating an Environment for Social and Emotional Learning

Teachers in a high-quality preschool program ensure that all the children feel safe and
nurtured. They know how to create a classroom climate of cooperation, mutual respect, and
tolerance and support children in developing skills needed to solve problems and resolve
conflicts with peers. Social and emotional learning is central to young children's development in
the preschool years and works hand in hand with cognitive and academic learning. To learn
well, they need to feel safe, to feel comfortable with their preschool teacher, and to be
supported in their play with other children. All these factors interact with each other and either
promote or detract from children's learning and well-being. Because preschool children are
naturally curious and learn best in meaningful contexts, teachers responsible for planning the
learning environment and curriculum will best support children's learning and development
when they use a variety of strategies to support children's learning--such as focusing on
interactions, scaffolding learning experiences, engaging in explicit instruction, changing the
environment and materials, and making adaptations to the learning environment.

Teachers make use of daily routines as an important context for learning, integrating engaging
learning opportunities into the everyday routines of arrivals, departures, mealtimes, naptimes,
hand- washing, setup, and cleanup, both indoors and outdoors. Children enthusiastically
practice and apply emerging skills when they are helpers who ring the bell to signal it is time to
come inside; when they count how many are ready for lunch; when they move a card with a
child's photo and name from the "home" column to the "preschool" column of a chart near the
room entry; when they put their name on a waiting list to paint at the easel; or when they help
set the table for a meal, making sure that each place has a plate, utensils, and a cup. Such
routines offer opportunities for children to build language skills, to learn the rituals of sharing
time with others, and to relate one action in a sequence to another" (adapted from CDE 2010,
18).

Based on teachers' assessments of individual children's learning, the teachers might add
materials to play-based interest areas, decide to read books with small or large groups, adapt

activities to meet the diverse learning needs of children in the classroom, and think of a
particular topic area that children would be interested in investigating. Guided by the California
preschool learning foundations, teachers use their understanding of children's learning and
development as a way to ensure they adequately support children's development across all
domains. With clear ideas or objectives in mind, teachers plan curriculum that includes
strategies to enhance the learning of all children in a group, as well as strategies to support the
learning of individual children (adapted from CDE 2010a, 21). Please refer to Chapter 4 for a
closer look at the curriculum planning process.4

Analyzing the Environment

In a educators' guide, the Australian Government Department of Education states:
         Children are important sources of inspiration and creativity when planning the
         environment, so it is an opportunity to learn by being open-minded and to collaborate
         with the children. It is important to include materials which are inviting and which can be
         used in a variety of ways.
              How does your environment convey a sense of belonging for children, families
                  and educators?
              Do children have a sense of autonomy?
              What involvement do children have in the planning of the environment?
              Have you tried to make the environment more home-like?
              How might you make it more aesthetically pleasing?5

                       Teacher Tip
                       During an annual ECE conference, a presenter challenged the participants
                       to change their thinking on student readiness. As a teacher, I spent a lot of
                       time considering how to best prepare the children in my care for the
                       transition to older classrooms. Attending this workshop inspired me to
                       think differently. Readiness is not about getting children ready, but rather
                       getting our environments ready for the children as they come to us. To put
                       this into practice, our preschool teachers visited children in the toddler
                       classrooms and observed the interest in specific areas, materials and took
                       notes on skills observed. As the children began to transition into our
                       preschool classroom the room was set with a mixture of materials they
                       were familiar with as well as new materials appropriate for their new stage
                       of development. The pressure was off of the toddler teachers to prep for
                       what they thought the children needed to be ready with and the new
                       preschool teachers had realistic expectations of the children as they
                       matriculated into their new environments. We took this idea one step
                       further with our older preschoolers and had them help us to create the
                       spaces they wanted to use. The children walked from area to area and
                       estimated how many children could safely exist in each area. Next, we
                       placed the number of students allowed in each area at a time (from the
                       children's perspective) and we let them experiment. We reflected with the
                       children our observations and their experiences and decided together if the
                       amount of children allotted per area was reasonable or needed adjusting.
                       We found that by incorporating the children's ideas and participation in
                       environmental design, they were more respectful of the environment and
                       the environment reflected their ideas and values. Remember: Not every
                       area of the classroom has to be created equal. The environment should
                       reflect the interests and skills of the people who use it.6

Early childhood teachers see and support children as scientists and thus design the play
environment to serve the children's inquisitive minds. Teachers also provide the materials
children need to construct concepts and ideas and master skills in the natural context of play.
Children learn from opportunities to discover materials that they may be seeing for the first
time and need time to explore and get to know the properties of these materials. It means
offering children materials that they can organize into relationships of size, shape, number, or
function and time. Children can investigate what happens when they put these materials
together or arrange them in new ways, experiencing the delight of discovering possibilities for
building with them, transforming them, or using them to represent an experience.

                       Loose Parts
                       An article by Reading Play discusses Loose Parts Theory:

                       `Loose parts' theory is about remembering that the best play comes from
                       things that allow children to play in many different ways and on many
                       different levels. Environments that include `loose parts' are infinitely more
                       open-ended, stimulating, and engaging than static ones. The play
                       environment needs to promote and support imaginative play through the
                       provision of `loose parts' in a way that doesn't direct play and play
                       opportunities, but allows children to develop their own ideas and explore
                       their world.
                        Must be included in both indoor and outdoor environments
                        Have no defined use and play workers must support the children when

                           they decide to change the shape or use of them.
                        Must be accessible physically and stored where they can be reached by

                           children without having to ask the play workers. The children should
                           know that they can use them whenever and however they wish.

                       Must be regularly replenished, changed, and added to.7

Early childhood teachers also design the daily routines as rich opportunities for children to
participate actively and to use their emerging skills and ideas in meaningful situations. Equally
important are the ways in which teachers use interactions and conversations with children to
support learning.8

Connecting Theories to Environments

Environments should be planned with developmental theories in mind:

     Jean Piaget and the Cognitive Theory: Environments should encourage active learning,
         stimulate skills of inquiry and promote problem-solving/risk-taking. Examples: Materials
         are placed low on shelves that make easy access for children. The shelves should be
         labeled with pictures of the materials so that children are encouraged to place these
         materials where they belong by matching the material to the photo when they finish
         playing with them. The environment must be stimulating for children to encourage
         knowledge seeking.

     Vygotsky and the Sociocultural Theory: Environments should provide opportunities for
         meaningful interactions that challenge children (zpd) and in which scaffolding exists
         through child-child and child-adult interactions.

     Behavioral Theory: Daily routines must be consistent and expectations of behavior
         should be clearly defined.

     Erikson: Environments provide opportunities for children to develop feelings of
         trustworthiness, autonomy and initiative in the early years. The environment provides
         areas for children to feel safe, play independently, and make choices throughout the
         day.9

Curriculum Occurs Throughout the Day

As previously stated, young children learn in everyday moments of play and interaction. A child
who arrives in the classroom and sees his name written on a cubby where he deposits what he
brought from home is learning. That learning is amplified when he walks to a nearby metal tray
(labeled with the words "Home" and "School") and moves the magnet attached to his photo
from the "Home" side of the frame to the "School" side. The learning continues when he stops
to write his version of his name in the sign-in binder, located near a ring of cards with a child's
name and photo printed on each. In this area, he can observe the accompanying family
member sign him in as well.

                                       Figure 5.3: An example page from a sign-in binder.10

A bit later, that same child is learning when he describes to the teacher his frustration that his
"favorite tricycle is still being used by another child." The teacher suggests what he might say to
encourage the other child to explore how the two of them might cooperate. After that
conversation, his learning continues as he ventures into the block area and takes on the
challenge of turning a container of blocks and boxes into a gas station, negotiating varying roles
in the pretend play with his friends. At lunch, when he pours milk into his glass using a small
measuring cup, he is learning. Each moment of learning, in this example, emerged from

thoughtful, intentional curriculum planning. Early childhood teachers plan such opportunities
for young children to learn throughout the day.
Teachers' early childhood curriculum plans include the physical space as a context for learning.
This means that teachers plan what, when, and how materials and furnishings are made
available to the children for use. Teachers also plan the social environment--the roles,
responsibilities, and guidance offered to children--during the daily routines and during
moments of spontaneous interactions. A broad definition of curriculum includes the following
components:

     Play spaces designed as environments for learning
     Care routines designed to invite children's active participation
     Interactions and conversations with children that support their understanding of

         themselves and others

Play Spaces as Curriculum

With play being central to the way in which children construct knowledge about the world
around them, an important task for teachers is to develop play spaces thoughtfully and
purposefully. Play spaces are children's environments for learning. Seeing children as young
scientists leads to the creation of play spaces that become the children's laboratories for
learning. Whether inside or outside, their play spaces are where they explore, experiment, and
solve problems. Play spaces include materials and furnishings that invite children to figure out
what the world is like and how it works. When early childhood teachers thoughtfully select and
organize materials for play, they support an essential aspect of curriculum--self-initiated
exploration, investigation, and invention of ideas. Jones and Reynolds (2011) list the varied
roles assumed by early childhood teachers, one of which they call "stage manager." This role
means that the early childhood teacher purposely sets the stage for learning by selecting toys,
furnishings, and materials that invite children to explore, experiment, and solve problems. In a
well-designed early childhood program, the play environment holds immense possibilities for
learning and creativity.

Consider how the play environment provides a context for learning in the following vignette:

92 | I n t r o d u c t i o n t o C u r r i c u l u m f o r E a r l y C h i l d h o o d E d u c a t i o n
                       Vignette
                       During a moment of play in the art area, infant teacher Joette watches as
                       two-year-old Lucila picks up a wooden frame that encloses two sheets of
                       blue plexi-glass. Lucila puts her eyes up close to the plexi-glass and peers
                       through. She holds the frame out to Joette, gesturing for her to take it.
                       Joette responds, "You want me to see what you saw, don't you? I'd love
                       to!" Joette looks through and exclaims, "I see everything blue! Here, your
                       turn, Lucila." Lucila looks through the block again. Another child walks up
                       and reaches for a different frame, this one with yellow plexi-glass inside.
                       The two children laugh together as they move the frames back and forth in
                       front of their eyes. Teacher Joette watches and then picks up a third frame,
                       which has red plastic sheets. She holds it near the window, and a red patch
                       appears on the floor. She gestures to the two toddlers and says, "Oh, look
                       what's over here!" They rush to the red patch. Lucila steps onto the red and
                       laughs with excitement. "It made red!" she says. "Yes!" says teacher Joette,
                       "Will yours make a color on the floor, too? You want to try?" Lucila holds
                       her frame to the sun, sees a blue spot, and says, "Yes, I made blue!"11

It is easy to see evidence of the children's thinking in this moment of play. They take full
advantage of the materials available in this well-stocked play space designed to prompt play
with colors and textures of materials. They notice the distinct features of the panes of
translucent plastic. They compare them as they play. They use one item in relation to the other.
They experience how they can use the different-colored panes to transform the shadows on the
floor. They explore how the shapes change in space and how their actions cause different
reactions. The inventions of one child are exchanged with those of the other. In this play space,
children can be seen constructing concepts of shape, orientation, light, and transformation.

Joette and her co-teachers supplied this art area with the same care that scientists might stock
their laboratories. In the art interest area for toddlers, they placed an array of toys and
materials that invite exploration and comparison of color, line, shape, and texture. They made
certain that there were objects with similar features as well as distinct features, in order to
challenge the toddlers' emerging ability to sort one object from another. They gathered similar
objects graduated in size, in order to challenge the toddlers to explore concepts of size and
sequencing. In the collection were identical objects for creating pairs and for assembling many
rather than few. The teachers made the materials easily available to the toddlers, on low
shelves and in wide, shallow baskets and bins. A variety of containers were labeled, each
holding a distinct type of object--objects made from paper in one; a collection of orange and
red fabric pieces in another; a collection or blue fabric, feathers, and ribbons in another; and a
collection of translucent colored frames in another.

In the natural course of spontaneous play, toddlers encounter such materials and build
relationships of identity, order, size, shape, number, and space. Many of the materials, like the

93 | I n t r o d u c t i o n t o C u r r i c u l u m f o r E a r l y C h i l d h o o d E d u c a t i o n
collection of fabric pieces, are familiar to the toddlers, already available in the bins of the play
space for many days. Other materials, like the long pieces of translucent cellophane paper in a
variety of colors, have been recently added by teachers, with the hope of extending and adding
complexity to the toddlers' play with color.

The new materials added to the play space are part of the teachers' curriculum plan. During
their weekly planning, Joette and her co-teachers discuss the observations they made of Lucila
and her friends as the children explored the colored panes of plexi-glass. As the teachers
interpreted the play, they wondered how to add some challenge and surprise to the toddlers'
enjoyment of making colored shadows on the floor with the sunlight and the translucent
plastic. The subsequent curriculum plan held a question: "In what ways will the children explore
the long lengths of colored cellophane that they discover in the art area?" The teachers
wondered whether these new materials might provoke toddlers' deeper exploration of
relationships of size, space, and similarity and difference. The teachers explored possible
questions to prompt toddlers' experiments in transforming the primary colors in the yellow and
the blue cellophane into the secondary color of green.

Once the stage is set for play, teachers observe to discover what will ensue. At times, teachers
might narrate what goes on as the children play, offering language related to the play. The
teachers might also prompt new ways of looking at the materials, as Joette did when she held
the colored pane near the window to catch the sunlight and cast a colored shadow. In this
moment, she artfully scaffolded the toddlers' learning by suggesting a new way of playing with
the plexi-glass. A scaffold is a structure that allows someone to go higher in order to accomplish
a task that the person could not have done alone. Teachers scaffold children's play when they
connect in shared knowing with children and support them in going further to figure something
out.

Environmental Design

Rich learning environments with a variety of activities enhance young children's learning and
development. In an environment in which children have the opportunity to make observations,
ask questions, plan investigations, gather and interpret information, and communicate findings
and ideas (CDE 2012b, 53), they explore concepts in domains such as science, math, and
history-social science. Dance, music, and drama not only introduce children to the arts and
allow them to explore creative processes, they also provide opportunities for children to learn
to regulate their behavior and take the perspective of another person.12

Creating Environments for Infants and Toddlers

The infant/ toddler framework proposes the following play spaces to consider for an
infant/toddler program:

     A cozy area for books and stories
     A small-muscle area
     A sensory perception area
     An active movement area
     A creative expression area
Here is a sample infant/toddler classroom. See Appendix B for an older toddler classroom and
for the corresponding blueprints.

                                             Figure 5.4: An infant/toddler classroom.13

Creating Environments for Preschoolers

The preschool framework offers the following list of suggested play spaces when creating a
learning environment for children three to five years of age:

     Dramatic play area
     Block area
     Art area
     Book area
     Writing area
     Math area

     Science/Sensory area
     Family display area
     Music/movement
     Meeting area (for conferencing)
And here is a sample preschool classroom. Additional sample classrooms for preschoolers and
corresponding blueprints can be found in Appendix B.

                                                 Figure 5.5: A preschool classroom.14

In both cases, it is helpful to think of ways that the spaces can be used by two or three children
together, one child alone, or an adult and one or two children, as well as larger areas for more
exuberant group play. Providing opportunities for small configurations enables the play space
to support growing social relationships and meet needs of children who prefer more defined
space or space away from others. 15

                       Licensing Requirements for Indoor Preschool Classrooms in California
                       Here are a few of the licensing requirements to keep in mind when
                       planning indoor environments for young children in California:

                            The program provides for quiet and active play, rest and relaxation,
                                eating, and toileting. (101230)

                            35 square feet of indoor activity space per child (not including
                                bathrooms, halls, offices, food preparation areas, or storage.
                                (101238)

                            That each child has individual storage space for clothing, personal
                                belongings, and bedding. (101238)

                            Storage must be provided for play materials, equipment, and
                                napping equipment. (101238)

                            Combustibles, cleaning equipment and cleaning agents shall be
                                stored in an area separate from food supplies in a locked cabinet or
                                in a location inaccessible to children. (101238)

                            Tables and chairs scaled to the size of children must be provided.
                                (101239)

                            All play equipment and materials used by children must be age-
                                appropriate. (101239)

                            Drinking water must be available freely to children. (101239)16

Ensuring Quality in the Indoor Environment

Outdoor Spaces

The areas highlighted in the frameworks should be represented in outdoor play spaces as well.
Materials may vary but all areas should be reflected in both the indoor and outdoor
environments.

Many outdoor spaces feature play equipment, such as what is shown in the following image,
which is a great way to provide for children's large motor play and exploration.

A variety of additional equipment can be purchased to expand children's experiences outside,
although a large budget is not required to create high quality outdoor spaces for young
children.

  Figure 5.8: Sensory play is one of the most popular activities for young children. While this setup allows for many
                children to play, less elaborate spaces would still create quality experiences for children.20

Temporal Environment: The Daily Schedule

One feature of a well-organized classroom is the use of a schedule and established routines.
Schedules and established routines are important because they influence a child's social and
emotional development. While referred to as the daily schedule, it is important to recognize
that the flow, or the predictable order of the day, should be the focus (rather than abiding by
rigid timelines for the different parts of the day). While there may be parts of the day that at
are at fixed times (for example meals or using a shared outdoor space), teachers should use
flexibility to make the schedule meet the needs of the children. If an activity seems to be
coming to a natural conclusion earlier, consider transitioning to the next part of the day. If
children are really engaged in an activity, consider giving them additional time to wrap up their
exploration. Flexibility also comes in handy when there are changes that affect the schedule
that are beyond your control, such as bad weather preventing outdoor play.25

Why Have a Daily Schedule?

Schedules are important because they
     Help children know what to expect:
             o Schedules and routines help children understand the expectations of the
                  classroom environment--which may be very different than in other settings.
             o Knowing expectations may lower behavior problems.
     Enhance feelings of security:
             o Predictable and consistent schedules in preschool classrooms help children feel
                  secure and comfortable.
             o Those children who have difficulty with change especially need to feel secure.
             o Children who do not yet speak and understand English well also benefit from
                  predictable and consistent classroom schedules and routines.
     Influence a child's cognitive and social development:
             o When periods of play are longer, children engage in more complex social and
                  cognitive play.
     Increase child engagement rates:

             o Child engagement is defined as the amount of time a child spends interacting
                  with his or her environment (adults, peers, or materials) in a developmentally
                  and contextually appropriate manner, at different levels of competence.

             o Schedules that give children choices, balanced activities, planned activities, and
                  individual activities result in a higher level of engagement.

Several factors influence child engagement.
     Attention span of children:
             o Plan activities to maximize children's engagement:
                       Use other adults to assist.
                       Use novel materials.
             o Limit duration to ensure children stay engaged throughout the activity.
     Alertness level:
             o Plan activities that require more child attention and listening skills during times
                  when children are more alert.
             o Plan calming activities after active activities.
             o Note if some children may be tired or sick.
     Adult availability:
             o For a more active part of your day, you may want to have more adults to support
                  the children's learning and the management of the classroom.
     Time for children's needs--allow enough time for children to fully engage and benefit
         from an activity. When children engage in longer periods of play they:
             o Show higher levels of exploration, experimentation, and persistence.
             o Utilize materials in more creative ways.
             o Develop social relationships.26

Creating the Daily Schedule

The first component is "blocks of time," the big chunks of time set aside for classroom activities.
Preschool schedules typically include:

     Large group or circle time
     Child-initiated play time
     Snack time and meals
     Outdoor time
     Rest time

The next component is the sequence. Sequencing the blocks of time requires taking into
consideration multiple factors including:

     Method of arrival/departure (bus or transportation provided by families)
     Schedules of other classrooms (e.g., which classroom goes outdoors at what times?)

103 | I n t r o d u c t i o n t o C u r r i c u l u m f o r E a r l y C h i l d h o o d E d u c a t i o n
Schedules include some of the daily routines such as meal times, but may not include others
such as bathroom breaks or clean up routines.

         Figure 5.11: This is a visual schedule that shows children images of the different parts of their day.27

            Figure 5.12: Here is a schedule that combines visual cues, written times, and text descriptions.28

Finding Balance in the Schedule

When planning the schedule you want to provide balance. This includes:
     Alternating active with quiet activities to help children with self-control.
     Having a mix of small group and large group activities.
     Having activities that differ in noise level, pace, person leading (child vs. adult), and
         location (indoor vs. outdoor).
     Having a mix of teacher-guided and child-initiated activities.29

Child-Initiated Play and Teacher-Guided Activities

The daily schedule balances child-initiated play and teacher-guided activities. The latter involves
teachers planning, introducing, and guiding specific activities to enhance children's learning
during small- and large-group times. In contrast, child-initiated play refers to children's
responses to ideas and materials introduced by teachers that the children are free to explore
without teacher guidance. Child-initiated play also includes those times when children create,
organize, and engage in activities completely on their own.

A daily schedule that ensures ample time for children to initiate their own play in well-
developed interest areas is critical to the teaching and learning. Young children need ample
time to engage in play, in the company of peers, in order to build their ideas, to pose problems,
to try out solutions, and to negotiate and exchange ideas. When children initiate, organize, and
develop their own play in the interest areas, it is called child-initiated learning. At times,
children choose to play alone, but frequently, child-initiated play takes place in small groups of
their own choosing.

In a schedule with ample time for children to initiate play in well-stocked interest areas, there
are times when teachers organize and guide specific activities for children. Such teacher-guided
curriculum activities are clearly distinct from child-initiated curriculum activities. Teacher-
guided activities occur in two contexts--small groups and large groups. A small group would
consist of one teacher working with a group of four to eight children. A large group is typically a
gathering of all the children in an early childhood setting. Each context serves a different
purpose and requires different preparation and different teaching strategies.

For some aspects of the curriculum, teachers may choose to organize an activity with a small
group of children. Although initiated and guided by the teacher, an effective small-group
encounter of this nature should still be rich in possibilities for children to contribute and
negotiate ideas with each other. Teacher-guided activities in small groups work best in quiet
spaces away from distractions of the full group and provide a manageable context for children
to discuss and explore ideas and experiences. The teacher listens to children's ideas, helps
orchestrate the give-and-take of ideas among children, and poses ideas or problems for
children to wonder about, explore together, or even solve. Away from the distractions of a
large group, teachers can easily observe, listen, and converse with children in a small group, as
well as note how individual children think, express ideas, relate with others, and use their
emerging skills.

Such teacher-guided conversations can enrich children's learning in all domains, particularly the
children's language and vocabulary development. In addition, teachers can intentionally guide
the development of specific skills by planning small-group activities (e.g., songs, games, shared
reading) for short periods of time that playfully engage children in using specific emerging skills.

Small-group activities have several advantages over large-group activities. With small groups of
children, teachers can readily observe, listen, and document children's developmental progress.

105 | I n t r o d u c t i o n t o C u r r i c u l u m f o r E a r l y C h i l d h o o d E d u c a t i o n
Teachers can also individualize the curriculum and use questions or prompts to scaffold each
child's thinking in more complex ways.

Whether the activities are child-initiated or teacher-guided, children's use of materials in
interest areas provide teachers with excellent opportunities to observe how they build
concepts and skills and how they negotiate ideas with others. Moments of observed play and
interactions also provide teachers with ideas on how to extend children's exploration and
learning through future encounters with related materials that add novelty, challenge, and
complexity in each domain.

Large groups provide another context for teacher-guided activities. The large group--typically a
gathering of the entire class--works well for singing, acting out songs and stories, playing
games, sharing experiences with each other, telling stories, building a sense of community, and
organizing the daily schedule and activities. Storytelling is one of the more popular large-group
experiences, one that has rich potential for adding to children's understanding about the world
around them. Storytelling allows teachers, children, family members, as well as storytellers
from the community to tap into and build children's knowledge and experiences in meaningful
ways. Large-group time is also when teachers let the whole group of children know what new
experiences will be available in the interest areas or what will happen in small groups that day.
Large-group gatherings that occur at the end of the day provide opportunities to review
noteworthy happenings and to anticipate what will be available the next day.30

Here are some examples of daily schedules for preschool classrooms.

Routines and Rituals

Schedules define the whole day, whereas routines are more specific sets of regularly occurring
behaviors. Routines provide some security and a sense of what comes next; children are able to
anticipate what will happen, and thus feel more secure.

Daily routines and rituals also provide a second context for curriculum. They offer possibilities
for children to use their emerging skills and to apply emerging concepts and ideas. Early
childhood daily routines include arrivals and departures, mealtimes, naptimes, diapering,
toileting, dressing, handwashing, tooth-brushing, and transitions between one place and
another. They also include rituals such as sign-in sheets, health checks, waiting lists, attendance
counts, dictated stories, reminder notes, or voting.

Children sit down for a meal, wash their hands, and put jackets and shoes on hundreds of times
in order to provide excellent opportunities for children to use and build emerging skills and
concepts. In group care, the care routines during arrivals, departures, meals, naps, diapering,
toileting, and dressing provide excellent opportunities for children to use and challenge their
emerging skills and concepts. When an infant whose diaper is about to be changed hears her
teacher describe what it is she is about to do, the infant experiences a flood of words, which

31 Based on the College of the Canyons Early Childhood Education Sample schedule

eventually become an anticipated phrase that gives meaning to a familiar experience. When
this same infant hears a request to put his arm into the sleeve of a shirt, he is invited to
demonstrate that he has understood this phrase and experiences the joy that comes with
sharing meaning with the teacher. When a preschool child looks in anticipation each morning at
the helper chart to see what job she gets to do that day, they are invited not only to cooperate
in the care of the classroom, but also to build their emerging skills in understanding the
meaning of print that accompanies the photo or drawing. Care routines are natural
opportunities for children to engage in learning. Therefore, teachers plan the routines of care
and the daily rituals that pepper the day in ways that invite children to be active participants
and to use and build their emerging skills and concepts in meaningful situations.32

A vignette featuring toddlers shows the kind of learning that occurs in another routine:

                       Vignette
                       Four toddlers are seated at a low table for lunch. Their primary care teacher
                       sits with them at the table. To his right, on a low bench, the primary care
                       teacher has a bin that holds everything he needs for the meal. He pulls out
                       bibs for each toddler and helps each toddler put one on. Each toddler finds
                       a cube chair to sit in. The teacher puts an empty bowl in front of the toddler
                       on his left. He offers this toddler a pair of small plastic tongs, holds a plate
                       of small sandwiches, and asks, "Would you like to take a sandwich?" The
                       toddler grabs the tongs and, after a few trials, manages to pick up one of
                       the sandwiches and drop it onto his plate. Later, after each toddler has
                       taken a sandwich, the teacher pulls from the bin a clear plastic measuring
                       cup, on which a red line is drawn at the one-cup mark. He fills the
                       measuring cup to the red line. He places an empty glass in front of a toddler
                       and, offering the toddler the measuring cup, says, "Would you like to
                       pour?" The toddler wraps his hand around the handle and tips the cup over
                       his glass. He spills a bit at first, but adjusts his hand and manages to empty
                       the measuring cup. He looks up at the teacher and smiles. The teacher
                       smiles in response, saying, "You poured your milk, Stephan! You know how
                       to do it!" The toddler seated next to Stephan reaches for the empty
                       measuring cup. The teacher says, "And now you can pour milk into your
                       glass, Alexi. I'll put the milk in the measuring cup first."33

Transitions

It is important to focus on creating and managing smooth transitions between activities in the
classroom. Reasons to address transitions between activities in early childhood classrooms
include:

     Transitions take up a great deal of time in preschool classrooms.
     During transitions, children often spend a lot of time waiting (e.g., waiting until

         everyone has finished their snack, waiting for everyone to clean up before beginning
         large group time). All of this time waiting with nothing to do can lead to unrealistic
         expectations and challenging behaviors.
     Some children (and adults) have stressful and frustrating experiences during transitions
         between activities (e.g., children arguing over who took out what toys and who should
         put them away; children not knowing where to put certain toys when they are done

         with them; children not knowing what to do, children not knowing expectations for the
         transition).
     Many preschool teachers and other caregivers consider children's ability to
         independently make transitions between activities one of the essential skills needed in
         group contexts such as preschool and kindergarten.35

Supporting Successful Transitions

There are numerous strategies that can be used to ensure well-organized transitions between
activities. These include strategies you use before the transition, during the transition, and
following the transition.

    · Before the Transition
             o Plan your daily schedule to include the minimal number of transitions that occur
                  over the course of the day. Minimize the number of transitions in which all
                  children have to do the same thing at the same time (e.g., Do all children have to
                  go to the restroom at the same time? Can some children come over to the rug
                  and sing a song or read a book, while other children finish an activity?).
             o Plan for what adults will do during transition times (e.g., Which adult is
                  responsible for greeting the children? Who will begin looking at books on the
                  carpet with children?).
             o Teach children the expectations for the transition routine. Teaching children how
                  to clean up and how to line up will reduce the length of transition times. By
                  reducing transition times, more time is available for children to spend in other
                  learning activities. As children become familiar with the expectations, problem
                  behaviors are less likely to occur.
             o Provide verbal and nonverbal cues before transitions (e.g., "Five minutes `til
                  snack. It's almost time for clean-up," show pictures of the next activity, beat a
                  drum). Once a transition cue has been established, the cue should be used
                  consistently to signal the transition.

    · During the Transition
             o Engage children in transition activities (sing songs, play word or guessing games,
                  recite rhymes, organize finger plays). Transition activities provide children with
                  an activity to complete while other children are still transitioning. These
                  activities also encourage children to finish their previous task, so that they can
                  play the game or sing the song. During these activities, skills related to the
                  transition can also be taught (e.g., setting the table for snack or lunch, sorting
                  toys during clean-up time).
             o Allow children adequate time to finish projects or activities so they do not
                  become frustrated by activities ending too soon. Give them a warning that it is
                  about time to change activities.
             o Plan something to engage those children who finish an activity quickly, so they
                  are not waiting without anything to do (e.g., if some children finish cleaning up

                  and getting to large group quickly, they might look at books while waiting for
                  other children to finish cleaning up).
             o Individualize support to accommodate individual children's needs.

                       Photos to help anticipate what activity is next.
                       Directions given in a child's home language or sign language.
                       An individual warning to a child that it will soon be time to clean up and

                           begin a new activity.
                                Support may need to be individualized (i.e., one child may need
                                    an adult to provide a five-minute, three-minute, and one-minute
                                    warning before clean up while the rest of the class might need
                                    only a three-minute warning).

    · After transitions
             o Provide positive attention and feedback to children following transitions.
                       When children pick up toys without much prompting, share with them
                           how this shows how well they take care of the classroom materials.
                       When children are working together to accomplish the task more quickly,
                           let them know how much you appreciate their teamwork (e.g., "Nicholas
                           and Jorge did a great job cleaning together and moving to the carpet").

You can also work to promote independence during transitions by
    · Allowing children to move individually from one area to another area when they
         complete an activity (e.g., as children finish snack, they are encouraged to go to the
         carpet and choose a book; as children finish putting away their coats and backpacks,
         they are encouraged to get a puzzle).
    · Teaching children to help others (e.g., have children move as partners from one activity
         to another, or ask one child to help another child gather his/her backpack).
    · Helping children self-monitor during transitions (e.g., children can be asked to think
         about how quietly or quickly they moved from one activity to another).

The following vignette offers an opportunity to watch and listen for the learning that occurs
during a transition routine and to reflect on the planning that had to occur in order for this
experience to play out as it did.

                       Ms. Cone had used the children's name tags in transition activities for quite
                       some time, at first pointing out and naming the first letter in each name as
                       she called children to go wash hands or to get their jackets before going
                       outside. Somewhat later, she held up each of the nametags and pointed to
                       the first letter as she asked the child to name it. Today, she is using the first
                       sounds in names to send a few children at a time from the circle time area
                       to wash hands for lunch: "If your name starts with /k/, you may go wash
                       your hands. Yes, Connie and Carolina, you may go to the sink. Both of your
                       names start with the /k/ sound." Cindy sees Connie and Carolina stand up,
                       and she stands up too. Ms. Cone explains that Cindy begins with the /s/, not
                       /k/ sound, and that she'll get a turn soon. Cindy says, "I'm a C too!" Ms.
                       Cone says, "Oh, you are right. Your name begins with the letter c like
                       Connie and Carolina, but it starts with a different sound. We hear /k/ at the
                       beginning of Connie and Carolina--/k/ Connie, /k/ Carolina. We hear /s/ at
                       the beginning of your name--/s/--Cindy. I'm going to say that sound next:
                       `If your name starts with /s/, you may go wash your hands.'" Sabrina stood
                       up, joined hands with Cindy, and they walked to the sink together.36

Built into this large-group gathering is a dismissal ritual that takes full advantage of young
children's interest in their names and the names of their friends. As part of this dismissal ritual,
the teacher invites children to use their emerging skills in distinguishing the distinct sounds of
language, described in the language and literacy foundations as phonological awareness. She
embeds this learning in the context of a game, one that inspires children to listen carefully to
the sounds spoken in instructions for inviting small groups of children to wash hands. The
transition from large group to the sink area goes much more smoothly as a result, and in the
process, children get to use an important emerging skill. 37

Chapter Objectives

At the end of the chapter, students should be able to:
     Identify factors that influence behavior
     Discuss the role of teachers in guiding behavior
     Explain influences on behavior
     Summarize principles of positive guidance
     Describe guidance strategies to use for children with disabilities
     Apply positive strategies to address behaviors

Introduction

Social-emotional development is foundational to children's learning in all other domains.
Through children's experiences in close relationships with parents and teachers, children
develop and learn the social-emotional skills necessary to act and interact with self-confidence,
regulate their behavior, and be successful in the early school years and beyond. With the
guidance of responsive and caring adults, "young children develop an understanding of other
people's feelings and needs, are encouraged to feel empathy and caring, learn to manage their
own behavior as responsible group members, and acquire a variety of other capabilities that
will be directly related to their success in managing the classroom environment of kindergarten
or the primary grades" (CDE 2008, 4).2

The Teacher's Role: Build and Maintain Positive
Relationships with Children

Teachers build meaningful relationships with children during day-to-day interactions with them.
Since relationships are central to young children's learning and development, effective
preschool teachers engage in consistent efforts to develop positive and nurturing relationships
with each child they serve. Preschool teachers understand the importance of consistency,
continuity, and responsiveness in supporting children's healthy social and emotional
development (adapted from California Department of Education and First 5 California 2012,
121). In cases in which children display challenging behaviors, teachers can focus even more
directly on cultivating a relationship with the children during less stressful times (when children
behave appropriately) and rely on additional support through ongoing mentoring and coaching
(e.g., reflective supervision, early childhood mental health consultation) to put in place
effective strategies to establish and sustain positive relationships with young children. When
teachers engage in positive, nurturing relationships with young children, children feel safe and
confident to engage deeply in exploration and learning. For those children who come to the
classroom displaying challenging behaviors, nurturing, stable, and positive relationships with
teachers often help to provide them with the emotional support needed to develop future
positive relationships with teachers and peers (Buyse et al. 2008).3

Development is often referred to as a journey, not a race. Children navigate their journey
through individual rates of development. Along the journey, there are many milestones and
developmental successes to celebrate, but alongside these celebrations there are behavioral
considerations that challenge children and their caregivers. Teaching young children is not just
about creating an environment and a curriculum, but also providing limits, clear expectations
and applying developmentally appropriate strategies to guide young children in navigating their
journey. Most importantly, teachers must also demonstrate a sensitivity to a variety of
children's needs, temperaments and learning styles.4

Factors that Influence Behavior

There are many factors that influence the behaviors of children. It's important for teachers to
keep these in mind as they observe, interpret, and respond to children's behaviors.5

Developmental Factors by Age

While each child develops at their own rate and in their own time and may not match every
listed item, here are some general descriptions of children by age:

         1-2 Year Olds

Positive Approaches for Individual Factors, Personal Styles, and

Social/Emotional Needs

Young children communicate their needs and wants through behaviors. Educators and parents
can observe children's behavior and look for clues about what it means. Since families know
their children best, early childhood educators can ask families about their children's behaviors
and what they notice at home. Sometimes, the behavior's meaning is clear to adults. Other
times, educators and parents need to try different responses and watch the child's reactions.
Over time, adults will likely improve in responding effectively to a particular child's
communications.11

Motivation behind Behavior

In order to respond effectively to children's behaviors and to extend positive relationships with
children, it's important to understand the motivation behind children's behaviors and then
match your approach.12

                                    Table 6.3: Motivation13

                  Motivation                                  Approach
Attention - Positive or Negative            Provide positive attention
Power - To be the "boss"                    Provide many opportunities for choice
                                            making (choices you can live with) and
                                            practice decision-making

Revenge - Children that are hurt want to    Acknowledge intense feelings and stay
hurt others to feel important               positive
Inadequacy - Children don't want others to  Provide opportunities for positive success
expect anything from them for fear of
failure

Having Appropriate Expectations for Behavior

It is really important that we realize that often what adults consider to be challenging behaviors
are entirely age-appropriate responses from children. So it is important that teachers:

                       Prevention of Challenging Behavior for Children with Disabilities15
                       Challenging behavior can often be addressed through prevention strategies.
                       For children with disabilities who have challenging behavior, the process is
                       the same as for all children, but the strategies might differ depending on
                       children's Individual Education Plans (IEPs) and their specific needs and
                       strengths. The following strategies can be individualized as needed.

                       Classroom schedules and routines:
                            Have consistent schedules and routines
                            Make sure the content and length of activities are developmentally
                                appropriate
                            Be intentional about using visuals to teach routines
                            Give consistent feedback
                            Provide more individualized support for children with disabilities
                                who have challenging behavior during routines. They may need an
                                individualized visual schedule or a peer buddy, for example.

                       Transitions:
                            Try to minimize the number of transitions
                            Teach expectations
                            Model or provide visual examples of appropriate things to do while
                                waiting (counting, singing a group song, playing Simon Says)
                            Allow children to transition at separate times or in smaller groups as
                                needed

                       Large Group Activities:
                            Consider the length of the activity (especially circle time). Is it age
                                appropriate?
                            For children who are working on expanding their attention, shorten
                                wait times and allow breaks.
                            Use visuals to make rules clear and to break tasks into smaller steps
                            Provide ongoing feedback to expand children's understanding,
                                participation, and learning

Involving Children in Guidance Curriculum

It is a valuable learning experience to involve children in creating/defining the classroom rules.
They become invested in those expectations. Teachers should use the following umbrella when
creating classroom rules:

     Keep self safe: (walk inside, feet on the floor, etc...)
     Keep others safe: (keep hands to themselves)
     Keep materials/environment safe: (keep books on the shelf to prevent tearing, throw

         balls, dig with shovels, etc...)

                       Classroom Teaching Strategies for Positive Interactions and Prosocial
                       Behavior16
                       Instruction is more effective when it is embedded in the meaningful
                       activities and contexts that occur throughout a child's day (Katz & McClellan
                       1997). Here are suggestions and examples for teaching social skills within
                       classroom activities.

                       Modeling. Demonstrate the skill while explaining what you are doing. As
                       you pass a block to a child, say, "Look, I am sharing my blocks with my
                       friend."

                       Modeling with puppets. Use puppets to model the skill while interacting
                       with a child, an adult, or another puppet. A puppet can explain to the
                       teacher and the class how she became angry and hit her brother to get a
                       toy. You can ask the puppet to consider other solutions and then discuss
                       what a child might do when he or she wants a toy that another child is
                       using.

                       Preparing peer partners. Ask one child to show another child the skill or to
                       help the child use the target skill. You can prompt the peer by saying,
                       "Carmen, Justin is still learning how to wait and take turns. Since you know
                       what to do, can you help him? Show him the line-up picture while you wait
                       for a drink at the water fountain."

                       Singing. Introduce a new skill through a song. To teach children to trade
                       toys, pass out small toys during a large group activity, then sing the
                       following song to the tune of "Mary Had a Little Lamb" and practice trading:

                                I can be a problem solver, problem solver, problem solver, I can be a
                                problem solver, let me show you how.
                                Maybe I can trade with you, trade with you, trade with you, Maybe I
                                can trade with you; let me show you how.

                       Children then practice trading toys with each other.

                       Doing fingerplays. Introduce the skill with a finger- play, then follow up
                       with a discussion or story. While showing fingers, have children recite this
                       rhyme:

                                One little friend cried, "Boo-hoo"; a friend gives a hug and then
                                there are two.
                                Two little friends share with me; we play together and that makes
                                three.
                                Three little friends ask for more; they all say "Please," and then
                                comes four.

123 | I n t r o d u c t i o n t o C u r r i c u l u m f o r E a r l y C h i l d h o o d E d u c a t i o n
                                Four little friends take turns down the slide; another comes to play,
                                and that makes five.
                                Five little friends have fun at school, because they follow every rule.

                       Using a flannel board. Introduce a new skill using flannel board activities
                       and stories. For example, to teach turn taking you could have flannel pieces
                       for Humpty Dumpty and change the rhyme so that "All the king's horses
                       and all the king's friends / Work as a team to put Humpty together again."
                       As you say the rhyme, have the children take turns putting the pieces
                       (castle, bricks, Humpty Dumpty pieces, horses, and friends) on the flannel
                       board. When you finish the rhyme, extend the activity by talking about how
                       Humpty felt when he sat on the wall; when he fell; and when his friends
                       helped put him back together.

                       Using prompts. Give a child verbal, visual, or physical prompts to use a skill
                       during interactions and activities. When a child who has difficulty with
                       initiating play interactions moves toward a group playing together, you
                       might say privately, "Remember to use your words and ask to play."

                       Giving encouragement. Provide specific feedback when the child uses the
                       skill. For example, describe what the child did: "You asked Joey for a turn. I
                       saw that you two had a good time playing together." Encouragement can
                       be verbal or a signal (a thumbs-up or high five).

                       Using incidental teaching. Guide the child to use the skill during
                       interactions and activities. Quietly say to the child, "Quan, I see that you are
                       very angry that all the trucks are being used. What can you do when you
                       are angry? Let's go over the steps."

                       Playing games. Use games to teach problem solving, words that express
                       feelings, identification of others' feelings, friendship skills, and so on. Place
                       photographs of each child in a bag. Have the children take turns pulling a
                       photo out of the bag and offering a compliment to the child in the photo.

                       Discussing children's literature. Read books to help teach friendship skills,
                       feeling words, problem solving, and so on. While reading a story, pause and
                       ask the children how a character in the story might feel or ask them to
                       suggest ideas for solving the character's problem.

Stating Behavior Expectations

Behavioral expectations are the appropriate behaviors expected from children during specific
activities and routines. By stating behavioral expectations in advance of activities, routines and

transitions, we allow children more opportunities to be successful. When children clearly
understand what we expect of them, they can more securely play and work within a set of
parameters. Other benefits of teaching behavioral expectations are that it:

     Maximizes children's learning time. When we tell children our expectations ahead of
         time, we spend less time playing catch-up during the activity.

     Builds a common language. When we outline behavioral expectations for activities,
         routines and transitions, we help build a common language among the teachers and
         children. Using the same phrases during the same activities, help children to understand
         the meaning of the expectations (i.e., walking feet and putting breakfast dishes in the
         brown bucket).

     Provides a consistent message to children. Giving children mixed messages about what
         is okay and not okay detracts from learning and engagement over time. When we say,
         write, and model our message consistently to children, they are more likely to get it.

     Sets the stage for learning. Developing behavioral expectations before activities begin
         creates an atmosphere ripe for engagement and learning.

     Helps prevent behavior problems before they happen. When we tell children in positive
         ways what is expected of them before they act, we can more readily reinforce the
         behaviors we want to see, based on our stated expectations.17

                       Tips for Teachers - Stating Behavioral Expectations

                       Anticipate - Think through activities, routines, and expectations

                       Plan - Develop a plan to support appropriate behaviors by determining
                       which behaviors you want children to use and which behaviors you do not
                       want to see

State   What Children Should Do

    1.  Tell a child what to do instead of what not to do.
    2.  Show the child by modeling or using a picture of the action.
    3.  Clearly and simply state what you expect the child to do.
    4.  Remember that young children may use inappropriate behavior because they do not
        understand the social rules and/or because they are unable to consistently apply what
    5.  they are in the process of learning.
        Talk to young children using language they understand. Young children may not
    6.  understand a word like "don't" because it is a short word for "do not" and he/she may
        not know what the "negation" of a word means.
    7.  Encourage the child in a way that lets him/her know that he/she is exhibiting the
    8.  desired behavior. Use positive, descriptive acknowledgement while the child is making
        an effort or is doing the desired behavior.
        Some children will respond better to more subdued expressions, and acknowledging
        them in a "matter of fact" way might be more effective.
        For the most part, be enthusiastic and generous with encouragement. Most children can
        never get enough!

Here are some examples:

             Teacher Tips20
             The concept of time is very abstract for young children thus stating, "Clean
             up in five minutes" is not meaningful in terms of time. Suggested
             alternatives for directing clean up actions can include statements, "When
             the lights go off it will be time to clean up, "When you hear the ringing of
             the timer, it will be time to..."

             To further gain cooperation in transitioning from one activity to another
             consider,

                  Talking individually to children at their level so they can hear you
                      and know you are addressing them in particular

                  Allow them a space to place unfinished work to revisit at a later
                      time

                  Provide choices for cleaning up areas

             Assign jobs each day for clean-up (book collectors, snack helper, etc...)

Redirecting Behavior

Redirecting is a proactive teaching strategy used to address challenging behavior (something
that interferes with learning and engagement in prosocial interaction) BEFORE it escalates or
continues. Redirecting:

     Allows a teacher to guide children to engage in alternative behaviors that are more
         acceptable.

     Consists of instruction and simple cues teachers can easily embed into teachable
         moments throughout the day.

     Is one of multiple proactive teaching strategies teachers use in combination with other
         strategies (e.g., creating classroom rules, clearly stating expectations for classroom
         behaviors).

     Stops a child from engaging in a challenging behavior before it escalates.
     Re-engages a child with appropriate activities which is key to maximizing learning time.
     Maximizes learning time for all children in the classroom as they will not be distracted

         by the challenging behavior.

Teachers redirect challenging behavior by
     Minimizing attention to the challenging behavior.
     Providing a clear description of the behavior expected from the child (e.g., "You can ask
         for a turn nicely," or "We play with the trucks by driving them on the carpet.")
     Providing positive attention and/or feedback (e.g., "That's playing with the trucks safely,
         Miguel! I see you are driving them on the carpet."), or access to the desired material as
         soon as it is available.

Redirection can be used when a child
     is off task to redirect attention to the task.
     uses materials inappropriately to provide a reminder of how to use the materials
         properly.
     talks out of turn to help the child wait for a turn.
     gets upset by a situation to guide the child away from that situation, to address the
         child's feelings, and to engage the child in an alternate activity

Four types of redirecting are most commonly used in the preschool classroom:
     Verbal redirecting: A teacher gives an instruction which distracts the child from the
         challenging behavior and directs him to a more appropriate activity.
     Physical redirecting: A teacher physically prevents a child from engaging in a challenging
         behavior and redirects her to an alternative or new activity.
     Redirecting with a cue that is visual or gestural (e.g., a picture or gesture).

129 | I n t r o d u c t i o n t o C u r r i c u l u m f o r E a r l y C h i l d h o o d E d u c a t i o n
     Redirecting attention to a positive model in a child's proximity (proximal attention): For
         example, a teacher draws attention to a nearby child who is engaged in an appropriate
         behavior.21

Addressing Challenging Behavior

Preschool children rely on guidance from their teachers to practice and eventually master the
complex skills required to navigate social interactions with peers and adults. With guidance
from caring adults in their environment, preschool children can develop a sense of competence,
learn developmentally appropriate ways to socialize with peers, and resolve conflicts.22

Teacher's Role

As the adults that work with children on a daily basis and who form positive relationships with
them, teachers have a critical role in addressing challenging behaviors. Teachers should:

     Observe and identify the emotions underlying challenging behaviors.
     Gather input from colleagues, other program staff members, and families

         to gain a greater understanding of the function or purpose behind children's challenging
         behaviors and to develop strategies--including self-reflection and peer-reflection--for
         addressing those behaviors.
     Share observations appropriately and respect confidentiality when discussions involve
         children and families.
     Implement strategies designed by colleagues, families, and other specialists to address
         children's challenging behaviors.
     Develop, modify, and adapt schedules, routines, and the program environment to
         positively affect challenging behaviors.23

Program's Role

Teachers also need support from their programs. Programs should:
     Provide support and professional development on the practices that are most likely to
         prevent challenging behaviors in young children, including strong relationships,
         supportive environments (including carefully planned transitions, schedules, and
         grouping), and teaching social-emotional skills to children.
     Provide professional development opportunities to staff and resources to families on
         the use of strategies to respond to challenging behaviors, including support from
         behavioral or developmental specialists, early interventionists, and mental-health
         professionals as necessary.24

Conflict Resolution

Conflict is a natural part of social interactions. Teachers can help children navigate conflict
successfully by facilitating conflict resolution. Teachers should:

     Support children in expressing their emotions and negotiating conflict in
         developmentally appropriate ways.

     Model appropriate behavior for resolving conflicts.
     Refine and implement developmentally appropriate strategies to help children learn

         how to express emotions, negotiate conflict, and solve problems.
     Work with coworkers to utilize a similar and consistent process with children in the

         same classroom or environment.
     Engage colleagues and other program staff, children, and families in discussions around

         conflict resolution.25

                       Steps for Resolving Conflict26
                       Include the children directly involved and use these steps

                           1. Acknowledge there is a problem or conflict: What happened? How
                                do you feel?
                                 Approach children calmly, take deep breaths, and acknowledge
                                    feelings
                                 Ask what happened and how do you feel?; hear from both
                                    children. This is about listening to each other

                           2. Ask for solution ideas
                                 See if the children have ideas first
                                 Get a "solution kit" if needed

                           3. Give it a try
                                 Get the children to signal agreement: thumbs up, hand shake
                                 You can state the solution again if needed and provide PDA
                                    (Positive, Descriptive Acknowledgment) for being flexible, being
                                    good at solving problems, asking for help, staying calm

                           4. Follow up with children, use PDA (Positive, Descriptive
                                Acknowledgment)

                       It's important to see that the issue is resolved or that the children move on.

The Teaching Pyramid

Challenging behavior often indicates that a child is experiencing stress from a number of
factors: internal stress from fatigue, poor nutrition, illness, pain or discomfort; external stress
from a mismatch in the classroom environment or expectations, poor relationships with the

teachers or children, overly difficult or overly simple tasks, limited social skills, trauma in the
home environment; or a combination of these factors. A consistent and supportive teacher or
other important adult can provide support for the child during short periods of stress. If
challenging behavior continues over longer periods of time, it may be necessary to examine
possible contributors to the behavior in the classroom and from other sources. A tiered
intervention framework such as the Teaching Pyramid may be an appropriate response to
challenging behavior.
The teaching pyramid model (Fox et al. 2003) describes a primary level of universal practices--
classroom preventive practices that promote the social and emotional development of all
children built on a foundation of positive relationships; secondary interventions that address
specific social and emotional learning needs of children at risk for challenging behavior; and
development of individualized interventions (tertiary level) for children with persistent problem
behavior (see the diagram "The Teaching Pyramid").27

Universal classroom practices include developmentally appropriate, child-centered classroom
environments that promote children's developing independence, successful interactions, and
engagement in learning. While universal practices may be enough to promote the development
of social competence in the majority of children in the classroom, teachers may find that there
are children whose lack of social and emotional skills or whose challenging behavior requires
more focused attention.

According to the California Collaborative on Social and Emotional Foundations for Early
Learning (CA CSEFEL), fundamental to promoting social and emotional competence in young
children is guiding children in their efforts to build positive relationships with adults and peers
and creating supportive social and emotional learning environments for all children. For
children at risk of developing behavior problems, targeted social and emotional strategies may
be necessary, and for those children who display very persistent and severe challenging and
behavior problems, individualized intensive interventions are required, when the children do
not respond to typical preventive practices, child guidance procedures, or social-emotional
teaching strategies that would normally work with most children (CA CSEFEL Teaching Pyramid,

Moving from Praise to Acknowledgment: Providing
Children with Authentic Support

The way teachers respond to positive behavior also has an impact. We can encourage children's
efforts by providing specific acknowledgement rather than empty praise (which can either
become meaningless or addictive for a child).

 "The only lifelong, reliable motivations are those that come from within, and one of
 the strongest of those is the joy and pride that grow from knowing that you've just
 done something as well as you can do it."

 -Lloyd Dobens and Clare Crawford-Mason

When a child has done something impressive, instead of saying, "Good job," try one of the
following:

    1. Report what you see (narrating).
         A short, objective statement such as, "You put your dishes in the tub," or "You figured
         out a solution to the problem," acknowledges children's efforts and allows them to
         judge for themselves the merits of their achievement. Elaborate on the details of their
         actions to provide more specific feedback. For example, "It looks like you used blue and
         green to make an ocean."

    2. Connect it with a desired character trait, value, or expectation (PDA: Positive,
         Descriptive Acknowledgment).

         When a child does something that is an example of a character trait, value or
         expectation, add the expectations language to the comment. For example, if a child has
         put away toys on the floor say, "You cleaned up the blocks. You are keeping the area
         safe." Or if they helped a friend you might say, "You gave Yoon Seo the fire truck. That's
         being friendly." Expectations language provides definitions for the character words,
         builds self-efficacy (belief that you have the ability to succeed at a task), and helps the
         child to internalize the behaviors.

    3. Emphasize the impact on others.

         If a child does something caring or something that benefits the community,
         acknowledge the positive impact. For example, if a child has put away toys on the floor
         say, "You cleaned up the blocks. Now someone else can have a turn." Or if they helped a
         friend you might say, "You gave Yoon Seo the fire truck. He looks really happy to have
         it." Such language builds a sense of agency (ability to intentionally make things happen
         through your actions) by drawing the child's attention to the impact his/her actions
         have on another child.

    4. Ask open-ended questions.

         Being curious encourages the child to reflect. "What do you like best about your
         tower?" or "How did you know to put the puzzle piece there?" Asking open-ended
         questions builds language and engages the children in abstract thinking.

    5. Say nothing.

         When children are playing, we often feel the need to continually comment on their
         actions. This can be disruptive and can create an extrinsic motivation to explore. Let

134 | I n t r o d u c t i o n t o C u r r i c u l u m f o r E a r l y C h i l d h o o d E d u c a t i o n
         children take joy in their own learning and allow them to experience the pride of their
         own accomplishments.30

Planning for Guiding Behavior

The plans for guiding behavior, although typically not seen on a daily or weekly plan posted for
all to see, will likely be found in the program manual. In a program manual, teachers and
administrators explain strategies for guiding children's behavior to support learning how to get
along respectfully and cooperatively with others. Short written handouts on common issues like
sharing, biting, hitting, or name-calling are also useful ways to make visible to families how
teachers support young children in getting along respectfully and cooperatively with others.
(The CA CSEFEL Teaching Pyramid Web site at https://cainclusion.org/teachingpyramid/ is a
resource that provides downloadable handouts on such topics in English, Chinese, and Spanish.)
It is important that families see that such planning is part of the broad definition of curriculum.
Families are integral to this planning, as they have their own perspectives on guiding learning
and behavior. Collaborating with families opens up possibilities to help children learn
expectations both at home and at school, because children are learning ways of being with
others in both settings.

There will be times when social-emotional development and negotiating relationships between
children take center stage in the written plan. For example, in a toddler classroom, several
children might be learning the importance of not biting others when they are upset. This
behavior might become a focus for teacher reflection and curriculum planning for the group at
large for several weeks. Teachers might decide to read stories to the children about things to do
when angry. Or schedules may be adjusted to allow a teacher to shadow a child who tends to
bite when upset. Teachers might also document over the course of several days to see if biting
tends to occur at particular times.

Another example comes from a classroom of three-year-olds who are all new to the program.
The term "cleanup time" may not make sense to the children, so the teachers plan
opportunities when children can experience and discuss what this term means. It becomes the
topic of discussion during a large-group gathering. It also takes on a special look during the
cleanup that happens before lunch, as a teacher adds a new routine in which each child gets to
pull from a basket a sign that says, "I cleaned" and carries it into the meal area. The idea of
cleanup also gets written into a story, dictated by several children who are dismayed that not
everyone was helping with cleanup. The teachers make time during large-group gathering to
read the story. Prompted by the teacher's suggestions, several children illustrate the story,
which becomes part of a homemade book that finds a home in the book/story area.31

                 Preschoolers

Objectives

By the end of this introduction, you should be able to:
     Summarize the developmental characteristics of preschoolers
     Explain what learning foundations are
     Describe the purpose of the curriculum frameworks
     Discuss the role of the Desired Results Developmental Profile
     Identify the domains that we categorize curriculum into for the purpose of learning
         about planning and implementing it

What Preschoolers are Like

In order to plan for children it is vital to begin with one aspect of developmentally appropriate
practice, which relates to the developmental characteristics of children based on their age.
Here are some representations of what children are like at each age in the preschool years. You
can find more developmental milestones in Appendix E.

You will notice that consideration for the other two aspects of developmentally appropriate
practice which are also critical to our work, understanding individual children and seeing
children in the context of their families and larger culture, are included throughout each
domain based chapter.

Using the California Preschool Learning Foundations,
California Preschool Curriculum Framework, and Desired
Results Developmental Profile

The following six chapters on planning curriculum for preschools have been compiled using the
California Preschool Learning Foundations and the Preschool Curriculum Frameworks. These
well-researched documents published by the California Department of Education can be used
along with the Desired Results Developmental Profile (DRDP), to support implementing the
curriculum planning process with young children.

Each of these resources fulfills an important role in the curriculum planning process:
     The Foundations are what we want children to learn and develop.

     The Curriculum Framework outline how teachers can support this learning and
         development.

     And the Desired Results Developmental Profile is a tool to assess children's learning and
         development and to inform programming.2

California Preschool Learning Foundations

The foundations describe competencies--knowledge and skills--that most children can be
expected to exhibit in a high quality program as they complete their first or second year of
preschool. In other words, the foundations are destination points of learning that, with
appropriate support, children move toward and often reach during the preschool years.

The foundations are designed to promote understanding of young children's development of
knowledge and skills and to help with considering appropriate ways to support children's
learning. In essence, the foundations serve as a cornerstone for educating practitioners about
children's learning and development. The foundations are designed to be used in combination
with other sources of information: formal educational course work on early learning and
development, information on individual differences, including those related to disabilities,
knowledge about the contribution of cultural and linguistic experiences to early development,
and English-language development, insights from children's families, and the practical
experiences of preschool teachers and program directors.

The support needed to attain the competencies varies from child to child. Many children learn
simply by participating in high-quality preschool programs. Such programs offer children
environments and experiences that encourage active playful exploration and experimentation.
With play as an integral part of the curriculum, high-quality programs include purposeful
teaching to help children gain knowledge and skills.3

The foundations are at the heart of the California Department of Education's (CDE) approach to
promoting preschool learning. Teachers use best practices, curricular strategies, and
instructional techniques that assist children in learning the knowledge and skills described in
the preschool learning foundations. The "how-to's" of teaching young children include setting
up environments, supporting children's self-initiated play, selecting appropriate materials, and
planning and implementing teacher-guided learning activities.

Two major considerations underlie the "how-tos" of teaching. First, teachers can effectively
foster early learning by thoughtfully considering the preschool learning foundations as they
plan environments and activities. And second, during every step in the planning for young
children's learning, teachers have an opportunity to tap into the prominent role of play.
Teachers can best support young children by both encouraging the rich learning that occurs in
children's self-initiated play and by introducing purposeful instructional activities that playfully
engage preschoolers in learning.

Professional development is a key component of early care and education in fostering
preschool learning. The foundations can become a unifying element for both preservice and in-
service professional development. Preschool program directors and teachers can use the
foundations to facilitate curriculum planning and implementation. At the center of the CDE's
evolving system for supporting young children during the preschool years, the foundations are
designed to help teachers be intentional and focus their efforts on the knowledge and skills that
all young children need to acquire for success in preschool and early elementary school--and
throughout life.4

                       Making Connections
                       Here's an example of a learning foundation from the Music strand of the
                       Visual and Performing Arts Domain.

                       3.3 Improvise vocally and instrumentally

                       This foundation will be connected to the CA Preschool Curriculum
                       Framework and the Desired Results Developmental Profile 2015 later in this
                       introduction. 5

California Preschool Curriculum Framework

Young children enter preschool with a sense of wonder and a love of learning. They have an
insatiable appetite for knowledge when they have learning experiences that are engaging and
enjoyable. Positive experiences in which children can make choices and explore help them feel
competent and confident. How can we offer them engaging and enjoyable learning experiences
that fuel their intellectual engines and build their confidence? How can we connect children's
fascination with learning in every domain and make the most of their time in preschool? With
these questions in mind, the California Department of Education (CDE) developed the
curriculum framework for preschool programs, which include any early childhood setting where
three- to five-year-old children receive education and care.

      Figure 3: Some of the most engaging play is sensory-based. What might these children be learning here?6

This curriculum framework provides an overall approach for teachers to support children's
learning through environments and experiences that are:

     developmentally appropriate
     reflective of thoughtful observation and intentional planning
     individually and culturally meaningful
     inclusive of children with disabilities or other special needs.

The framework presents ways of setting up environments, encouraging and building upon
children's self-initiated play, selecting appropriate materials, and planning and implementing
teacher-guided learning activities. As preschool teachers plan learning environments and
experiences, the foundations provide the background information to:

     understand children's developing knowledge and skills
     consider appropriate ways to support children's learning and development.
In essence, curriculum planning should offer children learning opportunities that are attuned to
their developing abilities and their interests and should be connected with their experiences at
home and in their communities.
In the National Association for the Education of Young Children's accreditation criteria, it is
stated that a curriculum includes the goals for the knowledge and skills to be acquired by
children and the plans for learning experiences through which such knowledge and skills will be
acquired. A preschool curriculum typically defines a sequence of integrated experiences,
interactions, and activities to help young children reach specific learning goals. A curriculum
framework provides general guidance on planning learning environments and experiences for
young children. Thus, as a curriculum framework, this document provides:
     principles for supporting young children's learning
     an overview of key components of curriculum planning for young children, including

         observation, documentation, and reflection
     descriptions of routines, environments, and materials that engage children in learning
     sample strategies for building on children's knowledge, skills, and interests

                  Figure 4: This teacher is engaging in a planned activity with a small group of children.7

Eight principles have guided the development of this curriculum framework. Grounded in early
childhood research and practice, the following eight principles emphasize offering young

children individually, culturally, and linguistically responsive learning experiences and
environments:

    1. Relationships are central.
    2. Play is a primary context for learning.
    3. Learning is integrated.
    4. Intentional teaching enhances children's learning experiences.
    5. Family and community partnerships create meaningful connections.
    6. Individualization of learning includes all children.
    7. Responsiveness to culture and language supports children's learning.
    8. Time for reflection and planning enhances teaching.8
The concepts and strategies described in the preschool curriculum framework require
thoughtful planning and implementation. They are grounded in evidence-based practices that
have evolved in the early childhood education field over decades. The ability to apply a broad
understanding of early learning and development in the preschool setting takes time and
experience. With appropriate professional development, preschool program administrators and
teachers can use the curriculum framework to guide their planning and implementation of
environments and experiences that allow all young children to prosper during the preschool
years.9

                       Making Connections
                       How do teachers use the Curriculum Frameworks to support children's
                       development of the foundations? Here are some takeaways from the
                       Curriculum Framework in Visual and Performing Arts domain that will
                       support the example foundation "Improvise vocally and instrumentally"
                       mentioned before:

                       A guiding principle:
                            Children make their own meaning. Original, imaginative expression
                                is a natural occurrence when children engage in the arts that is
                                scaffolded by adults in an appropriate environment.

                       A basic needs for the environment and materials:
                            It is important that music not be limited to prerecorded songs.
                                Music is an active process. Music may be a little more demanding of
                                specialized materials. A variety of rhythm instruments, such as
                                wooden blocks, bongo drums, or hollow, hardwood boxes, can be
                                used by children; little instruction is necessary. When these
                                materials are not available, clapping hands and stomping feet can
                                keep rhythm. Other musical instruments that may extend this
                                collection include recorder-like wind instruments, shakers, stringed
                                plucking devices, and so on.

                       Teachers can support music foundations by:
                       [Providing] music areas where children can experience instruments or
                       musical activities as individuals or in a small group.10

Desired Results Developmental Profile (DRDP)

The Desired Results Developmental Profile (2015) is a developmental continuum from early
infancy to kindergarten entry. It is a formative assessment instrument developed by the
California Department of Education for young children and their families used to inform
curricular decisions and program development. It was designed to improve the quality of
programs and services provided to young children who are enrolled in child care outside the
home.

Key Features of the DRDP 2015
     It is administered in natural settings through teacher observations, family observations,
         and examples of children's work. Ongoing documentation of children's knowledge and
         skills in everyday environments is a recommended practice for early childhood
         assessment. It is completed by the teacher who best knows the child.

     "[It] is written to facilitate observation during the developmentally age-appropriate
         play-based and instructional activities that are typical in high-quality programs."

     It represents a full continuum of development from early infancy up to kindergarten
         entry. It has two views: the Infant/Toddler view for use with children in infant/toddler
         programs, and the Preschool View, for children in preschool programs.

     It is designed for use with all children from early infancy up to kindergarten entry,
         including children with special needs.

     It is aligned with all volumes of the California's Infant/Toddler and Preschool Learning
         and Development Foundations, the Common Core Standards, and the Head Start Child
         Development and Early Learning Framework.

     It takes into consideration the specific cultural and linguistic characteristics of
         California's diverse population of young children, with specific consideration for children
         who are young dual language learners (see section below).

     It was developed with the goal of ensuring that all children have the opportunity to
         demonstrate their knowledge and skills. To enable access to the assessment for diverse
         populations, the principles of Universal Design were followed. It is embedded into
         program activities, not contrived activities.11

Dividing Development and Curriculum Into Domain

We know that children certainly do not develop in isolated domains (as the images earlier in
this introduction might lead you to assume). Their development is holistic and the domains are
interrelated. What happens in one domain or area influences and/or is influenced by what
happens in other domains or areas. We also know that learning is integrated and that
curriculum should reflect that. Children do not just learn about one curriculum area or domain.
A spontaneous or planned experience will touch on numerous curriculum areas.

                                                Figure 6: Domains of Development14

But to make these domains easier to explore we study them separately, while keeping in mind
that they are interconnected and interrelated.

The Preschool Learning Foundations and Curriculum Frameworks are divided into nine
domains. Our book will feature these as eight separate chapters. This table summarizes how
these are related. 15

Objectives:

By the end of the chapter, you should be able to:
     Explain how social-emotional development lays the foundation for and is interrelated
         with all other domains and areas of development
     Describe the foundations in social and emotional development that high quality early

         development
     Identify ways educators can support children's social and emotional development
     Summarize ways to engage families in curriculum for social and emotional development

Introduction

Social-emotional development indicates how preschool children acquire the social skills, self-
awareness, and personal qualities that are interconnected with learning in a classroom. Why is
social-emotional development important to early learning?

     Many social-emotional qualities--such as curiosity; self-confidence as a learner; self-
         control of attention, thinking, and impulses; and initiative in developing new ideas--are
         essential to learning at any age. Learning, problem solving, and creativity rely on these
         social-emotional and motivational qualities as well as basic cognitive skills.

     When learning occurs in groups, such as in preschool classrooms or family child care
         programs, the social environment significantly influences how learning occurs. When
         young children enjoy interacting with adults and other children, they are more
         enthusiastic about activities and participate more.

     The interest and enthusiasm of others fuels the child's own excitement about learning,
         and children are also motivated by others' acknowledgment of the child's
         accomplishments.

     Children who have been reported as having the greatest difficulties in learning are
         hindered by the lack of social-emotional qualities more than academic concepts.

     The developing brain is not neatly divided into separate areas governing learning,
         thinking, and emotions. Instead, it is a highly interconnected organ with different
         regions influencing, and being affected by, the others. This means, for example, that
         young children who experience emotional challenges (perhaps because of stress) are
         less ready for learning because the brain regions related to memory are being affected
         by other regions governing emotion. 1

                   What is your reaction to the importance of social and emotional development

                   most people are aware of this?

Guiding Principles for Supporting Social and Emotional
Development

Early learning is supported by attention to social-emotional development. Rather than taking
time away from activities promoting learning and thinking, attention to the development of
self, social interactions, and relationships is an essential component of an early childhood
curriculum designed to promote learning in all young children. Here are some guiding principles
on how to do that:

     Support social-emotional development with intentionality and ample opportunities to
         practice skills

     Attend to the impact of overall program design on social-emotional development (how
         you group children, what you model, etc.)

     Utilize curriculum practices that support healthy social-emotional development,
         including:
             o allow many opportunities for practicing social interaction and relationship skills
             o provide support for the growth of age and developmentally appropriate self-
                  regulation abilities
             o encourage curiosity and initiative
             o provide each child a network of nurturing, dependable adults who will actively
                  support and scaffold his or her learning in a group setting

     The most effective approach is play-based active learning

Here are some additional strategies to support children's social and emotional development:
     Create a program environment and daily routines that offer children opportunities for
         responsible and cooperative roles in the classroom or family child care community.
     Model desirable behavior and attitudes in interactions with children and other adults.
     Use the family culture to create bridges between the program and the home, supporting
         children's pride in their family experience, and understand individual differences in
         background and viewpoint.
     Enlist adults as active co-explorers in children's chosen activities.
     Encourage children's ideas, initiative, and contributions to shared activities.
     Observe children attentively, as they play, to understand each child's needs, interests,
         strengths, and areas of growth in social-emotional development.
     Establish developmentally and culturally appropriate expectations for children's
         behavior, especially expectations for self-control and self-regulation.
     Narrate for children what they are observed doing and expressing, providing language
         to describe their thoughts and feelings and to clarify others' feelings.
     Provide specific feedback to children about their efforts, reinforcing their choices that
         support learning and linking their actions to outcomes.
     Coach and guide children's behavior by using positive, respectful phrasing and tone to
         prompt problem solving and to give brief instructions and reminders.
     Help children to understand social cues (facial expressions, body language, tone of
         voice). This can be fostered by simply allowing the children to freely play with their
         peers (learning through experience), or by modeling your own thought processes by
         thinking out loud ("I wonder what it means when Hayden is crying?")3

  Figure 7.2: Children's emotions sometimes look like this. But with adult support they can learn to self-regulate.4

Environmental Factors in Supporting Social and Emotional
Development

The physical environment provides young children with expectations for behavior. When
educators are mindful of the aesthetics, organization, and function of each area in the space,
challenging behavior is likely to decrease while constructive, cooperative behavior increases.
A program's vision for learning and philosophy of care dictate how an environment is designed.
For example, if the curriculum is based on the view that children are competent directors of
their own learning, educators develop a physical setting and activities that reflect children's
emerging interests and provide easy access to meaningful play materials. Shelves for
manipulatives and other materials are near the floor where children can easily reach them.
Special areas in the room are designed for individual, small-group, and larger-group
interactions. Play materials and other materials are carefully selected to reflect children's
emerging interests, as observed in the context of play and conversation. In this environment,
adult-child interactions can expand children's questions and comments.

High-quality learning environments set the stage for social-emotional exploration and growth.
When children are presented with a warm, inviting, and culturally familiar environment, they
feel comfortable and secure. The attractive spaces adults prepare for children communicate
expectations of responsibility and cooperative care (we all play in and care for this beautiful
place together).

Figure 7.3: This classroom sends clear messages about how children are to play with the materials and each other.5

Preparing a variety of learning areas with open-ended materials encourages each child to
participate in meaningful play experiences that match their individual temperaments and
abilities. Incorporating elements from the home creates an atmosphere of community while
simultaneously acknowledging the presence of individuals.

A physical environment that supports social-emotional learning has the following
characteristics:

     Challenging and developmentally appropriate materials
     Ample supply of materials
     Appropriately sized small-group activities
     A variety of small-group activities within a range of adult supervision
     Aesthetically appealing
     Spaces to be with others and spaces to be alone
     Furnishings and materials accessible to children
     Displays of children's work
     Space for children's belongings
     Reflective of diversity
     Space for arrivals and departures
     Supportive of children's active engagement
     Outdoor areas supportive of social-emotional development
Just as the physical environment helps young children successfully meet the social-emotional
demands of the curriculum so, too, does the design of the daily schedule. Young children are
better able to manage themselves and their relationships when daily routines and activities are
predictable, transitions are signaled and supported, and there is a balance between relatively
active and relatively quiet play and between group and individual activities. In the sections that
follow, strategies to support social-emotional development are described in detail.6

                       Helping Children Cope with Stress
                       Teachers in an early childhood education program are often the first
                       persons outside the family to become aware that a young child may be
                       experiencing overwhelming stress. They may notice a child who reacts with
                       uncharacteristic aggression to a peer's comment that would not bother
                       another child, or they may notice that a child has become unusually quiet
                       and withdrawn lately. Young children convey their stress in individualized
                       ways: some are emotionally over-reactive, while others are emotionally
                       over-controlled; some become clingy, others withdrawn; some become
                       provocative and defiant. A common characteristic is that young children
                       under stress exhibit a marked change from their ordinary behavior. They
                       often lose their capacity for competence and self-control that they
                       previously had. When teachers observe these changes in a child, it can be
                       helpful to consult with parents to discover whether recent events have
                       created challenges that children are having difficulty managing. Often these
                       challenges arise from within the family.

                       How can teachers assist young children under stress? One of the most
                       important things they can do is provide the child with a predictable, safe
                       haven where children can feel secure. Teachers can create a comfortable
                       and comforting everyday routine that is child-centered, individualized,
                       responsive, and helpfully structured to give young children a sense of
                       control and predictability that may be lacking in other aspects of the child's
                       life. Central to these efforts is providing children with supportive adult
                       relationships that are reliable and helpful. This may be more difficult than
                       one would expect because young children under stress often test these
                       relationships to see whether teachers and other adults will remain
                       responsive to them even when children act defiantly or negatively.

                                                    Figure 7.4: A teacher who cares makes a difference.7

                       In some circumstances, it can be helpful for teachers to obtain the advice of
                       an early childhood mental health consultant who can observe the child in
                       the classroom, talk with the teacher about the child's behavior, and suggest
                       strategies for providing supportive assistance. Early childhood mental
                       health consultants can be valuable resources to an early childhood
                       education program. They can help teachers provide much-needed support
                       to young children who may not have other such sources of support
                       elsewhere in their lives.8

                   Pause to Reflect
                   What environments make you feel most socially and emotionally competent?
                   How do you deal with your stress? Why should you be thinking about those
                   things as a teacher?

Introducing to the Foundations

The domain of social-emotional development encompasses three areas or strands:
     self
     social interaction
     relationships9

Supporting Children's Developing Self

Early learning deeply engages the self. Most preschool children approach learning opportunities
with enthusiasm and self-confidence, excited by the prospect of new discovery. Their successes
(and occasional failures) shape their sense of what they can do and sometimes drive their
efforts to acquire new skills. Their achievements and occasional disappointments also provoke
the responses of others--adults and peers--that further influence children's self-concept and
self-confidence. Young children value learning for themselves because it is valued by the people
who matter to them.

In a preschool program, learning is a social activity. Therefore, preschool children's success in
learning depends on their capacity to understand and participate constructively in the social
environment. Early childhood is a period of rapid growth in social and emotional understanding
in which the children's capacity for empathy and caring is also developing. This is also a period
of growth in self-regulation as young children are acquiring skills for sustaining their attention,
focusing their thinking and problem-solving, managing their behavioral impulses, and
controlling their emotions. Even so, lapses in self-regulation are as apparent as young children's

successes, and developmentally appropriate expectations for children's self-control are
essential.

Figure 7.5: This group of children is working together, with their teacher, to connect these pieces.10

Therefore, a thoughtfully designed preschool curriculum that supports social-emotional
development devotes considerable attention to the direct and indirect ways that children's
classroom experiences shape the development of self.

The foundations for Self include those for self-awareness, self-regulation, social and emotional
understanding, empathy and caring, and initiative in learning:

                                               Self

Teachers can support children's development of the Self with the following:
     Provide ample space, use child-sized shelves and furnishings, and adapt materials to
         make all learning areas and activities accessible
     Designate learning areas to help children select preferred sites for exploration
     Place active play zones away from quiet areas to better support children in their choices
         for play
     Make use of adaptive tools and play materials to help the autonomous exploration of
         children with special needs
     Observe individual children attentively during a variety of activities
     Incorporate artwork and play materials that reflect children's home cultures
     Describe aloud for children observations of what they do and express as they play,
         explore, and participate in group activities
     Compare aloud children's past and present abilities as you observe them
     Give specific feedback to children about their efforts
     Use planned activities and children's own observations to draw attention to people's
         similarities and differences, including preferences and feelings
     Set up opportunities to practice problem solving with children who have not yet
         developed those skills
     Use appropriately stimulating aesthetic elements such as soothing colors, natural woods
         and fibers, and soft textures
     Eliminate or reduce background noise to help children attend to what you want them to
         hear

                       Vignettes
                       A child in a wheelchair enters the housekeeping area where three children
                       are pretending to be a family. They have dishes on the table and dolls in the
                       doll bed. The child in the wheelchair moves closer to the table and tries to
                       join the play but cannot get close enough. After a few minutes, one of the
                       children takes some dishes and puts them on the wheelchair tray. The two
                       children play together. Mr. Luke comments, "I like your idea to use Andy's
                       tray as a table."

                       Chloe cries in Ms. Julia's arms. Ms. Julia pats her back softly and
                       communicates in a soothing manner. "It sounds like that hurt. You can tell
                       Paz you don't like that. Say, `I don't like that, Paz.'" Chloe tucks her injured
                       arm in toward Ms. Julia's body, shakes her head slowly side to side, and
                       looks out warily at Paz. Paz stands close with her head lowered. "Chloe is
                       upset because you pinched her arm. It hurt her quite a bit. Is there
                       something you think we could do to help her feel better, Paz?" asks Ms.
                       Julia.

                       Paz responds softly, "Sorry, Chloe," and reaches forward to give Chloe a
                       hug.

                       Chloe whimpers and clings more closely to Ms. Julia. "When a friend is hurt,
                       giving a hug often helps. I guess Chloe isn't ready for a hug right now. Thank
                       you for trying, Paz. Maybe we can ask her again later."13

Supporting Children's Social Interaction

Group learning always involves social interaction. The ease and skill with which children interact
with adults and peers (in a preschool classroom or family child care program) and the
competence with which they assume their roles and responsibilities as group members
significantly influence how they learn. The development of these skills in the preschool years is
a foundation for children's capacity to be socially skilled and competent classroom members in
the primary grades.

For some children, unfortunately, difficulties in social interaction--because children are timid
and inhibited, are aggressive or disruptive, struggle with being cooperative, or have physical or
behavioral characteristics that often result in them being excluded--can pose significant
obstacles to benefiting from social interactions with adults and peers. For them and for all
children, attention to social interaction skills can be a significant contribution to preschool
children's learning in early childhood classrooms.

A thoughtfully designed preschool curriculum that supports social-emotional development
devotes considerable attention, therefore, to the direct and indirect ways that classroom
experiences shape the growth of children's social interaction skills. This includes interactions
with adults, peers, and in groups as well as cooperation and responsibility.

Introduction

Language is one of the most crucial tools that children acquire, one that is essential for
cognitive development, reading achievement, and overall school performance, as well as for
social relations. It allows people to share a society's achievements and history and the deepest
emotions. Language includes conventional sounds, gestures, and visual symbols, such as
writing, that are used separately and jointly for purposes of communication.

The human brain is "hard-wired" to learn language, a process quite similar in all children. Yet
children differ a good deal as to when they hit milestones such as when they use their first
words, start to combine words into sentences, and use complex sentence forms to
communicate meaning. Though children begin to develop language and literacy at birth, with
nonverbal cues such as eye gaze and gestures, they arrive at preschool ready to communicate
with symbols: words, signs, and pictures.

Children's early language and literacy environments often vary, with the amount and kind of
experiences differing across families. Some children experience more conversations and book
reading than other children and more than one language. Some children see print primarily in
the environment (e.g., street signs, store coupons, labels on containers). Other children engage
with print in many contexts, including books read to them regularly.

Figure 8.1: These children are really engaged with these books. Their prior experience with books and being read to
                                           helps them understand how books are used.1

Some children have opportunities to scribble, draw, and write with crayons and markers long
before they come to preschool, while others have few of these emergent writing opportunities.
Teachers should encourage all preschoolers to join in activities that will expand their language
and literacy skills. Each child's family should be invited to participate in this exciting process.
The following components constitute oral language:

                                       Figure 8.1: Parts of Oral and Sign Language System2

     Phonology--the sound system of language, such as noticing that hat, cat, and mat differ
         by only a single initial sound

     Semantics--the meaning conveyed by words, phrases, and sentences
     Syntax or grammar--the rules that govern how sentences are put together
     Morphology--the units of meaning within a language, also called morphemes, such as --

         ed for past tense (e.g., walked) and s for plural (e.g., dogs)
     Vocabulary--the words in a given language
     Pragmatics--the rules of language used in social contexts (e.g., one would talk

         differently to the president than to one's mother). Pragmatics includes gathering
         information, requesting, and communicating. Good conversations depend on staying on
         the topic and turn-taking

These components are used in the auditory (i.e., listening, speaking) and visual (i.e., sign,
reading, writing) modalities. Language allows children to express their feelings and needs,
acknowledge the feelings and needs of others, and to talk about emotions.

              Figure 8.2: Language allows you to express yourself, understand others, and work together. 3

Preschool is also an exciting time for written language development and for promoting interest
in reading. If the social and physical environments in preschool and the home support the
development of reading and written language, children will want to hear stories from books
and to use books to find out more about things of interest. They will also be inclined to create
marks that approximate letters and to learn how to write their own names. They will enjoy
playing with the sounds of language as well. All of these experiences are foundations for the
conventional reading and writing that come later.4

                       Research Highlight
                       The principles and curricular suggestions offered in this chapter are based
                       on 40 years of scientific research on language acquisition and literacy
                       development. Here are just a few of the amazing discoveries that form the
                       background of this chapter. The following findings come from this vast body
                       of research:

                            Even in infancy, children are active learners who use data from the
                                language they hear to grasp patterns. Children learning language
                                behave as young mathematicians who respond to patterns and
                                calculate, for instance, that in English -ed generally comes at the
                                end of verbs to indicate the past tense (e.g., he walked or it
                                dropped).

                            When young children hear language around them, they are
                                accumulating the data they need to use their skills and to grasp the
                                features of their native language. In addition, the very practice of
                                reading with children (e.g., starting at the front of a book and
                                moving page by page to the end) teaches the patterns of book
                                structure and handling and the general ways that print works (e.g.,
                                English is read from the left to right and top to bottom on a page).
                                When book reading is accompanied by explicit comments (e.g.,
                                "This is the title of the book: Whistle for Willie") and actions (e.g.,
                                underlining the title as it is read), children learn even more about
                                the features of books and how print works.

                            Children's storytelling skill and vocabulary development are
                                supported through shared reading experiences. Stories have a
                                predictable structure: setting, characters, a problem, and its
                                resolution. As children hear stories, they learn this basic structure
                                and begin to use this knowledge to shape the stories they create.
                                Children also learn the meaning of new words from listening to
                                multiple readings of good stories, "friendly explanations of words"
                                (explanations with wording and examples within the preschool
                                child's grasp rather than a more formal definition from a dictionary)
                                offered by teachers and parents as they read stories to children, and
                                from engagement with adults in discussions during story reading.5

Guiding Principles for Supporting Language and Literacy

It is critical that teachers and caregivers be responsive to young children's attempts at
communication and language by focusing on things that are meaningful to the children and
their families. No single component of any curriculum will have more impact on a preschooler's
development than language.

Figure 8.3: Listening to children's message (and not correcting their errors) is vital to their language development.6

Preschool is also an exciting time for written language development and for promoting interest
in reading. If the social and physical environments in preschool and the home support the
development of reading and writing, children will want to hear stories from books and to use

books to find out more about things of interest. They will also be inclined to create marks that
approximate letters and to learn how to write their own names. They will enjoy playing with the
sounds of language as well. All of these experiences are foundations for the conventional
reading and writing that come later.

Here are some guiding principles on how to support children's language and emerging literacy:
     Language and literacy work together. They often occur in the same context. And having
         well-developed oral language contributes to later success with more formal reading and
         writing.
     The more language children hear, the more their language grows.
     It is important to give children rich models of speech/communication and reading and
         writing.
     Opportunities to learn language and literacy are everywhere.
     Children learn best from experiences that are interesting, useful, and fun. This includes
         silly songs, poems with surprise endings, and interesting and informative books.
     Celebrate and support the individual. Things such as temperament, prior experience,
         and disabilities affect children's starting places with language and literacy.
     Connect with families. Providing them with certain materials and strategies to support
         their children's language and literacy development benefits children's learning.
     Create a culturally sensitive environment. Some children have been encouraged to
         speak up more than others.
     Encourage children to use language for negotiating with other children, asking for what
         they want, and expressing their emotions.
     Create many opportunities for children to do the talking. Ask open-ended questions and
         model engaging in the back-and-forth of conversations.
     Make thoughts more explicit to children by thinking out loud.
     Support curiosity and confidence. Children should freely use "Why? and "How come?"
     Create well-organized, literacy-rich environments, both indoors and outdoors.
     Observe how children engage with language and literacy to meet each child's needs.7

                      Figure 8.4: This large-group experience supports language in an engaging way.8

How the learning environment is arranged affects how children learn to talk, read, and write.
An environment that fosters language development, two-way communication, and literacy
skills provides rich curriculum content. The daily schedule accommodates a variety of groupings
(e.g., large group, small group, and individual), and the learning materials fascinate children.
Children learn more when adults model language and literacy as well as provide playful,
purposeful instruction. Play spaces with literacy props (e.g., signs, lists) allow children to
congregate and to make choices that foster rich language and literacy experiences.

     Create time in the daily routine for adult-child and child-child interactions.
     Have space and times for large-group times
     Create spaces and times for children to gather in small groups
     Provide a space to display family-related items; consider how to add text to those

         displays
     Organize your classroom into centers or interest areas to create clear spaces for children

         to engage and collaborate (and communicate), including
             o A dramatic play area
             o A block area
             o An art area
             o A writing area
             o A cozy library or book area
             o A science area
             o A game area
             o A math area

     Choose materials for small- and large-group times that the children will be interested in
         and use them with intention

     Create a learning environment to fascinate children and prompt conversations
     Extend the classroom beyond its wall; being outdoors, going on walks, and taking field

         trips are all great for promoting conversation
     Be flexible in your environment; allow children to expand their ideas to new areas9

           Learning English as a Second Language

In California as many as half of children will be identified as English learners
upon kindergarten entry. The home languages of these children include
Spanish, Vietnamese, Cantonese, Hmong, Tagalog, Korean, and other
languages.

In general the development of a second language follows these predictable
stages

  Stage      Description of Stage of Second Language Development
1st stage  The child uses their home language to try and communicate
2nd stage  The child figures out that it is not successful to use the home
           language so they pass through a period of observation and
3rd stage  listening
           The child attempts to use new language in more abbreviated
4th stage  form through the use of one or two word sentences
           The child begins to use more elaborated phrases and short
           sentences to communicate in the new language

While some express concern that learning more than one language is
confusing or delays children's development, there have been no negative
effects of bilingualism found in research. According to Gigi Luk, an associate
professor at Harvard's Graduate School of Education, "bilingualism is an
experience that shapes our brain for a lifetime." There are many potential
benefits to knowing more than one language, including: increased ability to
pay attention, better reading of social cues, better reading ability, better
school performance and engagement, increased comfort with diversity and
different cultures, and even protection from age-related dementia11 It's
important for educators to support and advocate for the maintenance of
children's home languages for both the benefits mentioned here but also
because,12 "[t]he child's first language is critical to his or her identity.
Maintaining this language helps the child value his or her culture and
heritage, which contributes to a positive self-concept.13

Children who are English learners bring a wealth of ability and knowledge as
well as varied cultural backgrounds to early childhood settings; English
learners also require curricular adaptations to make the most of their
abilities while they progress toward full English proficiency. The high-quality
early childhood practices described in the other domains will also benefit
preschool children who are English learners, but they may not be enough.14

Introducing the Foundations

The preschool learning foundations for Language and Literacy are organized into three broad
categories or strands

     listening and speaking
     reading
     writing15

Supporting Listening and Speaking

Language takes place all around us--in social interactions between teachers and children, in
classroom management, in play between children, and in instructional activities. For example,
when children learn mathematics and science, they learn them through language as well as
through meaningful, multisensory experiences.

Language also enhances or limits children's ability to choose playmates and join in games on
the playground. The foundations for listening and speaking include:

Language use and conventions focuses on how children use their language for a number of
purposes, including learning how to participate in short conversations.

Grammar allows children to go beyond mere naming with their vocabularies to express their
ideas in sentences. It's understanding how words are put together in a sentence.

Teachers can support children's development of the listening and speaking foundations with
the following:

     Make sure that children have a chance to talk by setting aside time for them to discuss
         and to share their ideas.

     Acknowledge their contributions by making eye contact, using their names, restating
         their talk, providing explanation when they ask a question, and building on what they
         say.

     Engage in "getting to know you" conversations.
     Model the use of language conventions and encourage children to do the same.

     Build on preschool children's own experiences by asking children to recount simple daily
         experiences.

     Use dramatic play and co-construct stories.
     Give story stems.
     Notice where children look and then talk about the things that are the focus of attention

         and action, using interesting, rich vocabulary.
     Narrate what you are doing.
     Use new vocabulary in natural conversations.
     Play language games.
     Ask children to tell you about their artwork and other creations.
     Talk one-on-one with children.
     Know individual children and their families (especially important for children whose

         home language is not English)17

                       Vignettes
                       It is Lara's turn to share a special story from home. Lara, who is beginning
                       to use an assistive technology communication device, had some key words
                       added to her device that enable her to share. As Mr. Tony holds up the
                       pictures, she pushes the button that labels the picture. Mr. Tony expands
                       the label by saying "Tango. This is your new dog, Tango." Lara beams as the
                       children get excited. "I got a dog like that!" Emilio says, "He is black too."
                       Mr. Tony holds up another picture and asks, "What is Tango doing in this
                       picture, Lara?

                       In response to the construction outside their classroom, the room is filled
                       with activity as children use their plastic hammers and wrenches, tool belts,
                       and benches. The planned curriculum includes a Construction Unit. Outside
                       the window, the children can see the cranes move and the workers in hard
                       hats. They hear the sound of hammer against nail. This week the teacher
                       reads to the class stories about construction equipment and information
                       books about how tall buildings are made. The construction outside gives
                       Ms. Vase an opportunity to expose children to the names of common and
                       even not-so-common tools. Ms. Vase sent home a one-page newsletter in
                       the languages of families represented in her classroom, telling parents
                       about the Construction Unit and about vocabulary children are learning.
                       She asked if any parents who are builders or carpenters would like to come
                       to class to share their experiences.18

                   conversation? What do you already do that will translate well into supporting
                   children's listening and speaking? What might you want to change or add to

Supporting Reading

Reading billboards effortlessly on a car ride or making a shopping list involves literacy skills.
Literacy includes both reading and writing. Literacy is also involved when people understand
language and know enough about the world to comprehend the books they read. Children hear
many books read aloud before they can read for themselves, and they can use scribbles to
represent the thoughts they compose before they will use conventional print. Literacy does not
develop overnight; it comes from being talked to and read to and from being encouraged to
look at books, to draw, and to write. Children start on their journey to literacy at birth through
visual and auditory observation of their world and through interactions with people and
materials, in a variety of daily experiences, both at home and at school.

 Figure 8.6: This sign for the math center, includes print in the home languages of the children and images to help
                                                     children interpret the print.19

Reading provides access to meaning represented by print. It requires the translation of print
into speech and the interpretation of meaning. Reading depends heavily on oral vocabulary and
grammar and also on specific literacy knowledge (e.g., names of alphabet letters) and skills
(e.g., detecting sounds in spoken words). Preschool children engage in reading by listening to
stories and by retelling familiar books. They also engage in reading when they interpret
environmental print by using physical clues (e.g., the stop sign is the red one at the end of their
street) or when they reenact through play the literacy-related social behavior of family

                       Pairs of children walk hand in hand to return to their classroom after
                       playing outside. Sasha stops walking, points to a sign posted in the hallway,
                       and says to Yasmin, her partner, "That sign says to be quiet because the
                       babies are sleeping." In a soft voice, the teacher says, "Yes, we are walking
                       past the babies' room. We've talked about how they might be sleeping. This
                       sign says, "Remember to Walk." Do you think we need to make another
                       sign for the hallway, one to remind us to talk softly?" The children agree
                       that the second sign is needed, and several offer to help.

                       After singing "Down by the Bay" at circle time, Mr. Zhang used an
                       illustrated book to review the song and engage children in playing with
                       some sounds in the words: "Here's the funny bear, combing his hair. Bear,
                       /b/-/ear/; hair, /h/-/air/. The last parts of those words [i.e., the rime
                       portion] sound the same, don't they? They rhyme." Several children agreed
                       enthusiastically. "And who's on this page?" "The llama," shout several
                       children. "Eating his /p/ . . . (pause)" Mr. Zhang continued.

                       "Pajamas!" several children called out. As he turned the page, several
                       children called out, "The fly with a tie." "Yes, the fl-y wearing a t-ie. Before I
                       turn the next page, I'll give you a clue about what you'll see next: A /wh/-
                       ale . . ." "A whale!" the children called out. "With a polka-dot /t/-ail,"the
                       teacher continued. "Tail," several children called out.

                       The caregiver shares an alphabet book with a few children. "This is the page
                       for the letter B. Here is the big B and here's the little b." She engaged the
                       children to help identify the pictures on the B page: "Blueberries, broccoli,
                       beets, bananas, beans." Then she comments, "B is the first letter in each of
                       these words. This word (pointing to the first letter in blueberry, printed
                       above a picture of a box of blueberries) starts with the letter B. It says,
                       Blueberry (underlines the rest of the word, as she reads it). Blueberry starts
                       with the /b/ sound. What do you think this word says? (She points to the
                       word above the picture of some bananas.) One child says, "banana;"
                       another says, "platano." The caregiver confirms that banana can be called
                       by either name, one Spanish and the other English. "The words in this book
                       are written in English--/b/ is for banana (points to banana). I think we
                       could write some of these words in Spanish and paste them into the book.
                       We could write brecol to put here with broccoli." "When can we do that?" a
                       child asks. "After rest time today, if you'd like. Miguel and Alexandria will
                       still be sleeping. I can help you and Aaliyah spell Spanish words that will
                       work in this alphabet book. We can type them on the computer and then
                       print them out to paste in our book."22

                   Pause to Reflect
                   What memories of reading and books do you have from your childhood? How
                   do you feel about reading now? Is that how you want children to feel about
                   reading? If so, how can you share that? If not, what might you do to ensure
                   they have a different perspective about reading?

Supporting Writing

Developing as a writer depends on the writer's understanding of how a particular written
language looks and on the writer's language and thinking skills. Conventional writing requires
knowledge of alphabet letters and an understanding that letters stand for sounds in spoken or
signed words. Deciding what to write requires oral or sign language, knowledge, and thinking.
Preschool children engage in writing when they use scribble marks and proudly announce their
meanings (e.g., "This says ____"). Preschool children frequently use drawing, rather than
writing marks, to represent their thoughts, and they often combine scribble or other writing-
like marks with their drawings to communicate. Preschool children are happy to serve as their
own interpreters, telling people what their early writing and drawing is meant to say. Teachers
are careful not to criticize children's early scribble productions. To find out what a child's
writing means, teachers may ask a child: "Tell me about these wavy lines down here."

                            Figure 8.8: Ask children about their writing to see what it represents.23

Writing focuses on understanding that print represents ideas and on learning to move from
drawing and scribble writing to using letters and words. Much exploration with paper and
writing tools occurs before children will try to write to convey specific meanings. When children
write to convey meaning, they are using their language, their physical ability to hold a crayon or

represent a meaning that can be shared.

     from pictures.                            3.5 Write first name nearly correctly.
 2.5 Write marks to represent own name.

While direct writing instruction is not yet developmentally appropriate for preschool-aged
children, who do not quite have the fine motor coordination needed to write legibly, they are
developing important skills and knowledge that contribute to their ability to communicate in
written form.

Table 8.1: Four Levels of Writing Development over the Preschool Years

     Level                                       Description
Exploring    The child explores with marking tools on a variety of writing surfaces,
Developing   creating scribble marks. The child sometimes focuses on making marks
             without any intention of using these to stand for writing. Sometimes the
Building     marks prompt the child to think of something from the child's world that is
             familiar, and the child attributes meaning to scribbles
Integrating  As the child continues to explore with mark making, the child organizes
             scribble marks into lines when "writing," which indicates the child's
             observation that marks for writing and marks for pictures are organized
             differently. Often, the child will point to scribble marks that are lined up and
             say, "This says . . ." In other words, children begin to attribute meaning to
             their scribble writing.
             Children's skill in using marks to create both pictures and writing increases
             to the point where others can recognize a child's intentions. Although the
             marks are still not always well formed, adults have a good idea what the
             child intended to portray and the letters a child intended to write. Children
             sometimes make up new designs that look remarkably like actual letters.
             They do not yet know that there are just 26!
             At this phase, children know most, if not all, of the uppercase alphabet
             letters, and they combine these to make words. Some of the words are
             ones they see frequently, such as their names. Most are quite legible,
             although not perfectly formed, of course, and a letter might be written with
             its orientation reversed. In addition to their names, children sometimes
             write a few simple words, such as love or yes and no. They also might string

       letters together in sets that look like words and ask adults, "What word is
       this?" A few older preschoolers might have figured out that letters selected
       to make words relate to the sounds in the spoken words, and invent
       spellings, such as KK for cake or CD for candy

                           Figure 8.9: Often the first word that children write is their own name.24

Teachers can support children's development of the writing foundations with the following:
     Setting up a well-stocked writing area
     Frequently adding new materials to the writing area
     Providing writing materials in other interest areas and outdoors
     Embed writing in everyday transitions and routines
     Encourage children to write in the art interest area
     Respond sensitively to children's emergent writing; focus on the meaning that children
         are trying to convey rather than on the form of their writing
     Respond to children's questions and requests for help with writing; describe and model
         how to write the letter on a separate piece of paper
     Model writing
     Display children's writing
     Provide ample opportunities for children to cross their midline
     Provide experiences in which children strengthen fine motor muscles (fingers, hand,
         wrist, forearm), and develop dexterity, such as working with clay, cutting with scissors,
         and working with tools25

                       Crossing the Midline
                       "The body's mid-line is an imaginary line down the cent[er] of the body that
                       divides the body into left and right. Crossing the body's mid-line is the
                       ability to reach across the middle of the body with the arms and legs. This
                       allows children to cross over their body to perform a task on the opposite
                       side of their body (e.g. being able to draw a horizontal line across a page
                       without having to switch hands in the middle..."
                       "Crossing the body's mid-line is an important developmental skill needed
                       for many everyday tasks such as writing... When a child spontaneously
                       crosses the mid-line with the dominant hand, then the dominant hand gets
                       the practice needed to develop good fine motor skills by repeated
                       consistent hand dominance. If a child avoids crossing the mid-line, then
                       both hands tend to get equal practice at developing skills and the child's
                       true handedness may be delayed. This means that once a child starts
                       school, learning to write is much more difficult when they have two less
                       skilled hands rather than one stronger, more skilled (dominant) hand.
                       Difficulty crossing the mid-line also makes it difficult to visually track a
                       moving object from one side to the other or track from left to right when
                       reading, meaning reading can also be delayed."26

                       Jessalyn is delighted with the birthday card picture from a peer and wants
                       to write a thank-you note. She draws a picture and then tells the teacher, "I
                       want real words, too, but I can't make them."

                       "What would you like the words to say?" the teacher asks. Jessalyn
                       dictates: "I liked the pretty picture of me. It was a pretty birthday card."
                       "Do you want me to write that down or help you?"

                       "I can do letters," Jessalyn explains, "but I can't make words. Well, just
                       love." The teacher helps Jessalyn spell the word pretty by segmenting some
                       of its sounds and naming the letters needed to write the sounds. After the
                       teacher names the last letter in pretty, Jessalyn remarks, "y? Why not e?"
                       The teacher explains that e is used to write this sound in many words, but,
                       in others, y is used.

                       Then the teacher asks, "What letter is at the end of your friend Jeremy's
                       name?" "Oh, y!" Jessalyn realizes. "Do we have anybody with e?" she asks.
                       "Not this year. But last year, there was a girl named Kaylee, and she used e
                       to write the /e/ sound."27

Engaging Families

Teachers can use the following strategies to help families to develop their children's language
and literacy.

     Send families home with things to look for on the weekend, topics to talk about, or
         stories to tell together (written in their home language).

     Suggest ways that parents can send a response back to the classroom.
     Send books, other reading materials, and writing materials home with children.
     Provide a lending library in the home languages of the children and encourage parents

         to read to their children in their home language.
     Share ideas with parents about questions they might ask about books, and provide

         these in the home language.
     Introduce parents to community resources to get books for home
     Encourage family members to share their writing with children.
     Share children's triumphs and experiences and people they really enjoy with families.
     Use displays to help family members understand the developmental nature of writing.
     Invite families to share their stories with you.
     Think about projects to do in class in which children can bring materials from home.28

Conclusion

Decades of research have shown that playful learning, intentional teaching, and a rich
curriculum help children learn about the world and master language and literacy. The principles
and strategies provided in this chapter are based on this research. Teachers must be mindful of
what the research has revealed about how children acquire a vast array of knowledge and skills.
However, teachers must also assume responsibility for weaving together a program that
combines children's play with their own specific plans in ways that secure a bright academic
future for each child. By definition, this means that children's interest in and motivation to
learn are maintained. The satisfaction and joy of teaching come from knowing that the very
best efforts were made and from seeing the results of such efforts in the children's faces every
day. The progress documented for each child over the course of a year also brings joy and
satisfaction.30

                   Pause to Reflect
                   What are some of the ways language and literacy occur naturally in the
                   everyday lives of children? What are additional things that teachers will need
                   to intentionally bring into the program (this could include materials,
                   interactions, activities, environmental design, etc.)?

          Chapter 9: Mathematics

Objectives:

     Explain what math education in early childhood is and what it is not
     Summarize the foundations in mathematics
     Identify ways that educators can support spontaneous experiences with math and

         intentionally plan to build children's mathematical knowledge.
     Describe how the environment supports mathematics.
     Relate how to engage families in support their children's mathematic knowledge.

Introduction

Mathematics is a natural part of the preschool environment. Young children actively construct
mathematical knowledge through everyday interactions with their environment, whether inside
or outside.

    Figure 9.1: When measuring two cups of flour, ½ cup of salt, two tablespoons of oil to help make playdough,
                                     children use and build their mathematical knowledge.1

Mathematics learning grows naturally from children's curiosity and enthusiasm to learn and
explore their environment. During the preschool years, children continue to show a
spontaneous interest in mathematics and further develop their mathematical knowledge and
skills related to number, quantity, size, shape, and space. Teachers should encourage children's
natural enthusiasm and interest in doing mathematics and use it as a vehicle for supporting the
development of children's mathematical concepts and skills.
High-quality mathematics education in preschool is not about elementary arithmetic being
pushed down onto younger children. It is broader than mere practice in counting and
arithmetic. It is about children experiencing mathematics as they explore ideas of more and

less, count objects, make comparisons, create patterns, sort and measure objects, and explore
shapes in space. Mathematics learning happens throughout the day, and it is integrated with
learning and developing in other developmental domains such as language and literacy, social-
emotional, science, music, and movement. There is a general consensus "that high-quality,
challenging and accessible mathematics education for three- to six-year-old children is a vital
foundation for future mathematics learning."

Teachers have a significant role in facilitating children's construction of mathematical concepts.
When teachers join children in becoming keen observers of their environment and in reasoning
about numbers, shapes, and patterns, mathematics is enjoyable and exciting for all.

                                  Figure 9.2: Songs and games are fun ways to support math.2

Teachers may not always realize the extent to which their current everyday classroom practices
support children's mathematical development. For example, when singing with children "Five
Little Ducks Went Out One Day," incorporating finger play with counting, the teacher develops
children's counting skills and understanding of numbers. Discussing with children how many
children came to school today and how many are missing supports children's arithmetic and
reasoning with numbers. Playing with children in the sandbox by filling up different cups with
sand and discussing which cup is the smallest or the largest or how many cups of sand it would
take to fill up a bucket introduces children to concepts of comparison and measurement.3

Guiding Principles for Supporting Math

The following principles will guide teachers' classroom practices in establishing a high-quality,
challenging, and sensitive early mathematics preschool program. These principles are partially
based on the ten recommendations in Early Childhood Mathematics: Promoting Good

Beginnings set forth by the National Association for the Education of Young Children and NCTM
in 2002.

     Build on preschool children's natural interest in mathematics and their intuitive and
         informal mathematical knowledge

     Encourage inquiry and exploration to foster problem solving and mathematical
         reasoning

     Use everyday activities as natural vehicles for developing preschool children's
         mathematical knowledge

     Introduce mathematical concepts through intentionally planned experiences (in
         addition to what they spontaneously engage in)

     Provide a mathematically rich environment
     Provide an environment rich in language, and introduce preschool children to the

         language of mathematics
     Support English learners in developing mathematical knowledge as they concurrently

         acquire English
     Observe children to discover opportunities to clarify, extend, and reinforce their existing

         mathematical concepts and to help them discover new mathematical concepts
     Provide an environment in which all children can learn mathematics, set appropriately

         high expectations for all children, and support individual growth
     Establish a partnership with parents and other caregivers in supporting children's

         learning of mathematics4

Environmental Factors in Supporting Math

Young children actively construct mathematical knowledge through everyday interactions with
their environment. Setting up a high-quality physical environment is essential for children's
mathematical development. The preschool environment sets the stage for children's physical

and social exploration and construction of mathematical concepts. It should provide access to
objects and materials that encourage children to experiment and learn about key mathematical
concepts through everyday play.

     Enrich the environment with developmentally appropriate, challenging, and engaging
         materials that promote mathematical growth

     Integrate math-related materials into all interest areas in the classroom
     Use materials, books, and real-life settings that reflect the culture, ways of life, and

         languages of the children in the group
     Use children's books to explore mathematics with children
     Be intentional and mindful in setting up and using the physical environment (children do

         not effectively use materials and engage in experiences just because you provide them)6

                       Research Highlight
                       Research indicates that the ability to reason about numbers starts as early
                       as infancy. Five-month-olds show sensitivity to the effects of addition or
                       subtraction of items on a small collection of objects. Toddlers viewing three
                       balls put into a container and then one being removed know to search for a
                       smaller number of balls, and many search for exactly two balls.

                       By the time children are in preschool, prior to having any formal lesson in
                       arithmetic, they use a variety of strategies to solve simple addition and
                       subtraction problems. They may use manipulatives or fingers to represent
                       the numbers in the problem and count out loud to find out the answer. As
                       they get older, they rely less and less on finger counting. To solve an
                       addition problem such as 4 + 2 presented with concrete objects (e.g., color
                       crayons), the child may count all objects "one, two, three, four" and then
                       continue with the second set of objects "five, six" and find out there are a
                       total of six. At a later stage, the child may "count on" from the second set
                       of objects. Knowing the number of objects in the first set (e.g., "four"), the
                       child starts with "four" and continues to count "five, six" to find out the
                       total number of objects, rather than starting to count from "one" with the
                       second set of objects.8

Introducing the Foundations

The California preschool learning foundations for math have been divided into five broad areas
or strands.

     Number Sense
     Algebra and Functions (Classification and Patterning)
     Measurement

Supporting Number Sense

The Number Sense strand refers to concepts of numbers and their relationships. It includes the
development of counting skills, the understanding of quantities, recognizing ordering relations
(which has more, fewer, or less), part-whole relationships, and a basic understanding of "adding
to" and "taking away" operations.

Teachers can support children's development of the number sense foundations with the
following:

     Observe children's spontaneous counting and foster growth through scaffolding or
         modeling

     Encourage counting during everyday interactions and routines
     Include preschool children's home language in counting activities, whenever possible
     Ask questions that encourage purposeful counting
     Foster one-to-one correspondence within the context of daily routines (such as setting

         the table)
     Support preschool children's ability to apply the counting procedure by

             o Providing a lot of objects to count
             o Starting with small sets

                       four, five, six, seven." The teacher intervened and asked, "How do you think
                       we can find out who has more cars?" "I count," said one of the children.
                       The teacher suggested, "Let's count together," and she modeled counting
                       together with the children. She put the cars in each set, in a row, and lined
                       up the two sets against each other. The teacher pointed to each car while
                       counting.

Supporting Algebra and Functions (Classification and Patterning)

Obviously, preschool is not the time to teach traditional algebra, but this is the period when
foundational algebraic concepts evolve and gradually develop. Children observe the
environment and learn to recognize similarities and differences. They learn to sort, group, and
classify objects. They learn to recognize ordering relations, such as large to small, and to
identify patterns. They develop the ability to make predictions, form generalizations, and derive
rules.

                       As part of a curriculum unit on the seasons, the children went for a nature
                       walk and collected various types of leaves. During the walk and later in the
                       classroom, the children explored the leaves and were encouraged to
                       describe different attributes of the leaves such as shape (pointy, round,
                       long, needle), size (small, tiny, wide, big), color (red, green, yellow, orange,
                       brown) and texture (smooth, soft, hard, wet, dry, rough). Children were
                       then asked by the teacher to sort the leaves: "Put leaves that belong
                       together in groups."

                       The teacher asks Enrique, "Why did you put these leaves together and
                       those leaves together?" Enrique responds, "They are same." The teacher
                       asks, "How are these the same?" Enrique points and says in Spanish, "Café
                       aquí, amarillo aquí, y hojas rojas." ("Brown here, yellow, here, and red
                       leaves here."). The teacher points to each group of leaves and says in
                       English, "Great! Brown, yellow, and red leaves. What other ways can we
                       sort the leaves? How about putting all the big leaves here and all the small
                       ones there?" The teacher models for the child, sorting leaves by size.
                       "Where do you think this leaf would go?"

                   Pause to Reflect
                   Before reading this section, did you think that algebra was something that
                   should be considered in the preschool classroom? Why or why not?

Supporting Measurement

The Measurement strand involves comparing, ordering, and measuring things. Included in this
strand is the child's ability to compare and order objects by length, height, weight, or capacity;
to use comparison vocabulary; and to begin to measure. Young children develop an intuitive
notion of measurement through natural everyday experiences. They explore and discover
properties such as length, height, volume, and weight as they look for a longer block, measure
who is taller, pour sand from a small bucket to a larger one, or try to pick up a heavy box and
ask for help. They make comparisons to see which is longer, taller, heavier, larger, or smaller.

                       Vignettes
                       As part of exploring and learning the concept of growth, the children have
                       planted sunflower seeds in the garden. A long stick was attached to each
                       plant, and the teacher asked that every week the children mark on the stick
                       the height of the sunflower. Tracking the growth of sunflowers has
                       generated comparison and measurement experiences. For example, one
                       week the teacher pointed to one of the sunflowers and explained to the
                       children, "Last week when we measured this sunflower, it was up to here. It
                       was seven inches long. This week it is up to here. How many more inches
                       do you think it grew in the past week? What is your estimate?"

                       Children were encouraged to make estimates and then were invited to
                       measure the growth of this sunflower. "How can we measure how much it
                       has grown since last time?" Children had different ideas. Some children
                       said, "You need a ruler." Others said, "With this" and pointed to a
                       measuring tape. Over time, children were also comparing the sunflowers
                       one to another. On one occasion, the teacher helped a small group of
                       children compare the height of two flowers by using a string to represent
                       the height of one flower and then laying the string against the second
                       flower.

                       Children enjoyed tracking the sunflowers' growth and finding out, "Which
                       sunflower is taller?" and "Which is taller?"--the child or the sunflower.20

                   Pause to Reflect
                   Involving children in measuring things that are meaningful to them is a great
                   way to engage children in mathematics. Do you remember any measurements
                   experiences from your childhood? This could be formal, like keeping track of
                   your height on a wall or growth chart or measuring the weight and/or length
                   of a fish caught or informal, such as recognizing that a new storage container
                   holds more (volume) or noticing the length difference in a new pair of shoes.

Supporting Geometry

Geometry is the study of shapes and spatial relationships. Children enter preschool with a
strong intuitive knowledge about shapes, spatial location, and transformations. They learn
about geometry as they move in space and interact with objects in their environment. From
infancy they begin to form shape concepts as they explore their environment, observe shapes,
and play with different objects. Before they can name and define shapes, very young children
are able to match and classify objects based on shape. During the preschool years, children
develop a growing understanding of shape and spatial relationships. They learn the names of
shapes and start to recognize the attributes of two- and three-dimensional shapes. They also
develop an understanding of objects in relation to space, learning to describe an object's
location (e.g., on top, under), direction (e.g., from, up, down) and distance (e.g., near, far).

       Figure 9.11: By using their bodies to make a triangle these children are working with shapes and spatial
                                                            understanding.21

                       Vignette
                       The teacher had noticed that several children in her group had shown a
                       strong interest in castles. They built castles in the block area, in the
                       sandbox, and even looked for castles in fairy tale books when visiting the
                       library. The teacher suggested that the group build a big castle outside.
                       They started by gathering the materials. The children brought from home
                       different sized boxes and figures or characters to be included in the castle.
                       The teacher also offered big cylinders, cones, building blocks, construction
                       boards, and other materials. The children made different suggestions: "Put
                       all the big boxes here and the small ones on top of them." "I put it above
                       this for the roof." "We can use these for the tower."

                       The teacher described their ideas using names of shapes and spatial terms.
                       "So you want to put the small square blocks on top of the big rectangle
                       blocks." "Are you suggesting using the cylinders to build the tower?" The
                       children enjoyed building the structure, using different shapes and
                       materials, and were proud of it.

                       During circle time, the teacher invited children to describe the castle and
                       how it was built. "Look at the castle you built. Can you tell me what it looks
                       like?" Children were encouraged to use spatial words and the names of
                       shapes in their talk. The activity evolved into a long-term project. The
                       children kept adding more pieces to the structure and added different
                       elements to decorate the castle.24

Supporting Mathematical Reasoning

Mathematical reasoning is a key process in learning and developing mathematical knowledge in
all areas of mathematics, including number and operations, classification, patterning,
measurement, and geometry. It involves the ability to think and reason logically, to apply

mathematical knowledge in different problem-solving situations, and to come up with different
solutions. Mathematical reasoning is natural to most young children as they explore the

         interactions and planned experiences

     Pose meaningful questions that promote investigation and inquiry and challenge
         children to think through a problem and come up with a solution

                       The children cleaned up the play yard before going back inside. The
                       teacher, Ms. Denise, had noticed that not all the shovels were picked up
                       from the sandbox. Ms. Denise asked for help saying, "We need all five
                       shovels back in the box so our toys aren't lost. I see here only three. We
                       need more shovels in the box. How many more shovels do we need?" The
                       teacher had noticed that Ling Wa, one of the older preschool children in the
                       group, was counting her fingers, trying to find out how many shovels were
                       missing.

                       Ling Wa suddenly said, "Ms. Denise, we need two more."

                       Ms. Denise went further, asking, "Do you think we need two more
                       shovels?" How did you figure that out?"

Engaging Families

Teachers can use the following strategies to help families to develop their children's
mathematical understanding:

     Communicate to families
             o the broader aspects of developing number sense; for example, using counting in
                  real-life situations, comparing numbers and discussing which is more or less,
                  making estimations (e.g., How many grapes are in this bowl?), and solving simple
                  addition and subtraction problems.
             o what classification and patterning are about and how they contribute to
                  children's understanding of mathematics.
             o the importance of early measuring experiences and types of measurement
                  experiences they can do with children.
             o that mathematical reasoning is being able to think mathematically and explore
                  different ways of solving problems

     Remind parents that daily use of numbers (which are everywhere!) can become learning
         experiences for children.

     Provide number-related games and books that children can take home or that families
         can make or purchase.

     Encourage parents to
             o involve children in everyday measurement experiences
             o refer to shapes in the environment when talking with children
             o use spatial words in everyday interactions with children
             o recognize math in everyday events and interactions and turn them into learning
                  experiences27

Conclusion

Young children have a natural interest, curiosity, and competence to explore and construct
mathematical concepts. Mathematics is a way of thinking and organizing the world around us.
It is a natural part of day-to-day activities and events. Mathematics in preschool is learned
through children's play and exploration as in the blocks area or the sandbox, through everyday
routines such as setting the table and cleaning up, and through participation in teacher-
initiated activities. Some teacher-initiated activities are designed with a focus on math, and
others may focus on art, movement, literacy, or science but present opportunities for math
learning.

When teachers recognize the potential for exposure to math in different situations, they can
turn everyday occurrences into exciting and effective mathematics-learning experiences.
Children are excited to explore the size or volume of objects, to discover and create patterns, to
manipulate and build with shapes, to sort and classify objects, and to try to figure out "how
many." Teachers get to experience with children the day-to-day excitement of learning and
discovering math. This process is joyful for the children and for the teacher, who guides and
challenges them in building mathematical concepts, skills, and language 29

                   Pause to Reflect
                   Many adults (including parents and teachers) shy away from math because
                   they "aren't good at it." How do you feel about math? How comfortable are
                   you "teaching" math? Has the way this chapter presented math affected that
                   at all? If so, how?

Introduction

Children have a sense of wonder and natural curiosity about objects and events in their
environment. Just like scientists, they seek information and actively explore and investigate the
world around them, try things out to see what happens, and confirm or adjust their
expectations.

Science is a natural and developmentally appropriate focus for young children. Preschool
science is about active learning, not memorizing scientific facts or watching the teacher
perform science demonstrations. The purpose of preschool science is to nurture children's
habits of inquiry, critical thinking, creativity, innovative problem solving, open mindedness, and
the motivation to learn. Preschool science guides children's natural curiosity into opportunities
to observe, explore, and inquire about basic phenomena and materials in their world.

From infancy, children gain knowledge and develop concepts about living things and physical
objects. Preschool science provides children with focused experiences that allow them to learn
ways to explore and extend their knowledge. Children begin to adopt scientific ideas and to
acquire the basic skills and language of scientific inquiry (ways to explore and develop
knowledge and understanding of scientific ideas). Making observations, posing questions,
planning investigations, using tools to gather information, making predictions, recording
information, and communicating findings and explanations all combine in an evolving process
of developing science understanding and creating a disposition to choose to learn science in the
future.

Science can be conducted in any preschool setting. All preschools, regardless of the level of
resources and access to nature, can use their existing resources to create a program with
meaningful science learning experiences. Pushing cars down an incline, building with blocks,
manipulating tubes at the water table, or mixing clay with water are everyday play activities
that engage children in experimenting with objects and materials. Collecting leaves, searching

for insects in the yard, sorting and classifying fruits and vegetables, and sprouting seeds in pots
engage children with living things. Experiences of child-initiated play are important as they
provide children with opportunities to construct understanding and integrate knowledge. With
teachers' intentional planning, guidance, and support, children's play and interactions with
objects can become rich experiences of scientific inquiry and facilitate children's knowledge and
understanding of objects and events in the world.

Preschool teachers play a pivotal role in expanding children's understanding of science
concepts and developing children's attitudes, skills, and the language of scientific inquiry. The
teachers can focus children's attention on particular science concepts, those that are
developmentally appropriate, interesting, and engaging for both children and teachers. They
can create engaging inquiry experiences, encouraging close observations of objects and events.

Children may draw the connection to their own growth and the growth of other animals and
begin to develop a broader understanding of living things. Such experiences of scientific inquiry
not only support children's development of scientific knowledge, but provide a natural vehicle
for developing children's social skills, and their development in mathematics, language, literacy,
and other domains.

                                                            documentation.1

Preschool teachers do not need to have extensive knowledge about science in order to teach it
well, but they should be willing to research and gain general knowledge of the concepts and
principles they explore with children. The kind and amount of information or knowledge they
need to know is readily available through basic research. Acquiring some background
knowledge about the topic helps teachers in planning inquiry experiences and challenging and
supporting children through their explorations.

Teachers do not need to have answers to all the questions children will raise. Rather than
providing children with answers, teachers can use children's questions as a springboard for
further investigations. They may say, "I don't know. Let's find out together." It is essential that

teachers become "scientists" together with children, model a questioning mind for children and
think out loud, expressing interest and enthusiasm. Teachers' thoughtful guidance and support
through inquiry experiences builds a foundation for children's understanding of basic science
concepts, fosters a positive approach to learning, and develops learning skills and attitudes
necessary for later success in science and in other subjects.2

Guiding Principles for Supporting Science

The following principles guide teachers in establishing a preschool science program that fosters
children's curiosity and develops their skills and habits to explore and learn about their world.
These principles are consistent with a constructivist approach to learning, where children
actively construct knowledge through physical and mental interactions with objects and people
in their environment. The principles are drawn from current research-based models and
approaches to early childhood science and are consistent with the National Association for the
Education of Young Children (NAEYC) guidelines on developmentally appropriate practice.

     The preschool environment supports children's curiosity and encourages inquiry and
         experimentation

     The teacher
             o acts as a researcher, joining children in exploring their world
             o asks open-ended questions to encourage children to think and talk
             o introduces children to new vocabulary, including scientific terms such as
                  observe, explore, predict, and measure
             o demonstrates appropriate use of scientific tools
             o invites children to reason and draw conclusions
             o encourages children to share their observations and communicate their thoughts
             o models respect for nature

     Content of inquiry is developmentally appropriate and builds on children's prior
         experiences

     Scientific inquiry experiences are interesting and engaging for children and teachers
     Children explore scientific concepts directly through active, hands-on, minds-on playful

         experiences
     Children explore scientific concepts in depth through multiple, related learning

         experiences over time
     Children construct knowledge through social interactions with peers and adults
     Children use language and other forms of communication to express their thoughts,

         describe observations, and document their work
     Teachers support children who are English learners in understanding and

         communicating scientific knowledge and skill
     Science is embedded in children's daily activities and play and provides a natural vehicle

         for integrating mathematics, literacy, and other content areas

     Individual differences are recognized, and all children are included and supported
     The preschool environment, home, and community are connected through science3

Environmental Factors in Supporting Science

The indoor and outdoor environments provide the context for children's physical and social
explorations and construction of scientific concepts. The following are strategies for helping
teachers set up a physical environment that is rich, stimulating, and conducive to children's
construction of knowledge

     Be thoughtful about what objects and materials to include in the environment
     Provide a variety of natural materials to observe and investigate
     Include objects and materials that allow for creativity and open-ended investigation
     Include living things in the preschool environment
     Include scientific tools for observation, measurement, and documentation
     Make scientific tools available throughout the preschool environment
     Consider adaptations in scientific tools and materials for children with special needs
     Use technology to support children's scientific experiences
     Present documentation of science-related experiences in the preschool environment
     Include children's books with science-related content
     Use the outdoors for natural explorations and investigations
     Organize the space in ways that promote children's explorations

             o Allow space for observations and for objects, materials, tools, and resources
                  related to science

             o Allow for flexibility in the use of physical space and furniture to accommodate
                  the changing needs of each activity

             o In order to promote self-direction and free explorations, tools and materials
                  need to be accessible and consistently available to children

             o Social interactions are necessary for conceptual growth and the development of
                  communication skills

     Always be aware of children's safety
     Foster children's curiosity and questioning
     Guide children in exploring their questions
     Be an active observer
     Talk with children and engage them in conversations during their investigations
     Provide children with time.
     Know when to intervene and when to stand back
     Model the use of scientific vocabulary4

                       Children bring to science many ideas about how things work. These
                       intuitive understandings or naïve theories that children have constructed
                       often conflict with what is known to be scientifically correct. Children hold

                       rain occurs when clouds are shaken. It is important to know how these
                       conceptions differ from the scientific explanation and why children
                       construct these ideas. Children's misconceptions are intuitively
                       reasonable, from the child's perspective, and are used by children to
                       explain the "why" behind physical events. Some of children's ideas may be
                       cultural beliefs that have been introduced at home. The teacher's role is to
                       guide children through numerous opportunities to discover and re-create
                       concepts, without overtly correcting their misconceptions. Remember,
                       science is about experimentation, and the goal is to support children's
                       scientific thinking, not to merely provide the correct answer.8

Introducing the Foundations

The preschool learning foundations for science are organized into four broad categories or
strands:

     Scientific Inquiry
     Physical Sciences
     Life Sciences
     Earth Sciences9

Supporting Scientific Inquiry

Young children's experience of science is an interplay between content knowledge (what
children learn about) and inquiry skills (the skills and processes they apply to explore and
develop knowledge and understanding of scientific ideas). Children build knowledge and

understanding of concepts through active participation in the process of scientific inquiry. Like
scientists, children have a natural desire to inquire, but they need guidance in developing the
skills of scientific inquiry.

     Observation and investigation skills involve ways to observe, compare, measure,
         classify, predict, and to check and investigate objects and events.

     Documentation and communication skills are employed to record information and to
         communicate findings and explanations with others.

Skills of scientific inquiry provide children with the tools for investigating and learning about
science topics. Such experiences build habits of questioning, critical thinking, innovative
problem solving, communication, collaboration, and decision making.

Scientific inquiry skills are integral to children's ongoing play and explorations and are not
taught in isolation. Children develop their abilities to make observations, ask questions, and
gather information, as part of meaningful exploration and investigation experiences. Teachers
can establish an environment with a culture of inquiry and facilitate children's use of scientific
skills and language through everyday explorations and planned experiences of scientific inquiry.

foundations for mathematics.

Teachers can support children's development of the scientific inquiry foundations with the
following:

     Facilitate children's observation skills by using the term "observe" and introduce the
         process with a familiar item

     Talk with children and ask questions to guide their observations
     Invite children to observe objects and phenomena related to the current focus of inquiry
     Promote the use of scientific tools to extend children's observations and investigations

         of objects

         use
     Encourage children to make predictions first and then check their predictions
     Remind children that predictions do not have to be right
     Record children's predictions
     Facilitate children's ability to make inferences and draw conclusions (when inferring and

         drawing conclusions, children observe what happened and make an assumption about
         the cause)
     Use everyday observations to model inferring

                       Vignettes
                       While exploring the play yard, children became fascinated with pill bugs
                       (usually called roly polies by children). In the yard, they would look for pill
                       bugs and enjoy watching them curl into balls. One day, Ms. Lopez noticed
                       that a group of children collected pill bugs in a bucket. She invited the
                       children to put the "roly polies" on a tray and observe them closely at the
                       outdoor investigation table. Ms. Lopez said, "Let's use our tools and look
                       really closely at the pill bugs. What do you notice about their body?" Ms.
                       Lopez assisted Jennifer in holding the magnifier above the pill bug: "Wow, it
                       looks so big," Jennifer said. Jose observes the pill bug with a magnifier and
                       gets excited: "I can see its head." Ryan asked, "When is it going to open up
                       again? I want to see how many legs it has."

                       Ms. Brown presented children with a big cube of ice. She asked the children
                       to touch or hold it and tell her what they notice about it: "What does it feel
                       like? What does it look like?" Children shared their observations: "It is
                       cold." "It is slippery." "It is very smooth." "It is wet." "It is white." "It is
                       square." Ms. Brown asked the children, "What do you know about ice?"
                       Some children shared their ideas: "We keep it in the freezer," "It's very,
                       very cold." "If you put it in water, it disappears." She invited children to
                       draw their observations of the ice cube in their notebooks. The next day,
                       Ms. Brown told the children that together they are going to explore what
                       will happen to ice when it is left outside of the freezer. She has asked
                       children: "What do you think will happen to this ice cube if we leave it in
                       this bowl? What is your prediction?" "Will it stay the same?" "What will be
                       different?" Children made predictions, and she wrote them on a chart (e.g.,
                       "It will not be so cold anymore." "It will turn into water"), "After lunch,
                       we'll check our ice cube and find out what happened."

                       The children in Ms. Moreno's group are taking turns bringing home the
                       picture book they created as a group. Today, it is Emilia's turn to take home
                       this book. This picture book was created to document the growth of their
                       plant. Emilia points to the photos in the book (taken by Ms. Moreno to
                       document the process) and to children's drawings. She tells the story out
                       loud to her grandmother, who is picking her up, "First we had to buy seeds
                       (points to a photo of the seeds packet on the first page), then we put the
                       soil, and then we put the seeds inside the dirt . . ." Emilia continues with
                       more details while looking at the pictures in the book: how they put the pot
                       in the sun, watered the plant, and measured its growth. "Here it was one
                       inch, and here it was bigger, and here it was very tall, and it has many
                       leaves." At home, Emilia will share it with her family, and together they will
                       retell the story in her home language.11

                   How would you facilitate children's thinking skills through everyday
                   observations and interactions?

Supporting Physical Sciences

Young children's inquiry in physical science involves the active exploration of nonliving objects
and materials and of physical events in their everyday environment. When children build with
blocks; play with different balls; push or slide objects of different kinds; play with water, sand,
clay, and other objects in the preschool environment; they explore materials in different ways
and begin to form ideas about the physical properties. They manipulate objects, act on them,
and observe what happens. They may try a certain strategy over and over to see if the same
result happens again. Through such exploratory interactions with objects and solid and nonsolid
materials, children can learn about cause-and-effect relationships, the physical properties of
objects and materials (e.g., size, shape, rigidity, texture), and about changes and
transformations of objects and materials. For example, when building with various kinds of
blocks, children may learn about the size and shape of the blocks and about the characteristics
of the materials used to make the blocks (e.g., wood, foam, plastic). They may discover that the
big cardboard blocks should be used at the bottom of a tower and the small unit blocks on top
in order to create a strong and stable tower. When playing at the water table, they experience
how water flows down and takes the shape of the container.

       Figure 10.4: What containers could be added to this water table to expand the children's exploration?12

With teachers' guidance, children's everyday play can become rich, hands-on inquiry
experiences of the key concepts in physical sciences. Teachers can provide children with

materials to broaden their investigation. They encourage children to try out their ideas, even if
the teacher knows the child's strategy will not create the desired result. Teachers challenge
children's thinking by asking questions that focus attention on key science concepts being
investigated: "What can you do to make the bridge higher?" "How can we make mud?" "Why
did the ball roll down in this direction?" Interactions of this kind provide children with
opportunities to extend their experimentations with objects, to notice patterns of cause-and-
effect, to reason and think more deeply about the phenomena they observe, and to use
language to describe, explain, and reflect on their work.

Key Concepts in Physical Sciences
In exploring objects and materials, children develop understanding of key
concepts about the physical world.

     They learn about the size, shape, weight, texture and other
         properties of objects and materials.

     They learn about the form and function of objects and that the form
         of an object supports its function.

     They continue to learn about cause and effect--that certain actions
         lead to certain reactions.

     They learn about changes in objects and materials. For instance,
         how mixing, heating, or cutting will produce changes in materials
         and that some changes are reversible and some are irreversible.

     They begin to understand that objects not in motion are in a state of
         balance.

They learn more about force and motion (inanimate objects are set in
motion; pushing and pulling put objects in motion; objects can move in
different ways).

                                                    speed and direction.

Teachers can support children's development of the physical sciences foundations with the
following:

     Provide children with opportunities to explore a variety of objects and materials in the
         daily environment.

     Prepare yourself and be purposeful about the scientific concepts children will
         investigate while engaged with objects and materials.

     Engage children in projects that allow them to explore, experiment, and invent with
         objects and materials for an extended period of time.

     Experiment with materials and objects before offering them to children.
     Invite children to observe and describe the characteristics and physical properties of the

         objects and materials they investigate.
     Plan opportunities for children to sort and classify objects and materials and reflect on

         similarities and differences.
     Provide children with opportunities to build and experiment with simple machines.

         Simple machines refer to six mechanical devices that make it easier to move or lift
         something: levers, a wheel on an axle, a pulley, an inclined plane, a wedge, and a screw.
     Provide children with opportunities to investigate the form and function of different
         tools and machines.
     Avoid presenting children with activities of "magical" science (such as chemical "snow"
         and exploding volcanoes) that are done for entertainment purposes and with the
         children as observers (not participants).
     Select activities or projects in which children can vary their actions on objects and
         observe the immediate reactions to their actions.
     Use cooking activities as opportunities to reason about transformations in materials.
     Invite children to set up an experiment and collect and analyze data.
     Focus children's attention on the effect of one aspect (variable) at a time.
     Lead children to make predictions about what they expect to happen.
     Ask questions to raise children's awareness of how they produced an effect.

                       Ms. Yen introduced children to a variety of solid materials, including
                       feathers, wood chips, pennies, foam pieces, marbles, and eggshells. After
                       the materials were introduced, she left them for children's free exploration
                       in the discovery center. The center also included tools such as magnifiers,
                       trays, cups, and a balance scale to expand their observations of the
                       materials, and the children were familiar with how to use them. Children
                       enjoyed exploring these materials, especially finding out how they are
                       similar or different from each other. One question they investigated was,
                       "Which materials are rigid and which are soft?" Children tried pressing,
                       poking, twisting, tearing, and breaking the different materials and shared
                       their conclusions with their classmates as they worked: "The pennies are
                       hard." "The feathers are very soft. You can bend them, and they do not
                       break." "The eggshell breaks when you press on it, and these (points to
                       foam pieces) are soft, and you can break them like this (the child
                       demonstrates how they break easily)." "The wood chips are very hard, too."
                       With the teacher's assistance, some children recorded their findings on the
                       chart, by gluing a sample of each material under "Rigid" or "Soft."

                       During the last cooking activity Ms. Moreno noticed that the children were
                       fascinated when they mixed the flour with water. The children's reactions
                       gave Ms. Moreno an idea for extending the group's explorations with dry
                       materials and engaging them in exploring mixtures. In small-group time,
                       Ms. Moreno introduced the children to different dry materials, such as salt,
                       flour, cornstarch, and sugar, and invited them to explore them. She then
                       suggested that they mix some of these materials with water. The teacher
                       asked the children questions to invite them to make predictions: "What do
                       you think will happen if we add salt to water . . ." As the children watched
                       the salt crystals disappear, they discovered that when salt is mixed with
                       water, it cannot be seen anymore. The teacher immediately asked
                       questions that encouraged the children to check their predictions. Ms.
                       Moreno asked the children, "What happened when you stirred the salt in
                       water?" Children came up with different answers: "It disappears." "It is
                       inside the water, but you cannot see it anymore." Ms. Moreno invited the
                       children to taste plain water and the water stirred with salt, and tell the
                       difference. When the children communicated that they tasted the salt and
                       that it was still in the water, the teacher introduced the word dissolve to
                       the children and explained that the salt dissolved in water to make salt
                       water. The children tried out different materials and discovered that some
                       dissolve in water and others, such as flour or sand, do not. The next day,
                       the children tried mixing other materials such as glue, lemonade powder,
                       tea leaves, and play dough to find out what happens to each of these
                       materials when mixed with water.

                       The children were playing at the water table and taking turns tossing an
                       object into the water, to find out which objects sink and which objects
                       float. Ms. Schultz held a plastic cup, and asked, "What do you predict will
                       happen to this cup when you put it in the water? Will it sink or float?" David
                       said, "It will float like the other cup," referring to the Styrofoam cup they
                       tested earlier. Dana said, "It will sink because it is more hard than the white
                       cup." Gaby said, "Maybe if we put it in like this (facing up), it will not sink."
                       Ms. Schultz asked, "Why do you think so?" Gaby said, "Because the water
                       will not go inside." She put the cup in the water, facing up, and the children
                       observed the cup floating. "You see! It is floating." David said, "Now, let's
                       put it in like this (facing down)." Ms. Shultz said, "That's a great idea. Let's
                       put the cup in the water facing down and see what happens. What is your
                       prediction? Will the cup sink or float?"

                       The children predicted that the plastic cup will float again. Ms. Shultz asked,
                       "Why do you think it will float?" David answered, "Because it was floating
                       before." She put the cup in the water, facing down, and everyone, including
                       Ms. Schultz, was surprised when they saw the cup sinking in the water. The
                       children were fascinated with what they discovered. They kept putting the
                       cup in the water, one time facing up and one time facing down, watching it
                       turn from a "floater" to a "sinker."15

                   Pause to Reflect
                   How can different interest areas in the preschool environment (e.g., the block
                   area, the water table, the sensory table, and the playground) be used to
                   enhance children's explorations of objects and materials?

Supporting Life Sciences

Life sciences for young children are about nurturing children's curiosity and fascination with the
natural world and building their understanding and appreciation of living things. Preschool
children have various opportunities to engage with living things in their preschool environment.
When playing in the yard, they may come across small animals or bugs or notice changes in the
trees. They may help take care of the class pet or plants in the room. They participate in
different planned activities related to living things, such as going on a neighborhood walk to
collect different leaves, search for bugs or other small animals in the yard, sort and classify
fruits and vegetables, explore various seeds, plant bulbs, sprout seeds, or grow a garden. Such

experiences in the preschool environment can provide the context for rich experiences of
scientific inquiry about properties and characteristics of living things.
The goal is to provide children with opportunities which allow them to closely observe living
things, including human beings, and to encourage them to question, explore and investigate
physical characteristics, behaviors, habitats, and needs. Through ongoing opportunities to
observe and discuss what they have seen, children develop their ideas about living things, how
they are the same, and how they differ from one another. They start to sort and classify and
look for patterns. They begin to recognize commonalities such as the physical structure and
basic needs of different living things, but also the diversity and variation among different
organisms.

                 Figure 10.4: Classrooms can get a butterfly kit to experience the life cycle of butterflies16

The teacher has an important role in guiding children through experiences of exploring and
observing animals and plants around them, whether outdoors, as they exist in nature, or
indoors in an environment that is as natural as possible. They deepen children's understanding
of living things, including features of their own body parts and processes, by encouraging
children to observe closely, raise questions, investigate more about a topic, describe and
represent their observations, and by creating opportunities for discussion and reflection. At the
same time, they model wonder and excitement of the natural world and an attitude of respect
for living things and their habitats.

          Key Concepts in Life Sciences
          In studying animals, plants, and humans, children develop an understanding
          of key concepts related to living things such as:

               All living things have basic needs that must be met for them to grow
                   and survive.

               The body parts of living things are useful for them in meeting their
                   needs.

               The physical characteristics of living things reflect how they move
                   and behave.

               Living things have their habitats in different environments.
               All living things grow over time and go through changes related to

                   the life cycle.

          There is variation and diversity in living things

                       Vignettes
                       While playing outdoors, Gregory pointed up to the oak tree and shouted,
                       "Look, a squirrel up in the tree." Joanna whispered, "Shhh . . . You will scare
                       the squirrel away." They stood there silently, watching the squirrel. Soon
                       more children joined them. Ms. Leon, watched them observing the squirrel
                       and asked, "What do you think the squirrel is doing?" (Pause) "What do you
                       think he is looking for?" She listened carefully to the children's ideas and
                       questions while observing the squirrel: "It is climbing up." "He is looking at
                       us." "I think he is looking for something to eat." Joanna asked Ms. Leon, "Is
                       that where he lives?" Ms. Leon turned the question right back to her and
                       asked, "What do you think?" Ms. Leon expected this question to come up
                       because recently they were talking about the habitats of different animals
                       and commented that some animals live in trees. Later, during group time,
                       Ms. Leon invited children to share with the group their observations of the
                       squirrel. She brought up her question again: "What do you think the
                       squirrel was looking for in the tree?" Some children said that squirrels were
                       looking for food. Ms. Leon asked, "What kind of food do you think squirrels
                       may find in the tree?" Joanna suggested, "Maybe they eat leaves." Miguel
                       said, "Maybe the squirrel was looking for seeds." Ms. Leon answered, "Oh,
                       so you think that squirrels may eat leaves, nuts, and seeds. Let's get our
                       small binoculars and journals and observe the squirrels to find out what
                       squirrels are doing in the tree and what they like to eat.

                       The teacher cut open the avocado, and Danny got really excited. "I knew
                       there was going to be a big seed inside." Ms. Wilson replied, "You did
                       predict that there was going to be a big seed inside." She invited children to
                       observe the inside of the avocado. Rena said, "It has this thing inside." Sara
                       pointed to the empty half and said, "This is where it was." The teacher
                       replied, "It is the avocado seed." She took out the seed and handed it to
                       Rena. "Oh, it is slippery." Ms. Wilson put it on a tray and said, "It does feel
                       very slimy." She invited children to observe the seed. "What does it look
                       like? What does it feel like?" After she gave children time to observe the
                       avocado seed, she pointed to the other fruits in the basket and said, "I
                       wonder if these fruits are also going to have seeds inside. What do you
                       think?" Rena said, "Maybe the orange will not have very big seeds." Danny
                       said, "The avocado has a big seed inside, not the orange." Ms. Wilson
                       asked, "What do you think is inside the orange?" The teacher invited the
                       children to predict what kind of seeds are inside an orange, a mango, a
                       butternut squash, a papaya, and a plum and wrote down their predictions.
                       She then invited the children to cut open the fruits and check what was
                       inside19

                   children in your group bring to their study of living things?

Supporting Earth Sciences

When children play with dirt, jump in puddles, collect rocks, observe the rain, or feel the heat of
the sun, they have direct contact with aspects of the earth. Daily interactions and direct contact
with objects and earth events provide children with the context to observe and explore
properties of earth materials and to identify patterns of change in the world around them (for
example, patterns of day and night, and changes in temperature). With teachers' guidance,
children's everyday interactions and direct contact with objects and earth events can become
rich, inquiry based experiences of earth sciences.

                            Figure 10.6: Exploring outdoors helps connect children with nature.20

Teachers can provide children with opportunities to explore the physical properties of earth
materials and to observe, record, and track changes in the weather and how it affects the living
world. Exploratory interactions with earth materials and ongoing observations of earth
phenomena enhance children's connection to nature and raise their awareness of the
importance of caring for and respecting the natural world. The box below summarizes key
concepts in earth sciences. The following section provides practical strategies to engage
children in rich, focused explorations of earth materials and phenomena.

Key Concepts in Earth Sciences
In studying earth materials and phenomena, children become aware of key
characteristics of earth:

     Earth materials (soil, sand, rocks, air, water) are part of the natural
         environment.

     Earth materials have different properties.
     There are patterns of change in earth phenomena (day/night;

         seasons). · Natural objects in the sky (sun, moon) are not always in
         the same place.
     Temperature and weather changes can be tracked over time.
     Weather and seasonal changes affect the environment.

People should respect and care for the environment.

                       Ms. Tina observes the children playing at the sandbox. Ted fills up the
                       bucket with water and pours it on the sand. Olivia and Ted watch as the
                       water is absorbed by the sand. Next they begin to pile the sand into a
                       mound. Olivia says, "It's like a mountain. Let's make it bigger." They add
                       more sand and compact it together. Their mountain is beginning to take
                       shape and gets bigger and bigger. Olivia says, "I am going to get water." She
                       gets a small bucket and gently pours it on top of the mountain. She notices
                       how the water creates a depression in the sand and then flows down. Ted
                       says, "Like a river." He gets more water in the bucket and pours it again in
                       the same place. The depressed part gets bigger. Ms. Tina gets closer and
                       asks, "What happens when the water is flowing down your mountain?" Ted
                       describes, "The water makes a hole in the mountain. Olivia says, "It takes
                       the sand down." Ms. Tina said, "A little bit of water at the beginning helped
                       to hold the mountain together, but pouring a large amount of water causes
                       the sand to slip and slide away. It can also happen in nature, when water
                       breaks down the land."

                       Today, Rena's father came to school to share with the group some of his
                       kites and to build a kite with the children. First, he invited the children to
                       observe him flying one of his kites in the air, and then the children took
                       turns flying the kite together with him. After they came inside, Rena's
                       father asked the children, "So what do you think makes the kite fly up?"
                       Children came up with different answers. "The wind touches the kite all
                       around, and it goes up in the sky. It pushes the kite up, up, up, up in the
                       sky." Another child said, "The air goes through the holes of the kite, and it
                       moves the kite to the sky." Rena's dad invited children to notice the shape
                       of the kite, and together they discovered that the kites he brought have a
                       similar shape, "like a diamond." He also asked them why they think the kite
                       needs to be light and not heavy, and one of the children said, "Because it
                       needs to fly up." Rena's dad told them, "A long time ago, kites were
                       invented in China. People used bamboo sticks and silk to make kites." He
                       then invited children to build a kite. "Now we are going to build our own
                       kite. What do you think we need to build a kite?

                       Every month the children observe the oak tree outdoors and keep records
                       of how it changes from month to month. Ms. B. encourages children to
                       make drawings of the tree, and together with the children, she takes
                       photos of it once a month. While observing the tree, Ms. B invites them to
                       share their observations: "What changes do you see?" "Why do you think
                       the tree changed like that?" Through such discussions, Ms. B helps children
                       to begin to draw the connection between the changes they observe in the

232 | I n t r o d u c t i o n t o C u r r i c u l u m f o r E a r l y C h i l d h o o d E d u c a t i o n
                       tree and the changes in the weather and seasons. In the fall, children
                       collected fallen oak acorns and leaves. They were fascinated with its deeply
                       lobed leaves, and some of them made drawings of the oak leaves in their
                       journals. They also observed the acorns and talked about them as well as
                       other trees around the yard that have dry fruit similar to the acorn. Ms. B
                       creates a class book with the observational drawings, children's words, and
                       photographs documenting the changes the children observe each month.
                       By the end of the school year, the book will include their documentation of
                       the tree in order of the seasons: fall, winter, spring, and summer.22

Engaging Families

Teachers can make the following suggestions to families to facilitate their support of history
and social science

     Use science learning as an opportunity to involve families by inviting them to the
         program and by sending home suggestions for activities that they can do with their
         children.

     Communicate to families their important role in supporting children's curiosity and the
         development of scientific knowledge.

     Share with family members your approach to science and how you support children's
         development of inquiry skills.

     Invite family members to come and talk with the teacher and children about their
         beliefs and connections to nature

     Share the importance of active hands-on explorations of objects and materials
     Inform families about children's explorations and experimentations with objects and

         materials.
     Involve family members as volunteers and rich resources in the preschool environment.
     Provide families with enrichment and follow-up activities they can do with children at

         home.
     Ask families about children's previous experiences, cultural beliefs, and theories about

         living things.
     Share with families children's experiences with science in the classroom.
     Remind family members of the many opportunities to engage children in life science

         explorations outside the preschool environment.
     Provide family members with tips to support children's awareness and understanding of

         their natural environment.23

Conclusion

Young children have a sense of wonder and a natural curiosity about objects and events in their
world. Through exploratory play and experimentation with objects and materials, they discover
how to make their car go downhill faster or how to control the movement and flow of water.
They are excited to find out what's inside a pumpkin, how trees change over the year, how the
rain feels and smells, and why pill bugs curl into a ball. The preschool environment nurtures
children's innate or natural dispositions to observe and seek information and guides their
curiosity into opportunities to observe, explore, and inquire about objects and phenomena in
their environment. Teachers provide children with a purposefully planned, play-based,
supportive environment that expands their explorations. Children's explorations and guided
investigations deepen children's understanding of concepts in science and develop their
attitudes, skills, and language of scientific inquiry.

              Figure 10.7: Capturing documentation of the worm this child found while exploring outside.24

While investigating concepts from physical, life, and earth sciences, teachers encourage
children to ask questions, to observe and investigate, to predict and experiment with objects
and materials, to draw conclusions, to document their work, and to share their observations
and ideas with others. Such experiences not only develop children's scientific inquiry skills, but
also provide the context for learning and developing their language (building vocabulary in
English and in their home language), literacy, mathematics, and social skills. Science also offers
a special avenue to include families in the curriculum and bridge the home and preschool
cultures. Preschool science is inclusive and prepares children for the scientific skills and
knowledge they encounter later in school. It fosters a joy of discovery, a positive approach to

throughout life.25

                   affect how you plan curriculum for science?

Introduction

The creative arts are as natural to young children's lives as language and play are. The arts build
skills such as problem solving and critical thinking; they bring parallel opportunities for the
development of language/communication, mathematics, and the development of social and
interpersonal skills. The following activities are often referred to as children's play: scribbling
with a crayon, pretending to be a pirate or a bird, humming bits of a tune, banging on a drum,
or swaying to music. But these behaviors in fact show elements of artistic expression and
creation that support continuous development of artistic skills. They also show the hallmarks of
children's abilities to express themselves through symbols and aesthetic images.1
The creative arts domain is presented in four familiar disciplines:

                                                  Types of Art

                 Visual Art: The visual arts include the practice of drawing,
                 painting, sculpting, and assembling collages in two or three
                 dimensions. Preschool visual art is process-based and open-
                 ended, allowing children to explore by using a variety of
                 materials. The product is not the focus, though the children
                 will likely view their creation as a masterpiece!

Figure 11.12

Figure 11.23     Music: Preschoolers love to listen to music as well as sing
Figure 11.34     along and move with music. Music learning in preschool is a
                 time to make new discoveries. Preschoolers can engage in
                 music making, performing rhythms, musical sounds and
                 passages with a variety of instruments, or simply sing along to
                 a favorite tune.

                 Drama: For preschoolers, this domain involves both
                 spontaneous dramatic play and teacher-structured drama,
                 each of which inspires the other. Preschoolers are naturally
                 inclined to engage in solitary, parallel, and group play, and
                 draw on these experiences when acting out situations and
                 using props (with teacher guidance). Similarly, engaging in
                 drama feeds children's imagination and inspires dramatic
                 play. A goal in dramatic play and drama for preschoolers is
                 unleashing the child's imagination. Thus, the focus is on
                 children's creative engagement in drama rather than on
                 actual performance or "the theater."

                 Dance: The dance domain for preschoolers is interested in the
                 creative and often expressive use of movement. Movement is
                 explored in all its range (e.g., small and large, fast or slow,
                 hopping or marching) and for various purposes, such as
                 learning math or language skills, or for the joy of moving.
                 Dance can be a nonverbal tool for expressing ideas, telling
                 stories, or communicating emotions. It is often rhythmic and
                 accompanied by music. Requiring thinking, social interaction,
                 and physical exercise, dance is a motivating way for
                 preschoolers to engage in learning.

Figure 11.45

The specific foundations, which are the knowledge, skills, and behaviors that preschool children

typically develop in a quality preschool environment as they relate to visual art, music, drama,
and dance are included later in the chapter as each strand is explored.6

Supporting Children's Learning

Much of children's development in the creative arts during the preschool years proceeds
naturally and needs only fertile soil, along with time, to grow. Children initiate many behaviors
and routines when they simply go about their play. They practice many skills along the way, and
supportive physical and social-emotional development occurs as children progress from ages
three to five. At the same time, their drawings become more mature and expressive, their
pretend characters and settings become more complex and social, their musical expression
skills grow with their muscular coordination and abilities to discern beat, tone, and melody, and
the movements they coordinate with music or simply orchestrate in silence gain in surety and
expressive complexity.

A primary responsibility of the preschool teacher is to let such natural developments occur.
Child-initiated artistic activity is valuable not only because it is so enmeshed with a host of
developments for children, but also because children cherish ownership of much of what they
do. Children follow their hearts and minds to what interests them and to areas where they
experience increasing mastery. They draw as they will and may not be interested in exactly
what thing, animal, or person the creation represents. They may hold firm to their idea of how
to draw a tree, behave like a bear, or sing like a bird; it often becomes important for teachers
and other adults to avoid critiquing such expressions (except where the child may solicit
advice). Teachers would do well to let the child experiment with, and perhaps revise, her

expressions as the need occurs or as maturing views of the world and its possible
representations take hold.

                         Figure 11.5 Participating and having fun with the arts should be the focus7

Along with child-initiated art, a complementary perspective needs reinforcement. This
perspective recognizes the ways that teachers can and should support young learners in their
development. An element of this scaffolding is creating conditions in the preschool program in
which interesting and important connections between the arts and other developments can
take place. Capitalizing on language and communication opportunities is another example;
placing children in settings where cooperation is important and where cooperative dispositions
and skills may grow is yet another. Some art activities can help children become aware of and
reflect on differences among people, become exposed to diverse art forms from different
cultures, and create a common platform of learning for children between home and school.
These considerations will set the stage for children's growth and interest in the arts.8

Guiding Principles

The following guiding principles relate the importance of teachings knowing their children and
providing instructional activities that tap into the children's prior knowledge and experiences.
Exploration in the arts is important and creative expression is more authentic when not
dictated by adult expectations. Adults need to scaffold this process of exploration providing
structure to activities, mediating potential problems, and inspiring and encouraging children's
progress. In this manner, adults can make the arts rewarding to all children, including those
with special needs.

Beyond helping to build artistic skills, reflection and modification are important to the creative
process. These opportunities in the arts also build skills such as problem solving and critical
thinking; the arts bring parallel opportunities for the development of language/communication,
mathematics, and the development of social and interpersonal skills. In the same vein, the arts
have applications to learning in many disciplines and to aspects of social-emotional
development. Observant teachers can capitalize on the arts to foster development of the self,
identity, and emotional outlet.

The arts can be pursued even with meager budgets and free materials. Children benefit from
high-quality learning experiences and high-quality materials-- both as vehicles to encourage
exploration and as symbols that demonstrate adult caring for children's welfare.

     The arts are inclusive of and can be enjoyed by all children.
     The arts are a language that is common to all and embrace understanding between

         children of different linguistic, cultural, and socioeconomic backgrounds, and between
         children of differing abilities.
     The arts promote dispositions for learning and regular experiences in the arts during the
         preschool years, cultivates life-long engagement in arts-related activities.
     Children make their own meaning. Original, imaginative expression is a natural
         occurrence when children engage in the arts that is scaffolded by adults in an
         appropriate environment.
     Children are capable of creating original art in all its forms.
     Children learn about human connections, beauty, and appreciation of the arts.
     The child's work is play and experiences in the arts should be offered in play-oriented
         approaches.
     Children are active learners who thrive when challenged appropriately. An effective
         curriculum includes a broad range of methods, experiences, and definitions of success
         for all children, teachers, and preschool settings.
     Arts experiences for preschoolers are more about process than product. Being engaged
         is what is important, not the end result or product.
     The arts reinforce the integrated nature of learning. Because children learn holistically,
         the arts should be presented in a way that is integrated with other domains of learning.
     Cultural competence is approached through art. The arts can help children reflect on
         their own cultures and origins as well as those of others.
     The arts are motivating and engaging for learners. The arts are a means to explore, take
         risks, communicate, and define personal perspectives and preferences regardless of
         culture, developmental status, or ability.
     Since children have a propensity for imitation, more than anything else, a teacher who is
         excited about the arts can potentially inspire children of any culture, language, or ability
         to become excited about art making.
     The arts provide a unique means for families to interact. They have songs, stories,
         games, and many other talents to share.11

Environments and Materials

Most materials necessary to support preschoolers' learning in the creative arts are inexpensive
and easy to obtain and can often be shared across art domains. In fact, by rotating props,
books, masks, and the like, teachers reinvent them in novel ways.

There are some basic needs in each art discipline to create exciting and enriching learning
experiences. Further materials will be summarized as each discipline is discussed later in the
chapter.

     Dance and movement require only space in a room and benefit further from music and
         costumes of modest scope and cost.

     Many things handy in a preschool environment can serve as props for dramatic play
         (spontaneous engagement in pretend play) and drama (guided experiences with
         instruction on acting out a drama), where imagination can turn almost anything into
         something else.

     Visual arts largely involve drawing, painting, and creating two- and three-dimensional
         works of art. These activities commonly make use of natural materials in addition to
         typical art supplies, such as, crayons, pencils, finger paints, watercolor paints, moldable
         dough, construction paper, and sufficient drawing or painting paper to provide the
         inspiration for children's creations. Children need flat places to draw and paint--
         tabletops, the floor, or outdoor surfaces, such as fences.

     It is important that music not be limited to prerecorded songs. Music is an active
         process. Music may be a little more demanding of specialized materials. A variety of
         rhythm instruments, such as wooden blocks, bongo drums, or hollow, hardwood boxes,
         can be used by children; little instruction is necessary. When these materials are not
         available, clapping hands and stomping feet can keep rhythm. Other musical
         instruments that may extend this collection include recorder-like wind instruments,
         shakers, stringed plucking devices, and so on.

     Adaptive materials may be necessary to ensure that activities are accessible for all
         children with disabilities or other special needs to participate in art activities with a
         feeling of enjoyment and accomplishment.

     Materials that may serve as props for pretend play, or costumes that reflect the cultural
         backgrounds of the children in the preschool program, are good to have on hand.

     Any and all art materials can be used to foster the creative process. Having a wide range
         of loose parts available gives children many opportunities to explore their creative
         tendencies.

                                Figure 11.8: Children enjoy playing basic musical instruments.12

Physical environments that support learning in the creative arts begin with sufficient,
appropriate space. The few basic materials described above, and space for the use of materials
and movement of the children, are all that is required of the environment. For example,
costumes, prop-like objects, and art supplies, along with a designated workspace accessible to
children, can help encourage learning while creating an aesthetically pleasing physical
environment.

Scheduled time for arts activities, with an organized flow of necessary preparation and cleaning
up (or possibly winding down of excited children), will also help facilitate learning. Teachers
quickly learn--often through trial and error--the importance of allowing sufficient time for an
art experience. The arts can also be woven into other areas of the curriculum throughout the
day.

An effective environment for teaching and learning in the creative arts for the preschool child
considers:

     The suitability, accessibility, safety, amount, and variety of materials.
     The aesthetics (beauty) of the early childhood environment.
     Sufficient open space for movement, dance, and theater play.
     Support for children's drawing skills.
     Indoor and outdoor environments for creating art.
     Art that is displayed at the eye level of the children. This includes their own, examples of

         visual arts, and photographs of those engaged in the arts.
     A well-constructed environment for social and collaborative learning.13

                       Research Highlight: Is It Art?
                       What is the difference between "art" and a mere scribble? Preschool
                       parents may be as interested in this question as the puzzled adult viewing
                       modern, abstract art at the local gallery. One sense of art stressed in this
                       curriculum framework is that the creative arts aim at the joys of free
                       expression and the pleasures of seeing and creating images. Art instruction
                       at the preschool level is also concerned with basic, first steps that can lead
                       to more advanced artistic skills.

                       Differing views prevail concerning the child artist. One approach seeks
                       artistic significance in a child's work--perhaps a genius or a prodigy is
                       emerging. A contrasting view dismisses the child artist by labeling his
                       artwork "haphazard" and its occasional glimpses of clever expression and
                       beauty as "accidental."

                       Over the years, the work of Nelson Goodman and Howard Gardner at
                       Harvard University's Project Zero has helped to demystify children's art.
                       Those scholars view art through the lens of cognition rather than through a
                       value-driven critique of aesthetics. Art is a cognitive activity, requiring
                       thinking, problem solving, communication, and intent. And learning in art is
                       frequently tied to learning in language as well as culture.

                       For Goodman, the classical question What is art? is transposed into a less-
                       familiar question: When is art? As Goodman suggests, art "occurs" when its
                       symbols are functioning aesthetically. The aesthetic functions of symbols
                       include expressiveness (conveying meaning or feeling), susceptibility to
                       multiple readings, and repleteness (full or abundant rendering). These ideas
                       de-emphasize judgments of beauty or merit; Goodman's artistic creator is
                       the individual with sufficient understanding of the properties and functions
                       of certain symbol systems to allow her to create works that function in an
                       aesthetically effective manner.

                       And what of preschool-age children? Rhoda Kellogg's documentation and
                       classification of hundreds of thousands of children's drawings from 30
                       countries testify to children's ability to use symbols at an early age, often
                       depicting qualities of the artist as defined by Goodman. Children's art is
                       frequently expressive, conveying emotion, feeling, action, and story.
                       Children's art may be more or less replete--with abundant renderings of
                       objects or symbols at times, with vague, sketchy treatments at other times.
                       Young children are not very likely to plan and create works with multiple
                       readings--this ability belongs to more mature developmental stages and
                       can emerge in adolescence.

                       Appearing commonly in drawings of children, especially those of two- or
                       three-year-olds, is the mandala, a term used to designate symbolic
                       representations that include a circular motif typically incorporating a
                       crosslike figure.5 For the child, the mandala is a well-balanced, pleasing
                       form that lies en route to genuine representation. The contrasting,
                       superimposed elements of the circle and cross are precursors to the figure's
                       metamorphoses to rounded figures with legs, arms, and facial details.

                       According to Gardner, the conditions suggested by Goodman, though
                       helpful in thinking through the puzzles of children's art, nevertheless leave
                       the debate about art created by children in a state of relative limbo. The
                       preschool teacher's role is to introduce children to a range of constructive
                       symbolic media and provide them with the faith that the child's own vision
                       and ability to give form to vision are worthy. The preschool teacher can
                       view children's art without an eye or plea for realism; rather, the gaze
                       might borrow from Paul Klee, who, when discovering his childhood
                       drawings, described them in a 1902 letter to his fiancée as the most
                       significant ones he had yet made.14

Let's take a closer look at each of the strands/disciplines of the Creative Arts.

Supporting the Visual Arts

Preschool children often have a natural fascination with the process of creating visual art.
Making marks, squishing clay, and using a brush to apply color are activities that attract most
young children. In groups where children speak multiple languages and may not share common
words, visual art can create connections and a way of communicating. Art can become a way
for people to connect across cultures to their common humanity; an appreciation for it may

begin in preschool. Inviting families into the environment to share works of art from the home
is an opportunity to build a bridge to the home.

Young children are naturally creative. The visual art framework is designed to encourage
creativity; open-ended projects emphasize the process of working with visual materials. In
other words, the curriculum is not focused on encouraging a child to produce, for example, a
specific painting, but rather to practice using a brush on paper without a set outcome.

                                           Figure 11.9: This child painting at the easel.15

Children are both consumers and creators of visual arts, which is reflected in the foundations:

Developmental Sequence of Drawing
When provided with tools and a supportive environment, children from
ages three to five progress more rapidly in the visual arts than during any
other two-year period prior to adulthood. Creativity and imagination are at
their apex at age four-and-a-half years; most experienced preschool
teachers will attest to this. The arts are a natural outlet for the creative
thinking of a preschooler, and learning is rapid.

The progression of children's drawing ability is the most documented in the
visual arts. When children are given a means and a place to make marks,
they begin with series of vertical lines and move on to mandalas (i.e.,
repeated circles). The mandalas soon sprout legs and arms, then faces, and
more detailed features such as hair, fingers, or eyes. Harvard University
Professor Howard Gardner refers to this process as "the birth of the potato
person." This research has become so well-known that medical doctors will
now check on children's intellectual progress by asking the child and parent
how detailed the child's human-figure drawings are (rather than asking
about letters and numbers) at the four-year and five-year checkups.
Because children speak multiple languages and progress differently around
writing skills, the question about drawing is more relevant and telling for
this age group.

                      The painting progress of children is not as well-documented as their
                      drawing progress. In general, children begin by simply experimenting with
                      brushstrokes and the process of applying paint to a surface. Children's first
                      paintings are usually solid sections of a single color, two colors, or three
                      colors at the most. The brushstrokes begin to change directions, and shapes
                      emerge. Finally, children begin to attempt representational paintings. The
                      subject matter of such paintings varies depending on the child, the teacher,
                      and the environment.16

Teachers can support children's development of the visual arts foundations with the following:
     Encourage engagement with art at all levels.
     Support exploration and discovery.
     Give children the time and space needed to explore creativity.
     Provide a comfortable environment in which children can practice art.
     Provide opportunities for children to reflect on their own work.
     Respect individual developmental, cultural, and linguistic differences, and encourage
         children to respect them.
     Provide children simply with a means and place to make marks (e.g., a crayon and
         paper), and they will begin with the same basic images.
     Encourage communication around shape and form to aid children's drawing skills.
     Help children acquire painting skills through practice with the tools.
     Stimulate children's interest in color and application of paint through other forms of
         painting.
     Create opportunities for children to work with dough, clay, or wet sand.
     Provide only the malleable material, without tools, during children's initial explorations
         of sculpting so that children have a chance to explore through touch.
     Communicate to a group of linguistically and culturally diverse children through
         sculpture techniques by using nonverbal methods.
     Introduce tools after observing that children have had many "hands-on" opportunities
         to explore clay and dough sculpture.17

                       Vignettes
                       Ms. Cheng is showing children how colors can be mixed to create other
                       colors. While pouring some yellow paint on the plate, she says "What is this
                       color?" "Yellow!" shout the children. Knowing that some children speak
                       other home languages, Ms. Lin asks "Milagros, how do you say yellow in
                       Spanish?" "Amarillo," Milagros answers. "Samantha, how do you say yellow
                       in Mandarin?" "Huang!" Samantha answers. Ms. Cheng pours out some
                       blue paint and asks the same set of questions. As she moves on to mix the
                       two colors, they turn into green. This time, without prompting, some
                       children shout, "Green!" others say, "¡Verde!" and others say, "Lu!"

                       It is springtime. The children have returned from a walk outdoors with
                       handfuls of yellow flowers. The teacher places the flowers in a cup in the
                       middle of the painting area and asks the children the color of the flowers.
                       Then he asks, "What shapes do you see in the flower?" The children say,
                       "Circles!" "Lines!" "Squares!" The teacher says, "Really? Where?" The
                       children point at different parts of the flower. The teacher brings out
                       brushes and paint and asks the children if they would like to paint the
                       flowers.

                       Many of the children sit down and begin to work with the materials,
                       producing all kinds of images. When a child has too much paint on the
                       brush, the teacher assists in showing the child how to wipe paint from the
                       brush on the side of the paint container. As the children finish, the teacher
                       encourages the children to talk about their paintings and then places them
                       in the drying area. Some children finish quickly, and others become
                       absorbed and work for a very long time. Some want to try several times on
                       new paper. A few children attempt to represent the flowers in their
                       paintings, and others experiment with the movement of the brushes and
                       the mixing of color on the paper.20

Supporting Music

When children develop an awareness and knowledge of musical elements, children progress in
their understanding and ability to control the elements for personal musical expression.
Although early childhood music education is primarily about introducing the child to musical
sounds and holistic experiences that are of the highest quality, enriched learning occurs when
the child has an understanding of and ability to manipulate the music elements of rhythm,
melody, form, loudness/softness, tempo, timbre, articulation, and style.

     Provide music areas where children can experience instruments or musical activities as
         individuals or in a small group.

     Set up a "Science of Sound" area where children can explore and experiment with
         building sounds.

     Provide a conductor's listening and play area.
     Make instruments with the children.
     Incorporate chant games and songs related to sound production.
     Include a variety of songs that related to a particular topic area
     Use songs that have movements or gestures that accompany the words.
     Provide children with an opportunity to conduct the group by singing or playing

         instruments.
     Dramatize poetry and nursery rhymes as a fun way to explore and develop vocal

         inflection and pitch capabilities in the young singer.
     Invite young children to move through instrumental program music, or music that "tells

         a story."

                        Research Highlight
                        The following points about music and development in early childhood
                        come from Start the Music Strategies, a collaboration by MENC (the
                        National Association for Music Education), the National Association for the
                        Education of Young Children, and the U.S. Department of Education. The
                        points were developed by reviewing the research and professional
                        literature.

                             We know that music is among the first and most important modes
                                 of communication experienced by infants.

                             As young children grow and develop, music continues as a basic
                                 medium not only of communication, but also of cultural expression
                                 and self-expression.

                             As preschool children not only listen to music, but also learn to
                                 make music by singing and playing instruments together (and
                                 responding to music in a variety of ways), they create important
                                 contexts for the early learning of vital life skills such as cooperation,
                                 collaboration, and group effort. Music in an educational setting also
                                 begins to teach young children to make judgments about what
                                 constitutes "good" music, helping them develop the rudiments of
                                 an aesthetic sense.

                             Music contributes to "school readiness," a foundational education
                                 aim of the American people for all our children.

                             When children develop musical skill and knowledge they are
                                 developing basic cognitive, social, and motor skills necessary for
                                 success throughout the educational process, and in life itself.25

                       window. Pretty soon, all the children are making different kinds of rain
                       sounds on the window. After a few minutes the rain comes to a stop, and
                       the children are invited to circle time.26

Supporting Drama

Drama is a valuable part of the preschool curriculum. Typically, children ages three to five first
experience drama by participating in dramatic play at home and in the early childhood
environment. Dramatic play is the foundation for the development of drama. This play typically
progresses from the time a child is 36 months old, when he or she engages almost exclusively in
solitary play and in watching others play; to the equal time engaged in solitary, parallel, and
group play at 48 months; and to primarily group play with some solitary and parallel play at 60
months.
Because of circumstances beyond their control, some children may arrive at school with limited
exposure to these areas. Regardless of prior exposure, however, all children bring experiences
that can enrich drama, and all children are capable of enjoying and participating in drama.
Preschool-age children enjoy participating in various types of dramatic play and drama, from
pretending to cook a meal in the dramatic play area to acting out part or all of a favorite story
with their teacher and peers.

                               Figure 11.18: What might these children have been acting out?27

During preschool, drama should be about the process of creating and exploring, rather than the
end product, such as a rehearsed play or other formal performance.

Teachers can support children's development of the drama foundations with the following:
     Observe dramatic play and role playing.
     Step in or model when needed.
     Provide adaptations to support the participation of children with disabilities or other
         special needs. This may include preteaching, using pictures, sign language, and other
         multisensory enrichment, modified equipment/props, etc.
     Use a drama-based vocabulary. For example, blocking, actors, stage, scenery, voice,
         props, etc.
     Encourage children to use drama based vocabulary
     Encourage and model the expression of interests and preferences.
     Encourage and allow initiative.
     Model and note appropriate ways of using drama materials.
     Move in and out role as appropriate (decide when to participate and when to facilitate).
     Use costumes, props, and scenery to inspire dramatic play and drama.
     Facilitate children's engagement in drama by first discussing expectations.
     Scaffold and encourage children during and after participating in drama to build their
         understanding and use of plot.28

                       Research Highlight
                       It is important that children be given the opportunity to make decisions and
                       determine the course of action during dramatic play and drama. It helps
                       cultivate social-emotional skills such as taking initiative in one's learning.
                       However, teachers should look for opportunities to participate often in
                       children's play. The teacher's participation adds an important dimension to
                       children's play. Research suggests that young children derive greater
                       benefits from dramatic play when the teacher or other adult is involved--
                       that is, monitoring and assisting children in engaging and fruitful play,
                       rather than just observing passively.

                       Ann Podlozny looked at numerous studies that examined the role of
                       children's participation in drama in their ability to understand stories. In the
                       17 studies that she examined, children listened to a story and either acted
                       it out or listened to the story a second time. Podlozny found that children
                       not only displayed greater story understanding and recall when acting out
                       the story rather than just hearing it, but that story understanding was
                       greatest when the teacher or other adult was in-role, working with the
                       children during the drama.

                       In another study, Robert Fink looked at how teacher involvement in role
                       play affects children's abilities to understand that people and objects retain
                       original qualities when others are added (conservation), that the physical
                       world stays the same even if one's view changes, and that people take on
                       multiple roles within a group (perspectivism). In Fink's study, children were
                       assigned to one of three groups. The first participated in dramatic play with
                       teacher support, the second participated in dramatic play without teacher
                       support, and the third group did not participate in dramatic play. After four
                       weeks it was found that the group that participated in dramatic play with
                       teacher support not only outperformed both other groups on measures of
                       conservation and perspectivism, but they also showed higher levels of
                       imagination when observed during dramatic play.

                       There are numerous social and educational benefits for children when they
                       engage in dramatic play and drama, and evidence suggests that teacher
                       involvement may enhance these benefits. Although it is important and
                       valuable to allow children autonomy (independence) and the ability to
                       make decisions and choices while engaging in play, frequent observation
                       and guidance are important. See "Interactions and Strategies,""Teachable
                       Moments," and the vignettes in this section for suggestions and
                       descriptions of how adults can enhance children's engagement in dramatic
                       play and drama.31

                       A day after reading and discussing "The Three Billy Goats Gruff" during
                       story time, Mr. Longfeather watches as a group of four-year-old children in
                       his class pretend to be goats. The three children portraying the goats are
                       trying to get into the "castle" as Juan, who is acting as a troll, stands guard.
                       Mr. Longfeather is pleased to see that the children are using several objects
                       he placed at the dramatic play area as props and scenery. Juan is clearly
                       having a great time, and laughs as he uses a deep voice and makes funny
                       "troll" faces.

                       After dramatic play time is over and the class has gathered on the rug, Mr.
                       Longfeather listens as the children excitedly recount and describe what
                       they did during dramatic play. "Juan was a funny troll," says Kim. Juan adds,
                       "And I used a walking stick." The teacher responds, "That's right, Juan.
                       When you were the troll, you were using the paint stick as a `prop.' A `prop'
                       is a thing actors use while pretending. I heard your deep troll voice and saw
                       your scrunched troll face. I noticed that you were laughing as you made the
                       faces. Did you enjoy making the faces?" The children ask if they can keep
                       their "castle," made from large blocks and fabric, in the dramatic play area.
                       Mr. Longfeather agrees.

                       Several children begin arranging the dramatic play area of their preschool
                       program to be a preschool itself. They excitedly call out their plans to play
                       the teacher, the assistant teacher, the parents, and even themselves. As
                       their teacher, Ms. Jackson, observes the activity, she notes that three
                       children are evident leaders of this enterprise: Peter, Emma, and Jamila, all
                       about four years old. The other children take an interest in this
                       development and look in on the preparations without participating much--
                       they occasionally toss in ideas or suggest the odd prop. Emma interrupts
                       the proceedings by pronouncing, "Come sit down on the rug, class. I'm the
                       teacher, and you are my children!" Peter and Jamila say nearly in unison,
                       "No, I'm the teacher!" Some of the remaining children express a preference
                       for who should be the teacher, including themselves.

                       As the project begins to fall to some grumbling and squabbling, Ms. Jackson
                       steps in and says, "This looks really great--you're building the whole
                       classroom in just one corner of the room. I'll bet you'd all like a chance to
                       be the teacher. So let's figure out how that can work." Jamila says, "How do
                       we tell who is the teacher?" Seizing a large plastic capital T from the
                       alphabet box, Emma says, "With this!" The teacher nods her head and says,
                       "That will be helpful because the word "teacher" starts with the "t" sound.
                       Peter adds, "The person with this yellow T will be teacher for a minute and
                       show the class something a teacher does. And we'll take turns." As the

                       children finish organizing the dramatic play area, Ms. Jackson sits down
                       next to Lulu and Alejandro, who are just beginning to learn English, to help
                       them understand the plan and participate.32

Supporting Dance

Dance and movement are an inherent part of life and are as natural as breathing. Dance is an
elemental human experience and a means of expression. It begins before words are formed,
and it is innate in children before they use language to communicate. It is a means of self-
expression and can take on endless forms. Movement is a natural human response when
thoughts or emotions are too overwhelming or cannot be expressed in words.

                       Table 11.5: Elements of Dance

There are many ways to describe each dance element. Teachers and children can add their
                                            ideas to this chart.

Teachers can support children's development of the dance foundations with the following:
     Help children to become enthusiastic participants in learning dance.
     Warm up! Even though preschool bodies are much more resilient than adult bodies,
         they should still be gradually prepared for any vigorous activities.
     Use play with games that require dance movements and cooperation.
     Be aware of cultural norms that may influence children's participation.
     Create environments and routines conducive to movement experiences.
     Consider the space, music, costumes, and props you provide.
     Establish spatial boundaries to ensure children have personal space when engaging in
         movement and dancing.
     Use children's prior knowledge.
     Structure learning activities so children are active participants.
     Introduce the learning of a dance skill by using imagery.

Research Highlight
Research supports the inclusion of dance in a preschool curriculum for a
number of reasons, not the least of these being the social-emotional
benefits gained from dancing at an early age.

In The Feeling of What Happens, neuroscientist Antonio Damasio describes
the body as the theater for emotions and considers emotional responses to
be responsible for profound changes in the body's (and the brain's)
landscape. Damasio creates three distinct classifications for emotions based
on the source of the emotion and the physical response to the emotion:
primary, secondary, and background emotions. The primary emotions are
the familiar emotions recognizable in preschoolers and adults alike:
happiness, sadness, fear, anger, and surprise. Damasio describes secondary
emotions as social emotions, such as jealousy or envy when a child is eyeing
a friend's toy or feelings of pride when accomplishing a difficult task. And of
particular interest in a discussion of dance are the background emotions--
much like moods. These refer to indications that a person feels down,
tense, cheerful, discouraged, or calm, and others.

Background emotions do not use the differentiated repertoire of explicit
facial expressions that easily define primary and social emotions; they are
also richly expressed in musculoskeletal changes, for instance, in subtle
body posture and overall shaping of body movement. Movement and
dance are natural vehicles for expression of these emotions.37

                       Vignettes
                       Sammy, a four-year-old in Ms. Huang's class, pulls a top hat off the hat rack
                       and begins to perform controlled balances high on the balls of his feet. Two
                       other children become interested in this performance, and suddenly three
                       children are using hats as creative props to stretch high into the air, with
                       their arms, as they rise up on their toes forming a chorus line; Sammy
                       continues to play the lead, placing a hat on a foot and balancing on one leg
                       like a bird; the other children imitate. The movement progresses to a
                       balancing game, and the children occasionally tumble to the floor, giggling.

                       Ms. Huang observes the movement game for several minutes and notices
                       the children have taken to making the same shape of the lifted bird leg. She
                       recognizes the children's imagination by commenting on their creative play
                       with the hat; she then suggests to Sammy that he attempt to bring his leg
                       behind him (in a pose resembling a ballet arabesque) while keeping the hat
                       balanced on his foot. The trio becomes more focused with their balances
                       and inventive with the shapes, moving the legs from the front to back and
                       even experimenting with lowering the torso while lifting the leg.

                       Mr. Soto leads the children in a lively singing and dancing performance of
                       Juanito (Little Johnny). The children shake and twist their bodies while
                       clapping their hands as they sing. "Juanito cuando baila, baila, baila, baila.
                       Juanito cuando baila, baila con el dedito, con el dedito, ito, ito. Asi baila
                       Juanito." (When little Johnny dances, he dances, dances. When little Johnny
                       dances, he dances with his pinkie, with his pinkie, pinkie, pinkie. That's how
                       little Johnny dances.)

                       In the first verse, they wiggle the pinkie back and forth; in the second, they
                       shake the foot and then wiggle the pinkie. Each time a new verse is sung, a
                       movement is added until the children's bodies are in motion, from head to
                       toe!

                       Even Matthew, who is generally reluctant to dance, picks his knees high up
                       and waves his arms exuberantly. Mr. Soto changes the character of the
                       song to Mateo, and Matthew dances into the center of the circle.38

Engaging Families

Teachers can make the following suggestions to families to facilitate their support of the
creative arts for their children:

     Try drawing, painting, and sculpture with the child at home.
     Embrace dramatic play at home. Provide props, costumes, space, and time.
     Show interest in their play and play with them.
     Turn on the music and move with their children.
     Incorporate dance and movement into everyday routines.
     Tap and clap to rhythm of songs and encourage children to do the same.
     Notice and talk about works of art seen and songs and music heard at home and in the

         community.
     Notice and talk about shapes and colors in works of art and in the environment, sounds

         heard, episodes of dramatic play
     Incorporate dramatic play into a variety of activities, such as reading and going on

         outings or trips.
     Bring the child to an art museum or areas in the community with public displays of art,

         community concerts, family-child music classes, community dance performances, and
         movement programs.
     Be open-minded and encouraging about works of art that are sent home from the
         preschool setting, children's spontaneous musical performances, children's dramatic
         play
     Share art, songs, music, and dance traditions or movement games from their homes.
     Donate materials that can be used in a variety of art experiences.
     Come to watch or participate in an art show, children's dramatic experiences, or a
         parent-child dance event39

Conclusion

The arts take on different meanings and expressions for individuals and communities.
Therefore, this chapter recognizes that the arts will materialize and thrive in ways individual to
each child and to the early childhood setting. This curriculum framework serves as a starting
point and reference for teachers and child care providers to shape how the arts can be
orchestrated or simply unleashed, as well as integrated, with other early learning experiences.
Each arts strand (visual art, music, drama, and dance) is given attention; suggested teaching
strategies, interactions, and environmental supports are illustrated with vignettes. However,
within each strand there are numerous opportunities to weave two or more of the four art
forms into the learning environment. More importantly, there are opportunities to integrate
the arts in the other domains such as physical development, science, mathematics, and
language and literacy.
It is essential to keep in mind that teachers serve diverse groups of children. The interactions
between the home and school are mutual and mutually important. Diversity is an essential
quality of human existence, and the creative arts provide excellent opportunities to learn,
understand, and express diversity.41

  Chapter 12: History & Social Science

Objectives:

     By the end of the chapter, you should be able to: Explain how history and social sciences
         are appropriate to plan for in early childhood education programs.

     Describe the foundations in history and social science that high quality early childhood
         education programs support

     Discuss how the environment supports children's understanding and participation in
         history and social science

     Identify ways educators can support children's engagement in and understanding of
         history and social science.

     Summarize ways to engage families in curriculum for history and social science.

Introduction

For many educators of young children, the terms history and social sciences conjure up images
of children studying past presidents, learning about other countries, and exploring related
topics during the primary school years. Yet, a look at young children's emerging sense of
identity, their growing interest in the larger social world in which they live, and their developing

also.

Young children are natural historians when they talk about their experiences and enjoy hearing
family stories of "long ago." They are intuitive geographers when they recognize the route to
the grocery store and create a map of the preschool room. Children are simple ecologists when

they worry about a plant that is wilted or a bird's egg on a nature walk. They learn about
democracy through their participation in shared decision making and taking turns on the
playground. Their interactions with other children acquaint them with the diversity in culture,
languages, backgrounds, and abilities in society. Young children are also everyday economists
as they begin to understand how money, bartering, and exchange work in the world around
them.

Preschoolers' understanding of history and social sciences naturally derives from their
expanding knowledge of the world and their place in it. It also provides a foundation for the
study of history, culture, geography, economics, civics and citizenship, ecology, and the global
environment that begins in the primary grades and continues throughout life. Those topics are
important because they provide a basis for understanding the responsibilities of citizens in a
democratic society, the legacy of past generations who built society, the importance of caring
for the natural world, and the rich diversity of other people.

In preschool, they are introduced to these important issues through everyday activities such as
caring for a plant, remembering a recent trip to the zoo, deciding as a group on a name for the
class pet, creating a shoe store, engaging in imaginative play with adult roles, or sharing family
traditions from home. In other words, young children learn about history and social sciences
from personal experiences, as they are enlisted into a preschool curriculum, and also from their
experiences at home. 2

Guiding Principles for Supporting History and Social Science

A thoughtfully designed early childhood program includes many activities that contribute to
children's understanding of history and social sciences. Some activities are carefully planned by
a teacher to help children learn about weather patterns, bartering for goods and services,
responsibilities as a class member, adult occupations, and many other ideas and concepts.
Other activities emerge from the opportunities created by children's spontaneous interests and
a teacher's capacity to build these into teachable moments. Taken together, they reflect the
assumption that young children develop knowledge of history and the social sciences as they
are encouraged to enact their understanding in everyday interactions with other children and
adults. This knowledge helps young children understand themselves in a wonderfully expanding
world. Here are some guiding principles on how to help children gain this knowledge.

     Build a cooperative, inclusive preschool community by ensuring that the curriculum
         maximizes children's opportunities to work together in ways that require responsible
         conduct, fairness, and respect for others.

     Create activities that will actively engage children's social skills and understanding.
     Affirm children's home cultures, experiences, and values.
     Build on preschool children's natural interest in their social world, and in the similarities

         and differences among the people in it.

     Actively teach and practice the essential skills of democratic participation.
     Encourage children to incorporate their knowledge of adult roles and occupations into

         their dramatic play.
     Observe and converse with children during play in order to learn about their current

         understanding of time and history.
     Help children deepen their own sense of place.
     Nurture children's sense of wonder about nature.3

Environmental Factors in Supporting History and Social
Sciences

When planning an environment to support children's learning in history and social science,
effective teachers consider the physical, curricular, and social elements. The physical
environment and daily routine set the stage for children's inquiry and should include ample
time for children's self-initiated work, different spaces for solitary play and for collaborative
play, and engaging materials that children are encouraged to use creatively. The curricular plan
needs to provide opportunities and adult support for both group learning and for informal
discovery and skill development. The key to a positive social environment is a teacher who
actively models curiosity, openness, and engagement and who is eager to explore the world
together with children. An environment that supports children's learning in history and the
social sciences has the following characteristics:

     Extended projects that are centered on a topic in history or social science and emerge
         from children's interests and inquiries

     Reflective of diversity; as opposed to a tourist approach, teachers and children
         participate in authentic experiences with culture

                       Research Highlight - Antibias Curriculum Approach
                       High-quality early childhood programs support children in developing their
                       physical, cognitive, social, and emotional potential. The settings encourage
                       children to explore their own sense of self and to develop an awareness
                       and appreciation of others. Such experiences are foundational to becoming
                       positive and constructive members of society and the world.

                       Creating an inclusive community of learners--one in which all individuals
                       feel comfortable, confident, and competent-- requires that educators take
                       an anti-bias approach to the planning, implementation, and evaluation of
                       their program. Educators who embrace an anti-bias curriculum approach
                       reflect on their own identity and experiences. They extend their knowledge
                       of different cultures and communities through conversation and discussion
                       with children, families, and colleagues. They also confront bias in the
                       preschool setting (e.g., "Girls can't play here" or "His eyes are a funny
                       shape") to send a message that all children should be respected and that
                       one's words can hurt other people.

                       Instead of using a one-size-fits-all curriculum, anti-bias educators design
                       environments and activities that reflect the real experiences of children's
                       lives. Educators routinely partner with families and community members to
                       further enhance the early childhood program. Throughout the day, the
                       adults in the preschool setting engage children in developmentally
                       appropriate conversations about similarities and differences, and promote
                       justice and fairness for all by helping children think critically about teasing,
                       bullying, and other hurtful behavior. Activities that promote anti-bias
                       education are integrated throughout the daily routine, thereby avoiding a
                       tourist approach. "The heart of anti-bias work is a vision of a world in which
                       all children are able to blossom, and each child's particular abilities and gifts
                       are able to flourish." For more information on the anti-bias approach, refer

Introducing to the Foundations

The preschool learning foundations for History and Social Science are organized into five broad
categories or strands:

     Self and Society: children's growing ability to see themselves within the context of
         society

     Becoming a Preschool Community Member (Civics): becoming responsible and
         cooperative members of the preschool community

     Sense of Time (History): developing understanding of past and future events and their
         association with the present

     Sense of Place (Geography and Ecology): developing knowledge of the physical settings
         in which children live and how they compare with other locations

     Marketplace (Economics): developing understanding of economic concepts, including
         the ideas of ownership, money exchanged for goods and services, value and cost, and
         bartering7

                     Figure 12.3: This child explored aeronautics and space through a mobile exhibit.8

Supporting Self and Society

An early childhood education setting acquaints young children with people who have different
backgrounds, family practices, languages, cultural experiences, special needs, and abilities. In
their relationships with teachers and peers, preschoolers perceive how others are similar to
them and how they are different, and gradually they learn to regard these differences with
interest and respect rather than wariness or doubt. This is especially likely if early childhood
educators incorporate inclusive practices into the preschool environment. The relationships
that young children develop with others in the preschool provide opportunities for

understanding these differences in depth and in the context of the people whom the child
knows well. One of the most valuable features of a thoughtfully designed early childhood
program is helping young children to perceive the diversity of human characteristics as part of
the richness of living and working with other people.

Young children are beginning to perceive themselves within the broader context of society in
another way also. Their interest in adult social roles, occupations, and responsibilities motivates
pretend play, excitement about visits to places such as a fire station or grocery store, and
questions about work and its association with family roles and family income. Teachers can help
young children explore these interests as children try to understand the variety of adult roles

Teachers can support children's development of the self and society foundations with the
following:

     Practice a reflective approach to build awareness of self and others by examining your
         own attitudes and values

     Maintain a healthy curiosity about the experiences of others; ask authentic questions to
         build understanding

     Partner with families in goal setting and program design; learn individual family values
         and each family's goals for their child's care and education

                       "You always get to do the money," complains Emma. Beck announces, "No,
                       Tommy, I'm the customer. I was here first." Ella and Maya argue about the
                       pieces of a plastic hamburger: "You can't have it again. It's the only one . . .
                       " These and similar interactions between children have been typical in the
                       area ever since Ms. Berta added the "Restaurant" prop box to it.

                       Now Ms. Berta is struggling to figure out how to foster more cooperation
                       among children playing in this dramatic play area. The restaurant theme is
                       very popular, but children's play is currently dominated by arguments over
                       who gets to use which items from the restaurant prop box. Each child
                       seems to be trying, independently, to hoard the most items from the box.

                       Ms. Berta shares her dilemma with Ms. Galyna, the school's mentor
                       teacher, who says she can come in for a quick visit during the next day's
                       play time. She follows her visit with some suggestions that help Ms. Berta
                       rethink the area's design for the following week

                       On Monday, the children entering the area are greeted by a large
                       restaurant sign. A waist-high shelf unit defines the front of the area. On top
                       of it sit two toy cash registers, supplied with ample paper bills, plastic coins,
                       receipt pads, and pencils. A clear plastic jar labeled "Tips" sits in between.
                       On a hook, hang clip-on badges: Cook, Cashier, Server, and Customer. There
                       are several of each. The shelves under the front counter hold stacks of
                       paper drink cups and trays. The cooking pans and utensils are clearly
                       displayed on the area's stove and sink shelves, as are multiples of food
                       items and dishes in the refrigerator and cupboard. The eating table is set
                       for customers

                       Ms. Berta begins play time as a restaurant customer, placing her order,
                       asking questions of the employees, and helping the other players think
                       about what a cook, server, or cashier in a restaurant would do. She refers
                       them to each other with their ideas and questions, and soon they are
                       having restaurant conversations with her and with each other "in
                       character."

                       Over the next two weeks, the group makes changes and additions to the
                       restaurant. At a class meeting, the group votes to make it a pizza
                       restaurant, and the teacher adds donated pizza rounds that children cover
                       with drawn-on toppings. With Ms. Berta's help, interested children work in
                       pairs to write and post menus. Several small groups of children remain
                       intensely interested in the theme, and their play in the restaurant area
                       becomes more elaborate and content-rich. With active teacher support and
                       modeling, friends are able to constructively solve conflicts that occur.10

Supporting Becoming A Preschool Community Member (Civics)

An early childhood program is a wonderful setting for learning how to get along with others and
for understanding and respecting differences between people. It is also an important setting for
learning about oneself as a responsible member of the group. In an early childhood education
setting, young children are enlisted into responsible citizenship for the first time outside of the
family, encouraged to think of themselves as sharing responsibility for keeping the room
orderly, cooperating with teachers and peers, knowing what to do during group routines (e.g.,
circle time), cleaning up after group activities, participating in group decisions, supporting and
complying with the rules of the learning community, and acting as citizens of the preschool.

                Figure 12.4: Knowing expected behavior during a large-group time is an important skill.11

Many formal and informal activities of an early childhood education setting contribute to
developing the skills of preschool community membership. These include group decision
making that may occur during circle time (including voicing opinions, voting on a shared
decision, and accepting the judgment of the majority); resolving peer conflict and finding a fair
solution; understanding the viewpoints of another with whom one disagrees; respecting
differences in culture, race, or ethnicity; sharing stories about acting responsibly or helpfully

                       The children gather for circle time, and after the group's gathering song,
                       Ms. Anya begins dramatically. "Today I am going to tell you a story about
                       something that just happened in our room.

                       At the beginning of playtime today, two of our friends, Julia and Javier told
                       me their plan was to work with the medical kits in the house area. They
                       were going to use the stethoscopes, bandages, and all the other medical
                       tools to take care of the babies. I told them I would plan to visit later to see
                       if their patients were feeling better.

                       A few minutes later, Julia and Javier hurried over to tell me that all the
                       babies were missing. They had looked all over the clinic, and had found no
                       babies! Where do you think they looked?"

                       The children in the group call out their ideas about all the places the
                       children could have looked. Ms. Anya continues, "You are right. They
                       looked in all those places. No babies. So what did they do next?" Many
                       children around the circle who are now recalling the incident call out, "They
                       asked us to help!" "That's right," affirms Ms. Anya. "They know what good
                       problem solvers you are and how good you are at teamwork, so they asked
                       you. Pretty soon you gave them lots of helpful suggestions of places to look.
                       And did they find the babies?" "Yes!" the children call out. "And where
                       were the baby dolls, Julia and Javier?" "They were out on the porch!" the
                       children respond, laughing.

                       Ms. Anya concludes the story by repeating, "Yes, you are right. The dolls
                       were out on the porch drying after yesterday's bath. Thank you all for
                       helping us solve the mystery of the missing baby dolls."14

                   Pause to Reflect
                   What are some ways educators can be a good example for children to follow
                   as they learn skills for being members of a community?

Supporting Sense of Time (History)

One of our unique human characteristics is the ability to think of ourselves in relation to past
events and to anticipate the future. The ability to see oneself in time enables us to derive
lessons from past experiences, understand how we are affected by historical events, and plan

14 The California Preschool Curriculum Framework, Volume 3 by the California Department of Education is used

for the immediate future (such as preparing a meal) or the long-term (such as obtaining an
education). The ability to see oneself in time is also the basis for perceiving one's own growth
and development, and the expectation of future changes in one's life.

The preschool years are a period of major advances in young children's understanding of past,
present, and future events and how they are interconnected. Yet their ability to understand
these interconnections is limited and fragile. Young preschoolers have a strong interest in past
events but perceive them as islands in time" that are not well connected to other past events.
As they learn more about events of the past, and with the help of adults, children develop a
mental timeline in which these events can be placed and related to each other. This is a process
that begins during the preschool years and will continue throughout childhood and
adolescence.

A thoughtfully designed early childhood program includes many activities that help young
children develop a sense of the past and future. The activities may include conversations about
a child's memorable experiences, discussions of a group activity that occurred yesterday,
stories about historical events, circle-time activities in anticipation of a field trip tomorrow, and
picture boards with the daily schedule in which special events can be distinguished from what
normally happens. In these and other ways, teachers help young children construct their own
mental timelines.

                       At outdoor play time, Mateo hurries over to a large tree limb lying at the
                       edge of the playground. "Look what happened!" he exclaims. "Yeah,"
                       agrees Luis, who had joined him, "the wind did it. It crashed down our big
                       tree, too, right into the street. Some guys are coming to saw it up." Luis
                       pauses. "My grandma said that tree was really old." Ms. Sofia, who has
                       followed them to the area, joins the conversation. "Your grandma told me
                       about that when she came with you this morning. It's a big surprise when a
                       tree that was there just yesterday suddenly isn't there anymore today,
                       especially when it had been growing there for a long, long time. Things like
                       that can happen fast. What do you think will be different when you get
                       home this afternoon?"

                       For today's circle time, Ms. Robin has prepared a two-column chart with
                       the headings: "When I was a baby, I couldn't . . ." and "Now I can . . ." She
                       reads the first phrase and asks the group to think of things they were not
                       able to do as babies. As children share their ideas, including, "I couldn't
                       walk; I couldn't ride a trike, I couldn't eat apples . . ." she lists them in the
                       first column. When they finish, she reads all the ideas aloud to the group.

                       Ms. Robin then points to the phrase, "Now I can . . ." and again asks for
                       children's ideas. After they finish sharing, she reads aloud the second list.
                       As she points to each list, she comments to the group enthusiastically,
                       "Look how many things you couldn't do when you were a baby! Look how
                       many things you can do now! You've grown so much!"

                       Nico looks through the familiar homemade, photo-illustrated book titled
                       Teacher Jen's Broken Ankle that is displayed on the reading area book rack.
                       "My papa fell and broke his arm when he was a little boy," he tells Ms. Jen.
                       She asks him how it happened, and he tells her the story his papa has told
                       him. Ms. Jen wonders with Nico whether his papa had to wear a cast on his
                       arm while it was healing. Nico says he thinks so, because he remembers
                       that Papa was supposed to keep his arm dry for a long time. He then asks
                       Ms. Jen to show him again the ankle cast she wore while her leg was
                       healing. She keeps the two halves of her bright pink cast in the "Hospital"

                   Pause to Reflect
                   How might you want to partner with families to make the preschool
                   environment reflective of their diverse family stories?

Supporting Sense of Place (Geography and Ecology)

Each person has a sense of the places to which they belong: home, workplace, school, and
other locations that are familiar and meaningful. Young children experience this sense of place
strongly because familiar locations are associated with important people who constitute the
child's environment of relationships. Locations are important because of the people with whom
they are associated: home with family members, preschool with teachers and peers.
Preschoolers also experience a sense of place because of the sensory experiences associated
with each location: the familiar smells, sounds, and sometimes temperatures and tastes
combine with familiar scenes to create for young children a sense of belonging.
Developing a sense of place also derives from how young children interact with aspects of that
physical location. Preschool children relate with their environments as they work with
materials; rearrange tables, chairs, and other furniture; create maps to familiar locations; travel
regularly from one setting to another; and work in other ways with their environments. Young
children also interact with their environments as they learn to care for them. Young children's
natural interest in living things engages their interest in caring for plants and animals, concern
for the effects of pollution and litter on the natural environment, and later, taking an active role
in putting away trash and recycling used items.

                          Figure 12.8: Gardening is an excellent opportunity to care about plants.19

These interests present many opportunities to the early childhood educator. Young children
can be engaged in activities that encourage their understanding of the environments in which

                       Michael sits down with his peers and Mr. Sean at the snack table. "There
                       was a huge dump truck going down my street today," he tells everyone. Mr.
                       Sean asks him what was in the truck. "Rocks and big sidewalk pieces,"
                       replies Michael. "I know that," adds Rio. "It's by my house. Papa says
                       they're digging up the street for water pipes." Several other children nod
                       and agree that they know where that is and they have gone by it, too. Mr.
                       Sean tells the children that the construction site they are talking about is
                       just around the corner and down one block from their preschool. "Would
                       you like to take a walk together to watch them work?" he asks. "It sounds
                       like a big and exciting construction project is happening in our
                       neighborhood."

                       "I like this place," shares Maya as she looks around the small reading area.
                       "What do you like about it?" asks Ms. Nicole. "I like the green. It's like un
                       bosque." Yes, agrees Ms. Nicole. The green plants do make it seem like a
                       forest."

                       This is the castle for the princess and her friends," explains Grace to Tanya
                       as she describes her unit block structure. "Here's the bedroom over here,
                       and the tower over there."

                       Ms. Julia, sitting in the block area to observe children's play, responds, "It
                       looks like a very long way from the bedroom to the tower. Do the princess
                       and her friends ever get lost in the castle?" "Well . . . sometimes they do,"
                       replies Grace. "I wonder if we could draw something to help them find their
                       way," suggests Ms. Julia. "Like a map!" exclaims Tanya to Grace.

                       Ms. Julia offers to bring the clipboards, equipped with paper and pencils,
                       from the art area. She takes one and begins describing her drawing plan.
                       "First I'm going to draw a square for the bedroom in this corner . . . " The
                       girls begin by imitating her technique and soon are exchanging ideas with
                       each other as they draw their versions of the castle. When they are
                       finished, Ms. Julia asks questions about the parts of their castle maps and
                       offers to label them. When the maps are finished, labeled, and signed, Ms.
                       Julia asks the girls' permission to display them on the block area wall.23

                   world into your own classroom? What might some things to try beyond that?

Supporting Marketplace (Economics)

Young children's interest in adult roles and occupations extends to the economy. Preschoolers
know that adults have jobs, and they observe that money is used to purchase items and
services, but the connections between work, money, and purchasing are unclear to them. This
does not stop them, however, from enacting these processes in their pretend play and showing
great interest in the economic transactions they observe (such as a trip to the bank with a
parent).
Moreover, young children are also active as consumers, seeking to persuade their families to
purchase toys or access to activities that they desire, sometimes hearing adult concerns about
cost or affordability in response. On occasion, they also learn about economic differences
between people and families, such as when a parent is unemployed or when families are living
in poverty. All of these activities convince them that the economy, while abstract to them, is
important.
A carefully designed early childhood education setting provides many opportunities for young
children to explore these ideas through play, conversation, and the creation of economic items
to buy, sell, or exchange.

                    Figure 12.11: A cash register is an excellent prompt for exploration of economics.24

         children's books
     Provide open-ended materials to support children's spontaneous investigations of

                       Ms. Jen settles into the reading chair to begin large group story time. She
                       holds a tall empty jar, a small cloth bag, and a book.

                       "Today I brought something with me to help me tell a story," she begins.
                       Then she holds up the small drawstring bag and shakes it. "Money!" call out
                       the children. "Yes, it is money. My little bag is full of coins: nickels, dimes
                       and quarters," she says, pulling out one of each. "This book is all about a
                       family who collects coins and saves them in a jar that looks a lot like this
                       one. It's called A Chair for My Mother, and Vera B. Williams is the author.
                       She wrote the words. She is also the illustrator, which means she painted
                       the pictures."

                       As Ms. Jen reads the book, she stops frequently to converse with children
                       about what is happening in the story. "The mother in this story works as a
                       server in a restaurant. That's how she earns money to buy the things her
                       family needs." After reading the page that describes the "tips" that Mother
                       brings home and puts into the jar, Ms. Jen asks the group if anyone they
                       know gets tips at work. After explaining the idea, she pours the coins from
                       her small bag into the tall jar she has brought as a story prop.

                       When she reads the pages about the family's moving day, when all their
                       relatives and neighbors brought things they needed to replace the ones lost
                       in the fire, Ms. Jen talks about how people don't always buy all the things
                       they have. Sometimes people receive gifts and things that others share with
                       them.

                       As each economic concept is introduced in the book, Ms. Jen pauses to
                       draw attention to it, while maintaining the flow of the story. At the end, she
                       holds up the jar of coins and asks the group how long they think it took for
                       Josephine's family to collect enough coins to buy the chair. She responds to
                       their comments, listening as they share their own related ideas. She
                       concludes by telling them that the book will be in the reading area
                       tomorrow for them to enjoy again.26

                   Pause to Reflect
                   What resources are in your neighborhood that a preschool teacher could use
                   to introduce children to the community's economic life?

Engaging Families

Teachers can make the following suggestions to families to facilitate their support of history
and social science

     Encourage families to tell stories and sing songs to their child about their home culture
     Remind families that they are the child's most influential models.
     Support families to help their child develop strong, warm relationships with adults and

         children among their family and friends.
     Suggest ways that family members can talk with their child about the daily work they

         do.
     Suggest that adults find household projects to work on with their child.
     Remind adults to notice and recognize times when their child is being cooperative and

         responsible.
     Encourage adults to talk with their child about respect and fairness.
     Work with adult family members as they establish some simple, age-appropriate rules

         to be followed at home and help children understand that there is a reason for each
         rule.
     Share ways to establish some dependable family rituals and routines.
     Remind families to discuss family plans and events with children before they occur.
     Share with family adults the importance of recounting past shared events with their
         children. Suggest that they use storytelling to help children remember the sequence and
         details of both everyday and special experiences.
     Suggest that families find a special place for items that document children's growth.
     Encourage adult family members to tell children stories about their family's history.
     Suggest that they look for maps in places where their family goes.
     Suggest taking different routes when going to familiar places.
     Encourage families to talk about nature (i.e., weather, seasons, plants, animals, and so
         on) with their child.
     Encourage families to have conversations about ways they can help the earth (reduce
         waste, conserve natural resources, compost, etc.)
     Suggest that adult family members share with their child elements of the natural world
         they especially enjoy.
     Encourage families to talk with their child about the connection between cost and
         decisions to buy items and services.
     Assure families that it is fine to have conversations about "wants" and "needs."
     Suggest that families show their child some alternative ways to acquire things the family
         needs or wants, as well as ways to help meet the needs of others.
     Encourage families to begin to share with preschool children their own values about
         money.

     Prepare yourselves, as early care and education professionals, to play an active role in
         supporting families facing personal economic crises. Educate yourselves about available
         community services and, when possible, help families to obtain access to them.27

Conclusion

The knowledge and skills in history and social science that preschoolers acquire in an early
education setting provide a foundation for their understanding of themselves and the world in
which they live. Adults benefit from the perspective of history (of society, families, and one's
personal past). People are connected deeply to the physical settings and natural ecologies in
which they live. People learn about themselves and others by comparison with people who
differ in culture, language, ethnicity, traditions, and abilities. Human lives are shaped by the
economy and its influence on people's roles as workers, consumers, and investors. Citizens
participate with others in the political process and in building their communities. As
preschoolers learn about these topics through instruction, enactment, and play, they are
introduced to issues that will remain important to them for years to come.29

Introduction

Young children learn best by doing. Active physical play supports preschool children's brain
development and is a primary means for them to explore and discover their world. Physical
activities enhance all aspects of development, including cognitive, emotional, social, as well as
physical.

     Cognitive growth occurs when children problem-solve how to negotiate an obstacle
         course or how to build a fort.

     Emotional development is supporting when children's confidence and willingness to try
         new activities increases.

     Social development is supported through the interaction with other children and the
         development of friendships through active play.

     Being active also has clear benefits for children's health and fitness.

The preschool years are a prime time for children's physical development. Preschool programs
have a key role in maximizing children's developmental potential during this important time by
providing well-designed, regular, and frequent opportunities for physical play. Although many
of young children's physical activities are exploratory and self-directed, children greatly benefit
from adult encouragement and guidance when learning new physical skills. Teachers tap into
children's intrinsic motivation for movement by designing meaningful, culturally appropriate,
and accessible play activities in which all children feel challenged yet successful.

              Figure 13.1: These children learn to navigate obstacles by practicing it on this play structure.1

Teachers are important role models in the area of physical development. Children benefit
immensely when teachers engage in physical activities alongside children and share in the fun
of physical movement. Just as important, preschool programs collaborate with family and
community members to promote children's physical development. Family support and
participation foster children's active lifestyle habits. Promoting active lifestyles during the
preschool years will benefit children throughout their lives.2

Guiding Principles of Supporting Children's Physical
Development

Teachers play a critical role in supporting children's physical development because physical
skills need to be explicitly and deliberately taught. Physical play, both indoors and outdoors, is
not merely "free time"; it requires thoughtful planning and intentional interactions. The
following guidelines will help teachers support children's physical development.

     Developmentally appropriate movement programs accommodate a variety of individual
         differences among children.

     Children often learn best through maximum active participation. There should be a daily
         quest to minimize sitting, waiting, and watching so children enjoy meaningful
         participation in physical activities. Maximum purposeful participation at some level is a
         challenging but attainable goal.

     The physical safety of children's play environments should be of paramount importance
         at all times (children should be able to take reasonable risks).

     Family members working as partners with teachers are key to enriching the physical
         development of children.

     Inclusion of children with special needs is beneficial to all and promotes greater
         understanding of and respect for diversity.

     Children are multisensory learners with unique learning styles.
     To maximize teaching effectiveness, movement skill learning should first focus on

         improving body coordination and increasing awareness of body movements. The
         product, or quantitative aspect of movements (e.g., how far they jumped, or how fast
         they ran), should not be the initial focus of learning.
     Children generally learn new movement skills more easily when they can focus on one
         specific aspect of the skill at a time.
     Children benefit from ample opportunities to practice new physical skills.
     Children benefit from integrated learning activities across the curriculum.
     Frequency, intensity, type, and duration are the four key parameters to designing active
         physical play to enhance children's fitness and health. The four parameters may be
         thought of as the FITT principles (Frequency, Intensity, Type, Time [duration]).

             o "Frequency" refers to the regularity of engaging in physical activity; frequent
                  short periods of physical activity each day are preferred (children should not be
                  sedentary for more than 60 minutes at a time except when sleeping).

             o "Intensity" refers to whether activities are sedentary, mild, moderate, or
                  vigorous; moderate to vigorous activities are preferred.

             o "Type" deals with the specific kind of physical activity engaged in; for young
                  children, the types of activities usually take the form of active games, child-
                  initiated play, as well as rhythms and dance.

             o "Time" (duration) refers to the amount of time in which the child is engaged in
                  physical activity; accumulating at least 60 minutes, and up to several hours, of
                  moderate to vigorous physical activity per day is recommended.

     Physical skills are more easily learned when clear instructions and appropriate feedback
         are provided in children's home language using familiar communication methods.

     Allow children to take risks. Risk taking allows children to challenge themselves, and to
         assess their own skills and abilities.3

Environmental Factors in Supporting Children's Physical
Development

The following recommendations apply to establishing the preschool environment as related to
the three Physical Development strands: Fundamental Movement Skills, Perceptual-Motor
Skills and Movement Concepts, and Active Physical Play

          Teachers promote optimal physical development when they provide children with
             positive encouragement and quality instruction (both indirect and direct). Teachers
             "set the stage" and "create the climate" for movement skill learning.

          The immediate physical environment is a powerful influence on children's physical
             development. The physical environment, play materials, and play themes can all be
             skillfully designed to promote active play. Both indoor and outdoor play
             environments should encourage fun and enjoyable learning.

          Indoor and outdoor play environments should include a variety of appropriately
             sized equipment that promotes both gross and fine motor development.

          Learning is most meaningful when the environment and materials reflect and
             accommodate children's individual interests, backgrounds, and present abilities.
             Embrace the richness of diversity by learning about children's culture, language,
             customs, music, physical activities, and focus on the unique gifts that each child
             brings to the learning environment.

          Take time to build safety into both the indoor and outdoor play environments.
          A safe environment reduces the need for adults to say no. It is important to establish

             clear expectations. Limits should be set rather than rules (rules eliminate reasonable
             risk) in order to ensure personal safety. Be particularly cognizant when working with
             children who have disabilities that impact their impulse control and judgment. Also,
             differences in cultural expectations for girls and those for boys, as well as language
             differences, may impact the critical need for building safety into children's regular
             play environments.
          Playground equipment, such as climbing, hanging, and sliding structures, should be
             checked regularly for safety hazards.
          Movement experiences should include exploration, discovery, and appreciation of
             the natural environment. Nature provides rich, diverse sensory experiences--
             sounds, smells, textures, and sights--that are beneficial for young children's
             sensorimotor development.
          Thoughtfully designed movement experiences, guided by adults, support children's
             physical development. Most children need more than just free play to acquire
             movement skills. Children benefit from teacher-guided, structured physical
             activities, particularly when they are learning new movement skills. Structured but
             flexible play activities that emphasize active participation, exploration, and self-
             discovery are ideal for practicing new, challenging physical skills.4

          Create culturally diverse scenarios for skills.
          Create meaningful scenarios that provide the opportunity for the integration of skills
             with other curriculum concepts.
          Use both unstructured and structured strategies, as well as multisensory
             experiences, in your teaching.
          Create developmental activities that provide a sense of success.
          Provide opportunities for repeated practice in a safe environment.
          Provide plenty of encouragement.
          Create activities that provide automatic feedback and a sense of accomplishment.
          Provide clear, specific feedback to facilitate children's problem-solving process.

                   Pause to Reflect
                   How can family culture, language, and diversity be incorporated into
                   fundamental movement activities? How can ideas and materials from
                   children's different cultures be included in fine motor activities and games?

                       Research Highlight: Must Young Children Sit Still in Order to Learn?
                       Researchers have stated that high activity levels, impulsivity, and short
                       attention span for sedentary activities are characteristics of typically
                       developing preschool-age children. Children naturally need to move in
                       order to learn. Being physically active boosts children's attention span and
                       capitalizes on multisensory learning so that children are more likely to
                       retain academic concepts such as colors, shapes, and the alpha-bet. The
                       need for movement-based learning experiences may be particularly
                       important for children with special needs. Research has shown that for
                       children who have autism spectrum disorder and attention deficit
                       hyperactivity disorder, being seated on a movable surface (e.g., a therapy
                       ball) resulted in increased ability to stay on task and remain seated during
                       classroom learning activities. However, children seated on a static surface
                       such as a bench, chair, or floor were less able to remain on task. Experts
                       have suggested that adults' efforts to entice young children to sit still, pay
                       attention, and be quiet during learning activities often run contrary to
                       children's natural needs for physical movement.7

Introducing the Foundations

The preschool learning foundations for physical development are organized in terms of three
broad categories or strands:

     Fundamental Movement Skills
     Perceptual-Motor Skills and Movement Concepts
     Active Physical Play8

The first strand is Fundamental Movement Skills. Most preschool children can acquire
reasonable levels of competence in a wide range of movement activities, including balance,
locomotor skills, and manipulative skills (both gross motor and fine motor), when given
opportunities for instruction and practice in an enriched environment. The second strand is
Perceptual-Motor Skills and Movement Concepts. This strand focuses on the development of
body awareness, spatial awareness, and directional awareness. These skills are important for
interacting with others and for exploring the environment. The third strand is Active Physical
Play. Active physical play promotes children's health and physical fitness by increasing their
levels of active participation, cardiovascular endurance, muscular strength, muscular
endurance, and flexibility.9

The specific foundations are included later in the chapter as each strand is explored. They
include what children should be able to do when in high quality early childhood program at
around 48 months and at around 60 months (which roughly corresponds to the end of the first
year and the end of second year of preschool).10

Supporting Fundamental Movement Skills

Fundamental movement skills are the foundations on which more complex movement skills are
built. Early childhood is a crucial and unique time for developing coordination of the basic
movement skills. During this period, daily movement experiences significantly influence
children's patterns of movement and their future as happy, active movers. Children who
develop these fundamental movement skills tend to become confident movers and have the
building blocks for an active way of life.

Fundamental movement skills emerge following a developmental sequence from simple to
more complex body actions. Initially, when children attempt a movement pattern, they move
few body parts (e.g., when throwing, move only one arm while the rest of their body remains
still). As their movement skills develop, children begin incorporating other body parts (e.g.,
throwing with one arm while stepping with one foot). Research-based developmental

sequences represent common pathways of development and can guide instruction and
learning. However, each child's development is unique and affected by many factors (e.g.,
genetics, culture, special needs, socioeconomic status, environment, and practice). Teachers
should expect variations in individual development.

Fundamental movement skills develop through meaningful interactions with the environment,
people, and objects; through both structured (e.g., teacher-guided) and unstructured (e.g.,
child-initiated play) practice of movement skills; through the integration of fundamental motor
skills into the preschool curriculum; and through the integration of fundamental movement
skills into the daily home life of children. Children's movement activities should be designed
with consideration of the multiple cultures and diversity of the participants. In addition,
teachers need to be sensitive to children with disabilities and special needs and modify the
tasks, context, or environment, including appropriate assistive devices and instructional
strategies, to facilitate the development of fundamental skills for all children.

Fundamental movement skills include:

Balance

Figure 13.3: This young boy is practicing his balance.11

The ability to balance is fundamental to all body movements. All movement involves elements
of balance, and each movement has different balance requirements.

Teachers can support children's developing balance with the following:
     Design spaces and activities to develop balance following a developmental progression.
     Incorporate balance activities into the children's world (such as acting out balancing
         challenges).
     Provide opportunities for activities that include both active movements and still body
         positions.
     Post pictures of balance positions and balance activities (can be of culturally
         representative athletes, dancers, performers, including those with disabilities).
     Design the environment so children combine balance skills with fundamental movement
         skills and movement concepts.
     Use visual aids, foot and handprints, and objects on the floor to promote balancing
         skills.

Locomotor Skills

The movement skills that children use to move effectively and efficiently through space. These
skills allow children to travel, explore, and discover their environments. Preschool children use
locomotor skills in their daily activities to move from one area to another.

                  Figure 13.4: Running is a locomotor skill that is being refined during early childhood.12

You can find example representations of the developmental sequences of fundamental
movement skills in Appendix D.

Teachers can support children's developing locomotor skills with the following:
     Observe and analyze children's locomotor skills to facilitate planning for learning
         opportunities.
     Promote progressive development of leg strength.
     Promote and be aware of the progressive development of coordination of locomotor
         skills.
     Encourage practice of locomotor movements in both indoor and outdoor environments.
     Use vivid visual information and visual aids that communicate to children in simple ways
         how to move.
     Use music, songs, rhymes, and stories to provide rhythmic patterns.
     Plan meaningful, purposeful, and connected locomotor activities and games.
     Create picture cards representing different ways to move related to children's cultural
         background.
     Allow children to take risks in their physical play.

Manipulative Skills

Skills that allow children to use their arms, hands, legs, and feet to project an object away from
the body (e.g., throwing a beanbag) or to receive and absorb the force of an object coming to
the body (e.g., catching a balloon). Fundamental motor skills that involve large muscle groups
are called gross motor skills (e.g., kicking) and the ones that involve small muscle groups are
called fine motor skills (e.g., cutting).

Fine motor manipulative skills are usually those in which children manipulate objects with their
hands. Fine motor manipulative skills include cutting, painting, and buttoning.

Gross motor manipulative skills include tossing, rolling, throwing, catching, striking, kicking,
bouncing, and punting with objects.

                       Children constructed birds and balls out of paper while playing indoors.
                       They colored the papers using markers of different colors. Children also
                       decorated their creations with colorful feathers and cut out shapes from
                       magazines. They attached these decorations to their birds and balls with
                       glue. When the decorations were dry, the teacher invited them to play with
                       their birds and balls outside. The teacher, Ms. Gupta, previously had
                       designed the outdoor play area by placing some colorful plastic hoops,
                       cones, and shapes on the floor with pictures of the community buildings
                       attached to them. She also drew a line two steps away from the pretend
                       buildings.

                       Outside, she said to the children, "Let's make the birds fly toward those
                       buildings and see where they land." The children became excited and began
                       using the throwing action to fly their birds. Some children were much closer
                       to the line, and others stood farther away. While throwing, they began
                       adjusting their proximity to the line. Ms. Gupta said, "How can you move
                       your bodies to make your bird fly up in the sky?" Jamila said, "I know, throw
                       like this [moving her arm up and down]." Lesley said, "We need to step and
                       send the bird up." Ms. Gupta paused and observed them throwing for a
                       while. One child's bird was going down fast, and she said, "Xuyen, do you
                       want your bird to go up?" Xuyen replied, "Yes." Ms. Gupta asked, "How can
                       we do that?" Xuyen shrugged her shoulders as though to say, "I do not
                       know."

                       Ms. Gupta then suggested, "How about if you throw it toward the sky?"
                       Xuyen moved her arm up over her head in the throwing action, and her bird
                       flew a little longer. She noticed and smiled, then ran to get it and tried
                       again. Ms. Gupta smiled and said, "You moved your arm up this time. That
                       is the way to make your bird go up: keep moving your arm up each time."
                       Another child was picking up his bird, and Ms. Gupta said, "Yeng, on what
                       building did your bird land?" Yeng said, "The store." and kept running back
                       to try again. Ms. Gupta said to another child, "Mary, did your bird land in
                       the hospital?" Mary replied, "No, that is the park." Mary was right. Ms.
                       Gupta continued asking different children about the buildings.16

Supporting Perceptual-Motor Skills and Movement
Concepts

Perceptual-motor skills and movement concepts are essential to all facets of young children's lives.
Perceptual-motor coordination is the process of receiving, interpreting, and using information from

all of the body's senses. Perceptual-motor development requires children to integrate both sensory
and motor abilities to carry out physical activities. All voluntary movement involves an element of
perception, and perceptual-motor coordination plays an important role in children's development
of movement skills.

Movement concepts are the cognitive component of movement. Preschool children gain
important knowledge about how the body can move in an almost endless variety of ways. For
example, they learn to move at different speeds and with different degrees of force, in various
pathways, around different types of obstacles, and in relation to other people. They are also
acquiring new vocabulary (e.g., zigzag, under, or behind) that describe their movement
experiences. Movement concepts enable children to problem-solve how the body should move
during certain activities and situations. Movement concepts provide critical foundations for
learning how to move in novel situations (e.g., when playing a new sport). To become proficient
movers, children need to acquire both the movement skills and the movement concepts
underlying those skills.

Children enter preschool with various experiences and abilities in perceptual-motor
coordination and understanding of movement concepts. Children's growth in perceptual-motor
skills and movement concepts leads to increased success and confidence when exploring,
performing personal care, and playing cooperatively with others. Perceptual-motor skills and
movement concepts are also key building blocks for future learning in areas such as reading,
writing, and mathematics.

Perceptual-motor skills and understanding movement concepts includes body awareness,
spatial awareness, and directional awareness.17

Body Awareness

Children's knowledge of their bodies becomes more accurate and specific. They develop a clear
understanding of how body parts interrelate (e.g., the shoulder connects to the arm, which
connects to the hand). Children are also learning to identify, describe, and differentiate an
increasing number of body parts. Furthermore, they can demonstrate different ways to move
specific body parts (e.g., the shoulder can move up and down, out to the side, or in a circular
motion). Body awareness is necessary for coordinating physical movements when new skills are
being learned, such as hopping or throwing. Accurate knowledge about body parts also
enhances children's ability to care for their own bodies, such as during toileting, bathing, and
dressing.

Teachers can support children's developing body awareness with the following:
     Use multisensory teaching strategies to reinforce children's learning.
     Use body-parts vocabulary in the child's home language.
     Use alternative communication methods, as appropriate, to teach body-parts
         vocabulary.
     Use body-parts vocabulary in the natural context of daily living activities and child-
         initiated play.
     Introduce body-parts vocabulary during structured group games.
     Engage children in singing and movement activities to teach body parts.
     Encourage children to identify and describe body parts in books or in pictures of
         themselves and family members.
     Provide opportunities for dress-up play.
     Provide opportunities for children to see external representations of their bodies.
     Provide constructional play for children to build or put together body parts.
     Ask children to describe their drawings of people.

Spatial Awareness

Children's understanding of their location and the location of objects and people around them.
Preschool children are learning to judge how much space their bodies and other objects take up
and whether something is "close" or "far." They are also developing vocabulary for describing

the position of two objects relative to one another, such as whether a ball is "in front of" or
"behind" them. Children gain awareness of their body dimensions and body position by
physically exploring their world and by maneuvering around different obstacles (both people
and objects) during play.

Directional Awareness

Children's understanding of what it means and how it feels to move up, down, forward,
backward and finally sideways. Most preschool children begin to understand that their bodies
have two sides but cannot yet identify the left or right side of their body. Children are also
learning to identify the top, bottom, front, or back of objects, but they do not clearly
understand that objects have a left or right side. Preschool children also enjoy following
pathways on the floor or creating their own movement pathways, such as straight, curved, or
zigzag.

                       Vignette
                       Several children in Mr. Clay's class are interested in trains, and during circle
                       time they read a book about trains. Later that day, a group of children go
                       through the obstacle course outdoors. Spencer asks, "I wonder if a train
                       could go through our tunnel." Ming responds, "Yeah, the train in the book
                       went through mountain tunnels." Mr. Clay suggests, "Well, maybe this
                       obstacle course is a railroad today?" The children all agree excitedly.

                       Children begin to go through the obstacle pretending to be trains and
                       saying "choo-choo" along the way. After awhile, Mr. Clay asks, "Do any of
                       you trains want to carry freight?" "I do!" volunteers Mei enthusiastically.
                       Mr. Clay retrieves a bucket of beanbags, which will be the trains' freight.
                       The teacher asks Mei, "Mei the Train, where will you carry your freight?"
                       Mei replies, "here" while pointing to her shoulder. "On your shoulder?
                       Great idea!" responds Mr. Clay. As children continue with the activity, Mr.
                       Clay assists them in coming up with other variations, such as having
                       everyone line up in a row and stay close together as one long train. When
                       Ming gets to the cardboard tunnel, the teacher lifts up the cardboard box
                       to provide clearance for Ming and his wheelchair to fit through the tunnel.
                       Later, the teacher asks, "I wonder if it would be fun for the trains to go in
                       reverse?" "What's reverse?" Spencer asks. Ming responds, "I know! Watch
                       this," and demonstrates wheeling his wheelchair backwards.22

                   Pause to Reflect
                   Think of other movement activities children enjoy. How could each be
                   modified to include children with differing disabilities and special needs?

Supporting Activity Physical Play

Active play is essential to the optimal physical development and overall health of young
children. Physical activity embedded throughout the preschool day promotes children's ability
to attend to, learn, and regulate their emotional responses. Active physical play not only
enhances the body's physiological functions (i.e., physical fitness), it promotes optimal brain
chemistry for self-regulation and enhances learning readiness. As such, it should be fully
integrated into the regular preschool day.

         unstructured active play.23                     structured active play.24

Active physical play contributes markedly to enhancing children's fundamental movement skills
in three principal areas: balance, locomotion, and both gross and fine motor manipulation. Both
typically developing children and those with special needs benefit. Furthermore, the
perceptual-motor components also discussed earlier are promoted through active physical
play. Activities that promote body awareness, spatial awareness, and directional awareness
engage the senses as children move through space. To derive the maximum health-related
benefits, children should engage in active play on most days of the week, in an environment
that promotes enjoyment, safety, and success. These benefits include increases in muscular
strength, muscular endurance, and joint flexibility as well as improved aerobic endurance and
body composition. Proper nutrition and adequate hydration also play important roles in young
children's active physical play.

Young children can be easily engaged in movement and benefit immensely from an active way
of life. The habits of physical activity that children learn in the early years greatly increase the
chance that children will continue being physically active throughout childhood and beyond.
Most importantly, children must see active play as fun. Your regular participation with children
will do much to model the joy of moving. You can take almost any indoor or outdoor physical
activity, give it a name, and make it a game. Children are active learners. For most, physical
activity is fun. Your enthusiastic participation with children will go a long way to motivate them
for continued active play.
Active Physical Play includes:

     Active Participation
     Cardiovascular Endurance
     Muscular Strength, Muscular Endurance, and Flexibility

Active Participation

Young children need to be involved in moderate to vigorous physical activity almost daily, at
home and at school. Moderate to vigorous activity that is enjoyable, develop-mentally

appropriate, and adapted to the needs of each child increases children's physical fitness levels.
When the large muscles of the body are fully engaged, young children learn more effectively
and also derive important health and physical fitness benefits. Active physical play contributes
measurably to all aspects of physical fitness. Physical fitness is defined as a set of physical
attributes related to a person's ability to perform activities that require cardiovascular
endurance, muscular strength, muscular endurance, and joint flexibility.

Figure 13.12: Parachute play is a favorite of many children and a great way to get them actively participated.25

Teachers can support active participation with the following:
     Provide ample opportunities for children to engage daily in active play. It is widely
         recommended that children accumulate at least 60 minutes and up to several hours of
         unstructured physical activity on each day of the week.
     Create inviting activity environments in which children can be physically active.
     Help children identify appropriate places for different types of physical activity.
     Create an activity environment that is nurturing and supportive and allows likely
         success.
     Encourage children to continue participation by providing opportunities for short but
         frequent rest periods during vigorous activity.
     Ensure that physical activity is sustained by providing personally mean-ingful and
         purposeful opportunities for children.
     Recognize and take into account any environmental constraints.
     Encourage physical exploration through play equipment and materials.
     Respect differences in children's temperament and find creative ways to engage all
         children in active physical play.

                       Research Highlight: Does Increasing Children's Physical Activity Really
                       Make a Difference?
                       A decisive "yes" was the answer to this important question which was cited
                       in a review of 850 research articles and published in the Journal of
                       Pediatrics. The evidence strongly supported that children of school age who
                       engage in relatively high levels of physical activity are less overweight than
                       inactive children, have better cardiovascular endurance, and higher levels
                       of muscular strength, endurance, and higher self-concepts. The authors
                       conclude that "Increasing the level of habitual moderate- to vigorous-
                       intensity physical activity in youth is a health promotion and disease-
                       prevention strategy. Sedentary youngsters should progress toward the
                       recommended level of physical activity gradually."26

Cardiovascular Endurance

This involves exposing the body to an increased workload that raises the heart rate beyond its
normal range of beats per minute and sustains that elevated rate for several minutes.

Teachers can support children's development of cardiovascular endurance with the following:
     Design the physical setting of the play environment to encourage moderate or vigorous
         physical activity.
     Engage children of all ability levels in activities that promote increased cardiovascular
         endurance.
     Promote increased cardiovascular endurance through chasing and fleeing activities.
     Promote cardiovascular endurance through the use of riding toys that require sustained
         pedaling or cranking.
     Use imagery as an effective tool in promoting moderate to vigorous physical activity.
     Provide positive encouragement for participation.
     Promote increased physical activity through story plays.
     Promote cardiovascular endurance through dance and rhythmic activities.

Muscular Strength, Muscular Endurance, and Flexibility

Active children naturally increase their muscular strength, muscular endurance, and joint
flexibility.

Muscular strength is the ability to perform one maximum effort, such as lifting a heavy weight
over-head, or picking up a heavy object off the ground.

                      Figure 13.14: Lifting these pumpkins onto the scale shows muscular strength.28

Muscular endurance is the ability to perform work repeatedly. (It is not recommended that
children prior to puberty engage in maximum strength efforts through high-resistance
activities. Instead, it is recommended that children engage in low-resistance activities with
multiple repetitions.)

Flexibility is the ability of a joint to move through its full, intended range of motion.

                       Knowing the importance of active physical play, Ms. Jennifer develops
                       strategies intended to maximize meaningful participation in a variety of
                       activities that promote active participation by all, cardiovascular endurance,
                       muscular strength, muscular endurance, and joint flexibility. These
                       strategies take into account children's personal preferences, likes and
                       dislikes, and sense of success and accomplishment.

                       Over several months of engaging in active play with children and
                       encouraging them to try new things, she notices a decided change in
                       behavior. The children are now more fully engaged in play activities that are
                       purposeful, meaningful, safe, and fun. 30

Engaging Families

Teachers need to develop some patterns for continuous communication with parents and
caregivers. Families are an important force in children's lives and in the physical activities
children engage in. Some people believe that fundamental movement skills are only used
outdoors. Although the outdoor environment offers a series of appealing possibilities, such as
open space and the chance to use all-out force, indoor spaces also offer an array of
opportunities for continued practice of the fundamental movement skills.

Here are some ideas for engaging families in supporting children's physical development.
     Create a newsletter to be given to families periodically. Photos of their children,
         pictures, and documents in the family's home language about what their children are
         learning about fundamental movement skills can be included. This may require
         translation; however, the connection with the families is worth the effort. Provide some
         stories and pictures of children in action
     Provide suggestions for activities that will support children's continuous fundamental
         motor skill development. Be specific about how. For instance, suggest families that
         when they go to the park, they can ask their child to show a balance position or a
         balance movement they learned at preschool, demonstrate a favorite way to move fast
         or slow, or show how he or she plays with balls.

     Ask families about the kind of balance, locomotor, and manipulative activities they did
         when they were young children. They can write them down or verbally communicate
         with the teachers and their children. This information can be incorporated into future
         activities and open a door of communication to discuss physical development in the past
         and in the present.

     Talk about the importance of physical development for both boys and girls and how
         gender issues may affect children. Girls already receive encouragement for manipulative
         skills, as do boys for locomotor skills. These reflections and conversations can bring
         opportunities to close this gap and explain to parents the importance of physical activity
         in today's society.

     Encourage families to ask their children about the movement skills the children are
         learning at their preschool.

     Figure 13.15: Hosting a play event for families is one way to get families involved in their children's physical
                                                             development.31

     Inform families about the importance of having their children wear comfortable clothes
         and shoes so they can move easily and freely during physical development activities.

     Ask children to show their families the movements they are learning at their preschool.
     Have a family "Show and Tell Day" where children show and tell families their favorite

         fundamental movement skills.
     Ask children to identify the movement skills of the athletes in sport games family

         members are watching and then demonstrate those skills. This is a way to engage family
         members' interest in their child's fundamental movement skills development.
     Suggest ways for children to help around the home and at the same time practice their
         fundamental movement skills. Examples include matching and rolling their socks and
         tossing them from a short distance into the laundry basket or drawer. Helping to unpack
         groceries and placing them on shelves provides children with an activity to develop
         manipulative skills and strengthen their hands. Families can create a safe obstacle

         course in their homes where children can move under and over furniture by using
         locomotor skills.
     Encourage families to provide time for children to perform independent daily living
         activities, such as brushing teeth or getting dressed. Children need time to manipulate
         objects such as toothpaste caps, zippers on their clothing, and lids of food containers.
     Encourage families to take their children outside to safe, open spaces and play areas
         where they can use fundamental movement skills.
     Encourage children to use words or signs to identify or describe their body parts when
         they are completing personal-care activities such as getting dressed or bathing.
     Provide opportunities for children to interact with adults and help around the home
         with activities such as putting away their toys, putting away groceries, sorting laundry,
         or bringing dirty dishes to the kitchen.
     When out in the community, such as at the park or grocery store, communicate with
         children about objects in the environment. Encourage them to describe where trees,
         buildings, cars, and other objects are located in relation to one another.
     When looking at books or pictures together, talk about how the characters are
         positioned and how they are moving their bodies.
     When children are playing, ask them to describe what they are doing with their bodies.
     Create an "Activity Recall Chart" to be used in the classroom first, then at home. Have
         children recall and categorize their activity into Sedentary, Moderate, and Vigorous.
     Have a "Family Dance Party."
     Model healthy behavior.
     Take an adventure walk to school.
     Develop a list of "can do" family rules for active physical play.
     Take part in family rough-and-tumble play that respects the rights and wishes of all.
     Proper clothing for indoor and out-door family activities is a must.
     Make a FITT activity chart. Frequency (how often per week), Intensity (how hard one
         plays), Type (of activity), and Time (length of activity). Have all family members decide
         what they want to do. Mark off what they do throughout the week and review at the
         end of the week.32

                   Pause to Reflect
                   What ways to encourage the practice of fundamental movement skills at
                   home would you most want to share with parents? How might you share
                   these ideas with them?

Conclusion

Until recently, the physical development of young children was often taken for granted. Family
members and caregivers had a tendency to assume that children, by virtue of being children,

got plenty of physical activity as a normal part of their daily routine. The results of over a
decade of research comparing the present, more sedentary generation of children to previous
generations clearly reveals an alarming trend toward increased obesity, diabetes, asthma, and
other health-impairing conditions.
Fortunately, a resurgence of interest in the vital importance of young children's physical
development is taking place throughout California and the nation.
Those working with young children have recognized that developing fundamental movement
skills; learning perceptual-motor skills and movement concepts, and engaging in active physical
play are essential to the total balanced development of children. The development of
fundamental movement skills provides a basis for an active way of life. Attaining proficiency in a
myriad of fundamental balance, locomotor, and manipulative skills equips children for active
participation in physical activities for a lifetime.
Perceptual-motor skills and basic movement concepts are important to the many time and
space concepts that children acquire as they get ready for more formal types of instruction and
learning. Body-awareness, spatial-awareness, and directional-awareness concepts can be
taught and learned through both teacher-directed and self-directed play.

              Figure 13.16: What types of physical development does playing at the water table support?33

However, children need encouragement, instruction, and sufficient opportunities for practice in
supportive environments to learn fundamental movement skills, perceptual-motor skills, and
movement concepts. Preschool programs and families play a critical role in maximizing
children's development in these areas.

Active physical play in preschool is a means by which children (and adults) can engage in
physical activities that promote healthy lifestyles and a genuine zest for life. Through active
participation in self-directed and adult-facilitated play, children acquire increased
cardiovascular endurance, muscular endurance, muscular strength, and flexibility. Young
children have not only movement skills and perceptual abilities; they also have the joy of
movement.
Learning to move and moving to learn are too important to be left to chance. Parents and
teachers have a precious opportunity to help set the stage for young children to enjoy physical
activity for a lifetime.34

Introduction

One way to foster healthy lifestyles is to encourage the development of health-promoting
habits during early childhood. Preschool education about health can begin a lifelong process of
learning about oneself, relationships to others, and the world. Preschool children's experiences
with their health and ways to improve it, both at home and in the early childhood setting,
enhance their desire and ability to make healthy decisions throughout their lives.

                           Figure 14.1: Positive experiences relating to dental health are valuable.1

The preschool health foundations describe the health knowledge, attitudes, habits, and
behaviors that set the groundwork for all preschool children to develop into healthy adults.
They explain what children should know about health, and what health habits and practices
should be part of their daily routines when they are provided with high-quality health education
in preschool. These skills and behaviors set young children on the path toward health and
healthy lifestyle choices. 2

Guiding Principles in Supporting Children's Health, Safety,
and Nutrition

An integrated and comprehensive approach is most effective when preschool children are
taught about health. Health education does not stand alone in the preschool curriculum. It is
integrated with the other domains. Health is comprehensive. Health education involves ideas
directly relevant to the child, such as "How do I grow?" Preschool teachers work with children
who are naturally curious and eager to learn about their bodies and how each part works. A
developmentally appropriate curriculum promotes overall health (e.g., wellness, safety, oral
health, nutrition) and integrates topic areas. For example, a discussion about safety rules might
include nutrition and sanitation.

                 Figure 14.2: Children can explore their understanding of health through dramatic play.3

Teachers address ideas and concepts that children can grasp at their developmental level and
then progressively build on what children already know and understand. This approach applies
to all children, including children with various abilities, disabilities, or other special needs (such
as delays in language, cognition, or physical ability).

     Health knowledge is individualized.
     Preschool children and their families possess diverse backgrounds and cultural practices.
     Learning about health practices has a language component.
     Children's personal health status (i.e., physical, mental, emotional) affects their ability to

         learn and develop in all domains.
     The overall theme of health education for preschool is personal health.
     Children learn through their experiences, including play, routines and scripts, modeling,

         and developing and sustaining relationships at preschool. This learning is supported
         through adult scaffolding.

     Practicing scripts, or behavioral rules, can foster the development of certain health-
         promoting behaviors or skills.

     The preschool program provides both indoor and outdoor environments that are safe
         and appropriate, challenging, and inviting for all children.

     Teachers help children feel secure by assuring them that there are adults who will take
         care of them (e.g., parents, family members, teachers, health care providers, special
         needs assistants).4

Environmental Factors in Supporting Children's Health,
Safety, & Nutrition

Children learn most effectively in a safe, inviting environment in which they can freely explore
and challenge themselves. Health and safety in the preschool program, both indoors and
outdoors, includes environment, supervision, and education. Environment is the first
component of safety; a safe environment allows children to explore, play, and learn without
unnecessary restriction. The environment should be set up and maintained to reduce the risk of
injury and disease transmission.

Proper supervision of children is essential, and the required adult-to-child ratios must be met at
all times, including periods when children play outdoors, are transported, and go on field trips.
The most effective supervision includes active involvement with children's learning: teachers
move around the room with children, attend to children and their interactions, make eye
contact, encourage children verbally, and model appropriate voice and actions.

Education is multifaceted. Teachers promote children's learning through discussion, modeling,
and daily routines through active participation. An accessible and supportive environment with
appropriate facilities and items allows children to practice and demonstrate progress in
learning.

The following recommendations apply to establishing the preschool environment that supports
children's health, safety, and nutrition.

     Establish a physical learning environment designed for children's initiative.
     Provide safe, inviting learning environments, and appropriate supervision of children.
     Maintain a clean, healthy, and sanitary environment. Incorporate cleaning and sanitizing

         into the daily routine.
     Have supplies available and accessible to promote routine health practices.
     Provide stimulating and developmentally appropriate materials in interest areas for

         children's use during play.
     Provide furnishing and utensils appropriate for children's size and abilities.

                       Research Highlight
                       Cleaning and disinfecting is essential. Studies have shown that some germs,
                       including influenza virus, can survive on surfaces for two to eight hours;
                       rotavirus can survive up to 10 days. Cleaning with soap and water removes
                       visible soil. After cleaning, disinfection (sanitizing) kills bacteria, viruses, and
                       fungi (i.e., "germs"). The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)
                       states that a bleach and water solution of one tablespoon household bleach
                       to one quart water is effective. Wet the surface with the solution and allow
                       to air dry. Mix fresh bleach solution each day to maintain effectiveness, and
                       store in a clearly labeled spray bottle out of children's reach. Research
                       shows that other chemicals (e.g., ammonia, vinegar, baking soda, Borax)
                       are not effective against some bacteria.7

Introducing the Foundations

The preschool learning foundations for safety, health, and nutrition are organized into three
broad categories, or strands:

     Health Habits
     Safety
     Nutrition

These describe the health knowledge, skills, and behaviors that preschool children typically
develop in a quality preschool environment. Through supportive communication and
participation in everyday routines and activities, children begin to develop behaviors such as
making food choices, engaging in physical activity, and maintaining personal safety and oral
health. These skills and behaviors set young children on the path toward health and healthy
lifestyle choices. The specific foundations are included later in the chapter as each strand is
explored.

They represent a vision of young children's developmental process, not an expectation. Each
child enters preschool with a genetic background, developmental characteristics, an individual
level of knowledge and skills, and understanding of everyday routines. The differences are
based not only on the child's age, but also on the child's developmental level, prior experiences,
and special needs. It is the responsibility of adults to help each child to develop the knowledge,
skills, and behavior that promote healthy development.8

Supporting Health Habits

Teachers can help children establish positive health habits. This learning is progressive, and
preschool teaching often focuses on scripts and routines for prevention of disease and injury.
Later, as children grow and develop knowledge and skills, they begin to believe and understand
that they are responsible for their own health.

Health Habits includes basic hygiene, oral health, knowledge of wellness, and sun safety.

     adult support and guidance.

Teacher-guided activities on health habits may be used to introduce or focus attention on a
specific topic or concept. However, learning is primarily achieved through children's daily
routines (e.g., washing hands at certain times, brushing teeth after meals) and verbal or
nonverbal scripts that illustrate the desired lifelong behavior (e.g., using tissue when blowing
the nose, coughing into elbows). Children demonstrate knowledge of body parts, disease
prevention, and wellness as they practice routines and develop descriptive scripts (e.g., "We
wash our hands, fingers, and wrists"; "I'm going to brush my teeth and tongue"); they begin to
understand more difficult concepts through scaffolding.
Teachers can support children's development of the Health Habits foundations with the
following:

     Teach children how to wash their hands.
     Practice toothbrushing skills.
     Model basic hygiene and disease prevention actions throughout the day (including issue

         tissue to blow nose, sneezing and coughing into their elbows, using napkins, brushing
         teeth, using utensils to serve foods, etc.).
     Remind children about health practices throughout the day. Include strategically placed
         visual reminders throughout the environment.
     Incorporate handwashing, toothbrushing, sun safety, and other health practices in the
         daily routine.
     Use visuals aids to demonstrate invisible germs.
     Reinforce learning with stories and music.
     Observe individual children attentively. Learn what experiences, knowledge, skills, and
         abilities each child has to determine where they are at in the learning process.

336 | I n t r o d u c t i o n t o C u r r i c u l u m f o r E a r l y C h i l d h o o d E d u c a t i o n
     Build communication and vocabulary skills. Use children's home languages. Tell them
         stories and have them draw stories about health routines (such as visiting the dentist).
         Introduce words that apply to different topics of safety (such as protect).

     Encourage pretend play, especially to work through their fears. Provide special interest
         areas (doctor's office, dentist office, eye doctor's office, etc.) with props for role playing.

     Provide hats and look at how each might protect children from the sun. Encourage
         children to dramatize protecting baby dolls from the sun.

     Encourage children to explore and accept differences. Children recognize physical
         differences and the different health practices, meal setups and food choices, and safety

                       The children are playing indoors when Miss Marie reminds them that it is
                       time to prepare for lunch. She begins to sing a handwashing song as
                       children leave their interest areas. Some of the children begin singing as
                       they wash their hands. The song follows the familiar "Row, Row, Row Your
                       Boat" tune, and the children enjoy singing it in both English and Spanish.

                       English:
                       Wash, wash, wash my hands
                       Make them nice and clean
                       Rub the bottoms and the tops

                       Lavalas muy limpias
                       Lavalas de arriba y abajo y
                       Entre mis dedos de las manos

                       The children have learned that if they sing the song two times while
                       washing their hands, then their hands should be clean! Miss Marie sings
                       along with the children as she observes the handwashing process. She helps
                       Tonya, who has a hearing impairment, by clapping along with the song;
                       Tonya can look in the mirror above the sink to see when the song (clapping)
                       ends. The younger children sometimes need help in dispensing the soap
                       and turning the water on and off; the older children enjoy helping the
                       younger ones and like to model their handwashing skills.

                       Mr. Jeff is putting sunscreen on four preschoolers. "Mr. Jeff, why do we
                       have to put this sticky stuff on every day?" asks Mary. As he removes his
                       gloves and puts away the sunscreen bottle, he explains, "The sun is good
                       for us. It gives us light and warmth. But too much sun is not good for your
                       skin. We put on the sunscreen to protect our skin from too much sun."
                       Javier says, "I don't burn. I don't need this." Mr. Jeff replies, "Everyone
                       needs to be sun-safe." Mr. Jeff encourages the children to run, jump, and
                       try new activities as they play outdoors.12

Supporting Safety

Preschool children deserve to live and play in safe environments. It is the adult's responsibility
to keep children safe; children should not be expected to actively protect themselves. Preschool
safety education helps children develop safety awareness and the realization that they can
control some aspects of their safety through certain actions.
The earlier children learn about safety, the more naturally they will develop the attitudes and
respect that lead to lifelong patterns of safe behavior. Safety education involves teaching safe
actions while helping children understand possible consequences of unsafe behavior.

     Figure 14.6: Children can be taught safety rules that give them an active role in keeping themselves safe.13

This section on safety addresses children's ability to follow safety rules, emergency routines,
and transportation and pedestrian safety rules.

Teachers can support children's development of the Safety foundations with the following:
     Incorporate safety activities into the daily routine.
     Involve children in creating rules. Limit the number of rules and keep them simple.
     Provide coaching and gentle reminders to help children follow safety rules. Use visuals
         with pictures and simple words in English and home languages.
     Promote independence while developing other skills.
     Provide time for children to practice individual skills (rather than just telling them about
         them).
     Introduce concepts and behaviors in simple steps. Build upon previous learning.
     Role-play safety helpers. Recognize that levels of trust with emergency and safety
         workers will vary from child to child based on their experiences and the environment
         they live in.
     Take field trips and bring in safety helpers (police officers, firefighters, crossing guards,
         paramedics, and others).
     Define emergency and have children practice problem solving with different emergency
         situations.
     Introduce safety signs. Help children learn to recognize important symbols (and their
         corresponding printed words).
     Incorporate music with safety songs. Children can learn to state their name and address
         with the help of a simple song.14

                       Vignette
                       Ms. Linda is preparing her preschoolers for the first fire drill of the year. She
                       has read several books about fire safety to the children. The class enjoyed a
                       visit from Deloria's mother, who is a firefighter. The children are excited
                       about their first fire drill, but they are not sure what to expect. Ms. Linda
                       plays a tape of the school fire alarm and explains that the real warning
                       alarm will be very loud. The fire alarm means everyone must leave the
                       building.

                       "Now we are going to practice listening and preparing to leave the
                       classroom," says Ms. Linda. "It will be like playing Follow the Leader, and I
                       will be the leader." The children are eager to try this new experience, and it
                       is difficult for them to listen quietly. Several of the children are learning
                       English so Ms. Linda uses words in the other languages of the children, as
                       well as English, to focus their attention and explain the steps. Prior to this
                       practice, Ms. Linda presented a list of key words and phrases to parents
                       who speak languages other than English and obtained the relevant
                       translations. She combines words and hand signals to direct the children.
                       Ms. Linda explains that she will assist Juan, who is in a wheelchair, during
                       the fire drill.

                       Ms. Linda demonstrates what to do when the alarm sounds (e.g., stand up,
                       stay quiet) before the children practice. They practice this routine each day
                       that week so they will be ready for the actual drill on Friday.16

                       Research Highlight
                       Unintentional injury is the leading cause of death of children ages fourteen
                       and under. Motor vehicle injuries are the leading cause of death among
                       children in the United States; each year more than 200,000 children are
                       treated in emergency departments for play-ground-related injuries;
                       children ages four years and younger are susceptible to residential fire
                       deaths and injuries; and children under age six years are more likely to
                       experience unintentional poisoning. The good news is that the number of
                       deaths caused by unintentional injuries to children has dropped in recent
                       years; from 1987 to 2004, there was a 43 percent decrease.

                       Death rates among California children ages one to four years declined
                       slightly from 2000 to 2005; however, the death rates for young children
                       remained significantly higher than the target established in Healthy People
                       2010.

                       Child injury prevention efforts continue throughout the United States. For
                       example, all 50 states and the District of Columbia have child restraint laws;
                       and 21 states, the District of Columbia, and over 140 localities have enacted
                       some form of mandatory child bicycle helmet legislation. In addition, all
                       national and regional code-making bodies have amended their plumbing-
                       code language to require anti-scald technology and a maximum water
                       heater temperature of 120 degrees Fahrenheit in all newly constructed
                       residential units.

                       The state of California has been a leader in advocating child safety. It has
                       enacted laws requiring the use of bike helmets, personal flotation devices,
                       and child safety seats; prohibiting adults from leaving children alone in
                       motor vehicles; and imposing criminal liability on adults who allow children
                       to have access to loaded firearms.17

                   Pause to Reflect
                   Some children find learning about safety to be frightening. What should you
                   keep in mind to help children deal with their fears surrounding staying safe?

Supporting Nutrition

Lifelong eating habits are shaped during a child's early years. Teachers of young children have a
special opportunity to help children establish a healthy relationship with food and lay the
foundation for sound eating habits. Nutrition education and activities help set children on the
path to a healthful lifestyle. Providing nutritionally balanced meals and snacks and integrating
nutrition education and healthy eating habits in the home and early childhood environment can
help prevent health risks such as childhood obesity.
Nutrition education is integrated with the other domains of learning. Through food and cooking
activities, children also develop skills in math, science, art, language and literacy, social science,
health and self-care, and social skills. Nutrition education for preschoolers fosters children's
awareness of different types of foods and promotes exploration and inquiry of food choices.
Lifelong habits with foods are developed during early childhood. Through nutrition education in
preschool, teachers encourage children to include a wide variety of foods that provide
adequate nutrients in their daily diet.

             Figure 14.8: Providing nutrient dense foods, such as fruit and milk, for children is important.18

Nutrition includes: nutrition knowledge, nutrition choices, and self-regulation of eating.
Through knowledge, children become aware of different foods and tastes, some of which are
familiar and others that are new. As they explore various foods and food preparations, they
develop likes and dislikes and begin to make choices based on preference. Both nutrition
choices and self-regulation of eating--that is, eating when hungry, chewing food thoroughly,
eating slowly, and stopping when full-- involve decision-making skills.

Teachers can support children's development of the Nutrition foundations with the following:
     Introduce many different foods. This can be done through books, meals and snacks, and
         cooking activities. Include familiar and novel foods and foods from the various cultural
         backgrounds of the children and their families.
     Recognize and accommodate differences in eating habits and food choices. Provide
         explanations for differences (e.g., eating from communal dishes, feeding tubes, avoiding
         certain foods, etc.) by having a family member or specialist come in to explain.
     Provide opportunities and encouragement in food exploration. Encourage children to
         explore with all five senses.
     Integrate nutrition with the other areas of learning through cooking activities.
     Show children where food is produced. Expand nutrition education through field trips to
         gardens, farms, orchards, local produce markets, kitchens, restaurants, grocery stores,

         etc. and bring in visiting experts (e.g., farmers, food co-op members, community
         gardeners).
     Start a garden in which the children actively work. Allow them to plant, water, and care
         for the garden.
     Help children experience gardening as they raise herbs, fruits, or vegetables.
     Establish special interest areas for children to engage in dramatic play (e.g., grocery
         stores, restaurants, picnics, etc.).
     Encourage role playing by providing props including: place mats, tablecloths, table-
         setting items, pretend food items, cooking utensils, menus, and other items that
         represent the children's families.
     Integrate nutrition education with basic hygiene education (e.g., washing hands before
         and after preparing food) and other learning areas (e.g., singing songs and discussions).
     Model and coach children's behaviors. Each what the children are being served.
     Encourage children to share information about family meals. Explore cultural diversity
         and how children's families eat at home.

                        Figure 14.9: Healthy food, served family style sets the stage for great nutrition.19

     Serve snacks and meals family style. Adults and children eat together, share the same
         food, and talk with each other informally.

     Encourage tasting all foods, but don't compel them to taste or eat certain foods.
     Serve foods prepared in many ways (e.g., raw, grilled, steamed, cut in shapes,

         shredded,).
     Combine new foods with familiar ones.
     Be aware of individual food restrictions and help children make appropriate choices.
     Offer a variety of nutritious, appetizing foods in small portions.
     Encourage children to chew their food well and eat slowly.

                       showing the photos and taking questions from children, she shares with
                       children a large durian and a few star fruits, fruits that people in Taiwan like
                       to eat. Ms. Tsikudo helps to carry the durian on a plate and moves around
                       the class to ask children to touch it. "How does the skin feel?" "Bumpy!"
                       Children reply with excitement. Meanwhile, Zhiying has sliced the star fruits
                       and starts to pass them around. "What do the pieces look like?" she asks.
                       "Stars!" reply the children. Ms. Tsikudo picks up one slice of star fruit, puts
                       it into her mouth, and says "I have never had star fruit before. Yum! I like
                       the taste of this fruit. Who wants to try?" Some children raise their hands
                       to try the fruit.

                       "I don't like that." Every day at lunch for the past three weeks, Amy said the
                       same thing. She would eat the meat and fruit but would not taste any
                       vegetables or bread. Mr. Rios asked Mrs. Gardner, Amy's grandmother,
                       "What does Amy like to eat at home?" Mrs. Gardner replied, "She has
                       never eaten very much at one time, and now all she wants is mashed
                       potatoes. She looks healthy, but I'm worried about her."

                       Mr. Rios continued to observe Amy's eating habits and encouraged her to
                       try other foods. As the children served their plates, he asked them about
                       the different colors and smells. Using small serving utensils, he encouraged
                       each child to take a small amount. If a child said he did not want it, Mr. Rios
                       assured him that he did not have to eat it but gently encouraged him to put
                       a tiny bit on his plate.

                       As Mr. Rios planned learning activities for the following weeks, he included
                       a cooking activity along with snack time two days each week. He involved
                       children's families by asking them to send ideas or simple recipes for
                       favorite snack foods. Through these activities, the children were introduced
                       to different foods, some new and some familiar, and various methods of
                       food preparation (e.g., cooked versus raw, single food versus combined
                       foods).21

                       Research Highlight
                       Fear of new foods is common in children. It may take many tries before a
                       child will taste a new food and up to 20 exposures before a child decides he
                       likes or truly dislikes a food. Food jags (when a child will eat only one food
                       item meal after meal) are also common. Food jags rarely last long enough
                       to cause harm. Children's eating habits are a way for them to feel
                       independent. They reflect typical development in children.

                       Some children have disabilities or other issues that affect their decisions
                       about foods. Children with autism often have very limited food
                       preferences; some children may have sensory issues and avoid specific
                       textures or food items. Other children may not like it when different types
                       of foods touch each other on the plate or may wish to eat foods in a
                       particular order. Be aware of differences in children's preferences and
                       eating habits, and consult with the child's family and specialist to ensure
                       that needs are met.22

Engaging Families

Teachers can use the following strategies to help families to develop their children's health
habits:

     Provide families with concise, accurate information about ways to promote and develop
         good health habits in children. Information should be presented in English and home
         languages.

     Share written and visual safety messages with families through newsletters, brochures,
         and bulletin boards, web pages, and take home activities in English and home
         languages. Emphasize safety issues that relate to your program and community.

     Provide individualized information as well as general health information to all families.
         Provide safety information, especially those that involve higher risk in specific
         communities (e.g., water safety, gun safety, or lead poisoning). Use daily contact,
         workshops, and parent meetings to share information. Make sure workshops and
         meetings are offered at a variety of times and provide child care.

     During family conferences, find out what messages family members would like
         reinforced at school. Safety rules and supervision may differ at home.

     Post emergency plans on family bulletin boards and provide families a written copy of
         the program's emergency plans.

     Encourage families to plan and practice emergency drills for fires, earthquakes, floods,
         violent encounters, or other emergency situations that might occur in their homes and
         communities.

     As you introduce health routines (e.g., handwashing and toothbrushing), invite family
         members to participate and model.

     Encourage families to contribute ideas or materials to interest areas that reflect diverse
         health habits at home.

     Invite family members to help children learn about people who can help in emergency
         situations (firefighters, paramedics, construction workers, electricians, meteorologists,
         cleaning businesses, etc.)

     Be sensitive and respectful of different values or beliefs, as well as varying levels of
         access to health products and services.

     Gather information on available and accessible health, safety, and nutrition resources in
         the community, including those for children with special needs, and provide this
         information to all families, translated into their home languages.

     Provide families with weekly or monthly menus in their home languages.
     Recognize families have the most information about their children's food preference,

         serving styles, and restrictions in eating habits.
     Offer workshops and information on nutritious and economical meals based on the

         families' cultural, ethnic, and personal food preferences.
     Encourage families to use available community resources for meal planning.
     Provide lists of foods or simple recipes for a variety of foods that are nutrient-dense, low

         fat, sodium, and sugar, and look and taste great. Include foods that reflect cultural
         preferences and are available locally.
     Encourage families to involve children in food preparation.
     Invite families to share their favorite family recipes.
     Invite families to visit the classroom and to sit with children during mealtimes and
         participate in nutrition related activities.

     Include families in planning the menu and meal-service routines.
     Provide information to all families on nutrition, child growth and development, nutrition

         risk factors, and community resources.
     Encourage families to ask questions and provide information about their children's

         eating habits or nutritional concerns.23

      Figure 14.10: Information can be shared with parents formally, like in this workshop, or more informally.24

                   Pause to Reflect
                   Hygiene and nutrition are very much influenced by culture. What do educators
                   need to remember when working with families whose culture relating to these
                   things might be very different than their own?

Conclusion

The early years of children's lives are crucial to the development of behaviors that contribute to
good health, and early childhood teachers can significantly enhance opportunities for young
children to learn about health by providing appropriate experiences. Many adult chronic
diseases and conditions, such as obesity, diabetes, and heart disease, are related to lifestyle
choices about nutrition and fitness and often begin in childhood.

A respectful and integrated approach that meshes home and preschool environments and
involves responsible adults can help children initiate a lifelong process of learning about
themselves, their relationships to others, and the world around them. Health education is an
essential part of the curriculum for young children. The topic of health is incorporated into daily
routines and the environment; it is also the focus of planned learning activities. Early child-hood
educators have the challenge of modeling a healthy lifestyle for the children they teach--one
that will benefit both themselves and the children.26

Brief Introduction to Planning for School-Age Children

Children in kindergarten through grade 8, may be cared for in out-of-school programs that have
a variety of philosophies and approaches. School-age care may provide academic support (or
even focus) and should include recreation (after the school day). Chapter 16 discusses a general
framework of creating high-quality curriculum for school-age care programs based on a model
from Australia. The chapter addresses:

Why Look at Infant and Toddler Curriculum?

A majority of this book is focused mostly on children aged 3 to 5 years. But, it is important to
note how curriculum for the youngest children is a bit different. While the content in this
chapter could, and often is, the focus on an entire class, this chapter will highlight some
important considerations when planning and implementing curriculum with infants and
toddlers.

What Infants and Toddlers are Like

During the infant/toddler years, all children depend on responsive, secure relationships to
develop and learn. Let's explore what infants and toddlers are like in terms of their progression
through developmental milestones, so that we can connect it to what they need from adults.
Here are some representations of what children are like as infants and toddlers. You can find
other ages and more developmental milestones in Appendix C.3

Introduction

A fundamental consideration in planning curriculum for individual children is being responsive
to the competencies, experiences, interests, and needs of each child. California's infant/toddler
population includes children who are culturally diverse, linguistically diverse, diverse in ability,

and from diverse socioeconomic backgrounds. Partnering with families is an important strategy
for being responsive to individual children and for making curriculum individually and culturally
relevant.5

      Figure 15.2: This little girl is showing a toy to her caregivers while her dad sits close by. When families and
                    caregivers form partnerships, amazing things can happen for infants and toddlers.6

Overarching Principles of Planning Curriculum for Infants
and Toddlers

When planning curriculum for infants and toddlers we should keep the following principles in
mind:

     The family is at the core of a young child's learning and development. Family
         relationships have more influence on a child's learning and development than any other
         relationships he has. Family members know him better than anyone else.

     Infant/toddler learning and development is grounded in relationships. Relationships
         provide infants and toddlers a secure emotional base from which they can explore and
         learn. Much of the cognitive, language, social, and physical learning a child experiences
         occurs while interacting with an adult. In fact, relationships with others are at the center
         of young children's lives.

     Emotions drive early learning and development. A child's emotional state drives early
         learning and greatly influences learning in other domains. The pleasure an infant
         experiences when receiving a positive response from a nurturing adult or when making
         a discovery motivates the child to continue engaging in positive interactions and
         exploration. For infants and toddlers, learning always has an emotional component.
         They are highly sensitive to the emotional cues of other people and are emotionally
         expressive in every situation

     Responsiveness to children's self-initiated exploration fosters learning. Research shows
         that responsive care and nurturance not only promotes the development of emotional
         security in children, but learning and development in general.

     Individualized teaching and care benefits all children. Each child is unique.
         Infant/toddler care teachers use their understanding of each child's blend of
         temperament, family and cultural experiences, language experiences, personal
         strengths, interests, abilities, and dispositions to support the child's learning and
         development. Through recognizing and adapting to each child's individual development,
         teachers are able to offer learning experiences that are responsive, meaningful, and
         developmentally attuned to each child. Providing interactions, experiences, and an
         environment that meet the individual needs of children with disabilities or other special
         needs can enrich the experiences of all children in the program. A classroom
         environment in which all children are supported and feel welcome creates rich learning
         experiences for everyone.

   Figure 15.3: The way this infant is being worn by his mother gives us a glimpse into the culture of his family. It
    would be important for his caregivers to learn more about the routines of this child to provide him culturally

                                                            responsive care.7

     Responsiveness to culture and language supports children's learning. Responsive
         infant/toddler programs create a climate of respect for each child's culture and
         language. Teachers and other program staff members partner and regularly
         communicate with family members to get to know the cultural strengths each child
         brings to the program. An essential part of being culturally and linguistically responsive
         is to value and support each child's use of home language, as "continued use and
         development of the child's home language will benefit the child as he or she acquires
         English." Equally important are nurturing interactions with children and their families in
         which "teachers attempt, as much as possible, to learn about the history, beliefs, and
         practices of the children and families they serve." In addition to being responsive to the
         cultural history, beliefs, values, ways of communicating, and practices of children and

         families, teachers create learning environments that include resources such as pictures,
         displays, and books that are culturally rich and supportive of diversity, particularly the
         cultures and languages of the children and families in their infant/toddler care setting.
     Intentional teaching and care enriches children's learning experiences. Effective
         curriculum planning occurs when teachers are mindful of children's learning and are
         intentional in their efforts to support it.
     Time for reflection and planning enhances teaching and care. In nurturing the
         development of infants and toddlers, teachers engage in an ongoing process of
         observation, documentation and assessment, reflection and planning, and
         implementation of strategies in order to provide individualized and small-group learning
         experiences. Curriculum planning requires time for teachers to reflect on children's
         learning and plan strategies that foster children's progress in building knowledge and
         mastering skills. Infant/toddler programs that support intentional teaching and care
         allocate time in teachers' schedules for both individual and team reflection and
         planning.8

   Figure 15.4: Intentional teaching and caregiving thrives when teachers have a chance to share and collaborate
                              around their observations, inquiries, celebrations, and challenges.9

                   Pause to Reflect
                   Which of the overarching principles did you connect with the most? Why? Are
                   there any that might be more challenging for you to embrace?

Program Features That Support Effective Infant/ Toddler
Curriculum

Program policies set the stage for infant/toddler learning and development. Program policies
that support effective infant/toddler curriculum planning and implementation include these
elements:

     Primary Care--assigning a primary infant care teacher to each child and family
     Small Groups--creating small groups of children and caregivers
     Continuity--maintaining consistent teacher assignments and groups over time
     Personalized Care--responding to individual needs, abilities, and schedules
     Cultural Continuity--maintaining cultural consistency between home and program

         through dialogue and collaboration with families
     Inclusion of Children with Special Needs--providing appropriate accommodations and

         support for children with disabilities or other special needs.10

 Figure 15.5: How would you describe this interaction? Notice the smiles on the faces of the caregiver and parent.11

The Infant/Toddler Learning Process: The Starting Point

Research has shown that infants are ready to learn from birth; they are able to absorb
information from the sights, sounds, and scents around them, to store it, to sort it out, and to
use it. This information helps infants understand the world and the people around them.

Research has also shown that infants and toddlers are quite dependent on primary
relationships for their physical and emotional needs to be met. Aware of this need, teachers
plan their interactions with infants and toddlers to address both the vulnerability and the
competence of children. In doing so, teachers simultaneously attend to the children's need for
close, consistent relationships with nurturing adults and to the children's curiosity and
motivation to learn.12

    Figure 15.6: One way to balance the need for close relationships and curiosity is to stay nearby during play. A
    caregiver can provide a secure base that allows the children to explore and emotionally check in as needed.13

Infant and Toddler Development and Its Facilitation

Because everything is new to infants and toddlers, and their brains are developing rapidly,
infancy is a unique period of life that calls for unique responses from adults. The ways infants
and toddlers think, feel, and function differ somewhat from the ways children in the
developmental periods of preschool, middle childhood, and adolescence think, feel, and
function.
Four major aspects of infant/toddler development illuminate the kinds of "basic sensory, social,
and emotional experiences" that are "essential for optimizing the architecture of low-level
circuits" in the brain. The following four aspects of infant/toddler development call for a special
approach to planning and supporting their learning:

    1. Infants follow their own learning agenda as is focused on fundamental competencies
         that are developed at relatively similar times in their development, including:
          seek and form relationships with people who will nurture and protect them
          learn language for the first time in order to communicate

          construct knowledge of basic concepts such as the relationship between cause and
             effect and how things move and fit in space

          master rudimentary small-muscle and large-muscle skills

So, adults must be there to support this with responsive relationships by interacting with
infants and toddlers in ways that best facilitate the children's learning and development.

    2. Infants learn holistically. This means they take in information continuously, naturally,
         and fluidly. Although they often focus on one thing at a time, that focus can change
         quickly. From their actions, interactions, and observations, they pick up all kinds of
         information that they use to build knowledge and skills. A single interaction can lead to
         learning about many things in many areas simultaneously.

Because infants and toddlers learn in a holistic way, they may not always focus on the content
area that an adult may wish to emphasize.

So, if adults structure interaction with the purpose of creating specific outcomes in a particular
content area--for example, language or shapes--they will often miss the child's larger learning
experience. Thus, plans to help with infant learning are best created in ways that reflect the
child's openness to all aspects of an experience.

For Example:

                  A teacher may think that crafting a special lesson on colors will result in specific
                  learning about color, but infants do not separate their lessons according to
                  distinct topics. For the infant or toddler, narrowing the focus to the adult's
                  interest or goal does not match how the child engages in learning. The child's
                  focus may switch to the part of the interaction that is personally more important,
                  such as the texture of the materials used to display color, the movement of the
                  wrist to transfer the color from brush to paper, the emotional tone used in the
                  interaction, or the social style the adult uses to introduce the activity. From the
                  perspective of the infant or toddler, the lesson (or lessons) learned may end up
                  having nothing to do with colors. Thus, adults can better facilitate learning by
                  attending to the many learning possibilities that exist for an infant or toddler in a
                  particular experience14

   the bottles of colored liquid waiting to be explored. If the only focus of this activity was color, what experiences

                                                      might have been missed?15

    3. During the first three years of life, much of a child's life is organized around issues
         related to security, exploration, and identity. While children attend to all three issues
         throughout infancy, each of these issues generally takes center stage at different points
         in development. As an issue becomes more or less prominent, developmental
         transitions occur. The child's behavior starts to change and reflects a new way of
         organizing experiences.

    4. Infants are in the process of developing their first sense of self and this begins by how
         others treat them. They receive important information from others.
         So, adults must be really intentional in how they treat infants and toddlers.

For Example

                  They may resist eating food they do not like and judge someone who tries to
                  make them eat such food as mean or unfair. Even when infants resist eating
                  certain foods, they do not consciously judge the person trying to feed them.
                  Instead, they take in the ways they are treated as examples of how things are.
                  They come to expect: "This is the way people feed me"; "This is the way people
                  express emotions"; "These are things that cause people to get yelled at"; "These
                  are the ways to approach people"; and "This is how my curiosity is accepted."

                  Thus, creating a warm, caring, personal relationship with the infant is more than
                  a nice thing to do; it significantly contributes to a child's positive sense of self.17
The four aspects of infant development call for teaching and care that is individually adapted to
who infants and toddlers are and who they are becoming. Because infants move through
distinct developmental periods so rapidly, adults need to respect and be responsive to each
child's learning agenda. Because early learning is holistic, plans to facilitate infants' learning
should reflect consideration of all the domains of development that may be influenced by an
experience.18

   Figure 15.9: What domains of development do you see here? While the caregiver might be reading a book, the
           infants are engaged in physical, cognitive and language, and social and emotional development.19

                   Pause to Reflect
                   Based on what you just learned about the four major aspects of infant/toddler
                   development what are some key things to remember when thinking about the
                   kinds of "basic sensory, social, and emotional experiences" that infants and
                   toddlers need?

Curriculum Planning

Infants and toddlers have an amazing capacity to engage in learning and rapidly organize vast
amounts of new information. Clearly, an infant or toddler who is exploring how something
works or interacting with an adult or other children reveals an active mind that is discovering
and making sense of the surrounding world of people and things.

Infants and toddlers experience the world and build knowledge holistically during simple
moments of play, exploration, and interaction with objects and with other people. They
constantly gather new information and make sense of it. Their minds actively take in sounds,
words, patterns of movement, and the actions and reactions of people, creatures, and objects.
They integrate new information into an increasingly complex system of knowledge. As infants
expand their encounters with objects and people, they try out emerging skills, discover new
actions, and experience feelings in new ways. In moments of play, they experiment, investigate,
and invent solutions, trying to figure out how things work.20

Figure 15.10: What happens when you hit the metal pot with a plastic spatula? This infant is enjoying the resulting
                                                                  music.21

Contexts for Infant/Toddler Curriculum

In planning curriculum for the birth-to-age-three period, teachers must be aware of what
infants and toddlers do in play, both when they act on objects and when they interact with
adults and peers. In essence, play is the "work" of infants and toddlers. When teachers are
mindful of the ways in which each infant experiences a moment of play, that child's learning
agenda reveals itself. In response, teachers are able to plan curriculum that aligns with the
infant's inborn learning agenda. In developing curriculum for infants and toddlers, teachers plan
for three learning contexts:

    1. The play environment as curriculum. Curriculum plans include the selection of play
         materials that add interest and complexity to distinct areas where infants and toddlers
         freely play.

    2. Interactions and conversations as curriculum. Curriculum plans address ways of being
         with infants and toddlers during interaction, including nonverbal interaction,

         conversations, cooperation, conflicts, and times when infants express strong feelings
         such as delight, sadness, anger, or frustration.
    3. Caregiving routines as curriculum. Curriculum plans include care routines, particularly
         mealtimes, diaper changes, and naptimes. Intentional teaching invites infants and
         toddlers to participate in care routines that deepen their relationship experiences and
         open up possibilities for building emerging skills and concepts.22

Figure 15.11: This early childhood education classroom serves the children food family style and allows the children
to develop many skills through serving themselves. Look at his focus and concentration as he manipulates the tongs

                                                          to pick up the food.23

Observation as the Basis for Planning the Infant/Toddler Curriculum

Planning infant/toddler curriculum begins with teachers discovering, through careful listening
and observation, each child's development. Observation is an essential teaching skill. When
teachers mindfully observe, they find out how individual children make discoveries and make
meaning within everyday moments of play and interactions.

Observing for the purpose of assessing individual children's learning means carefully watching
and listening with thought and reflection. In doing so, teachers find evidence of individual
children's meaning-making--how a child expresses or shows feelings, how a child responds to
others' feelings, and how a child responds to the impact of his actions on the objects he
encounters or the people with whom he interacts.

When teachers observe infants' play and interactions, they gather evidence that pertains to
individual children's social- emotional, language, cognitive, and perceptual and motor
development. An observation can help teachers see, describe, and understand how an infant
organizes feelings, ideas, skills, and concepts.

Sometimes, teachers may choose to write down what they observe in a note. They may also
take a photo, or, with older toddlers, they may keep a sample of each child's work. In doing so,
teachers collect observational data that provide clear, vivid evidence of children's development.
Observing how children explore and play with newly introduced materials or ideas often makes
it possible for teachers to track children's developmental progress.
As teachers observe children's play, exploration, and interactions, they discover ways to
support children's learning. Ideas for the next steps in curriculum planning emerge as teachers
reflect on how they might extend or expand children's exploration, problem solving, thinking,
interactions, and language. Observation, reflection, and documentation in the moment
simultaneously launch an ongoing assessment of each child's progress in learning as well as the
curriculum planning cycle.24

                       Observing While Participating

                            Figure 15.12: Having note-taking materials on hand can allow you to jot down some notes
                                                   quickly without even stepping away from the children.

                       One of the key challenges for infant care teachers is to be able to observe
                       and record their observations while providing early care and education.
                       Learning how to address this challenge takes time and a good support
                       system. Teachers can develop plans together for observing and recording
                       behavior in the context of daily routines and events. Some teachers take
                       turns; others have systems such as cameras and note cards placed around
                       the rooms and play yards so they can take quick notes or photos "on the
                       fly." There are many ways to participate and observe at the same time.
                       Children become accustomed to the teacher's taking notes and photos, and
                       it becomes incorporated into the daily routines. Observations from
                       teachers who are involved with children daily are really the most useful
                       because the teacher understands the child's context; everything from how
                       the child slept the night before to his current interests. Infant care teachers
                       who observe regularly are better able to provide care and education that
                       connects with each child in the group.25

Observation and Documentation and the PITC Responsive Process

In the Program for Infant/Toddler Care (PITC) approach to infant/toddler care, responsive
teachers are always observing children. "Watch," or observation, is the first step of the PITC's
three-step responsive process. Observation enables teachers to read infants' cues and meet
their needs moment by moment. One of the central practices of the PITC is helping babies to
establish secure bases for exploration and learning. The moment-by-moment monitoring of
babies' messages and the prompt, contingent responses that stem from observation strengthen
relationships between infants and their teachers and lead to the development of secure bases.
PITC's "Watch, Ask, and Adapt" process works hand in hand with curriculum planning that
includes observation, documentation, and assessment. Infant/toddler care teachers observe in
order to be responsive and build relationships with infants. In this process, teachers also
observe and document, which helps them to deepen their understanding of children's learning
and development and discover ways to support it.26

                   Process. How would you Watch, Ask, and Adapt?

Implementation of a Plan

Each day, infant care teachers introduce or implement possibilities for expanding children's
learning and development. Once the children in care have been observed, and their
experiences documented, teachers try out their plans by making changes in the environment,
introducing materials, relating to and interacting with the children in new ways, and
highlighting objects or concepts for selective focus. However, this implementation process
should not be seen as an end point in the curriculum planning process. Each child's unique
thoughts, feelings, needs, and interests in reaction to the plan or a strategy should influence
the way implementation occurs. How each infant or toddler will respond to a teacher's
suggestions is unpredictable. Once a possibility or suggestion is introduced, the teacher follows
along, observes what each child does, and is responsive to individual children's ongoing
engagement in learning.

Once an interaction with a child or small group of children begins, teachers have to be ready to
adapt their plans and actions to the momentary and often changing needs and interests of each
child. Adaptation and change are critical parts of both children's and teachers' learning
processes and come into play constantly during the implementation process.

             Figure 15.14: This teacher is going to need to be ready to follow the lead of the children as they create
                                       their own experience from what she has planned for them.28

The activities, environments, and interaction opportunities that are introduced should reflect
respect for (1) the competencies that infants and toddlers bring to each interaction and (2) the
children's need for relationship-based experiences.

To work well, implementation should adapt to the infant's changing interests and needs during
each day. In this way, the curriculum will be responsive to what the infants bring to early
experiences and to what the children seek from those experiences.
Implementation should:

     orient the infant care teacher to the role of facilitator of learning;
     help the teacher read the cues of each infant in the small group;

28 Image by the California Department of Education is used with permission

374 | I n t r o d u c t i o n t o C u r r i c u l u m f o r E a r l y C h i l d h o o d E d u c a t i o n
     address the whole learning experience of the children, including the learning
         environment and the program policies that contribute to the learning climate;

     spark each infant's interest and encourage and support exploration;
     reflect consideration for developmental stages but also allow for individual variations in

         temperament, approach, and pace;
     be broad enough in scope to enable the teacher to respond to all developmental

         domains simultaneously.

The teacher's interaction strategies are complemented by a supportive environment that
offers:

     a safe and interesting place for learning;
     a variety of materials that are appropriate for the individual needs and interests of

         infants and toddlers in the group;
     organization of learning and care in small groups;
     adherence to policies that maximize each child's sense of security in care and continuity

         of relationship with the teachers;

    optimization of program connections with the child's family.29

For Example

                  A teacher may have observed over several days that a small group of older
                  toddlers is becoming fascinated with pretend play. Among the reasons that the
                  teacher may be attuned to this interest is its connection to several infant/toddler
                  learning and development foundations, most notably, symbolic play. Through
                  reflection on observations and documentation of the children's emerging
                  interests, the teacher may decide to place additional puppets in the environment.
                  The teacher may wonder whether the puppets would motivate the children to
                  continue to build their interest in pretend play. Rather than drawing attention to
                  the puppets, the teacher may simply decide to place the puppets in the dramatic
                  play area in the room. The teacher may also add to the outside play area some
                  new props related to gardening. Then, curious about what the children will do
                  with the new play materials, the teacher would wait to see what happens next.
                  Anything could happen; the children may not be interested in the new materials,
                  or they may begin to engage in lively pretend play that suggests new possibilities
                  to the teacher.30

Developmentally Appropriate Planning for Infants and
Toddlers: The Infant/Toddler Learning and Development
Foundations

We started the chapter by looking at what infants and toddlers are like. The foundations, which
describe competencies--knowledge and skills--that all young children typically learn with
appropriate support, provide guidance on how to plan what is developmentally appropriate for
infants and toddlers. They also present infant/toddler learning and development as an
integrated process that includes social-emotional development, language development,
cognitive development, and perceptual and motor development. The foundations give a
comprehensive view of what infants and toddlers learn through child-initiated exploration and
discovery, teacher-facilitated experiences, and planned environments, offering rich background
information for teachers to consider as they plan for children.

The foundations identify key areas of learning and development. While moving in the direction
identified by each foundation, every child will progress along a unique path that reflects his or
her individuality and cultural and linguistic experiences. The foundations help teachers
understand children's learning and can give focus to intentional teaching.33

Social-Emotional Development

Social-emotional development includes the child's experience, expression, and management of
emotions and the ability to establish positive and rewarding relationships with others. It
encompasses both intra- and interpersonal processes.

 Figure 15.17: Notice how this teacher is supporting the social-emotional development of both of these children as
                                                     they interact over the gate.34

     Be positive and allow children to explore freely, while often hearing "yes" and seldom
         hearing "no"
     Provide materials that support relationships and the development of social
         understanding
     Provide materials that relate to feelings and emotional expression
     Be arranged to support peer interactions and relationships

Caregivers should:
     Offer learning opportunities through caregiving routines
     Learn about temperament
     Pay attention to feelings and emotional responses
     Support and respect the child's relationship with his or her family
     Support relationships and interactions among the children in the program
     Model responsive and respectful interactions and behavior
     Respect children's interests
     Support children's regulation of emotions
     Demonstrate acceptance for all of the feelings children express35

                  Anita is holding six-month-old Jed on her lap. Jed is the first child to arrive
                  in Anita's family child care home each day. They have a few quiet minutes
                  together before the other children begin to arrive. Anita has noticed that
                  Jed often demonstrates excitement when watching the older children. He
                  kicks his legs and puffs his breath when he sees Carlo and his mother enter
                  the playroom. Miss Anita turns so that Jed can easily see Carlo and she says
                  softly to Jed, "Here is Carlo, coming to play. He made you laugh yesterday,
                  didn't he?" Anita smiles and greets Carlo and his mother, and then she says,
                  "Carlo, Jed is so happy to see you. Do you see how he kicks his legs and
                  waves his arms? Would you like to say hello?" When Carlo approaches,
                  Anita says to Jed, "Here is Carlo, coming to say hello." The boys gaze at
                  each other quietly for a moment. Anita is attentive and silent. Then Carlo
                  makes a silly face and dances, and Jed lets out a little giggle. Carlo's mother,
                  who is several months pregnant, shares a smile with Anita.36

Language Development

Language development naturally occurs through ongoing interactions with adults. Babies have
an inborn capacity to learn language that emerges by experiencing language input from adults.
Experiences with language allow infants and toddlers to acquire mastery of sounds, grammar,
and rules that guide communication and to share meaning with others.

Figure 15.21: Engaging in play with toddlers is one of the best ways to support language development. Wouldn't it
                       be great if this image came with audio? What might they be talking about?40

Guiding principles of the language curriculum include:
     Be responsive to the active communicator and language learner
     Include language in your interactions with infants and toddlers
     Celebrate and support the individual

     Build on children's interests
     Make communication and language interesting and fun
     Create literacy-rich environments

The environment should:

    Provide for exploration of books and other sources of print

     Moderate background noise
     Be arranged to support language development and communication
     Provide open-ended materials that foster communication

Caregivers should:
     Be responsive when children initiate communication
     Engage in nonverbal communication
     Use child-directed language
     Use self-talk and parallel talk (narrate their own and others actions)
     Help children expand language

                       What Language Looks Like in Deaf and Hard-of-Hearing Children

                                                                           Figure 15.2243

                       What happens when a child cannot hear spoken language? They can learn
                       to communicate through sign language. American Sign Language (ASL) is a
                       complete, natural language that has the same linguistic properties as
                       spoken languages, with grammar that differs from English. ASL is expressed
                       by movements of the hands and face. It is the primary language of many
                       North Americans who are deaf and hard of hearing, and is used by many
                       hearing people as well.

                       Parents are often the source of a child's early acquisition of language, but
                       for children who are deaf, additional people may be models for language
                       acquisition. A deaf child born to parents who are deaf and who already use
                       ASL will begin to acquire ASL as naturally as a hearing child picks up spoken
                       language from hearing parents. However, for a deaf child with hearing
                       parents who have no prior experience with ASL, language may be acquired
                       differently. In fact, 9 out of 10 children who are born deaf are born to
                       parents who hear. Some hearing parents choose to introduce sign language
                       to their deaf children. Hearing parents who choose to have their child learn
                       sign language often learn it along with their child. Children who are deaf
                       and have hearing parents often learn sign language through deaf peers and
                       become fluent.

                       Parents should expose a deaf or hard-of-hearing child to language as soon
                       as possible. The earlier a child is exposed to and begins to acquire language,
                       the better that child's language, cognitive, and social development will
                       become. Research suggests that the first few years of life are the most
                       crucial to a child's development of language skills, and even the early
                       months of life can be important for establishing successful communication

388 | I n t r o d u c t i o n t o C u r r i c u l u m f o r E a r l y C h i l d h o o d E d u c a t i o n
                       with caregivers. Thanks to screening programs in place at almost all
                       hospitals in the United States and its territories, newborn babies are tested
                       for hearing before they leave the hospital. If a baby has hearing loss, this
                       screening gives parents an opportunity to learn about communication
                       options. Parents can then start their child's language learning process
                       during this important early stage of development.44

Cognitive Development

The term cognitive development refers to the process of growth and change in intellectual or
mental abilities such as thinking, reasoning, and understanding. It includes the acquisition and
consolidation of knowledge. Over the past three decades, infancy research has caused
developmental psychologists to change the way they characterize the earliest stages of
cognitive development. Once regarded as an organism driven mainly by simple sensorimotor
schemes, the infant is now seen as having sophisticated cognitive skills and concepts that guide
knowledge acquisition.

                                       and provides materials to extend their exploration.45

Guiding principles of the language curriculum include:
     Relate to the child as an active learner
     Provide opportunities for exploration
     Respect the child's initiative and choices
     Allow ample time for children to make sense of experiences
     Appreciate the child's creativity

     Support the child's activity participation in personal care routines
The environment should:

    Provide play spaces with rich opportunities for learning

     Provide storage/display of toys in places that are easily visible and accessible
     Include both novelty and predictability
     Be arranged to encourage exploration
     Provide nesting and stacking toys to support an understanding of spatial relationships
     Provide toys that support cause-and-effect experimentation
     Include toys and props for and be arranged to support pretend play
     Provide toys that support the collection and storage of treasures

    are stored to be accessible to children, and even the nesting toy waiting to be played with on the table top.46

Caregivers should:
     Notice what interests the child
     Use language to engage each child's intellect
     Use personal care routines to support cognitive development47

              Jenna crawls up the wide ramp to a platform where there are several large,
              plastic boxes of different sizes. Jenna crawls up to a box and sticks her head
              inside it, as if she were going to crawl into the box.

              Archie knows she will not be able to fit her entire body inside the box, but
              Jenna is already halfway inside it. Archie scoots up the ramp to Jenna, who
              may be feeling a little stuck at this point, and gently places his hand on
              Jenna's back, saying, "You put your head in this big box, and the rest of you
              is out here with me. I'm here, Jenna."

              Jenna pulls her head out, looks at Archie, and then vocalizes, "Ahhh, ya, ya"
              and gestures toward the box. Archie smiles and says, "Yes, I saw you with
              your head in there. I came right up here in case you needed me, but you got
              yourself out, didn't you?" Jenna looks back at Archie, and then at the box, a
              few times. Then she bangs on the box with her hands and crawls to a larger
              box. She glances back at Archie, who smiles, and she crawls in, fitting into
              the larger box quite easily. "You are in the big box, Jenna. You sure are, and
              I'm out here." Jenna smiles and bangs on the box while vocalizing her
              triumph. 48

                       Discoveries of Infancy

                       Learning Schemes
                       Learning schemes are the building blocks for all other discovery during
                       infancy. By using schemes such as banging, reaching, and mouthing,
                       children gain valuable information about things. Scheme development
                       helps children discover how objects are best used and how to use objects in
                       new and interesting ways.

                       Cause and Effect
                       As infants develop, they begin to understand that events and outcomes are
                       caused. They learn that:

                            They can cause things to happen either with their own bodies or
                                through their own actions.

                            Other people and objects can cause things to happen.
                            Specific parts of objects, for example, wheels, light switches, knobs,

                                and buttons on cameras, can cause specific effects.

                       Use of Tools
                       Tools are anything children can use to accomplish what they want. Among
                       the tools infants use are a cry, a hand, a caregiver, and an object. Infants
                       learn to extend their power through the use of tools. They learn that a tool
                       is a means to an end.

                       Object Permanence
                       For young infants, `out of sight' often means `out of mind.' Infants are not
                       born knowing about the permanence of objects. They make this important
                       discovery gradually through repeated experiences with the same objects,
                       such as a bottle, and the same persons, such as their mother or father.
                       Infants learn that things exist even when one cannot see them.

                       Understanding Space
                       Much of early learning has to do with issues of distance, movement, and
                       perspective. Infants learn about spatial relationships through bumping into
                       things, squeezing into tight spaces, and seeing things from different angles.
                       In a sense, infants and toddlers at play are young scientists, busily
                       investigating the physical universe. For example, they find out about:

                            Relative size as they try to fit an object into a container
                            Gravity as they watch play cars speedily roll down a slide
                            Balance as they try to stack things of different shapes and sizes

                       Imitation
                       One of the most powerful learning devices infants and toddlers use is
                       imitation. It fosters the development of communication and a broad range
                       of other skills.
                       Even very young infants learn from trying to match other people's actions. .
                       . .
                       As infants develop, their imitations become increasingly complex and
                       purposeful. . . . At every stage of infancy, children repeat and practice what
                       they see. By doing the same thing over and over again they make it their
                       own."

                   Pause to Reflect
                   How do these discoveries of infancy relate to the Cognitive Foundations? How
                   might you use both to plan engaging curriculum for infants and toddlers?

Perceptual and Motor Development

Perception refers to the process of taking in, organizing, and interpreting sensory information.
Perception is multimodal, with multiple sensory inputs contributing to motor responses. Motor
development refers to changes in a child's ability to control his body movements, from the
infant's first spontaneous waving and kicking movements to the adaptive control of reaching,
locomotion, and complex sport skills. Gross motor actions include the movement of large limbs
or the whole body, such as walking. Fine motor behaviors include the use of fingers to grasp
and manipulate objects. Motor behaviors such as touching and grasping are forms of
exploratory activity.

Guiding principles of perceptual and motor development curriculum include:
     Recognize the child's developing abilities
     Encourage self-directed movement
     Respect individual differences
     Provide a safe place for each age group
     Be available to children as they move and explore

The environment should:

    Include materials that support perceptual and motor development, focusing on the

         children's interests and how to expand on those interests
     Provide many opportunities for movement and large motor play, both indoors and

         outdoors
     Provide safe, but challenging spaces where children can move, both indoors and

         outdoors
     Establish physical boundaries for moving and exploring with the arrangement of

         furniture and space
     Protect young children's need for sheltered spaces
     Be arranged safely
     Allow children to move easily
     Include everyday objects and materials
     Provide a variety of sensory and motor experiences

Caregivers should:
     Provide the infant with freedom to move
     See things from the infant's perspective
     Help build the infant's feelings of comfort, security, and awareness of his body
     Use common routines, activities, and behaviors to allow for practice of perceptual and
         motor skills
     Acknowledge each child's accomplishments52

                       ready for lunch. Abasi tugs at his bib and watches intently as Stephen fills a
                       bowl with orange baby food. Abasi opens his mouth when Stephen holds
                       up a full spoon for him to see. Stephen gently moves the spoon to Abasi's
                       lips, and Abasi closes his mouth on the spoon. Almost immediately, Abasi
                       spits out the spoon and food and grimaces. Stephen is surprised. Abasi
                       refuses another bite and ends up having a bottle instead. Stephen mentions
                       this episode to Abasi's grandmother at pickup time. She laughs and says,
                       "His favorite food is peaches, but that was carrots. I told his Mama that it
                       would be a nasty surprise for him!" Abasi watches as the two adults laugh
                       together. Stephen comments, "Abasi, you looked at the orange color and
                       expected your favorite--peaches. What a surprise to taste carrots!"53

Summary of Infant/Toddler Foundations in Perceptual and Motor Development

It is important to recognize that, though developmental charts may show motor development
unfolding in the form of a smooth upward progression toward mastery, the development of
individual children often does not follow a smooth upward trajectory. In fact, "detours" and
steps backward are common as development unfolds.54

The key concepts in the Perceptual and Motor Development domain that provide an overview

of the infants and toddlers perceptual and motor development are:

 Perceptual Development: The developing ability to become aware of the social and

      physical environment through the senses

                       Foundations. Can you see how all of these are at play here?

Continuing the Cycle

As curriculum is implemented teachers must continue to observe and reflect on what those
observations mean. It is important for programs to support the experimental nature of
curriculum planning for infants and toddlers. Even plans that do not work out are learning
opportunities for both the children and the teachers.
Teachers must use the information they have gathered about the infants and toddlers to create
a rich learning environment for each child and the group as a whole. In doing so, it's imperative
that they trust the children to teach themselves by exploring that environment and one
another. This is done through respectful interactions that support curiosity, exploration, and
integrations of new knowledge.56

Chapter 16: What Curriculum Looks Like
          for School-Age Children

Objectives:

By the end of the chapter, you should be able to:
    · Connect the purpose of school-age care to important aspects of planning curriculum for
         school-aged children
    · Explain how the needs of school-aged children and desired outcomes are met through
         developmentally curriculum
    · Justify the importance of collaboration between educators and children, families, and
         communities
    · Examine the role of reflective practice in curriculum planning
    · Define what a holistic approach to curriculum is
    · Analyze the value of play in school-age care and curriculum
    · Identify ways to plan for the different types and aspects of play
    · Discuss the importance of intentionality
    · List considerations for planning the environment for school-aged children
    · Summarize the role of diversity and the importance of cultural competence in school-
         aged programs
    · Describe how quality curriculum planning meets the five outcomes
    · Relate each step of the curriculum planning process
    · Differentiate the different roles of the educator

During the school-age years (kindergarten to grade 8), children may be cared for during out-of-
school times in a variety of school-age programming. The focus, philosophy, staffing, and
location of those programs will vary greatly. This chapter will briefly discuss some information
that can be used to create high quality curriculum for children in school-age programming.

But before we get to that, let's look at what school-age children are like. Meet these school-
aged children:

                     This is Emily. She is 5 years old and in kindergarten. She enjoys hopping,
                     skipping, and somersaulting. She is beginning to write and loves drawing
                     figures. She counts to 10 and can tell you what money is. She speaks
                     clearly and enjoys telling stories. She sings and dances. She enjoys
                     spending time with her friends. And she is learning to follow rules.

  This is Antonio. He is in first grade and is 6 years old. He plays soccer and
  rides his bike with training wheels. He writes all his letters and numbers, but
  reverses a few. He is learning to tie his own shoes. He knows right from left
  most of the time. He has "bathroom" humor and is quite talkative. He doesn't
  like to lose and will cheat to win. He recently developed a fear of the dark.

                    Mei is 7 years old and a second grader. She prefers sitting on the floor
                    rather than on furniture. She is becoming more skilled with a paintbrush
                    and writes neatly. She can tell time and read a calendar. She talks with her
                    hands about her personal experiences and loves reading. She has a group
                    of female playmates and while outgoing, worries about not being liked.

    This is Devon. He is 9 years old and in fourth grade. He plays basketball and
    gets better with every practice. He enjoys putting together Lego sets. He
    reads each night and enjoys math. He uses his words to express himself
    when upset, but finds it hard to calm down. He is quite the joke teller. He is
    anxious to please and thrives on positive attention.

                     Dipa is 10 years old and in fifth grade. She enjoys jumping rope. She
                     loves writing stories and illustrating them. She is voracious reader of
                     chapter books. She corrects people's grammar, but pouts when she is
                     corrected. She talks nonstop. She knows when she has broken rules of
                     not met expectations. She still sees the world from her perspective.

   This is Taylor. They identify as genderqueer. Taylor is 12 years old and in
   sixth grade. They are going through a clumsy stage due to a growth spurt.
   They enjoy hiking and bike riding. They draw detailed pictures. They stay
   focused and make detailed plans. They have adult-like langauge, but
   continues to add to their vocabulary. They have signed up to take Chinese
   next year in school. They spend most of their free time with friends.

                                                               Figure 16.11

Introduction

In school-age care settings educators collaborate with children to provide play and recreational
opportunities that are meaningful to children and support their well-being, learning and
development. School-age care settings pay attention to the needs and interests of individual
children within a context that promotes collaboration and active citizenship. Children in school-
age care settings have choice and control over their learning as they collaborate with educators
to extend their life skills and develop dispositions towards citizenship.
From before birth, children are connected to family, community, culture and place. Their
earliest development and learning takes place through these relationships, particularly within
families, who are children's first and most influential educators. As children participate in
everyday life, they develop interests and construct their own identities and understandings of
the world. As children transition to school, their social worlds expand to include a wider range
of relationships particularly with children of a similar age. Children's learning in school-age care
settings complements their learning at home and at school. In school-age care settings there is
great importance placed on relationships and developing and strengthening children's talents
and interests. Children learn to know, to do, to be, to live together and to transform oneself

Introducing the Framework

                           Figure 16.3: Belonging, being, and becoming foster children's learning.3

Children's lives are characterized by belonging, being and becoming.
     Experiencing belonging - knowing where and with whom you belong - is integral to
         human existence. In school-age care, and throughout life, relationships are crucial to a
         sense of belonging. Children belong first to a family, a cultural group, a neighborhood
         and a wider community. Belonging acknowledges children's interdependence with
         others and the basis of relationships in defining identities. Belonging is central to being
         and becoming in that it shapes who children are and who they can become.
     Childhood is a time to be, to seek and make meaning of the world. Being recognizes the
         significance of the here and now in children's lives. It is about the present and them
         knowing themselves, building and maintaining relationships with others, engaging with
         life's joys and complexities, and meeting challenges in everyday life. During the school-
         age years, children develop their interests and explore possibilities. School-age care

         settings give children time and place to collaborate with educators to organize activities
         and opportunities meaningful to them.
     Children's identities, knowledge, understandings, capacities, skills and relationships
         change during childhood. They are shaped by many different events and circumstances.
         Becoming acknowledges children's ongoing learning and development. It emphasizes
         learning to participate fully and actively in society.

Figure 16.4: This Battle of the Bands at a school-age program provides an opportunity to belong, be, and become.4

There are five desired outcomes for children (these are covered more later in the chapter):
     Children have a strong sense of identity
     Children are connected with and contribute to their world
     Children have a strong sense of well-being
     Children are confident and involved learners
     Children are effective communicators

Children's well-being and learning is at the core of the framework and comprises three
interrelated elements: Principles, Practice, and Outcomes.
All three elements are fundamental to pedagogy and program decision-making in school-age
care. A school-age care program encompasses all the interactions, experiences, routines and
events, planned and unplanned, which occur in an environment designed to support well-being
and foster children's learning and development. The emphasis is on the planned or intentional
aspects of the program, which includes supporting spontaneous play and recreational
experiences initiated by children.
Children are receptive to a wide range of experiences. What is included or excluded from the
program affects how children learn, develop and understand the world.

Working in collaboration with children and in partnership with families, educators use the
outcomes to guide their planning for children's well-being and learning. In order to engage
children actively in learning, educators identify children's strengths and interests, choose
appropriate strategies and design the environments. Program decision-making should be an
ongoing cycle. This involves educators drawing on their professional knowledge, including their
in-depth knowledge of children. In collaboration with children and families, educators carefully
evaluate to inform further planning.

Pedagogy

The term pedagogy refers to the holistic nature of educators' professional practice (especially
those aspects that involve building and nurturing relationships), decision-making, and teaching
and learning. When educators establish respectful relationships with children and families, they
are able to work together to develop programs and experiences which are relevant to children
and build on individual and group interests. These experiences create possibilities for children's
own ideas and activities, allowing them to celebrate their own interests and friendships and
express themselves in different ways.
Educators' professional judgements are central to their active role in facilitating children's
learning. In making professional judgements, they weave together their:

     professional knowledge and skills
     knowledge of children, families and communities
     awareness of how their beliefs and values impact on children's well-being and learning
     personal styles and past experiences.
They also draw on their creativity, imagination and insight to help them improvise and adjust
their practice to suit the time, place and context of learning.

Different theories about childhood inform approaches to children's learning and development.
School-age care educators draw upon a range of perspectives in their work. Drawing on a range
of perspectives and theories can challenge traditional ways of seeing children, facilitating
learning, and encourage educators, as individuals and with colleagues, to:

     investigate why they act in the ways that they do
     discuss and debate theories to identify strengths and limitations
     recognize how the theories and beliefs that they use to make sense of their work enable

         but also limit their actions and thoughts
     consider the consequences of their actions for children's experiences
     find new ways of working fairly and justly.

Principles

The following are five Principles that reflect contemporary theories and research evidence
concerning children's play and learning. In school-age care settings, these principles underpin
practice that is focused on collaborating with all children.

1. Secure, respectful, and reciprocal relationships

Mutually supportive relationships are very important in school-age care settings. Secure,
respectful and reciprocal relationships between children, between children and adults, and
amongst adults provide the foundation upon which the community in school-age care settings
is established. When children feel safe, secure, respected and given appropriate responsibility
they feel like valued members of the school-age care community. Children, who are supported
to understand themselves in this positive way, experience a sense of belonging that nurtures
the development of their self-esteem. Self-esteem is critical to children's capacity to develop
positive images about their abilities, interests and personal future.

2. Partnerships

School-age children are involved in a range of activities throughout their day. Children have the
potential to be affected by people, places and events. Families, schools and local communities
contribute to the opportunities provided for this age group. Children feel positive when there
are strong links between these settings and positive outcomes are most likely to be achieved
when educators work in partnership with these contributors. Educators also recognize and
explore community activities. These partnerships shape children's dispositions towards
citizenship.

Educators recognize that families are children's first and most influential teachers. They create
a welcoming environment where all children and families are respected and actively
encouraged to collaborate with educators about program decisions in order to ensure that
experiences are meaningful. Further, educators recognize the school setting and the
significance of the learning and teaching opportunities provided for children. They are sensitive
to the conduit role they provide between families and schools.

 Figure 16.7: This is a school-age program administrator and parent. While the administrator can share about the
    program, the parent can share about the child and together they can create the best program for their child.7

Partnerships are based on effective communication, which builds the foundations of
understanding about each other's expectations and attitudes, and build on the strength of each
others' knowledge. In genuine partnerships, children, families, schools, communities and
educators:

     value each other's knowledge
     value each other's contributions to and roles in children's life
     trust each other
     communicate freely and respectfully with each other
     share insights and perspectives with and about children
     engage in shared decision-making.

3. High Expectation and Equity

School-age care educators who are committed to equity believe in all children's capacities to
access opportunities and succeed, regardless of diverse circumstances and abilities. They
nurture children's optimism, happiness and sense of fun. Children progress well when they,
their parents, educators and the community hold high expectations for achievements and
contributions to society.
Educators recognize and respond to barriers to children achieving a positive self-identity, sense
of purpose and positive view of personal future. In response, they challenge practices that
contribute to inequities and make decisions that promote inclusion and participation of all
children. By developing their professional knowledge and skills, and working in partnership with
children, families, communities, other services and agencies, they continually strive to find
equitable and effective ways to ensure that all children have opportunities to experience a
sense of personal worth and achieve outcomes.

        Figure 16.8: Differences in abilities may not always be as noticeable as a child that uses a wheelchair.8

4. Respect for Diversity

There are many ways of living, being and of knowing. Children are born belonging to a culture,
which is not only influenced by traditional practices, heritage and ancestral knowledge, but also
by the experiences, values and beliefs of individual families and communities. Being aware of
and understanding diversity in school-age care means taking into account the context of
different family practices, values and beliefs. Educators endeavor to understand the histories,

8 Image by Jet Fabara is in the public domain

409 | I n t r o d u c t i o n t o C u r r i c u l u m f o r E a r l y C h i l d h o o d E d u c a t i o n
cultures, languages, traditions, child rearing practices and lifestyle choices of families so they
can better support children in their care. They value children's different capacities and abilities.

Educators recognize that diversity contributes to the richness of our society and provides a valid
evidence base about ways of knowing. When school-age care educators respect the diversity of
families and communities, and the aspirations they hold for children, they are able to nurture
children's well-being and foster children's development. They make program decisions that
uphold all children's rights to have their cultures, identities, abilities and strengths
acknowledged and valued, and respond to the complexity of children's and families' lives.

Educators think critically about opportunities and dilemmas that can arise from diversity and
take action to redress unfairness. They provide opportunities to explore similarities and
differences and consider interdependence and how we can learn to live together.

                       A Culturally Responsive Environment
                       According to Matthew Lynch, in an Education Week blog post, one way that
                       educators can incorporate cultural awareness is to "express interest in the
                       ethnic background of your students. Encourage your students to research
                       and share information about their ethnic background as a means of
                       fostering a trusting relationship with fellow classmates. Analyze and
                       celebrate differences in traditions, beliefs, and social behaviors. It is of note
                       that this task helps European-American students realize that their beliefs
                       and traditions constitute a culture as well, which is a necessary
                       breakthrough in the development of a truly culturally responsive classroom.
                       Also, take the time to learn the proper pronunciation of student names and
                       express interest in the etymology of interesting and diverse names."9

5. Ongoing Learning and Reflective Practice

Educators continually seek ways to build their professional knowledge and develop learning
communities. They collaborate with children, families and communities, and value the
continuity and richness of local knowledge shared by community members.

Reflective practice is a form of ongoing learning that involves engaging with questions of
philosophy, ethics and practice. Its intention is to gather information and gain insights that
support, inform and enrich decision-making about children's well-being and development. As
professionals, educators examine what happens in their settings and reflect on what they might
change.

Critical reflection involves closely examining all aspects of events and experiences from
different perspectives. Educators often frame their reflective practice within a set of
overarching questions, developing more specific questions for particular areas of inquiry.
Overarching questions to guide reflection include:

     What are my understandings of each child?
     What theories, philosophies and understandings shape and assist my work?
     Who is advantaged when I work in this way? Who is disadvantaged?
     What questions do I have about my work? What am I challenged by? What am I curious

         about? What am I confronted by?
     What aspects of my work are not helped by the theories and guidance that I usually

         draw on to make sense of what I do?
     Are there other theories or knowledge that could help me to understand better what I

         have observed or experienced? What are they? How might those theories and that
         knowledge affect my practice?
A lively culture of professional inquiry is established when educators and those with whom they
work are all involved in an ongoing cycle of review through which current practices are
examined, outcomes reviewed, and new ideas generated. In such a climate, issues relating to
program quality, environment design, equity and children's well-being can be raised and
debated.

Practice

The principles of school-age care pedagogy underpin practice. Educators draw on a rich
repertoire of pedagogical practices to promote children's learning by:

     adopting holistic approaches

     collaborating with children
     planning and implementing play and recreational activities
     acting with intentionality
     creating physical and social school-age care environments that have a positive impact

         on children's development, well-being and community-building
     valuing the cultural and social contexts of children and their families
     providing for continuity in experiences and enabling children to have successful

         transition
     using reflection and documentation about children's well-being and learning to inform

         and evaluate programs and to support children in achieving outcomes.

Holistic Approaches

School-age care educators take a holistic approach to their roles and responsibilities,
recognizing the connectedness of mind, body and spirit. They focus attention on children's
physical, personal, social, emotional and spiritual well-being as well as cognitive aspects of
learning as it pertains to life-long learning. They are particularly concerned with how children's
social and physical development and well-being influences capacity and potential to become
effective citizens. Each outcome is viewed as being integrated and interconnected.

An integrated, holistic approach focuses on connections to the social and natural worlds.
Educators foster children's capacity to value and respect the broader social environment and to
be world-wise; and as well understand and appreciate the natural environment and the
interdependence between people, plants, animals and the land.

Educators recognise the connections between children, families and communities and the
importance of reciprocal relationships and partnerships. They see learning as a social activity
and value collaborative activities and community participation.

Each school-age care setting can be considered as a community itself, just as it is also part of
the local and global community. As such, the school-age care community has the power to
affect and be affected by issues within and outside the setting. School-age care educators
consider children's needs including nutrition and safety. They see children as capable and
responsible, and provide places for them to socialise and play with friends and to relax and
have fun. School-age care settings are places to learn about self, others and the world - in other
words learning about living and learning through living.

Collaboration with Children

School-age care educators are responsive to all children's strengths, abilities and interests. They
value and build on children's strengths, skills and knowledge to ensure their well-being,
motivation, and engagement in experiences. They respond to children's expertise, cultural
traditions and ways of knowing, the multiple languages spoken by some children, particularly
Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children, and the strategies used by children with
additional needs to negotiate their everyday lives.
Responding to children's ideas and play forms an important basis for program decision-making.
In response to children's evolving ideas and interests, educators assess, anticipate and extend
children's ideas via open ended questioning, providing feedback, challenging their thinking and
guiding their actions.

Figure 16.11: The school-age care program these children attend worked with the children to create this calendar.12

Responsive relationships are significant features of school-age care settings. This form of
collaborative engagement is evidenced between educators and children, among children,
between educators and parents and various stakeholders including schools, working to support
children, families and the community.

Responsive relationships are strengthened as educators and children share decisions, respect
and trust each other and learn together. Responsiveness enables educators to respectfully
enter children's play and ongoing projects, stimulate their thinking and enrich their growth and
development. Responsive relationships with families and the local community including
schools, enables educators to establish safe and secure environments for children.

Learning through Play

Play and recreational activities provide opportunities for children to learn as they discover,
create, improvise and imagine. When children play with other children they create social
groups, test out ideas, challenge each other's thinking and build new understandings. Play
provides a supportive environment where children can ask questions, solve problems and
engage in critical thinking. Play can expand children's thinking and enhance their desire to know
and to learn. In these ways, play can promote positive dispositions towards learning. Children's
immersion in their play illustrates how play enables them to simply enjoy being.

                              Figure 16.12: Play dough is a great open-ended play experience.13

School-age care educators take on many roles in play and recreational activities with children
and use a range of strategies to enrich development. They allow time and create spaces that
encourage children to explore, build relationships, solve problems, create and construct. They
also recognise spontaneous `teachable moments' as they occur, and use them to build on
children's experiences.
Educators actively support the inclusion of all children in play and recreational activities. They
also help children to recognise when play is unfair and offer constructive ways to build a caring,
fair and inclusive community.

In school-age care settings, there is a myriad of recreational and play experiences that foster
children's development and encourages valuable learning. Play in school-age care settings will
often differ from that of preschool-aged children. According to Piaget's theory of cognitive
development, most school-age children will have moved, or be moving, into the concrete
operational stage of development. As they get older, school-age children place more
importance on peer interactions. `Peers become partners who must learn to negotiate,
compromise, share and defend themselves as equals' (Nixon & Gould 2005, p.173).
Play also provides children with opportunities to practice skills taught at school or learned at
home, and to reinforce the learning that has occurred. The following table addresses the ways
to incorporate different types of play into school-age care.

Table 16.1: Way to Incorporation Different Types of Play into School-Age Care

    Types of Play                Ways to Incorporate Into School-Age Care
Dramatic Play      · Provide materials that will foster role play
                   · Create spaces for dramatic play
Games with Rules   · Facilitate more complex, pre-planned dramatic productions for

Play Rituals           older children
Rough and Tumble   · Provide opportunities for team games and sports
Play               · Balance competitive games with experiences in which the whole

Collecting             group works towards a common goal
Excursions         · Be involved in card and board games to ensure they are positive

                       experiences for children
                   · Mixed-age groups are ideal places for these to be handed down
                   · Provide space, materials, and time for games like hopscotch, four

                       square, clapping games, chants, and hide-and-seek
                   · Provide opportunities for this play with educator support and

                       guidance to facilitate this
                   · Consider structured experiences, such as pillow fighting, pool

                       noodle sword fights, and sumo suits
                   · Have a specific space with rules
                   · Ensure close supervision (can act as umpire/referee)
                   · Develop a policy and procedures on how collections can be

                       traded (or not)
                   · Provide opportunities for children to connect to their

                       communities, have stimulating and different experiences, and
                       test out skills in a different context

Intentionality

Intentionality refers to actions that are deliberate, purposeful and thoughtful. Educators who
engage in intentional actions recognise that learning occurs in social contexts, and that
interactions and conversations are vitally important for learning. They actively promote
children's learning through worthwhile and challenging experiences and interactions that foster

415 | I n t r o d u c t i o n t o C u r r i c u l u m f o r E a r l y C h i l d h o o d E d u c a t i o n
high-level thinking skills and they seize opportunities in activities and conversations to extend
or affirm children's learning. They listen with intent to the conversations of children and use
strategies such as modelling and demonstrating, open questioning, speculating, explaining, and
engaging in shared thinking and problem solving to extend children's thinking and learning.
Educators move flexibly in and out of different roles and draw on different strategies as the
context changes. The documentation and monitoring of children's well-being and engagement
with learning life skills and citizenship supports effective program planning. Intentionality
utilises professional knowledge and strategies that reflect contemporary theories and research
concerning children's play, recreational and learning.

School-age care educators are conscious of making the most of opportunities to follow up
children's needs and interests. They make use of spontaneous `teachable moments' to scaffold
children's development. These incidental opportunities are significant and meaningful to
children's being and becoming and achievement of the outcomes.

Figure 16.13: This educator noticed the child's interest in a nursery rhyme and is showing her the hand motions that
                                                               go with it.14

Environments

School-age care environments are welcoming spaces when they reflect and enrich the lives and
identities of children and families participating in the setting in response to their interests and
needs. (See Appendix B for a sample school-age care program classroom.) Environments that
support well-being and development are vibrant and flexible spaces that are responsive to the
welfare and abilities of each child. They cater for different needs and interests and invite
children and families to contribute ideas and questions. Educators can support engagement by
allowing time for meaningful interactions, by providing a range of opportunities for individual
and shared experiences, and by finding opportunities for children to go into and contribute to
their local community.

Resources need to reflect the interests and capabilities of the children that are sharing the
environment and be accessible to children so they can choose and be responsible for their

416 | I n t r o d u c t i o n t o C u r r i c u l u m f o r E a r l y C h i l d h o o d E d u c a t i o n
actions. Access to digital technologies can enable children to locate global connections and
resources, and encourage new ways of thinking and communicating.

School-age care environments and resources can also emphasise accountability for a
sustainable future and promote children's understanding about their responsibility to care for
the environment, day to day and for long-term sustainability. These spaces promote the
development of life skills such as growing and preparing food, waste reduction and recycling.

School-age care settings are commonly located in a variety of venues and many are in shared
facilities. The space should be flexible enough to allow for the range of activities necessary for
children to participate in opportunities to achieve the outcomes. The environment should:

     Welcome the social nature of school-age children
     Provide an aesthetic beauty
     Be organized
     Provide rich possibilities and choices
     Invite children to undertake exploration and problem-solving
     Facilitate cooperation and negotiation
     Include quiet, comfortable spaces
     Incorporate structure and unstructured experiences
     Provide a range of recreational experiences
     Be designed to meet the needs of a diverse group of children (of differing ages, abilities,

         interests, and needs)
     Have spaces for both small and large group gathering/activities
     Encourage complex and creative thinking through open-ended materials
     Promote opportunities for sustained shared thinking and collaborative activities
     Recognize the importance of active play
     Include outdoor play in a natural environment and/or with natural materials
     Have an established routine
     Be more home-like; warm and cozy
     Nurture a sense of belonging
     Have a culture that sets the right tone
     Involve the rituals that are respectful and inclusive of all children and families
     Overcome obstacles (such as being in a shared space)

      Figure 16.14: This image shows a school-age care environment that provides space for large group/active
                   experiences (such as the karate they are doing), comfortable seating, and storage.15

Children report that they value a space:
    · that is and makes them feel safe
    · feels positive and friendly
    · where you can talk about your feelings and seek help for social difficulties
    · outside that provides gross motor experiences
    · inside that is organized and arranged for a purpose
    · in which equipment, materials, personal belongings, and creations are stored safely
    · that is decorated by displaying their work and creations
    · with some natural elements (trees, animals, water, and gardens)

Here are some quotes from children about their school-age spaces:
                  "School-age care makes me feel a positive feeling, like a feeling I get when I go to
                  my grandma's, knowing someone really, really cares for me."

                       "Creating a Sensory Sensitive Environment"

                       Creating a sensory sensitive environment School-age care can be especially
                       challenging for a child with a sensory processing disorder. Children are
                       expected to process a wide range of sensory input in the environment
                       simultaneously. For some children, inefficiencies in sensory processing
                       impair their ability to do this. Therefore providing a space for children to
                       retreat to and engage in experiences which help them to self-regulate is
                       important for their successful inclusion in the school-age care setting.

                       After working with the Principle and Special Education Coordinator, visiting
                       local elementary schools to look at their programs, talking to staff about
                       resources and training, attending a workshop, we created a sensory
                       sensitive and responsive environment which included beanbags, tents,
                       music, lava lamps, weighted blankets, soft toys and a fish tank. The room
                       has been used by children with autism spectrum disorder and children with
                       developmental trauma. It has also proved a useful resource to engage
                       children who may be reticent to attend school or the school-age care
                       program.

Cultural Competence

Educators who are culturally competent respect multiple cultural ways of knowing, seeing and
living. They celebrate the benefits of diversity and have an ability to understand and honour
differences. This is evident in everyday practice when educators demonstrate an ongoing
commitment to developing their own cultural competence in a two way process with children,
families and communities.

Educators view culture and the context of family as central to children's sense of being and
belonging, and to success in lifelong learning. Educators also seek to promote children's cultural
competence.

Cultural competence is much more than awareness of cultural differences. It is the ability to
understand, communicate with, and effectively interact with people across cultures. Cultural
competence encompasses:

     being aware of one's own world view
     developing positive attitudes towards cultural differences
     gaining knowledge of different cultural practices and world views
     developing skills for communication and interaction across cultures.

Continuity and Transitions

School-age care settings are situated in complementary relationships with homes, schools and
community spaces with different places and environments having their own purposes,

419 | I n t r o d u c t i o n t o C u r r i c u l u m f o r E a r l y C h i l d h o o d E d u c a t i o n
expectations and ways of doing things. In learning life skills children draw on the
understandings, skills and attitudes from the range of settings in which they engage. Educators
work with children, families, other professionals and the broader community to ensure
successful transitions between settings and that children feel secure and confident. They assist
children to understand the traditions, routines and practices of the settings to which they are
moving and to feel comfortable with the process of change.

Children are likely to engage with other children and the educators in school-age care settings
over a significant period of time. Ensuring children have an active role in preparing for
transitions helps them to feel motivated to contribute and become engaged with the activities
within settings. As children make transitions between settings (including school) educators
from school-age care settings, schools and other children's services, support the transitions by
sharing appropriate information about each child's capabilities and interests.

    Figure 16.15: These children's daily transitions between school and school-age care requires riding the bus.16

Change can be stressful and some individuals find it more difficult dealing with change than
others. Change can occur on a day-to-day basis when children must transition from school-age
care to the classroom and then back to school-age care again, or it may occur on a larger scale
when children change schools or classrooms or experience a new addition to their family.
In exploring and understanding change and effectively managing change, children need support
in:

    · learning that change is easier to cope with if it is expected and timely
    · using previous experiences of change to help cope with current change
    · establishing meaningful routines which help during times of change choosing friends to

         bridge the gap between the familiar and unfamiliar
    · recognizing that at times of change emotions may be difficult to manage
    · learning that new opportunities can come with change
    · gaining some control in the changes in their lives

    · realizing that change is a part of life.

Evaluation for Well-being and Learning

Educators gather knowledge about children's well-being and learning as they reflect and
engage in processes such as scanning, monitoring, gathering and analysing information about
how children feel and what children know, can do and understand. It is part of an ongoing cycle
that includes planning, documenting and evaluating children's well-being, development and
learning.

It is important because it enables educators in partnership with children, families and other
professionals to:

     plan effectively for children's well-being
     plan collaboratively with children
     communicate about children's well-being and development
     determine the extent to which all children are progressing toward realising outcomes

         and if not, what might be impeding their progress
     identify children who may need additional support in order to achieve particular

         outcomes, providing that support or assisting families to access specialist help
     evaluate the effectiveness of environments and experiences offered and the approaches

         taken to nurture children's well-being and to enrich children's development
     reflect on pedagogy that will suit the context and children.

Educators use a variety of strategies to collect, document, organise, synthesise and interpret
the information that they gather about children's well-being and enrichment to evaluate the
effectiveness of their programs. They search for appropriate ways to collect rich and
meaningful information that depicts children's well-being and development in context,
describes their progress and identifies their strengths, skills and understandings. When school-
age care educators and children collaborate about their well-being and experiences they use
approaches that have become powerful ways to make the process visible to children and their
families, educators and other professionals.

Educators make many informal observations and assessments on an ongoing basis. The goal in
evaluation is to integrate these into a more planned and formal process to be able to evaluate
the overall goals of the setting, as well as individual children's needs and progress around well-
being and learning.

One of the biggest challenges facing school-age care educators is efficient use of time and the
need to document what is significant. What do you document? How do you know what is
significant? You cannot possibly document everything and it tends to become meaningless if
this occurs. Educators need to select the important moments. You can't write in detail about
every child, and you can't do it every day! However, in time you can gather pictures and stories
about all the children to give a better idea about who they are and their dispositions.

                       Figure 16.16: This educator is deep in thought about what she has observed.17

Educators are keen observers. They notice not only what children are doing, but also what and
how they are playing and what they are saying during play. This puts them in a strong position
to develop a program based on their observations. An emergent curriculum is one which:

    · is child initiated, but framed by an educator: collaborative between child and adult
    · builds on existing interests
    · allows children to create, extend themselves and discover more
    · is flexible, constantly developing and not done well in advance
    · uses various forms of documentation.

A Closer Look at the Outcomes

The five outcomes are designed to capture the integrated and complex well-being,
development and learning of all children. They:

     Are broad and observable
     Acknowledge children in care have choices and opportunities to collaborate with other

         children and educators
     Recognize that children lean in a variety of ways and vary in their capabilities and pace

         of learning
     Respect that children engage with increasingly complex ideas and learning experiences,

         which are transferable to other situations
     Are influenced by

             o Each child
             o Educators' practices
             o The environment
             o Engagement with the family and community (including the school)

The Planning Cycle

A school-age program encompasses far more than just a list of planned experiences. So when
planning, educators need to consider such things as the environment, the routines, the
everyday resources, and even the skills and knowledge of the educators who work with the
children.

As children explore relationships, resources and experiences in a thoughtfully planned
environment, educators move through an ongoing cycle underpinned by reflective practice. It
operates as a continuous `cycle of inquiry' which includes stopping to think about how and why
we're doing things the way we are, examining our answers to these questions from different
perspectives, and using the deeper understandings we develop as a reference point for
deciding what actions or changes we want to make. This current method of ongoing and cyclic
planning is demonstrated in the figure below.

426 | I n t r o d u c t i o n t o C u r r i c u l u m f o r E a r l y C h i l d h o o d E d u c a t i o n

Deconstructing the Cycle

Question

Step 1 - Knowledge and beliefs
At the core of the program, planning is investigating our knowledge and beliefs and the
practices that are linked to these. Educators constantly update their knowledge and associated
practices by immersing themselves in contemporary research and theory. As everyone has
different values and beliefs, educators in school-age care settings must regularly come together
to share their knowledge and beliefs to develop their philosophy or enable a team approach.

This philosophy or team approach should be based on theory and research, not just personal
beliefs.

Step 2 - Strengths and Interests
Educators, like the children they care for, are diverse in their education, backgrounds and
talents. This diversity means that educators can be responsive to a wide range of children's
needs and interests. Different educators will bring different things to the program and there is
no one prescribed role. This also models an important concept in school-age care services--
that of inclusion: it is a place where everyone belongs.

                              Figure 16.18: What might be these boys' interests and strengths?19

When educators plan by combining children's strengths and interests with their knowledge and
beliefs they can formulate both short term and long term goals for the service.

Plan

Step 3 - Plan the Environments
Educators should spend time planning their indoor and outdoor environments to achieve the
outcomes of their vision, which is aligned with their philosophy and beliefs. School-age care
settings should provide choice and flexibility and a range of engaging experiences, which will
meet the needs of a range of different children in different age ranges. There should be
opportunities for creativity, experimentation, and play. The environment should allow children
to feel a sense of belonging, coupled with a sense of autonomy.

Step 4 - Define the Role of the Educator
Effective educators have a clear vision of their role when working with children. Educators in
this context can be defined as practitioners whose primary function in school-age care settings
is to plan and implement programs that support children's well-being, development and
learning.

In their day-to-day duties, the educator has to undertake many varied roles, and the qualities
and skills necessary for these roles, do not always come naturally with all individuals'
personalities. Some educators may need some training or development to acquire some of
these strengths. Training and practice can help educators develop these qualities just as skilled
educators can help children develop these qualities. To be able to develop these qualities,
however, educators need guided self-reflection and the support of an educational leader or
mentor.

Observer            Although educators are primarily facilitators, there are times when
                    clear direction is more appropriate. This includes situations that
                    involve safety issues and other situations where there may be non-
                    negotiable issues (such as bullying).
                    An educator is always modelling. Children notice everything:
                    learning is their job and they learn from everything you do and
                    everything you don't do, everything you say and everything you
                    don't say. Educators model skills from conflict resolution to hand
                    washing and sun safety measures.
                    Educators must plan programs, budgets, professional development
                    and communication systems.
                    Educators celebrate or acknowledge each child's participation,
                    efforts, gifts and talents, affirm children's sense of belonging, and
                    provide physical and emotional support.

Role               Description

      identifying what is working and what needs improvement or

      adaptation.

Step 5 - Devise or Be Aware of Evaluation Methods
Knowing what evaluation methods you are going to use up front enables educators to have
clear direction on what they are doing and why. Programs may have tools or processes that are
required or you can use the five outcomes outlined in this chapter.

Evaluation is important because it enables educators to collaborate with children and examine
the program with the outcomes in mind. This allows us to go deeper to discover how the
programs are contributing to children's well-being, learning and development.

Step 6 - Plan Experiences
When planning experiences for children in school-age care settings, it is important to consider
the outcomes (those listed in this chapter and/or those in the program's mission and
philosophy). You must start with considering what your end goal is. There does not need to be a
set curriculum to follow (although some programs may have this). But it is important that what
is planned is responsive and allows for flexibility and creativity.

Settings may use a variety of approaches or theories (such as Multiple Intelligences, Emergent
Curriculum, Reggio Emilia, or theme-based planning) to plan their experiences. What is
important, however, is that educators recognize that best practice program planning is
underpinned by the components of contemporary theory and research, educator skills and
knowledge, collaboration with children and partnerships with family and culture.
At all times, the child must be central to program planning, so devising experiences around
children's needs and their interests is a good starting place. One of the best ways to ensure
curriculum is developmentally appropriate is to use an emergent approach. `In an emergent
approach the sources of curriculum are:

    · children's interests such as discovering birds making a nest
    · educators' interests such as artworks
    · developmental tasks--emergent curriculum is responsive to children's development and

         learning
    · things in the physical environment, including manufactured and natural resources
    · people in the social environment, including staff, families and community members
    · curriculum resource materials that can be adapted'
Children need stimulation and scaffolding in their learning and interests and this is where
effective educators can work closely with children to notice their emerging interests and
further this interest through responsive planning. Noticing the cultures and issues in the
community are also stimuli for planning experiences.

Planning with a Holistic Approach
School-age care educators take a holistic approach to their roles and responsibilities recognizing
the connectedness of mind, body and spirit. They focus attention on children's physical,
personal, social, emotional and spiritual well-being as well as cognitive aspects of learning as it
pertains to lifelong learning.
Our image of the whole child influences every interaction and experience. This image
encompasses physical, personal, social, emotional, cultural, spiritual and cognitive aspects of
the child.
A holistic approach does not prioritize one aspect of development or learning over another: it is
the connectedness of body, mind and spirit, all of which are equally important. Nurturing the
whole child is an important role for school-age care educators. Taking a holistic approach also
means considering and incorporating into the program the culture of the families that it serves.

Act and Do

Step 7 - Implement Plans
Time to put the plan into action. Educators actively engage with and support all children to fully
participate in a range of experiences. Educators should listen carefully and respond to children's
voices and accommodate for spontaneity, natural curiosity, individual needs and interests.

                   Figure 16.19: This educator is engaged with these girls that are completing puzzles.20

Observe and Review

Step 8 - Assess and Evaluate Planned and Unplanned Learning Experiences
When reviewing and evaluating the program, it is important to assess both the planned
experiences and unplanned experiences. After all, by definition, the program constitutes all of
the interactions, experiences, routines and events.

Evaluation methods should have been established in step 5, so it is a matter of gathering the
information and undertaking critical analysis and reflection to understand what this means and
implement change as needed.
Evaluation should not simply consist of individual written work. Group reflection and discussion
is a critical component of evaluation that then leads onto the next step in the cyclic process.
Children should also play a critical role in evaluating aspects of the program including routines,
experiences and resources.
Some questions to consider during this process include:

     How did the planned learning occur? What learning occurred?
     What unplanned learning occurred? Is this unplanned learning desirable? What does

         this mean?
     In what ways are you listening to your culturally diverse families? How are you

         demonstrating cultural competence?
     Consider time, space, resources:

             o Do we need more resources, either human resources or material ones?
             o Did we allow enough time? Was it the right time of the day?
             o Was there enough space? Was it the right space?
     What would have made it a better learning experience?
     How can we build on this?
     Does this experience tie in with any other experiences that were planned or unplanned?
     How do we/can we gather feedback from children, families and other educators to help
         evaluate the learning experiences?

                       Vignette
                       Recently our team was called on to practice being more reflective. We
                       chose to reflect on our current sign in process.

                       We brainstormed and reflected on our current `signing in' practice, which
                       was as follows:

                           · educator sits at the staff desk and signs children in as they walk
                                through the door

                           · other educators are greeting children at the door and asking
                                children to put bags away in the bag area, with one educator
                                waiting in the kitchen ready to serve food and remind children to
                                wash their hands

                           · children walk in and greet the educator; normally the educator is
                                busy signing

                           · some children come in all at once
                           · educators try to sign in as fast as they can: it can feel rushed, as

                                there is often a line up
                           · some children say hello, some don't
                           · educators feel rude sometimes when they don't get to say `hi' to all

                                children initially
                           · late bus children arrive at 3:50pm: educators feel like these children

                                aren't getting a nice greeting · bags get left on the floor
                           · children sometimes hang around the sign-in desk wanting to talk to

                                the educator
                           · signing in gets put on hold when the phone rings, or a parent wants

                                to pay fees, then children get missed.

                       After analyzing our thoughts and reflections, we were concerned that this
                       routine was not promoting a positive atmosphere where children felt
                       welcomed, unhurried and valued.

                       We discussed the fact that some children are asked to move away from the
                       sign-in desk because it is crowded. We are aware some children may not be
                       getting sufficient attention. We want to make each child feel that they are
                       welcomed when they arrive, so they feel a sense of belonging when they
                       walk in the door. We also talked about how to get away from the `line up'
                       as it reminded us of being at school.

                       We want the children to feel that the after school care setting is different
                       from school. We wanted to get some ideas from the children about signing
                       in and how we could improve the transition from school to care.

433 | I n t r o d u c t i o n t o C u r r i c u l u m f o r E a r l y C h i l d h o o d E d u c a t i o n
                       An educator then held a meeting with the children to ask whether they had
                       any ideas on how to make signing in fun and easier for them. The children
                       came up with:

                           · signing ourselves in
                           · one sign-on for under-nines and one sign in for over-nines
                           · if you don't say `hi' to the educator and get signed in, you go back

                                out and try again
                           · sign your name on the white board
                           · stick your own piece of paper on your name to say you are there
                           · tick your own name off.

                       Once we had gathered this information, we decided to involve the children
                       by signing their name in on the white board, as the white board is quite far
                       away from the staff desk. It allows the children to walk in, say `hi' to all the
                       educators, put bags away, then make their way to the white board and
                       write their own name on it.

                       We tried the new system for a week. An educator wrote on the white board
                       before any of the children arrived: `New sign in. Write your own name'. The
                       educators voiced some concerns: `What if it doesn't work? How will the
                       shorter children reach? What if there is a line up?'

                       On the first day, the first child arrived and the educator explained the new
                       system. He raised his eyebrows and said `OK', then wrote his name and the
                       time he arrived. The other children seemed happy to copy what the
                       children in front of them were doing. They seemed to enjoy having the
                       responsibility of signing themselves in. The educator in the quiet area
                       would then check the board and sign off the children on the daily booking
                       sheet.

                                        Figure 16.20: The children signed themselves in using the white board.21

                       When the children got picked up, they would go to the white board and
                       wipe their names off to say they have left or they would write `left' next to
434 | I n t r o d u c t i o n t o C u r r i c u l u m f o r E a r l y C h i l d h o o d E d u c a t i o n
                       their names. Overall the children enjoyed this system and the signing-in
                       process was less crowded. It allowed educators to talk to each child as they
                       came into the service and it promoted continuous flow.

                       As the week went on the children were walking into after school care with a
                       smile, saying `hello, I know what to do' and they would go to the white
                       board and sign their name. The sign-in educator supervised while taking the
                       time to have a conversation with all children, asking them about their day
                       and following up on conversations from previous interactions. The children
                       reported that they liked the new system better.

                       As a result of this change of practice, we have decided to continue the
                       process this way. It has improved and relaxed the process, the room is
                       quieter, and runs smoother. The children seem to co-operate more with the
                       process because it is up to them to complete the task.

Conclusion

School-age children experience learning in a wide range of settings. Family, school and the
community (including school-age care settings) provide diverse opportunities for children to
explore relationships and ideas, and build competence and skills. The diversity in family and
community life means that school-age children experience belonging, being and becoming in
many different ways. They bring their diverse experiences, perspectives, expectations,
knowledge and skills to their learning.

Children's learning is dynamic, complex, and holistic. Physical, social, emotional, personal,
spiritual, creative, cognitive, and linguistic aspects of learning are all intricately interwoven and
interrelated.

Play is a context for learning that:
     allows for the expression of personality and uniqueness
     enhances dispositions such as curiosity and creativity
     enables children to make connections between prior experiences and new learning 
         assists children to develop relationships and concepts
     stimulates a sense of well-being.

Children actively construct their own understandings and contribute to others' learning. They
recognize their agency, capacity to initiate and lead learning, and their rights to participate in
decisions that affect them, including their learning.

Recreational experiences constructed by children and supported by informed educators
promote children's dynamic, complex and holistic learning. Children's happiness, optimism and
sense of fun are dispositions that are significant to their emotional well-being and resilience. In
school-age care settings, children's sense of responsibility for their learning is co-determined
and skills and attitudes towards life-long learning are consolidated. Children actively involved in
community building develop common interests and learn about citizenship.

Viewing children as active participants and decision-makers opens up possibilities for educators
to move beyond preconceived expectations about what children can do and learn. This requires
educators to respect and work with children's unique qualities, abilities and interests. When
children are given choices and control, they experience connections between actions and
consequences.

Educators' practices and the relationships they form with children and families have a
significant effect on children's sense of identity and well-being which impacts on children's
involvement and success in learning. Children thrive when families, educators and the wider
community (especially schools) work together in partnership to support children's well-being
and learning.23

    · Review criteria to determine when and what to document
    · Explain the purposes of documentation
    · Justify documenting children's play
    · Describe different methods of documenting children's learning
    · Relate how to respect the rights of children and families when documenting
    · Discuss the role of assessment
    · Describe how the Desired Results Developmental Profile can be used to assess children
    · Summarize important considerations in assessment during early childhood
    · Explain the importance of working with families when documenting and assessing
         children

Introduction

Documenting and assessing all the children in your care allows you to gradually build up a
comprehensive picture of each child's interests, strengths and relationships, as well as an
insight into areas they may be avoiding or skills they need help to develop. It will give you a
clearer picture of the social interactions, creative ideas and the concerns of the children in your
program. It will take some time and a concerted team effort to gather documentation on all the
children in your care-- but there are benefits. Having this kind of profile of all the children in
your service will allow you to plan curriculum that develops these interests and builds up these
skills over time. 1

Documentation

Knowing What to Document

One of the biggest challenges facing early childhood educators is efficient use of time and the
need to document what is significant. What do you document? How do you know what is
significant? You cannot possibly document everything and it tends to become meaningless if
this occurs. Educators need to select the important moments. You can't write in detail about
every child, and you can't do it every day! However, in time you can gather pictures and stories
about all the children to give a better idea about who they are and their dispositions.

                   Figure 17.1: Educators can use their observations to create high quality curriculum.2

Educators are keen observers. They notice not only what children are doing, but also what and
how they are playing and what they are saying during play. This puts them in a strong position
to develop a program based on their observations.

When trying to determine when and how to document, ask yourself:
    1. Why am I recording this--what is meaningful/significant?
    2. What is the learning occurring?
    3. How can we extend on this?
    4. How does it link to the outcomes we are measuring?3

Purposes of Documentation

Documentation serves different purposes at different times. The criteria for what counts as
quality documentation depends on the context in which you are using it. What seems to remain
constant is that quality documentation focuses on some aspect of learning--not just `what we
did.' It prompts questions and promotes conversations among children and adults that deepen
and extend learning.

There are three good reasons to document observations in school age care:
    1. to inform program planning
    2. to deepen our understanding of the children
    3. to make learning visible and share it with others.4

To Inform Curriculum Planning

Documentation makes children's and educators' thinking visible. It allows children and
educators to revisit it, reflect, uncover meaning and plan future directions. A program direction
often comes from a simple moment spent in conversation or play with a child: a moment which
makes us pause and reflect.

                       The Power of Ordinary Moments
                       Ordinary moments are the pages in the child's diary for the day. If we could
                       resist our temptation to record only the grand moments, we might find the
                       authentic child living in the in-between. If we could resist our temptation to
                       put the children on a stage, we might find the real work being done in the
                       wings. If we understood the great value in the ordinary moments, we might
                       be less inclined to have a marvellous finale for a long term project. We
                       appeal to educators everywhere to find the marvel in the mundane, to find
                       the power of the ordinary moment!5

                       (Forman, Hall & Berglund, 2001, p.52-3)

Before documenting, you should ask: Why am I documenting this? How is this significant? If
there is not a worthwhile reason, there may not be good reasons for recording.

There are different ways in which observations can be recorded, such as:
     note pads carried around by individuals
     sticky notes which may be gathered over a period of time and used for reflection
     clipboards
     group journals/communication books
     video recorder
     camera
     voice recorder
     poster/spreadsheet

The documentation taken for program planning can be recorded in one place by all educators
or it can be recorded individually (such as in notebooks) and brought together with the group
during discussion.

Notes just need to act as a visual reminder to stimulate thought and plans for planning.6

                   Pause to Reflect
                   Think of yourself in the classroom with young children. What might you want
                   to capture with documentation? Why? What methods do you think would best
                   capture these?

Reflective Thinking and Discussion to Deepen Our Understanding of the Children

Jotting down observations for later discussion helps educators, particularly new and
inexperienced ones, reflect and analyse, which can lead to deeper understanding for the
educators in the setting.

These observations may be recorded in a variety of ways, such as quick summaries on sticky
notes, captioned photographs, or entries in child portfolios. What is important, however, is the
fact that the learning has been made visible and the educators may share knowledge about this
and question and extend it further. True collaborative planning can occur when educators share
recorded observations. Once again there are a variety of ways to undertake this, but group
discussion during meeting time is an ideal way to promote this deeper understanding and
shared wisdom.

                     Figure 17.3: Some classrooms use tablets to capture photographs to document.8

Encourage all educators in your setting to question why children's play is significant. The
thinking is more complex and needs to go beyond just thinking `they are playing in the home
corner again'. Ask yourself why the children are choosing particular role-playing scenarios.
What inspired it? Who is involved? Does it reflect an event or experience in a child's life that
they are choosing to act out in play? Is someone trying to work through some emotions? Are
they undertaking family life lessons at school? What meaning are they getting from it? What
misinterpretations are there? How can I assist their learning in this area? How can we build on
this learning?

                 Figure 17.4: How might this family child care provider answer the questions just posed?9

Curtis and Carter (2008) suggest examining children's play from three angles:
     The child's story (Why are they playing this? What fascinates them about this? What is
         their previous experience? How can I encourage them to show more?)
     The learning story

     The educator's story (What excites you? What are you curious about? How can you find
         out more?)

During training, many educators have been encouraged to look at learning and developmental
aspects; however, to engage in deeper thinking, it is important to consider all three
perspectives.10

Making Learning Visible and Sharing it With Others

Educators may make some documentation visible to showcase the learning which has occurred
and to find ways to connect with others. When you document a child's story you give the child
a voice, and have a valuable tool for opening a meaningful discussion with that child's family. It
is also a means to engage with other educators, such as teachers in the child's school. Children
also love to go back and reflect on documented moments.

There are numerous ways to document for others to see. Some options include:

Wall Displays/Documentation Panels
Documenting and displaying the children's project work allows them to express, revisit, and
construct and reconstruct their feelings, ideas and understandings. Pictures of children engaged
in experiences; their words as they discuss what they are doing, feeling and thinking; and the
children's interpretation of experience through the visual media are displayed as a graphic
presentation of the dynamics of learning. Documented wall displays or documentation panels is
a Reggio Emilia concept which aims to place emphasis on the process, not just the end product.

    Figure 17.5: These documentation panels are in a classroom that is inspired by the Reggio Emilia approach.11

Making images of learning visible and being together in a group is a way to foster group identity
and learning. This type of documentation promotes conversation or deepens understanding
about one or more aspects of a learning experience. It can serve as a memory experience,
allowing children and adults to reflect on, evaluate, and build on their previous ideas. Sharing
documentation with learners can take many forms: a photocopied sheet of paper, words,
scrapbook pages, or a carefully arranged panel.

Learning Stories
A learning story is an alternative to other forms of observations. Margaret Carr developed this
narrative form of assessment to meet documentation requirements in New Zealand to
demonstrate knowledge and understanding of each child. In learning stories, educators capture
significant moments throughout the day with photos and then tell the story of the child's
learning (Carr, 2001).

                        Figure 17.6: This is a portion of a learning story about 11 month-old Caleb.12

Portfolios
A portfolio could document a child's development over time and highlight each child's learning
story. The portfolio belongs to the child and contains their work and their stories. Portfolios are
as individual as the children and they don't follow a prescribed pattern or format, they can just
evolve. School age care is a social setting and children's portfolios should contain photos and
stories of their friends, but be mindful of children and families who do not wish their photos to
be included in others' folders and find strategies to deal with this. Portfolios and scrapbooks are
long-term projects which can be undertaken jointly by the children and educators.

                       Vignette
                       The educators at our school age care decided they wanted to improve the
                       basic child files and develop new and improved individual child portfolios.
                       Some of the educators attended professional development sessions and
                       spoke to other services to get feedback on how others set up portfolios.

                       We looked at scrap books, display books, worksheets and folders. We liked
                       the idea of a display book into which we could easily slip pages and photos.
                       We also liked the idea of a scrap book where children could paste, draw,
                       collage and write and which they could make quite personal.
                       We considered developing a `contents page', but thought not all children
                       would be interested in completing all the experiences in the contents. We
                       also had a huge selection of worksheets including about me, family trees,
                       self-portraits, birthdays, special things, coat of arms, pets, friends and when
                       I grow up.

                       Educators decided that, rather than a standard format, they wanted each
                       child's portfolio to be unique to the individual. We wanted choice and
                       variety: written work, photos, typed stories, collage, artwork, scrapbooking.

                       As space is limited at our service, we wanted something that was easy to
                       store so that the children could easily find their portfolio without flicking
                       through or moving other children's portfolios.

                       The solution:
                            one display book per child
                            type each child's name on the labelling machine and stick it on the
                                spine of the display book
                            put the display books in alphabetical order in plastic tubs
                            provide each child with an notebook and place this in the front of
                                the display book to be used as a scrap book/journal
                            copy all the different sheets we have sourced and place each in a
                                plastic pocket in a folder so that children can `choose' what they
                                want to include in their portfolio
                            set up a folder for each child on the children's laptop so that
                                children's photos and learning stories can be stored and easily
                                accessed.

                                      Figure 17.8: The children could access their learning stories on the laptop.14

                       The result:
                            The children were so excited to have their own personal, individual
                                portfolios.
                            The children are able to easily access their portfolios.
                            The children can browse through the worksheet folder and choose
                                what they would like to do.
                            Some children have stuck records of other experiences they have
                                done at school age care in their
                            journals/scrap books.
                            Some children have shown their portfolios to their families.
                            Educators have gone through all our `old' photos and placed them in
                                the new child portfolios. Children and families have enjoyed
                                revisiting past experience at school age care by looking at the
                                photos from previous years.
                            Some children have sat down with educators to share their
                                portfolios and this has assisted educators to get to know the
                                children.

                       We decided that in the future we would:
                            encourage children to self-initiate what items they want to file in
                                their portfolio
                            print a list of all children that attend school age care. Each term,
                                check each child's portfolio and document what they have included.
                            encourage those that have not filed anything to complete a sheet or
                                learning story. Educators could place a photo in the child's portfolio
                                and then ask the child to tell the educator about that experience
                                and how they felt.
                            ask the children what they want to include in their portfolios. What
                                other resources can educators provide?

                       children motivated once the novelty wears off?15

                   Pause to Reflect
                   What are pros and cons to the different ways of documenting children
                   presented here? Why might an educator want to use each? What might be
                   some drawbacks?

                   What are other types of documentation to consider that weren't provided
                   here?

Children's Voice in Documentation

Educators can gain valuable insight by creating a culture of listening to and working
collaboratively with children. How do you know what the children in your care want from their
time in care?

There is a strong synergy between children's being and belonging and their active involvement
in democratic processes, and having an impact on what the environment, programs and
partnerships look, sound and feel like. The information you gather from children is integral to
the development of a program that meets their needs and interests.

         Figure 17.9: The discussion these school-aged children are having is a great way to get their insight.16

A range of ways can be used to gather and document children's voices in school age care
settings including:

     `All about me' sheets, where children and families document important information
         about themselves, such as likes, dislikes, hobbies and such

     setting time to have informal and formal discussions with children

     children interviewing other children
     suggestion boxes and surveys
     recording children's comments and thoughts about experiences as part of the

         evaluation process
     children's portfolios
     creating opportunities for joint planning, including setting up of the care environment
     photographing children and asking them to write about the experience
     children writing their own learning stories
     joint problem-solving opportunities.

Careful consideration needs to be given to children who may be non-verbal or have difficulty
expressing themselves to ensure their voices are heard in your care setting.17

Ethical Considerations

When documenting children's learning, educators must be respectful of the rights of children
and families. Permission must be sought from children and families before information is
collected and documented. Children and families must have the right to privacy, be informed
about how the information will be used and have a choice about participating.
MacNaughton, Smith and Lawrence suggest that to protect and enhance children's rights
through consultation with them, adults should ensure that children have:

     safe spaces in which to share their ideas without challenge or critique
     privacy: ask children for permission to document/ record what they say
     ownership of their ideas: ask children to display and/ or share their ideas and

         understandings with others
     appropriate equipment with which adults can care for children's work in ways that

         shows that their voice is important and respected

Some further questions to consider when thinking about documentation include:
     What does observing, documenting and evaluating look like in your setting?
     How do you involve children in the process?
     How do you involve families in the process?
     How do you know what is valued or expected for children within the family and cultural
         context?
     Do you assess children at an individual level? Do you think this is important in your
         setting?
     How do you define `regular' in the context of children who attend `regularly'?
     What methods or tools would you use?
     Does the documentation focus on learning, not just something you did?
     Does the documentation promote conversation or deepen understanding about some
         aspect of learning?

     What documentation do you collect which is appropriate to share/display?
     Does the documentation focus on outcomes for children and not just what the

         educators are doing?
     Does the documentation focus on the process as well as the product(s)?
     Does the documentation clearly communicate the aspects of learning you consider most

         important?
     Does your display documentation have a title?
     Is the documentation presented in a way that draws the viewer in?

   Figure 17.10: This documentation is down at the child's level in the space where building materials are stored.
                                   What might have been the educators' rationale for this?18

Documentation does not need to be repeated. A narrative story with photos can be shared at a
staff meeting, with input from all educators about links, questions, and where ideas may be
built upon. The story can then be displayed in the room (as a work in progress or perhaps with
an end product if there is one). The child can show people who are important to them the
documentation and it will open up discussion with families, children and educators. Once it has
been displayed for a period of time it can be filed away in the child's portfolio, where it can be
revisited at any time. It is also available if an assessor wants to look at it during a visit as well. So
this one piece of documentation serves many purposes.19

Assessment

Early childhood education programs should have outcomes that relate to their philosophy and
the objectives they have for children. As we examine the cycles of curriculum planning that we
have completed, we can use that data to further inform curriculum planning and assess
children's developmental progress.20

Assessing to Inform Curriculum Planning

The challenge for teachers and others who plan early childhood curriculum is to determine how
much assessment data to gather and how to use the resulting information. The key is to
organize a sustainable infrastructure that facilitates gathering meaningful information on every
child regularly and systematically.

    1. The best instructional assessment information is collected frequently and used
         continuously to inform curriculum and instruction decisions. Young children learn
         quickly, and regular monitoring of progress is necessary to document incremental
         improvements in skills and behaviors. Teachers and other adults are more likely to
         collect, interpret, and apply assessment data if the process is built into the daily
         classroom schedule and responsibilities.

    2. Assessment to inform and monitor instruction is most accurate if multiple sources are
         considered and multiple methods used. Because much of young children's learning and
         development occurs outside classrooms, it is important that competencies and progress
         are considered in all contexts and environments. The richest results are obtained when
         the perspectives of parents, caregivers, teachers, specialists, and children themselves
         are combined. Assessment instruments that gather information by observation and
         report, and include components for parents to report on children's developmental and
         academic progress, provide a helpful structure.

    3. Methods used to collect instructional assessment information should resemble ongoing
         instruction and the interactions of home, child care centers, and classrooms. There are
         valid concerns about the negative effects of testing on young children. One of the
         biggest advantages of assessment to inform and monitor instruction is that the process
         seldom necessitates individualized testing. Adults should be able to collect instructional
         assessment data using the same experiences designed to facilitate preschool learning in
         group activities, support parent/infant interactions at home, or provide instruction in
         primary classrooms.

    4. Assessment instruments should be criterion-referenced with items that reflect
         functional skills. Actual assessment items and administration procedures will vary
         depending on whether the focus is in development or early academics. Nonetheless,
         repeated measures of performance across a sequence of skills that reflects curriculum
         goals provides the best documentation of children's progress. Assessment to inform and
         monitor instruction is only as good as the curriculum and instruction young children
         receive. Assessing what we teach and teaching what we assess is essential for
         meaningful instructional assessment.

    5. Instructional and classroom assessment instruments should ideally reflect a logical
         teaching sequence. Assessments to inform and monitor instruction are most useful if
         items are organized in a sequence that reflects major skills in the curriculum, along with
         prior knowledge and/or prerequisite skills. This organization maps the curriculum for
         teachers and provides guidance for selection of subsequent learning goals.

    6. Instructional assessment instruments and procedures must be culturally and
         linguistically relevant. If the basic skills represented in early developmental and
         academic curricula are functional and appropriate for young children, instructional

451 | I n t r o d u c t i o n t o C u r r i c u l u m f o r E a r l y C h i l d h o o d E d u c a t i o n
         assessments have the advantage of being able to incorporate familiar materials, people,
         routines, and important events of a child's life. If using an assessment in which items are
         culturally inappropriate, it is vital that those are revised, and parents can suggest more
         familiar and appropriate materials and behaviors. It is especially important that English
         Language Learners not be penalized by materials or directions that confuse cultural and
         language differences with cognitive or academic delays.21

 Figure 17.11: If materials, tasks, interactions, or the language being used is unfamiliar to a child, caution must be
                                  taken before making judgments about their development.22

                   Pause to Reflect
                   What stood out to you about assessing to inform curriculum planning? What
                   did you most agree with? What got your thinking a bit more? Was there
                   anything you disagreed with or are unsure about?

Assessing Children

Each child and group of children will be at different points in their journey towards these
program's outcomes. Children come with a range of interests, understandings, family and
community experiences, developmental pathways, temperaments, and dispositions.

                                              temperament and dispositions at work.23

Educators use their observations of children and feedback from children and families, as well as
evaluations of learning and wellbeing to analyse and assess what children are able to do and
areas for further development or progression. Learning stories, educator reflections, journals
and child portfolios are strategies to not only document experiences, but also help educators
become more familiar with the outcomes as they make frequent links from their
documentation to the outcomes they have for children.24

Desired Results Developmental Profile

One tool that educators can use to assess the development of children is the Desired Results
Developmental Profile (DRDP). The DRDP is part of the Desired Results System developed by the
California Department of Education (CDE), Early Learning and Care Division to help improve
program quality in early care and education programs across California. The Desired Results
(DR) System was developed based on the following six Desired Results:

         Desired Results for Children
                  DR 1: Children are personally and socially competent.
                  DR 2: Children are effective learners.
                  DR 3: Children show physical and motor competence.
                  DR 4: Children are safe and healthy.

         Desired Results for Families
                  DR 5: Families support their child's learning and development.
                  DR 6: Families achieve their goals.

The DR system implemented by the CDE is a comprehensive approach that facilitates the
achievement of the Desired Results identified for children and families. California is one of the
very few states in the nation that has developed its own system designed specifically for
measuring child progress toward desired outcomes. The DRDP (2015) includes a Preschool View

and an Infant/Toddler view to provide a developmental continuum to assess children from birth
to kindergarten. And the DRDP-SA (2010) assesses children in school-age programs.

The DRDP (2015) (Level 5)
The DRDP (2015) is:

    · administered in natural settings through teacher observations, family observations, and
         examples of children's work

    · designed for use with all children from early infancy up to kindergarten entry, including
         children with Individualized Family Service Plans (IFSPs) and Individualized Education
         Programs (IEPs).

    · Is aligned with all volumes of the California's Infant/Toddler and Preschool Learning and
         Development Foundations, the Common Core Standards, and the Head Start Child
         Development and Early Learning Framework

    · takes into consideration the specific cultural and linguistic characteristics of California's
         diverse population of young children, with specific consideration for children who are
         young dual language learners

    · has the goal of ensuring that all children have the opportunity to demonstrate their
         knowledge and skills

There are 56 measures that are organized into the following eight domains in the DRDP (2015):
    · Approaches to Learning-Self-Regulation
    · Social and Emotional Development
    · Language and Literacy Development
    · English-Language Development (for dual language learners)
    · Cognition, including Math and Science
    · Physical Development-Health
    · History-Social Science
    · Visual and Performing Arts

development, descriptors for each developmental level, and examples of observable behavior
that show mastery at each developmental level. Educators determine the latest developmental
level the child has mastered and mark it on the rating scale.27

                   Pause to Reflect
                   Why might a program choose to use the DRDP to assess children? What are
                   benefits to this type of assessment for each child? What are some drawbacks
                   or challenges that educators might find when completing the DRDP multiple
                   times per year for each child?

Consideration in Early Childhood Assessment

Early childhood professionals are feeling ever-increasing pressure to document learning
outcomes in an era of standards, accountability, and achievement testing. In addition to
parents, we are the people responsible for the well-being of young children. Many
professionals have legitimate concerns about misuse of assessment practices and instruments,
and the potential for inequitable consequences for the children in our programs. It is important
to consider some implications of the unique nature of early development and learning:

     Complete and meaningful assessment in early childhood necessitates an understanding
         of family context, including getting to know family language and culture, gathering
         developmental information from parents, and conducting home visits with parent
         approval. This principle applies to all youngsters and families, but is especially critical for
         children whose families may not share the language or some of the economic
         advantages of the dominant culture. Understanding family expectations and experience
         places a child's behavior in context and can prevent harmful decisions that result from
         misinterpretation of assessment data (NAEYC, 2005).

     Younger children present some complex challenges and require flexible procedures for
         gathering meaningful and useful assessment information. Constitutional variables such
         as fatigue, hunger, illness, and temperament can easily overshadow the abilities of a
         young child. Time of day, setting, testing materials and other situational factors also
         affect performance. The younger a child, the more likely he or she is to fall asleep,
         become distressed, refuse to comply with directions, or be distracted from assessment
         activities. Professionals should be prepared to modify activities, explore alternative
         procedures, and/or reschedule rather than risk gathering faulty information that
         compromises assessment results.

  Figure 17.15: Children will not always cooperate with an educator's plans to gather accurate information about
                                                                  them.28

     Young children learn by doing, and demonstrate knowledge and skills through action-
         oriented activities. Authentic assessment of youngsters as they participate in daily
         activities, routines, and interactions generally produces the most valuable information
         for assessment. To the extent possible, assessment methods should allow for
         observation of young children engaged in spontaneous behaviors in familiar settings and
         with familiar people.

     More assessments and increased data do not necessarily result in better assessment
         information. Early childhood professionals should only gather information they need,
         and know ahead of time how they will use all the information collected. It is generally
         most desirable to identify a set of appropriate methods and instruments that provide
         necessary information, and refine the use of those procedures over time

     Some assessment instruments and procedures are better than others. Factors such as
         purpose, content, reliability and validity, efficiency, cost, and availability of professional
         development are all more important than appealing packaging and effective advertising.
         Of primary importance is the quality of information gathered and the decisions made as
         a result of assessment. Ultimately, whatever assessments we conduct should benefit the
         children, families, and programs we serve.29

                   Early Childhood Assessment to share with others, what would you want to be
                   sure people new about assessment of young children.

Working with Families

Documenting and assessment should be done collaboratively with families. Families are not just
a recipient of information from educators. Parents and other family members bring a broad
array of information, feelings, beliefs, and expectations relevant to the child's experience in the
program, including curriculum:

    · the child's temperament, health history, and behavior at home
    · family expectations, fears, and hopes about the child's success or failure
    · culturally-rooted beliefs about child-rearing
    · parents' experiences of school and beliefs about their role in relation to professionals
    · parents' sense of control and authority, and other personal and familial influences

Educators have unique information and perspective that they can share with families. Program
staff bring their own knowledge, beliefs, and attitudes to their work with families:

    · developmental and educational information about the child based on observation and
         assessment

    · information about the child's performance in the program
    · information about the curriculum and learning goals for the child
    · knowledge about the child's next educational environment
    · staffs' own unique personality and temperament, family history, and culture
    · their job description, agency policies, and the supervision they receive
    · their own training, experience, and professional philosophy

The goal of sharing information with parents about their child is not to make parents do what
program staff think needs to be done, nor to see the child as staff do. Instead this process helps
program staff to see the child as the parents do. This expands their understanding of the child
and the family, so that they can adjust teaching and family support accordingly. When program
staff can see the child as parents do, parents know that they can trust them. As a result, they
are more likely to be open to program staff perspectives about their child. Information about
the child will more effectively flow, from parents to staff, and staff to parents. Then, parents
too will have richer information about their child to add to their support of their child's learning
and development at home.

Respectfully sharing these different perspectives is an essential step toward healthy learning
environments for children. Regular and purposeful supervision can help program staff recognize
when their own perspectives are based upon personal reactions, biases, and cultures, and guide
them to effective communication strategies.30

                   What happens when parents and staff have very different perspectives on a
                   child?

Conclusion

Evaluating children in early childhood education settings is an ongoing process of using
observations and other evidence to make judgements about children's development and
learning. The purpose for regular evaluation through a process of documentation and
assessment is to enable responsive, well thought out long-term and short-term planning to
promote the optimal growth, development, and learning for all children in the program.

Approaches to evaluation that are culturally and linguistically relevant and responsive to the
social, physical and intellectual capabilities will acknowledge children's abilities and strengths,
and allow them to demonstrate competence. Evaluation, when undertaken in collaboration
with children can support and empower them to see themselves as capable and foster
independence and initiative.

When educators reflect on their role in children's lives they reflect on their own views and
understandings of theory, research and practice to focus on:

     the experiences and environments they provide and how that links to the intended
         outcomes

     the extent to which they know and value the culturally specific knowledge about
         children that is embedded within the community in which they are working

     each child's opportunities in the context of their families, drawing family perspectives,
         understandings, experiences and expectations

     the opportunities which build on what children already know and what they bring to the
         school age care setting

     evidence that the experiences offered are inclusive of all children and culturally
         appropriate

     not making assumptions about children's development or setting lower expectations for
         some children because of unacknowledged biases

     incorporating pedagogical practices that reflect knowledge of diverse perspectives and
         contribute to children's wellbeing and successful learning

     whether there are sufficiently challenging experiences for all children
     the evidence that demonstrates children feel safe and secure, and are engaged
     how they can expand the range of ways they debrief and reflect to make evaluation

         richer and more useful.

                   Figure 17.17: The process of evaluation completes the cycle of curriculum planning.32

This process of reflective evaluation can lead to quality early childhood education programming
that supports the optimal development of each child it provides care and education for.33
