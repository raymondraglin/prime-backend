    ACADEMIC LITERACIES:
   CASE STUDIES TOWARDS
TRANSFORMATIVE PRACTICE
PERSPECTIVES ON WRITING
Series Editor, Susan H. McLeod and Rich Rice

The Perspectives on Writing series addresses writing studies in a broad sense. Consis-
tent with the wide ranging approaches characteristic of teaching and scholarship in
writing across the curriculum, the series presents works that take divergent perspec-
tives on working as a writer, teaching writing, administering writing programs, and
studying writing in its various forms.

INTERNATIONAL EXCHANGES ON THE STUDY OF WRITING
Series Editors, Terry Myers Zawacki, Magnus Gustafsson, and Joan Mullin

The International Exchanges on the Study of Writing Series publishes book-length
manuscripts that address worldwide perspectives on writing, writers, teaching with
writing, and scholarly writing practices, specifically those that draw on scholarship
across national and disciplinary borders to challenge parochial understandings of
all of the above. The series aims to examine writing activities in 21st-century con-
texts, particularly how they are informed by globalization, national identity, social
networking, and increased cross-cultural communication and awareness. As such,
the series strives to investigate how both the local and the international inform
writing research and the facilitation of writing development.

The WAC Clearinghouse and Parlor Press are collaborating so that books in these
series will be widely available through free digital distribution and low-cost print
editions. The publishers and the series editors are teachers and researchers of writ-
ing, committed to the principle that knowledge should freely circulate. We see the
opportunities that new technologies have for further democratizing knowledge. And
we see that to share the power of writing is to share the means for all to articulate
their needs, interest, and learning into the great experiment of literacy.

    ACADEMIC LITERACIES:
   CASE STUDIES TOWARDS
TRANSFORMATIVE PRACTICE
INTRODUCTION

      Theresa Lillis, Kathy Harrington, Mary R. Lea and Sally Mitchell

WHY THIS BOOK?

    The idea for this book arose from the many conversations over the years be-
tween researchers and practitioners about what it means to adopt, or perhaps more
accurately as reflected in the title of this book to work with an "Academic Literacies"
approach to writing, and more broadly language and literacy, in contemporary
higher education. Whilst not necessarily distinct people or groups, a gap in under-
standings between researchers (those with a specific role in carrying out research
about academic writing and reading) and practitioners (those with a specific role in
working with students in their academic writing, such as teachers, curriculum de-
signers, policy makers and academic administrators) often seems to be in evidence.
The impetus to take forward a project that would bring together researchers, practi-
tioners and researcher-practitioners to illustrate the specific ways in which they/we
engage in and develop ideas from Academic Literacies came from the 2010 inter-
national Writing Development in Higher Education conference, London, following a
plenary workshop on "Academic Literacies" by a group of researcher-practitioners,
Sally Baker, Lynn Coleman, Theresa Lillis, Lucy Rai, and Jackie Tuck (http://www.
writenow.ac.uk/news-events/wdhe-conference-2010). Three questions arising from
this plenary were debated and are reflected in the framing and contributions of this
book:

      1. What does working with Academic Literacies mean "in practice"?
      2. How can the transformative approach argued for in Academic Literacies'

         theorizing be instantiated in practice(s)?
      3. In developing a transformative approach, how might work in Academic

         Literacies usefully draw on and engage with other approaches to writing?

    Exactly how, when and in which specific contexts--geographical, institutional,
disciplinary, stage of study--particular elements of Academic Literacies are valu-
able for developing a transformative approach to writing and reading in the acad-
emy were (and are) questions we all felt needed more consideration. This book is
intended as a contribution to such a development, bringing together ideas, peda-
gogic case studies and critical commentaries from teacher-researchers working in
a range of contexts, from undergraduate to postgraduate levels across a range of
disciplines--including natural and social sciences--and a number of geopolitical

regions--Australia, Brazil, Canada, Catalonia, Finland, France, Ireland, Portugal,
South Africa, United Kingdom, United States. While some contributions are from
within specific institutionally "writing designated" spaces (a well-known example
being US Composition), many others engage with the question of writing from
within disciplinary spaces. Contributions focus on issues such as: How to make
language and writing visible in meaningful ways in disciplinary activity, including
in areas as diverse as engineering, geography, nursing, natural sciences, graphic
design, business studies and photojournalism? How can teachers across all disci-
plinary areas meaningfully engage with writing? How can and do writing/language
specialists work collaboratively with disciplinary specialists? How can a wider range
of semiotic resources including modes, media and genres fruitfully serve academic
meaning and knowledge making? What kinds of writing-specific designated spaces
do we need and how can these be facilitated, for example through postgraduate
writing circles and one-to-one language/writing tutorials? How can theory and
practice from Academic Literacies be used to open up debate about writing and
language at institutional and policy levels?

WHAT IS ACADEMIC LITERACIES?

    What is the "Academic Literacies" that contributors are seeking to work with in
this collection? While acknowledging that the phrase is used in a number of ways
(see Theresa Lillis & Mary Scott, 2007), here we briefly set out the particular tradi-
tion we are referring to and engaging with.

    "Academic Literacies" is a critical approach to the researching and teaching of
writing and literacy and to the role and potential of these activities for individual
meaning making and academic knowledge construction in higher education. In
broad terms, "Academic Literacies" draws attention to the importance, for re-
search and pedagogy, of adopting socially situated accounts of writing and text
production. It also draws attention to the ways in which power and identity (at the
levels of student, teacher, institution, discipline) are inscribed in literacy practices,
and the need to explore the possibilities for adopting transformative approaches
to academic writing, which includes working to extend the range of semiotic re-
sources--linguistic, rhetorical, technological--that are legitimized in the academy
of the twenty-first century. Key areas of research have included: the nature of
academic writing from the perspective of student-writers; the impact of power re-
lations on student writing; the contested nature of academic writing conventions;
the centrality of identity and identification in academic writing; academic writ-
ing as ideologically inscribed knowledge construction (for overviews see Theresa
Lillis & Mary Scott, 2007; David Russell et al., 2009; Jackie Tuck, 2012a; Joan
Turner, 2011). More recent work has continued with a focus on student writing
but also extended into areas such as the everyday writing of academics (Mary Lea

& Barry Stierer, 2009), disciplinary teachers' perspectives on their engagement
with students' writing (Tuck, 2012b), academic writing for publication (Theresa
Lillis & Mary Jane Curry, 2010) and digitally mediated literacy practices inside
and outside the academy (Lynn Coleman, 2012; Mary Lea & Sylvia Jones, 2011;
Robin Goodfellow & Mary Lea, 2013). The approach has a particularly vigorous
research base in the United Kingdom and South Africa (see for example, Awena
Carter et al. (Eds.), 2009; Roz Ivanic, 1998; Cecilia Jacobs, 2010; Carys Jones et
al., 1999; Mary Lea, 2005; Mary Lea & Barry Stierer (Eds.), 2000; Mary Lea &
Brian Street, 1998; Theresa Lillis, 1997, 2001, 2003; Lillis & Scott (Eds.), 2007;
Lucia Thesen & Linda Cooper, 2013; Lucia Thesen & Ermien van Pletzen, 2006)
and has strong connections/resonances with critical arguments found in a number
of pedagogical and theoretical traditions across a range of national contexts, for
example, critical EAP (Sarah Benesch, 2001; Nigel Harwood & Gregory Hadley,
2004), "basic writing" (e.g., Bruce Horner & Min-Zhan Lu, 1999), didactique or
littéracies universitaires (Isabelle Delcambre & Christiane Donahue, 2011), writ-
ing across the curriculum and writing in the disciplines, WAC and WiD (e.g.,
Charles Bazerman et al., 2005; Donna LeCourt, 1996; David Russell, 2001) and
multilingual academic writing (e.g., Suresh Canagarajah, 2002). (See Reflections
1, 3, 4, 6 this volume).

    There are strong points of convergence in the ways in which researchers and
teachers define or co-opt the notion "Academic Literacies" in their/our research and
practice, as well as considerable points of debate and areas in need of development.
A core point of convergence (and indeed the imperative driving much research and
pedagogy) is a deep and consistent concern with the limitations of much official dis-
course on language and literacy in a rapidly changing higher education world. This
includes the prevailing deficit approach to language, literacy, and indeed students,
whereby the emphasis tends overwhelmingly to be on what student writers don't or
can't do in academic writing rather than on what they can (or would like to), and
where--even whilst discourses of diversity and internationalization populate uni-
versity mission statements globally--"variety" of linguistic, semiotic and rhetorical
student repertoires tends to be viewed as "a problem rather than resource" (Brian
Street, 1999, p. 198). A core area of debate is how best to draw and act on Academic
Literacies' critiques of contemporary approaches to language and literacy, in particu-
lar, how to design policy, curriculum, assessment and pedagogy which engage with a
commitment to "transformation"--rather than solely induction or reproduction--
and indeed, to examining what we understand by "transformation" in contemporary
higher education. The goal of this book is to focus explicitly on how practitioner-re-
searchers (mainly teachers) are grappling to theorize and develop "transformation"
in their/our practice, within the constraints and demands of specific disciplines and
institutions within a range of higher education systems globally, each of which have
their specific social and geopolitical histories.

WHERE DOES "ACADEMIC LITERACIES" COME FROM?

    The use of the phrase "Academic Literacies" to signal a critical and social prac-
tice perspective on writing and reading in the academy seems to have been forged
out of conversations taking place at different times and in different places by people
with similar concerns. From the late 1980s onwards, the term was regularly used,
for example, at monthly Academic Literacies sessions at the Institute of Education,
London, chaired by Mary Scott--and the related extensive international mail and
discussion list--and in ongoing discussions by scholars in South Africa, such as
Lucia Thesen and Cecilia Jacobs. The principles underpinning what would come
to be labelled as "Academic Literacies" were also evident in some innovative lan-
guage pedagogy and policy work without the use of this label: for example, in a UK
polytechnic in 1989, which subsequently became a "new" university,1 the Language
Policy, written by Phyllis Creme, was designed to both recognize and value diversity
and the language practices that students brought with them to the university (see
Phyllis Creme & MaryLea, 1999). More widely at the time, the response of many
of the new universities to both their students and their attempts to compete with
other high status institutions was to develop targeted study skills provision. This
frequently included "fixing" student writers with generic approaches, focused on
surface features of form, grammar, punctuation, spelling etc.--what Lea and Street
in their 1998 paper termed the "study skills" model. However, many practitioners
working directly with student writers were increasingly finding these approaches
unsatisfactory when faced with actual students completing real assignments.

    In the context of policies of access and widening participation in higher educa-
tion, "Academic Literacies" came to be used to challenge the strongly deficit orien-
tation towards the writing (and reading) of students, in particular of students who
were the first generation in their families and communities to go into higher educa-
tion and to signal the need for a more questioning and critical stance towards what
students were doing and meaning in their academic writing. Available linguistic,
theoretical and pedagogic frames just did not seem to articulate or help account for
the experiences and practices of the student-writers. Lillis, for example, was struck
that student-writers often did not use discourses that their academic teachers were
expecting, not because they didn't know these, but because they were not what they
wanted to use, to mean, to be (Lillis, 2001). Key writers offering ways of articulat-
ing such phenomena were Norman Fairclough (1992) and other critical discourse
analysts (Romy Clark & Roz Ivanic, 1991). In particular, Roz Ivanic used critical
discourse analysis (CDA) to explore students' practices and texts, foregrounding
the question of identity (1998). Teacher-researchers in the United Kingdom and
in other parts of the world grappled with finding a frame that would enable them
to explore issues that were often treated as background or secondary--where the
job of the teaching discipline-based academic writing, if visible at all, was often

construed as teaching conventions (as if these were uncontested) that students must
adopt (rather than critically engage with).

    Of course the work that is central to articulating an "Academic Literacies" ori-
entation--and widely cited across this book--is the 1998 paper by Lea and Street.
In this paper they outlined three ways or "models" to articulate different approaches
to student writing in the academy which they described in terms of "skills," "social-
ization," and "academic literacies." Whereas `"study skills" was primarily concerned
with mastery of the surface features of texts, "academic socialization" pointed to the
acculturation of students into the discourses and genres of particular disciplines as
an essential prerequisite for becoming a successful writer. Lea and Street saw "ac-
ademic literacies" as subsuming many of the features of the other two, illustrating
that the three models were not mutually exclusive. Nevertheless, they claimed that
the academic literacies model was best able to take account of the nature of student
writing in relation to institutional practices, power relations and identities, there-
fore offering a lens on meaning making that the other two models failed to provide.

    An important point to signal about this 1998 article was that Lea and Street
were adamant that it should speak to both practitioners and researchers--of writ-
ing, language and literacy--and chose their target journal carefully. However, get-
ting the article published was not without its challenges. They had to persuade the
editor and reviewers that their approach "counted" as research in higher education
and that the literacies as social practice frame was legitimate in a context dominated
by psychological models of student learning. Its theorized and practitioner-focused
orientation is still at the heart of the field that we call Academic Literacies although
individual researchers and practitioners occupy different institutional positions and
orientations. Some are centrally concerned with finding ways of providing imme-
diate support to students, often in demanding institutional settings against a back-
drop of institutional accountability; others are endeavouring to engage critically
and make visible issues of power and control over knowledge and meaning making;
and many are seeking to do both, as evidenced in the contributions to this volume.

    So what was it that the framing and the phrasing "academic literacies"--that
was definitely in the air but was honed in Lea and Street's 1998 paper--seemed
to be offering? It provided a name for a whole cluster of research and pedagogic
interests and concerns that many were grappling to articulate and it anchored con-
cerns around academic writing to a larger scholarly project relating to literacy more
generally (New Literacy Studies, e.g., David Barton & Mary Hamilton, 1998; Da-
vid Barton & Uta Papen, 2010; James Gee, 2007; Mary Hamilton, 2001; Mastin
Prinsloo & Mignonne Breier, 1996). Furthermore, the ethnographic impulse in
New Literacy Studies in particular--paying particular attention to emic perspec-
tives--connected strongly with progressive voices in adult education and access
movements and thus captured the intellectual imagination of many educators and
language/writing researchers both in the UK and other national contexts. Thus

                                                                                                       7
Lillis, Harrington, Lea and Mitchell

whilst the phrase `academic literacy' and even the plural form were in use in some
contexts,2 the publication of the work by Lea and Street fulfilled three important
scholarly functions in configuring the field:

      1. It helped generate an intellectual space for the many scholars who were
         dissatisfied with dominant pedagogical and institutional approaches to
         student writing.

      2. By indexing "New Literacy Studies" and Street's robust critique of
         "autonomous" approaches to literacy, it opened up routes of intellectual
         inquiry that differed from the strongly "textualist" (Bruce Horner, 1999)
         and normative approaches available with which many scholars were also
         dissatisfied (across a number of traditions, such as English for Academic
         Purposes and Systemic Functional Linguistics).

      3. It helped create a theoretically and empirically robust position from
         which to challenge the prevailing ideology of deficit which centered on
         what students could not do (rather than what they could) and also shifted
         attention towards disciplinary and institutional practices.3

WHAT DOES "TRANSFORMATION" MEAN IN ACADEMIC
LITERACIES?

    At the heart of an Academic Literacies approach is a concern with "transforma-
tion" and the "transformative." But what does this mean? How is "transformation"
to be understood, and what does it look like when using an Academic Literacies
lens to investigate and design writing practices in the academy? In this section, the
book's editors each offer a perspective on these questions--but without a desire to
close them down. We recognize that individual practitioner-researchers will de-
fine and work with the notion of transformation somewhat differently depending
on their/our particular institutional and/or disciplinary positions and the specific
questions they/we ask. An examination and elucidation of this contextual diversity
is, indeed, one of the main aims of this volume.

Theresa Lillis: Towards Transformative Design

    As a teacher, researcher and participant in contemporary academia I am involved
in both working with(in) and against powerful conventions for meaning making
and knowledge construction. I am committed to exploring what it is that prevail-
ing academic conventions for meaning making have to offer--and to whom--and
what it is they constrain or restrict. My concern (based on many years of teaching
and researching) is that we--as teachers, researchers, writers, policy makers--may
often adopt prevailing conventions, including those surrounding which specific

8
                                                                                                      Introduction

semiotic practices are valued, simply because they have become routinised rather
than because they offer meaningful, valid and creative resources for knowledge
production, evaluation and participation in the contemporary world. The chal-
lenge, I think we all face, is to become aware of the vast array of semiotic resources
potentially available to us and others (however we construe "us" and "others"--and
in positions of both producers and receivers/evaluators) and to explore how these
can be harnessed for meaning and knowledge making.

    As part of this broader concern with conventions, why is transformation an im-
portant notion to discuss? In an opening paper of a Special Issue on Academic Lit-
eracies in the Journal of Applied Linguistics Mary Scott and I set out what we saw as
a map of the field of "Academic Literacies" in its current state as well as offering a
position statement on what the field could be, some ten years after Lea and Street's
influential 1998 paper. In addition to pointing to the key epistemological framing
of "Ac Lits"--notably a social practice approach to language and literacy with a
particular emphasis on ethnography as a research methodology--we also pointed to
the ideological orientation of Ac Lits as being one of transformation. In broad terms,
we made a contrast between two common stances (in research and pedagogy): those
which could be characterized as "normative" and those that could be characterized
as "transformative". Normative stances and approaches to writing and literacy tend
to work within a framework which raises questions about writing and literacy in the
following terms: What is the nature of the writing and literacy required--at the level
of genre, grammar, style, rhetoric? How can these most usefully be researched (made
visible) and taught? A normative stance is often considered essential when seeking to
induct people into the literacy practices that have become legitimized in academia
to the extent that in order for people to participate in existing academic practices,
these practices have to be taught and literally "practised". However, we argued that
Ac Lits has also encouraged a transformative stance towards writing and literacy
which foregrounds additional questions such as: how have particular conventions
become legitimized--and what might alternatives be? To what extent do they serve
knowledge making--and are other ways of making knowledge, and other kinds of
knowledge/knowing possible? Whose epistemological and ideological interests and
desires do these reflect and enable--and whose interests and desires may be being
excluded?

    As transformation/transformative is a key theme in this book, I'd like to quote
what Mary Scott and I wrote here:

         The ideological stance toward the object of study in what we
         are calling "academic literacies" research can be described as
         explicitly transformative rather than normative. A normative
         approach evident for example in much EAP work can be sum-
         marized as resting on the educational myths that Kress (2007)

                                                                                                       9
Lillis, Harrington, Lea and Mitchell

         describes: the homogeneity of the student population, the
         stability of disciplines, and the unidirectionality of the teach-
         er-student relation. Consonant with these myths is an interest
         to "identify and induct": the emphasis is on identifying academ-
         ic conventions--at one or more levels of grammar, discourse
         or rhetorical structure or genre--and on (or with a view to)
         exploring how students might be taught to become proficient or
         "expert" and developing materials on that basis (for examples,
         see Flowerdew, 2000; Swales & Feak, 2004). A transformative
         approach in contrast involves an interest in such questions
         but in addition is concerned with: a) locating such conven-
         tions in relation to specific and contested traditions of knowl-
         edge making; b) eliciting the perspectives of writers (whether
         students or professionals) on the ways in which such conven-
         tions impinge on their meaning making; c) exploring alternative
         ways of meaning making in academia, not least by considering
         the resources that (student) writers bring to the academy as
         legitimate tools for meaning making. (Lillis & Scott 2007, p.
         12-13, emphasis added)

A key point we were seeking to make was that the normative stance is the de-
fault position in much practice in academia (pedagogy and policy) and a necessary
stance in order to participate (and enable participation) successfully in academic
institutions as currently configured. However we also argued that there was a con-
siderable amount of additional work to be done--thinking, research, engagement
and reflection on practice--in order to harness the full range of semiotic practices
to intellectual labour.

    One conceptual way forward is to acknowledge the importance of critique which
is strong in Academic Literacies research (for example the critique of the domi-
nant deficit discourse on writing, the critique of an autonomous approach--Street
(1984)--to language and literacy, the concern with issues of power and identity in
academic writing) but at the same time to work with the notion of design. Gun-
ther Kress usefully offers "design" as an epistemological and ideological move which
builds on critique but moves beyond it:

         Design rests on a chain of processes of which critique is one: it
         can, however, no longer be the focal one, or be the major goal
         of textual practices. Critique leaves the initial definition of the
         domain of analysis to the past, to past production. (Kress, 2000,
         p. 160)

    The question of design--or what I am referring to as "transformative design" in

10

order to signal the critical basis for Kress's notion--has been explored by colleagues
and myself, Lillis (2003, 2006) and Lea (2004) in specific relation to the relevance
and use of Academic Literacies to practice in higher education but we have both
pointed to the need for considerably more work to be done. For this book, the four
editors came together to begin to engage in this design work, each of us committed
to the importance of interrogating possibilities for transformation and interested
in exploring the potential of "Ac Lits" in designing pedagogy and policy and all
aware that working towards transformative design in higher education is a large
and challenging project, possible only through extensive collaboration. We see this
collection as reflecting examples of transformative design and as therefore a part of
this larger collaborative project.

Kathy Harrington: Border Crossing

    My interest in transformation, how I think about and understand what this
might mean in the context of Academic Literacies, stems from the position I oc-
cupy as a relative newcomer to the field, coming in from the outside and bringing
with me questions and perspectives from other domains of knowledge, experience
and work. In her book on encounters between science and other disciplinary fields
in nineteenth century Britain, Gillian Beer (1996) suggests that "ideas cannot sur-
vive long lodged within a single domain. They need the traffic of the apparent-
ly inappropriate audience as well as the tight group of co-workers if they are to
thrive and generate further thinking" (p. 1). I have been intrigued and stimulated
by Beer's ideas since coming across her work while writing my PhD in Victorian
Studies in the late 1990s. What happens, I have been wondering more recently,
when ideas harvested in other domains are trafficked into the field of Academic
Literacies? What transformation might become possible in my own thinking and
practice, particularly in my role as a teacher on academic and professional develop-
ment programmes for other teachers in the academy?

    I am interested in boundaries, how and why edges lie where they do, how we
demarcate and decide what's inside and what's outside, and the transformative, or
restrictive, possibilities this field mapping allows. I am interested in the potential
for transformation as located within self-understandings, in the perceptions we
have of ourselves as students and as teachers, and in the fluidity of the relationship
between these identities. I am interested in the connection between transformation
and being able to take the risk of not knowing whether the destination will be bet-
ter than what has been left behind. None of these questions is specifically about,
or originates from my engagement with, writing practices in the academy. They
come from outside, from my personal history and experiences of border crossings,
and from other fields--from perspectives gleaned from psychoanalysis and group
analysis, group relations and open systems theory.

                                                                                                      11
Lillis, Harrington, Lea and Mitchell

    So, what does this mean in practice? What "further thinking" do these perspec-
tives and questions generate in the context of Academic Literacies? In her appli-
cation of open systems theory to the study of organizations, Vega Zagier Roberts
notes that "a living organism can survive only by exchanging materials with its
environment, that is, by being an open system" (1994, p. 28). In keeping something
alive, boundaries are important. They can provide a helpful frame and hold a space
within which something can live and flourish, such as a research or teaching com-
munity, ideas and people. But if drawn too tightly, boundaries can isolate and close
down dialogue and growth. Boundary setting happens both from within and out-
side a field, and there are gains to be had by questioning which interests are being
served by these processes. Where are the lines around Academic Literacies being
drawn, by whom, and why? The rich and various contributions in this volume at-
test, I think, to the inspiring fecundity of thought and practice that comes of ques-
tioning and constantly re-thinking where the edges of the field might lie, and how
permeable, and to which outside influences, they might most vitally remain open.

    There is another sense in which working with a notion of boundaries informs
my sense of the transformative potential of Academic Literacies. Boundaries can
delineate an intellectual and professional field, but also an internal space, where
one's own norms and assumptions--about the nature of writing and learning, about
oneself as a teacher/authority and about the other/student--and one's own experi-
ences of difference, inequality and power situated in specific contexts and relation-
ships, can be brought to the surface and worked with. In my understanding, this
questioning, self-reflective attitude and challenging work of seeing and confronting
one's own assumptions is integral to the practice of teaching as informed by an
Academic Literacies approach--and it is itself transformative, and empowering, for
both teachers and students.

    Transformation as I see it, and as distinguished from induction or reproduc-
tion, is essentially about this increased level of awareness. Whether the focus of a
particular piece of work is on students, teachers, resources, institutional culture,
or classroom practices, what is transformed through a "transformative approach"
is fundamentally a way of seeing and being--and in particular, seeing and being
with respect to one's own contribution to variously perpetuating, subverting and
re-writing exclusionary narratives of power and identity inscribed in the practices
and discourses of "academic writing". This is about daring to be curious, to ask
difficult questions and to be honest about the answers. For example, it might be
interesting to ask how requiring the "submission" of written work--and how one's
own attitudes to the authority and power of the teacher in this relationship--influ-
ences the nature of the knowledge it is possible to create within formal writing and
assessment processes. From a place of self-awareness, it becomes possible to step
back, imagine and actually begin to do things differently--more creatively, more
thoughtfully, and more radically. Rather than set the "transformative' against the

12
                                                                                                      Introduction

"normative, " as has sometimes been implied, it is through this critical process of
nurturing transformation in self-understandings, uncertainties and identifications
as teachers in higher education that I believe the normative has the potential to enable
the transformative.

    Returning to the notion of an open system, my sense of the transformative po-
tential of Academic Literacies lies in being able to delineate living, creative yet
protected spaces--within the curriculum and in institutional structures, in the in-
teractions and relationships between and among students and teachers, in academ-
ic professional development programmes where discussions about assessment and
literacy inevitably bring deficit and autonomous models of student writing to the
surface, and, perhaps most importantly, in ourselves--where diverse and often con-
flicting beliefs, values and knowledges about writing in the academy can be made
available for further thinking and ongoing transformation.

Mary R. Lea: Heuristic Thinking, Institutions
and Transformational Possibilities

    My interest has always been around the contested nature of textual practice.
The ethnographic perspective--which permeates our Introduction and many con-
tributions in this book--has been crucial here. It has helped me to develop my
earlier work, which was concerned with making visible the detail of encounters
between students and teachers around meaning making, towards the consideration
of broader institutional perspectives.

    So what do I mean by transformation when I am thinking institutionally? As I
argued in Lea (2004), I believe that we need to attend to the workings of academic
literacy practices, more widely, rather than focus our attention solely on students
who may appear marginalized from the dominant practices and cultures of the
academy. I think there is a danger that if we concentrate our attention on the latter
it can mask the implications of academic literacies research and practice for laying
bare the ways in which textual practices become instantiated through institutional
processes and procedures. In fact, many of the chapters in this volume attest to
how broader institutional practices are implicated in many day-to-day encoun-
ters around writing, assessment and feedback between students and their teachers.
Deficit views of student writing still hold significant sway in higher education de-
spite the extensive body of work in both academic literacies and other traditions of
writing research which offers evidence to the contrary. My belief is that, in order to
counter these deficit stances, we need to be interrogating practice at both an insti-
tutional and sectoral level, since the complexity and diversity of textual practices are
evident across the institution and not merely in the practices of writing students.
This might help us also to deal with the ongoing tension that is evident between
conceptualizing "academic literacies as a heuristic" and more normative approaches

                                                                                                      13

associated with "teaching academic literacies". As a heuristic--one that is in prog-
ress as illustrated in this book--Academic Literacies has illuminated and helped me
to understand more about the contested space of knowledge making and to build
on this in practical ways in a range of practice settings in higher education. In con-
trast, I see the normative approach as more orientated towards inducting students
into academic and disciplinary writing conventions, what Brian Street and I have
referred to as "academic socialization". Although in some ways these may appear
to be rather crude distinctions, I have found them invaluable when it comes to ex-
amining institutional practice within the changing landscape of higher education.
Indeed, they emerged for us from our own research.

    The development of academic literacies as a field of study in the early 1990s re-
flected a very different landscape from that which is in evidence today. The last de-
cade has seen a combination of both structural and technological change, reflected
in emergent textual practices around teaching and learning. Potentially these signal
a breaking down of old boundaries and opening up of new spaces for meaning
making in higher education. In this regard, my own curiosity about writing and
academic professional practice (Lea, 2012; Lea & Stierer, 2009) was sparked by
my teaching role in academic and professional development with Open University
teachers. This signaled to me how different experiences of writing, values about
writing in relation to academic identity and the models of writing associated with
specific professional fields all suggest a contested space for teachers' own writing
and their students' writing (see Lea, 2012; Tuck, 2013).

    When Brian and I undertook the research for our 1998 paper, the use of dig-
ital technologies was still in its infancy. As these have gained centre stage, practi-
tioners and researchers--including myself--committed to an academic literacies
orientation in their work have begun to explore the relationship between litera-
cies and technologies (Robin Goodfellow & Lea, 2007; Bronwyn Williams 2009;
Goodfellow & Lea, 2013; Lea & Jones, 2011; Colleen McKenna, 2012; Bronwyn
Williams, 2009). Williams (2013) discusses how certain virtual learning environ-
ments reinforce conservative views of knowledge-making practices, for example
where the software and design of the online teaching environment privileges print
and makes it difficult for students to engage in multi-modal text making. Colleen
McKenna and Jane Hughes (2013) take a literacies lens to explore what technol-
ogies do to writing practices, in particular the ubiquitous, institutional use of
plagiarism detection software and how this is reframing the concept of plagiarism
for students and their teachers, taking them away from useful discussions, in dis-
ciplinary learning contexts, around attribution and knowledge-making practices.
Research I carried out with Sylvia Jones offered an alternative to the representation
of students as "digital natives" (Marc Prensky, 2001), purportedly comfortable on-
line but unable to engage in more conventional study practices, such as academic
reading and writing. Our project explored this issue through a literacies lens, il-

14
                                                                                                      Introduction

lustrating the complex interrelationship between literacies and technologies with
the potential to disrupt traditional academic literacy practices. We argued that in
order to understand the changes that are taking place for learners in today's higher
education more attention needs to be paid to textual practice around learning and
less upon the technologies themselves and their applications. While on the one
hand students accessed online resources and engaged in a wide range of digital and
print-based textual practices, on the other we found that assignment rubrics did
not generally reflect or engage with the rhetorical complexity of these practices.
This meant that the opportunity for teachers to work explicitly with the processes
of meaning making with their students was being missed. These examples signal
to me the intransigent dominance of normative perspectives towards learning and
literacies in a changing landscape and, therefore, the pressing need to think about
transformation institutionally if we are going to work across the myriad nature of
textual practices emerging in today's higher education.

Sally Mitchell: Open-ended Transformation:
Ethnographic Lens and a Suspicious Tendency

    In my experience transformation is not to be understood as a finished state,
something that is fully achieved, rather it is an inclination towards envisaging alter-
native understandings of, and actions within any particular context. In this sense
transformation is set against the normative and the status quo. And there are many
things within educational settings which can become the object of transformative
thinking. Clifford Geertz lists some of them when he calls for an "ethnography of
thought, " a consideration of thought's "muscular matters":

         ... translation, how meaning gets moved, or does not, reasonably
         intact from one sort of discourse to the next; about intersubjec-
         tivity, how separate individuals come to conceive, or do not, rea-
         sonably similar things; about how thought frames change (revolu-
         tions and all that), how thought provinces are demarcated ("today
         we have naming of fields"), how thought norms are maintained,
         thought models acquired, thought labor divided. (p. 154)

    If an ethnography is a description and an interrogation of "what is" in a particu-
lar setting, to this I would add a suspicious orientation towards findings, and, after
that, a tendency to pose the next question--the transformative question--"what
if "?

    Suspicion is a term I borrow from Paul Ricoeur who in Freud and Philosophy
(1970) talks about the "hermeneutics of suspicion" as compared to the "hermeneu-
tics of obedience". A suspicious tendency is a willingness to question how things--
especially dominant things--are as they are, and why, and to seek for alternatives.

                                                                                                      15

For me similar powerful ideas are the notion of taking a "paradigmatic" approach
to "knowledge" (Aram Eisenschitz, 2000), and of acknowledging the crucial role
of "warrants" and "backing' (Stephen Toulmin, 1958) in establishing, and hence
critiquing, any position (Sally Mitchell & Mike Riddle, 2000). These ways of un-
packing knowledge claims help to make sense both of what I observe in practice
and of how I might want to respond.

    Looking at a fraction of data from my study of "argument" in educational set-
tings in the 1990s (Mitchell, 1994; Richard Andrews, 1995) may help to anchor
what I mean. Picture an upper secondary school sociology class where students are
gathered in small groups around tables to discuss Ivan Illich's (1976/1990) theory
of "Iatrogenesis. " In one group, two students dominate: Andrew--questioning the
value of hospital treatment and pointing out that treatment ultimately doesn't stop
people from dying and is also costly; Susan--strongly resisting this view.

         Susan: Rubbish. No sorry Andrew, I don't agree.

         Andrew: Why?

         Susan: Because I wouldn't want to die and I don't think you
         would and if it comes to the choice where you'd got a chance of
         living, you would have it. You would have it!

    In this scene "argument"--the object of my study--emerges as a conflict be-
tween what Susan knows and feels to be the case in her everyday experience and
Andrew's espousal of the new, counter-commonsensical idea. She's annoyed, it
seems, by his detaching himself (what he would do if he were ill and needed treat-
ment) from the discussion. And indeed Andrew is getting more abstract in his
thinking, becoming more "sociological. " Towards the end of the discussion he
seems to grasp--to arrive at for himself--the "bigger picture" argument being put
forward by Illich. Referring to the Health Service, he says:

         Andrew: So it's an excuse for, like, the government not interven-
         ing in causes of ill health, isn't it?

    Andrew's aha! moment isn't the end of the story however: I observed how much
of the argument that had emerged collaboratively and antagonistically through the
peer to peer discussion dropped out of the writing the students subsequently did
(see Mitchell, 1995). What accounted for this disappearance? Was it control over
the medium, the medium itself, the fact that the writing would be read and assessed
by the teacher as part of working towards a public exam, a resultant reluctance to
take risks?

    These kinds of question about "translation, how meaning gets moved, or does
not ...", about "intersubjectivity, how separate individuals come to conceive, or
do not, reasonably similar things ..." make clear that it was not possible thinking

about what I observed, to conceive of "argument" simply as a text or simply as talk.
It was also absolutely necessary to think about beliefs, identities, permissions, what
was tacit or silenced as well as what was shared--by whom and for what purposes.

    Then comes the shift to new kinds of question. What other kinds of trans-
formation besides those achieved through the class dialogue, would Andrew and
Susan have had to make to express their insights powerfully in their written texts--
and to have them recognized against official assessment criteria? What might have
been done differently and by whom? What might make a difference? To what and
to whom? What kind of a difference? And why? Seeking to address these questions
suggests that there would be no such thing as straightforwardly "better argument. "
This is absolutely not to say that change shouldn't be tried--and my study gave rise
to numerous suggestions, including ways of bridging the gaps between generative
and formal writing, meta-discussion of what counts as knowledge and so on.

    To return to where I started, however. The combination of an ethnographic lens
with a suspicious tendency, means that any transformative goal is never finalized;
being socially, politically, ideologically constructed, what counts as "good" or "bet-
ter" is always rightly the object of further scrutiny. Many of the contributions to
this book suggest a willingness to engage in such scrutiny.

THE CONTENTS OF THE BOOK

    The goal of this book is to offer examples from a range of institutional contexts of
the ways in which teacher-researchers are working with Academic Literacies, engag-
ing directly with the three questions set out in the first section of this Introduction.
The contributions are 31 "case studies, " a term we use here to refer to the detailed
discussion and/or illustration of specific instances of "transformative design" which
are often also anchored to specific theoretical concerns. Contributors have worked
hard to offer concise snapshots of their practice and key challenges in order to:

      · illustrate how they have sought to "work with" Academic Literacies
      · offer their perspectives on what constitutes transformative design in

         current practice
      · provide resources for teacher-researchers working in a range of contexts

         which are practical in nature whilst being theoretically robust.

    We have also included six contributions that we have called Reflections. These
are comments and dialogue from scholars from different traditions and geoloca-
tions and reflect some of the "troublesome" areas we are all seeking to grapple with,
both theoretically and practically. These are interspersed across the book.

    We have organized the contributions into four main sections, the sections de-
termined by the key focus of each contribution: Section 1--Transforming pedago-
gies of academic writing and reading: Section 2--Transforming the work of teach-

                                                                                                      17

ing: Section 3--Transforming resources, genres and semiotic practices: Section
4--Transforming institutional framings of academic writing. Whilst we provide an
introduction at the beginning of each section, we do of course recognize that there
is considerable overlap in themes, questions and issues across the contributions and
we strongly encourage readers to move back and forth across the book to follow
threads of particular interest.

NOTES

1. "New" universities were created in 1992 in the United Kingdom, with the abolition
of the binary divide between polytechnics and universities. Initially, they took students
from the local community and had close links with colleges providing "Access to High-
er Education" courses. Many of their students were the first in their family to attend
university.

2. Tracking the use of terms is not straightforward. This is discussed in Lillis and Scott
2007.

3. These three points are discussed in more detail in Lillis 2013.

                     SECTION 1
      TRANSFORMING PEDAGOGIES
OF ACADEMIC WRITING AND READING
INTRODUCTION TO SECTION 1

    Section 1 focuses on the ways in which teachers are seeking to transform ped-
agogies around academic writing and reading and re-negotiate opportunities for
teaching and learning. A key theme running across the chapters is a commitment
to making visible the dominant conventions governing academic writing so as to
facilitate access to such conventions, whilst at the same time creating opportunities
for student choice and active control over the conventions they use in their writ-
ing. At the heart of this section is a concern with the pedagogic relationship and
the ways in which teachers seek to transform this relationship in order to enhance
students' academic writing, reading, meaning making and knowledge making prac-
tices. Transformation is explored along a number of dimensions drawing on a range
of theoretical traditions and using a range of data, including teacher-researcher
reflections, extracts from students' writing, drawings and sketches, students' talk
about their writing and examples of curriculum design and materials. The section
opens with a paper by Julio Gimenez and Peter Thomas who offer a framework
for what they call a "usable pedagogy" or praxis. In offering this framework the
authors are tackling head on the question of the usability of theory and principles
developed in academic literacies work (and indeed theory more generally). Their
framework for praxis includes three key goals: to facilitate accessibility, to develop
criticality, to increase visibility. Transformation in their work draws on traditions
of "transformative learning" foregrounding the importance of making students
"visible participants of academic practices." They illustrate the use of their frame-
work with undergraduate students in Art and Design and Nursing. The following
chapter by Lisa Clughen and Matt Connell also centres on the transformation of
the pedagogic relationship by explicitly connecting issues of concern in academic
literacies work with the psychotherapeutic approach of Ronald David Laing (1965,
1967). They explore in particular two key challenges: how tutors can validate stu-
dents' struggles around writing and reading without trapping them into feelings
of stupidity, passivity or self-condemnation; and how tutors can share their power
with students. Their dialogue is an instantiation of the collaborative relationship
between "academic literacy" facilitator and discipline specialist--a relationship that
is also explored in many chapters in the book--as well as an illustration of an alter-
native model of writing that can be used in knowledge making and a theme that is
focused on in detail in Section 3.

    Transformative pedagogy in the following two chapters seeks to tackle old or
familiar problems with new approaches. Jennifer Good tackles what she describes
as "theory resistance" by undergraduate photojournalism students through the ac-
tive encouragement to use a semiotic resource they are more at ease with--visual

                                                                                                      25

metaphor. She describes how she encouraged students to visually represent their
feelings around attempting to engage with difficult texts and argues that an aca-
demic literacies model "provides a framework for acknowledging the pressure faced
by students as they negotiate unfamiliar literacy practices."

    Joelle Adams likewise foregrounds the academic learning potential in the peda-
gogic use of visual rather than verbal (only) resources. Adams returns to a question
that is nested in all contributions--how is "academic literacies" understood and
taken up by practitioners?--focusing in particular on students taking on a tutoring
role as part of an elective module in a Creative Writing course. Adams provides
details of the kind of writing tutoring that student-tutors engage in, including
designing subject specific writing workshops, but her main aim is to consider the
ways in which student-tutors engage with academic literacy theory. Using sketches
made by student-tutors as well as written extracts from their journals, she illustrates
the ways in which student-tutors grapple with and take meaning from a key text in
Academic Literacies (Lea & Street, 1998) and apply it to both their teaching and
understandings about their own writing.

    A theme prominent in Academic Literacies research and running across all con-
tributions in Section1 is the implicit nature of many conventions in which students
are expected to engage and the challenges teachers face in working at making such
conventions visible. The paper by Adriana Fischer, focusing on an undergraduate
engineering course in Portugal, seeks to explore the extent and ways in which the
implicit or "hidden features" (Brian Street, 2009) of academic literacy practices can
be made visible to both students and tutors. Fischer outlines a specific programme
of interventions involving an academic literacy facilitator working with discipline
specialists and highlights both the possibilities and limits to practices involving
`overt instruction' (Bill Cope & Mary Kalantzis, 2000). Transformation in Fischer's
work centres on combining attention to overt instruction, alongside the creation
of spaces for ongoing dialogue between subject specialists, academic literacy facil-
itators and students. She argues that overt instruction is important but that given
the ideological nature of academic literacy practices, many specific understandings
about these practices will inevitably remain implicit, an argument also made by
Lawrence Cleary and Íde O'Sullivan in Section 4.

    The final three contributions in this section focus on transforming pedagogic
orientations towards language and literacy at graduate level. The paper by Kath-
rin Kaufhold explores specific instances of thesis writing by a sociology student,
Vera, foregrounding the uncertainties the writer experiences and the choices she
makes, particularly in relation to her decision to include both what she saw as
"more traditional" sociological writing and her more alternative "auto-ethnograph-

she carefully traces in the text. The paper by Cecile Badenhorst, Cecilia Moloney,

outlining a programme of workshops in a Canadian university aimed at supporting
graduate students' explicit knowledge of academic and research discourses, whilst
encouraging their creative engagement with these. At the centre of this paper is a
focus on "play," with the authors arguing that play is an important way to encour-
age "participants to move out of their usual ways of writing and thinking." The
paper draws on comments by workshop participants to illustrate the value of the
approach adopted and to explore the extent and ways in which such involvement
can be considered transformative. The question as to what counts as transforma-
tive in graduate writing is also addressed in the final paper in this section by Kate
Chanock, Sylvia Whitmore and Makiko Nishitani. Co-authored by a writing circle
facilitator with a background in Applied Linguistics and two writing circle partici-
pants in an Australian context, the paper focuses on the question of "voice" and the
relationship between writer voice, disciplinary field and the specific object being
investigated. Using extracts from writers' texts and their concerns about these texts,
the authors discuss how the writing circle provided a space for the consideration
of how "academic socialization had shaped their writing" and opened up oppor-
tunities for taking greater discursive control. The authors argue for the value of
"informed" choice around acts of writing.

    This section of the book closes with reflections by Sally Mitchell on a conversa-
tion with Mary Scott, one of the key researcher-teacher participants in the develop-
ment of Academic Literacies as a field. The question in the title, "How can the text
be everything?"signals a key position in Academic Literacies which is that in order
to understand what writing is and does we need to carefully explore written texts
but not limit our gaze to texts alone. Reflections 1 foregrounds the importance of
personal trajectories and biography in the development of individual understand-
ings how these are powerfully bound up with the ways in which areas of knowledge
grow and develop.

A FRAMEWORK FOR USABLE
PEDAGOGY: CASE STUDIES
TOWARDS ACCESSIBILITY,
CRITICALITY AND VISIBILITY

      Julio Gimenez and Peter Thomas

    This chapter presents case studies of pedagogical applications of an academic
literacies approach to the development of academic reading and writing. They were
designed for degree programmes at a London university within the context of UK
policies of widening participation.1 In most widening participation contexts the
student profile is varied in terms of, inter alia, relationship with English,2 previous
educational experiences, and length of time away from formal education. These el-
ements of the student profile have a direct bearing on academic achievement, so we
argue that academic literacies practices in contexts like that described in this chap-
ter must take account of this variety and provide students with a balance between
language learning, language development and literacy enhancement.

    The two case studies here represent attempts to develop what we call a "usable
pedagogy" informed by, and complementing, theoretical considerations of academ-
ic literacy (e.g., David Barton, Mary Hamilton, & Roz Ivanic, 2000; Mary Lea,
2004; Mary Lea & Brian Street, 1998; Theresa Lillis, 2001, 2003; Joan Turner,
2012). This interrelation of theory and practice draws on Paulo Freire's (1996)
conceptualization of praxis, or research-informed action through which a balance
between theory and practice is achieved. This balance, we believe, is important for
widening participation contexts.

    Our approach to academic literacies as praxis is based on three core principles
which aim to offer students opportunities for: 1) gaining access to and mobi-
lizing the linguistic and analytical tools needed for active participation in their
academic and professional communities; 2) developing a critical approach to not
only academic discourses but also the broader contexts where these discourses are
produced and consumed (e.g., their disciplines and institutions); and 3) increasing
their visibility as active participants in the processes of knowledge telling, transfor-
mation and creation through dialogue and authorial presence. These three princi-

ples form the basis of our framework for usable pedagogy which will be discussed
in the next section.

    The framework has been developed with the purpose of providing students with
opportunities for transformative practices through which they can gain control
over their own personal and educational experiences. Alongside most of the liter-
ature on transformative learning (e.g., Jack Mezirow, 2000; Edmund O'Sullivan,
2003), we would argue that transformative practices involve shifts in a number of
human spheres: thinking, feelings and actions. These shifts require changes in how
we have learned to think of, feel about and act upon the world around us, including
ourselves, the relations of power underlying institutional structures, opportunities
for access to knowledge and resources, as well as opportunities for success. Trans-
formative practices thus aim to help learners to develop a deep understanding of
themselves as main agents in processes such as knowledge creation and discourse
construction and co-construction, their own location and positioning, their rela-
tionship with other learners and their teachers, and their feelings about themselves.
Like constructivist approaches to education (e.g., Lev Vygotsky, 1978), transfor-
mative practices recognize that knowledge in all its forms--technical, practical,
propositional and procedural--is central to transformation and that learners can
become more visible participants of academic practices through inquiry, critical
thinking, and dialoguing with peers and lecturers.

    Our approach is not a rejection of text-based approaches to academic writing
instruction, often known as "English language support"3 (e.g., EAP), in favor of
an academic literacies approach which emphasizes "social practices". We contend
that an either-or view is problematic in the context of universities committed to
widening participation. Instead, we support Turner's call for a balance or synergy,
"whereby a focus on social practice feeds back into an awareness of textual practice"
(Joan Turner, 2012, p. 19) (see also Turner Chapter 28 this volume; for relationship
between Ac Lits and EAP, see Theresa Lillis and Jackie Tuck 2015).

    Despite having developed in "quite different socio-political contexts" (Ken
Hyland & Liz Hamp-Lyons, 2002, p. 4), EAP and academic literacies approaches
both aspire to provide students with a more successful educational experience. Our
approach couples text-centred pedagogy, which highlights how particular textual
and genre-related features are used in specific disciplinary contexts, with the so-
cio-political dimension emphasized by academic literacies. The former allows us to
raise novice "home" and "international"4 student writers' awareness of the rules that
govern disciplinary academic discourses.5 The latter provides opportunities for stu-
dents to become more aware of, and more confident in, their roles and positioning
within their educational contexts.

    In the next section we discuss the framework for usable academic literacy ped-
agogy that we have designed, then illustrate how the framework was implemented
in two degree programme subject areas: Art and Design and Nursing. The final sec-

tion concludes the chapter with a brief evaluation of the three underlying principles
that make up the framework and the way in which they materialise social inclusion
in higher education.

A FRAMEWORK FOR USABLE ACADEMIC LITERACY
PEDAGOGY

    Paying attention to context, in particular the contextualization of pedagogical
practices, is central to our understanding of academic literacies. Contextualization
in our work includes a macro level of theorizing (the student's individual and social
realities before their institutional experiences, their individual and social identities,
their new institutional realities, and the identity of their institution and disciplines)
and a micro level of praxis, involving the modules and the lecturers for whom the
students are writing. Our aim is that these levels of theory and practice should
enable students to empower themselves in their reading and writing, as will be
illustrated in the case studies.

    Thus our framework aims to--

      Facilitate accessibility by:

      · Challenging the "institutional practice of mystery" (Lillis, 2001; Turner,
         2011) and, by means of analytical tools, helping students to gain access
         to the often tacit disciplinary expectations (Julio Gimenez, 2012);

      · Helping students to develop effective means of expression through raising
         their awareness of the constitutive nature of language (Turner, 2011)
         in their construction and representations of knowledge.6 One common
         route to this is the identification of key textual and discursive features in
         their disciplines (by using linguistic tools), the consideration of alterna-
         tives and their impact, and the development of informed student use of
         such features.

      Develop criticality by:

      · Helping students to understand the role they play in the academic world
         that surrounds them. It is only through this understanding that stu-
         dents will be able to fully comprehend "the way they exist in the world
         with which and in which they find themselves" and most importantly to
         "come to see the world not as a static reality, but as a reality in process,
         in transformation" (Freire, 1996, p. 64, emphasis in the original);

      · Helping students to critically analyze the multiplicity of factors interven-
         ing in the processes of producing and consuming texts to avoid collaps-
         ing them into monolithic entities (e.g., good and bad writing) (Freire &

                                                                                                      31
Gimenez and Thomas

         Donald Macedo, 2002).
      Increase visibility by:
      · Encouraging visibility and writer's voice development through a pro-

         cess we refer to as "dialogics," that is, by establishing co-operation and
         dialogue between all the people involved in academic literacy practices.
         This idea resonates with Bakhtin's views of dialogue as an aspiration to
         struggle for, "a range of possible truths and interpretations" (Lillis, 2003,
         p. 198);
      · Empowering students to find ways of becoming more visible (to them-
         selves, their lecturers and institutions) and thus less peripheral to the
         processes of knowledge telling, transformation and creation, getting their
         voices as writers heard, and their writer authority respected.
    Figure 1.1 illustrates how the elements in the framework are interrelated: vis-
ibility depends to a certain extent on criticality and both on accessibility. The di-
agram also aims to show the proportional relationship between the elements: the
more visible the students become as participants of knowledge-making processes,
the wider the range of resources, linguistic and otherwise, they can access and con-
trol. However, the relationship between the elements is fluid; their sequence is not

fixed as will be demonstrated in the case studies.

PUTTING THE FRAMEWORK TO WORK: CASE STUDIES IN
ART AND DESIGN AND NURSING

    This section examines how the framework was applied in the context of three
core modules; "Introduction to History of Art, Architecture and Design," a first year
BA module for a number of programmes in Art and Design; and "Foundations for
Nursing Practice" (first year) and "Nursing the Patient with long-term Conditions"
(second year), two BSc Adult Nursing modules. The students in these two subject
areas differed in terms of their ages (most Art and Design students were in their early
twenties whereas most Nursing students were in their early or mid-thirties) and in
terms of their relationship with the English language (for most of the nursing stu-
dents, English was their second or additional language but the majority of the art and
design students used English as their first--or only--language). However, almost all
students on both programmes can be classified as "non-traditional students," that is,
they are from social groups which have historically been largely absent from higher
education: students from working class backgrounds, older than 18 when starting
university, some with learning difficulties, and as a group representing a variety of
cultural and linguistic backgrounds. Against this context, pedagogical interventions
representing the framework discussed here were designed and planned by two aca-
demic literacy lecturers, the authors of the chapter, in collaboration with the content
lecturers in charge of the modules and in discussion with the vice-chancellor of the
university. Interventions were delivered as small seminars, which meant they were
repeated a number of times. They were scheduled within the degree timetable and
most of them were co-taught with the content lecturers.

    The following sections of the chapter present two case studies which illustrate
how we implemented the framework in the context of the two degree subject areas:
Art and Design and Nursing.

A USABLE PEDAGOGY FOR ART AND DESIGN

    This case study illustrates an approach to reading required texts, which was used
in interventions designed for a first year History of Art, Architecture and Design
module that runs alongside studio modules. The texts on the module are often
part or all of seminal texts (e.g., Benjamin's The Work of Art in the Age of Mechan-
ical Reproduction) and as such are not introductory. Students can find these texts
off-putting because the language is not moderated to suit the non-expert reader,
and conceptually the texts can be complicated. The authoritative discourse (Bakh-
tin, in Erik Borg, 2004, p. 195) of texts like these can be perceived to leave little

                                                                                                      33

room for the student-reader, and the text-based practices of contextual studies/
history of art, can be seen as restrictive by studio-based art and design students. In
contrast, the more internally persuasive discourse (ibid.) of object-based practices of
the studio tends to be seen as comparatively liberating, because it encourages forms
of self-discovery that these texts seem to deny. Reading these texts brings to the fore
an epistemological tension between the distinct worlds (Michael Biggs & Daniela
Büchler, 2012, p. 231) of text- and object-based research practices.

    The students on the module share the broadly mixed profile of the university,
but many of them also have dyslexia or another SpLD (Special Learning Difficul-
ties).7 Biggs (2007, p. 99) identifies that dyslexics seem to favor, "forms of thinking
that aid creative work in the arts," or cognitive activity characterized as a preference
for holistic, visual and spatial thinking, rather than sequential and auditory (word-
based) thinking.8
Developing Criticality

    An important feature of the session is that it draws on studio-related practices,
to encourage students to make use of the kind of criticality that they exercise in
the studio, with which they often feel more competent. The sessions begin with an
image that is relevant to the studio area (e.g., Figure 1.2 for Photography students),

                   Figure 1.2: Dorothea Lang, Migrant Mother, 1936
                          [permission under Creative Commons].

                                                                            A Framework for Usable Pedagogy

and we consider questions like: How do we look at an image? What do our eyes settle
on? Is there a prescribed order of looking and what to look at?

    Students tend to suggest that they start to look at what they want to start with,
and work on from there, selecting their own route-of-looking through the image.
In the case of "Migrant Mother," some of the students have mentioned looking first
at her eyes, others start with the backs of the heads of her children, one student
mentioned being drawn to the edges of the image, which provide evidence that it
has not been cropped, but is a print of the full, original negative.

    The session continues with another image of the floor plan of an exhibition, and
more questions, this time related to how we encounter an exhibition, like Do we
follow a prescribed order? Students tend to suggest that to an extent, they do because
of curatorial decisions. However, they also speak of following an alternate order,
their own, particularly if the exhibition is busy or they have specific interests. Some
speak of working backwards, which means encountering the work in counter-cu-
ratorial order. We consider whose order is correct, whether meaning remains the
same, and whether this matters (see also Good, Chapter 3 and Adams Chapter 4
this volume).

Facilitating Accessibility

    Next we address the required text. The sessions propose an interpretation of
interactive reading (David Eskey, 1986, p. 11) that draws on different approaches
to reading as necessary. We objectify the text, which includes breaking it up (literally,
removing the staples and laying it out on the floor, if the text is short enough, see
Figure 1.3.). This allows students to see the whole text at once, to examine it as a
visual object and look for areas, or centres, of interest to them.

    They are encouraged to walk around the text, literally and figuratively, to con-
sider it from different angles, and to see component parts in a different order, as
they might elements in an exhibition. These centres of interest are not necessarily at
the beginning of the text; the students skim it, as they might a magazine, to find
their own starting points. They are encouraged to notice clues (visual elements,
repetition of words, etc.) that indicate topics. Having identified centres of interest,
students investigate around them, forwards, backwards or sideways, to establish
where they seem to start and end.

    We address meaning making with initial discussions about the discourse of
the text, its genre and purpose, framing linguistic features as language choices that
the author has made. The students generally characterize the language as "compli-
cated," so we look at simplifying strategies like removing modifying language (see
simplification of a passage on early cinema in Figure 1.4). The students do this
type of activity in small groups on their individual centres of interest, generating
interpretations of them.

    Discussion and dialogue are important elements of the sessions, which are of-

                                                                                                      35
Gimenez and Thomas

ten co-taught by a content lecturer and an academic literacy lecturer. We encour-
age dialogue between all those present in the session, which generates a process of
collective meaning making, drawing on Freire's (1996, p. 56) idea of humanistic
education. For the last part of the sessions, students are asked to explain one of their
centres of interest in the text, and to relate it to their studio practice.

    Access here is gained to potentially off-putting texts, and to the process of di-
alogue towards meaning. We challenge the misconception that less confident stu-
dent-readers can have, that reading means word-for-word decoding of a hidden
message, which reinforces their sense of incapacity (Pierre Bourdieu & Jean-Claude
Passeron, 1990, p. 111.)
Increasing Visibility

    The visibility of the studio in the session is an important feature. In drawing on
epistemologies of the studio in this non-studio setting, we acknowledge the central
role it plays for the student. This responds to the gap/tension between studio/object
and text-based practices through emphasising a synergy between art/design and
language (Joan Turner & Darryl Hocking, 2004).

    The visibility of student decisions or agency is also key. The act of selecting their
own centres of interest encourages them to question their role in the reading-writ-
ing process. It draws their attention to the possibility that they are reader-creators,
generating new knowledge from texts, rather than merely reader-conductors. Also,
making choice visible at the level of language accentuates a sense of possibility and

                                Figure 1.3: Text objectified.

                                                                            A Framework for Usable Pedagogy

relevance which, for these students, is present in the studio but is often lacking in
writing-related activities.

    Our approach encourages student-readers to exercise criticality in accessing texts
on their own terms. In challenging textual norms they alter the power-relationship
between the author and the reader, and loosen the sway of the author (Roland Bar-
thes, 1977, p. 143). This does not mean that the author's authority is denied, but
as the students navigate the text and map it for their own purposes, it becomes a
usable resource for them, rather than an inaccessible holder of secret meaning.
A USABLE PEDAGOGY FOR NURSING

    Most nursing students in this and similar institutions are faced with two sig-
nificant challenges when writing academically: returning to education after some

               Figure 1.4: Text simplified: A slide used in an intervention
     with communication arts students (excerpt from Gunning, 1994, pp57-58).

                                                                                                      37
Gimenez and Thomas

considerable time away and writing in their second or additional language. The
case study presented here discusses how the framework was implemented within
two nursing modules.

Facilitating Accessibility

    One of the first pieces of writing that nursing students are asked to produce is a
reflective account. Reflective writing is in itself a rather complicated process that re-
quires a set of distinctive analytical and linguistic skills. Research on reflective writ-
ing has shown that writers need to distance themselves from the situation reflected
upon in order to analyze it critically and suggest a course of action to improve it
(Gimenez, 2010; Beverly Taylor, 2000). It also depends on a fluent command of
language so as to present a coherent sequencing of events supported by the correct
use of tenses to make complete sense (Kate Williams, Mary Woolliams, & Jane
Spiro, 2012). All this poses a real challenge to most of the students on the nursing
programme described here.

    A number of language development tasks were designed to help students write
their first reflective account for the module. In these tasks, the academic literacy
and content lecturers start by asking students on the "Foundations for Nursing
Practice" module to discuss their previous experiences in writing reflectively, how
successful these experiences were, and the challenges they faced. Next, led by the
content lecturer, students examine the general role of reflective writing in nursing
before they set out to analyze the discourse of reflection. For the discoursal analy-
sis, we focus on an "incident in practice" account a student from another cohort
has written (see activities in Figure 1.5). We examine questions such as Who wrote
it?, For whom?, For what purposes?, and How has the writer positioned him/her self?
Then, a textual analysis of the account provides insights into its generic structure,
organizational patterns, sequential arrangement, and textual patterning. Linguisti-
cally, students de-construct the account to examine its language and register. This
linguistic exercise is followed by transformation activities that require students to
manipulate the discoursal, generic and linguistic elements in the account so that
it can be located in a different context: a different writer-reader relationship, a dif-
ferent situation, a different outcome. This aims to help students realize the effects
of their linguistic choices and the relationship between language and discourse (see
also English chapter 17). An example of the texts and activities for this type of in-
tervention is shown in Figure 1.5.

Developing Criticality

    In our framework, developing criticality means providing students with oppor-
tunities to evaluate the context where they are operating as students and as future
professionals, assess their roles and actions, and establish a reflective link between

38
                                                                            A Framework for Usable Pedagogy

the present (as student writers) and their future (as professional nurses).
    To help students to develop their criticality, a number of activities were de-

signed around a care plan for the "Nursing the Patient with long-term Condi-
tions" module. The first activity requires students to write a care plan by filling in
a template typically used in hospitals for these purposes. Following this, a number
of activities provide opportunities for critical evaluation. Students critically exam-
ine the care provided by a female nurse to an Asian man with a type 2 diabetes
condition, taking into account contextual elements (who the patient is, the rela-
tionship with his GP, his nurse and the hospital consultant, and his culture and
beliefs), their roles as student writers (writing for knowledge telling and knowl-
edge transforming), their role as future nurses (the care provided and how it could
be improved), and in what ways writing this text can help them as future nurses

              Figure 1.5: Analyzing, deconstructing and transforming text.
                                                                                                      39
Gimenez and Thomas

(initiating dialogue with their lecturers, markers and also future patients with sim-
ilar conditions). In this way, criticality becomes both a "textual" activity and an
attitude towards self and others.

Increasing Visibility

    One way of achieving greater visibility is by students initiating dialogue and
co-operation (dialogics) between themselves and key participants in academic lit-
eracy practices: other students, lecturers, and markers. In the example about re-
flective writing provided above, nursing students in their role of academic writers
are encouraged to use their outlines and first drafts to continue the dialogue with
their lecturers and other students initiated with the analysis of reflective texts and
the co-operation in co-constructing the meaning of their own texts. Through this
process of dialogics, students are able to discuss how the drafts they have produced
represent a range of possible interpretations of the task set by their lecturer and of
the disciplinary discourses the assignment is supposed to encapsulate.

    By speaking about their texts from their authorial stance, students make it
clearer for themselves and others how they are involved in processes of knowledge
telling, transformation and creation. Dialogic encounters also offer the students
the opportunity to situate their writing within the context of their professional
communities, their discipline, and their institutions.

DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION

    One central aspect of our development of a praxis of academic literacies, shown
in the case studies here, is the need to provide opportunities for students to access
and mobilize a variety of linguistic resources. Thus language development is at the
heart of the accessibility component of our framework. Key sociolinguistic studies
(e.g., Jan Blommaert, 2005; James Gee, 1999; Dell Hymes, 1996) demonstrate that
success in education, and society as a whole, is largely determined by the linguistic
resources individuals have access to and are thus familiar with.9 Social systems, of
which education is just one, are characterized by structural inequalities includ-
ing differential access to and distribution of these resources (Blommaert, 2005).
By offering opportunities for student writers to engage in analytical tasks, which
required not only deconstructing different genres but also transforming them by
mobilising a variety of linguistic resources, a process akin to what English calls "re-
genring" (2011; see also English chapter 17 this volume), our framework afforded
students the opportunity to gain a better understanding of the role and impact of
language choices in performing specific academic actions.

    By the same token, the activities in our framework aim to demystify a number
of academic practices in the context of the degree programmes and, in particular,
the modules for which students were writing. Thus the students are not only able

to explore formal aspects of the texts they are writing but also examine the value of
those texts within their disciplines and modules, as well as their own expectations
as writers and those of their lecturers.

    The framework also provides opportunities for the students to critically evaluate
their academic and professional contexts to comprehend their present and future
roles and actions, and to consider how the reality they are part of is not static but
open to negotiation and change. This, we argue, is mainly achieved through dia-
logue. The students gain a better understanding of their positions as writers of aca-
demic texts, and as future professionals, by dialoguing about the processes involved
in discipline-specific knowledge creation and transformation; a process of finding
their own voice through speaking about their interpretations of the contexts in
which they operate.

NOTES

1. Widening participation, according to the Higher Education Funding Council for
England (HEFCE), "addresses the large discrepancies in the take-up of higher edu-
cation opportunities between different social groups. Under-representation is closely
connected with broader issues of equity and social inclusion, so we are concerned with
ensuring equality of opportunity for disabled students, mature students, women and
men, and all ethnic groups" (HEFCE, 2011).

2. For some students English is their mother tongue, for others their second, third, or
additional language.

the remit of this chapter. Readers are referred to Turner (2011, 2012) and Wingate

4. Like most other categories used to describe groups of people and their behaviour,
these categories are also problematic and far from being straightforward but they pres-
ent a more "realistic" alternative to the "native" and "non-native" labels usually used in
these contexts.

5. These rules are familiar to expert writers but are usually left unexplained to students
(Turner, 2011).

Specific Learning Difficulty (SpLD), like dyslexia, at the university. More than 15%
of recent applicants for art and design courses identified themselves as dyslexic. The
proportion of dyslexics tends to increase as the year progresses because many students
are not assessed for dyslexia until they enter HE.

a highly debated phenomenon, for which a universally accepted definition is elusive
(Reid, 2009, p. 2).

form of social capital (Bourdieu, 1986).

WORKING WITH POWER:
A DIALOGUE ABOUT WRITING
SUPPORT USING INSIGHTS FROM
PSYCHOTHERAPY

      Lisa Clughen and Matt Connell

    Harnessing the potential of writing for self-transformation through exchanges
with students can be a struggle indeed. Students, it often seems, wish to hand con-
trol over their writing to their tutor,1 who struggles to resist this. Academic litera-
cies perspectives can help elucidate some of the reasons for such tussles, inviting us
to consider "hidden" aspects of writing (Brian Street, 2009), such as relationships
between writing, subjectivity and power (Romy Clark & Roz Ivanic, 1997), and
asking how such relationships may enable or disable the transformative potential-
ities of writing. Moreover, academic literacies researchers argue, it is through open
dialogue that students and tutors may engage with these complex facets of writing
(Theresa Lillis, 2006). However, as Lillis suggests, the nature of dialogue itself needs
examination if it is to become genuinely transformative, and spaces for writing
generated where the `creative,' rather than the `compliant' life might thrive (Sarah
Mann, 2001, pp. 9-13).

    In this chapter, we construct a dialogue between its co-authors2 which examines
struggles in writing support encounters from a psychological perspective, arguing
that transformative exchanges over writing are quasi-therapeutic. Framing writing
support as a negotiation of struggles with power and subjectivity, we offer tutors a
way of thinking about relationships with students and their writing. We have cho-
sen this dialogic form because it reflects the way our position on these topics has
developed through conversation and co-writing, and also resonates with the con-
versational medium of academic supervision itself. We also think that this form can
work as an example of alternative modalities of academic writing that can retain the
author's voice, something students often find difficult.

    Our dialogue follows psychotherapists who have argued for the application of
certain insights from psychotherapy to pedagogy (Carl Rogers, 1993), and writing
tutors who already use psychotherapy to inform their practice (Amanda Baker, 2006;

DOI: https://doi.org/10.37514/PER-B.2015.0674.2.02  45
Clughen and Connell

Phyllis Creme & Celia Hunt, 2002). However, we would avoid conflating the sep-
arate spheres of writing support and psychotherapy, simply noting that writing sup-
port encounters may take on the flavour of counselling, with issues of self-esteem,
rejection and alienation being their everyday stuff (Helen Bowstead, 2009; Lisa
Clughen & Matt Connell, 2012; Tamsin Haggis, 2006; Mann, 2001; Barbara Read,
Louise Archer & Carol Leathwood, 2003). We aim not to pathologize students but
to recognize that difficulties with writing are "normal," that struggles within writing
tutorials are to be expected, and that psychotherapeutic discourse can offer strategies
to negotiate them. Attitudes and methods that seek to recognize and redistribute
power, such as a realness in the tutor-student exchange, a focus on non-directive
modes of language and a reframing of powerlessness through normalizing strategies
and non-judgment have as much of a place in writing support as they do in the ther-
apy session. These are just some of the themes we touch on in our dialogue.

         Lisa: My writing support sometimes veers toward counselling,
         especially if students position themselves as stupid or as lacking
         in what it takes to succeed. I try to bolster their confidence to
         help them to help themselves, but it's a struggle to enter into the
         open, transformative exchange Carl Rogers talks about (1993).
         Often they just want me to tell them what to do and, under-
         standably, ask me to judge their work, as if I am the final arbiter
         of truth: "Is that ok?" "Is that better?" They may refuse to own
         their power, seek to give it to me, and then resist my attempts to
         give it back to them!

         Matt: That sounds like a psychotherapeutic client saying "Doc-
         tor, I'm sick; cure me." The therapist has to carefully avoid
         reinforcing their passivity and self-pathologization. Have you got
         an example from your sessions?

         Lisa: Well, the opening of sessions often sets the scene for this--
         a student showed me her writing today and said: "I really need
         you to fix it for me." And read this email from a very self-aware
         student: "I hate to admit this--and I'm embarrassed that I have
         to admit it--but I think I need to be spoon-fed."

         Matt: "Spoon-fed" is an interesting choice of language psycho-
         analytically speaking, since it has infantile connotations. Writing
         tutorials can certainly seem like power struggles over dependency
         and independence. How do you avoid positioning the tutor as
         the dispenser of authoritative knowledge and the student as its
         recipient?

Lisa: Well, passivity is often a response to being rendered pas-
sive by, for example, alienating language and the pressure to
succeed--so I try to resist becoming another alienating force. I
take seriously the language I use so that it does not represent me
as author of their text. I aim to foreground the student-writer as
governor of their writing and to downplay my own authority:
"what would you like to discuss today?" "I can only comment
as a reader, you don't have to accept my points." "Am I right in
thinking that ...?" I sometimes talk about questions I ask myself
when writing "that you may or may not find helpful" such as: "Is
this really what I'm trying to say here?" "Does that language really
get over my meaning?" This positions them as in being control,
emphasising that only they can know what they want to say.

Matt: I'm afraid I find it very hard to resist students' desire to
give away their agency by positioning me as their editor, and too
easily get sucked into giving them what they often want--an
editorial critique that can "fix" a specific piece of work.

Lisa: But if you do that, or only that, you run the risk of affirm-
ing their self-critical tendencies, feeding feelings of powerlessness
and dependency. Subsequently, they may feel they can't do it
without you.

Matt: Yes. Negative feelings and self-critique crop up a lot when
students are struggling with writing--that's another reason for
the parallels with therapy.

Lisa: What Rogers (1993) says about learning is definitely what
I experience in my writing support--students bring the whole
self to the exchange about writing, not just a simple request to
go over, for example, sentence construction. Have a look at these
statements from recent writing support sessions:

   I feel too stupid to be here. It's not a nice feeling at all.

   I deleted my work in anger, so I couldn't send it to you. You
   get a bit frustrated don't you, because you feel a bit thick.

   I ... got myself in a right mess. I lost the ability to write so
   cried for a while.

Matt: You can really feel the pain in these cries for help. I'm sure
you need a box of hankies in your office, just like a counsellor!
Humanistic psychotherapy tries to avoid reinforcing the client's

                                                                                           47
Clughen and Connell

         self-pathologizing tendencies, refusing the power of clinical
         classification and labelling (Thomas Szasz, 1974). In our context
         the question is: how can we avoid making the student who says
         they are stupid feel it even more? I wonder if the cognitive mode
         of academic teaching often side-lines such feelings, exacerbating
         students' self-condemnation for getting emotional?

         Lisa: Oh yes, approaches to writing that are purely rational
         (for example, conceiving academic support as "skills teaching")
         often ignore the relationship between writing and emotion.
         But emotions affect both sides of the support encounter. Being
         "real" in the exchange by, for example, owning one's feelings
         about it could mean that while students might complain of their
         frustrations if the tutor will not edit their work for them, tutors
         might have to admit to their own feelings of irritation if students
         believe they are, or should be, telling them what to write, rather
         than engaging in an open exchange about both of their responses
         to the student's text (Rogers, 1993).

         Matt: And to other people's texts and discourses? I'm interested
         in the way in which language use can sustain or disturb power
         in the writing exchange--those impediments to writing caused
         by engagements with alienating academic language. Tutors don't
         even have to assume the mantle of this intimidating linguistic
         power, it unconsciously colonizes the space between teachers
         and learners, being always already part of the cultural imaginary
         around education.

         Lisa: One student told me that her strategy for coping with her
         tutor was to use dictionary.com afterwards because she "didn't
         have a clue what she was trying to say to me." She didn't feel
         able to ask at the time, due to the fear of looking stupid. Here's
         another student emailing me their experience of reading: "I've
         read all these theory books and they sound posh and are just too
         hard to understand. If I don't pick at each sentence, I won't have
         a clue what they are on about."

         Matt: Here, students are imagining that it's different for us,
         whereas in reality, everyone struggles at one level or another with
         "theory books." I have to pick at each sentence too, and I find
         that if I explain this to students, it can help to transform their
         self-perceptions, mitigating their fantasies about our power. Rad-
         ical psychotherapy can work like this too--one of the insights of

"co-counselling" was that empathy can be generated more easily
when professional hierarchies are eroded rather than reinforced
(Mann, 2001).

Lisa: I sometimes explicitly give up my power by mentioning my
own struggles with writing and what I do to cope with them,
then ask students if they can suggest anything to help me.

Matt: Even Freud, a bad offender when it comes to jargon and
power-bound interaction, knew that the struggles of the so-
called "mentally ill" are only exaggerated versions of the every-
day struggles that dog us all. If we can normalize what students
are feeling, that helps them enter the community of scholars as
potential equals, not competing supplicants.

Lisa: Yes. Normalizing both feelings and the typical gamut of
unproductive writing behaviors can be a potentially powerful
strategy. A PhD student who said she wanted me to tell her "how
to write efficiently and effectively" told me that she was panick-
ing that she was not a good writer as some days she could write
a thousand words and other days none at all. It was as if she was
looking for a magic formula for writing, something outside of
herself (Bowstead, 2009). Instead, I drew on ideas about mind-
fulness and encouraged her gently to see this just as a part of her
own writing process (and said it was mine too, in fact)--it was
neither good nor bad, but just the way it was at that moment.
My hope was that her self-diagnosis ("bad writer") and the panic
that ensued from it might be assuaged by establishing a climate
of non-judgment. You've mentioned R. D. Laing when we've
talked about this before, haven't you?

Matt: Yes--he's the big figure when it comes to avoiding the
pathologizing gaze, normalizing distress and trying to avoid the
pitfall of therapy becoming a lesson in power-bound conformity
to an existing social order (Laing, 1967).

Lisa: But Matt, these students DO have to conform in order to
succeed, they aren't living in a cultural free-for-all. The university
and their employers determine which language games win and
which lose.

Matt: Yes, but if they can become conscious of this on their own
terms with their integrity intact, rather than feeling "retarded"
because it doesn't come automatically, as one student shockingly

                                                                                           49

         described it, then that's a big thing. This may mean they need
         to find the sense hidden in what they are trying, but failing, to
         articulate in their writing, and to present it a different way. Laing
         provided a lot of analysis of distorted communications--espe-
         cially a peculiar type of jumbled psychotic discourse colloqui-
         ally known as "schizophrenese" or "word-salad" (Laing, 1965).
         Traditional psychiatry is uninterested in this discourse, seeing
         it simply as a symptom of a diseased brain. Following Freud's
         (1991) notion that all symptoms had a sense, Laing instead tried
         to tease out what meanings underpinned the confusing speech
         (Laing, 1965).

         Lisa: Aren't you coming close to pathologizing students here? We
         don't want to suggest they are psychotic!

         Matt: Of course not! Firstly, I mean this as an analogy, as a
         metaphor. But secondly, Laing was, precisely, trying to avoid the
         pathologizing of psychosis itself--where some would dismiss it
         as nonsense, he reframed it as a "normal" expression of the hu-
         man head and heart, and as a communication strategy that made
         sense to the person deploying it.

         Lisa: So, applied here, can we say that there must always be a
         logic behind even the most confused writing, the kind of text
         that tutors may highlight with a big question mark, if only we
         could find out what that logic is?

         Matt: Right! In Laing's case studies the jumbled discourse is
         indicative of repressed and conflicted personality fragments. In
         a much less extreme way, jumbled writing may be indicative of
         conflicts in students' understanding and expressions. The further
         twist is that Laing suggests the "word-salad" may operate as a de-
         fensive measure when the sufferer feels pressurized or misunder-
         stood by those exerting power over them (Laing, 1965). I think
         sometimes there's a parallel here with student writing--students
         may be trying to mimic a scholarly register as a defensive reac-
         tion to criticism, but trying to sound clever to avoid seeming
         stupid usually only makes it worse.

         Lisa: So, the task is to somehow negotiate the power while
         knowing that the required language game cannot be completely
         avoided--just as those experiencing psychosis in the end have
         to find ways to talk using the rules of conventional discourse.

Empathy is the key to this--Rogers' (1989, pp. 225-226)
"unconditional positive regard," where we refrain from judging
the student no matter what they say, is central, but it's a struggle
to maintain it: when confronted with very frustrating writing,
or confused students asking me to sort it out for them, value
judgments--and even anger--can be hard to avoid. I have to
be constantly mindful of the suffering individual and strive to
remain compassionate.

Matt: It's interesting that you say "negotiate" rather than "re-
move" the power. With that distinction, I think you are opening
up a critique of the sort of theory which frames power simply as
something to be escaped.

Lisa: Do you mean the Nietzschean criticism deployed by Fou-
cault (1988), which he aims at Freudo-Marxists and existential-
ists like Laing?

Matt: Yes, bang on--for Foucault, there's a naiveté to theories
which claim power is a purely negative thing, operating via
constraint. For the theorists he criticizes, power always stops
things happening, it limits freedom, and they want us to strive to
remove it so that freedom can blossom free of its baleful effect.

Lisa: Whereas in his Nietzschean model, power is constitutive, it
creates things ...

Matt: ... and, moreover, it simply cannot be "removed": it can
only be re-deployed, swapped for another form of power or
channelled in another way. We could say it has to be owned,
consciously exploited and used, rather than refused. The refusal
to own power may simply be a sort of passive-aggressive strate-
gy--in fact, a disavowed form of power. Maybe we have to help
students work with power because, as you said, we simply can't
remove power when it comes to academic writing. We might
harbour a hope that students' personal growth can be central to
the university experience, à la Rogers, or that we can help them
shrug off the shackles of conformity and develop their true self,
à la Laing--but if we overdo it, we may be giving them rope to
hang themselves with. If we removed academic structure and
expected "freedom" to emerge, it would just be a mess!

Lisa: Yes. On the one hand, it is certainly important to critique
the dominating force of didactic academic socialization, which

                                                                                           51

         can deny students the right to their own voice. For that, the
         strategies of humanistic psychotherapy for opening up dialogue
         and empowering students through an understanding of the
         complex role of emotion and self-identity are really useful. But
         on the other hand, we can't simply throw the baby out with the
         bathwater, and can accept that scholarly frameworks and writing
         conventions can be an enabling force too, a form of power that
         can be appropriated and used. For example, writing conventions
         are not just a straight-jacket, they're a means of achieving clarity:
         if you can learn them, you can communicate more powerfully.

         Matt: So, what we need is for writing support to function as a
         sort of "critical socialization" that helps to foster the students'
         nascent membership of the academic community. We can help
         students to find the parts of academic culture where they feel at
         home, and to resist those parts of the culture that alienate them.

         Lisa: And the task of academic literacies work is to do this
         concretely, not only at the level of theory. So, for example, other
         ways of writing academically might be offered that would allow
         for a freer engagement with academic ideas. Perhaps what we are
         doing here is one model for this: writing an academic analysis
         as a conversation can allow for a discussion that is research-in-
         formed, critical, and also more immediately inclusive of the
         writer's own voice, as it allows for a language that is closer to this
         voice. This isn't necessarily the case with the formal language
         required by the academic essay.

AN ACTION RESEARCH
INTERVENTION TOWARDS OVER-
COMING "THEORY RESISTANCE" IN
PHOTOJOURNALISM STUDENTS

      Jennifer Good

"THEORY RESISTANCE"

    What follows is an account of a small-scale action research intervention de-
signed to tackle a problem I have called "theory resistance," among undergraduate
photojournalism students. By this I mean the resistance often expressed by these
students to theoretical reading and writing, encountered in the required "Con-
textual Studies" unit of their course (also called the "History and Theory" unit).
This is often related to a perceived or artificial polarization of "theory" and "prac-
tice." In this context, "practice" denotes the act of taking photographs, as opposed
to the critical reading and writing that supplements and underpins this activity.
Many students express a belief that this reading and writing is at best alienating
and difficult, and at worst, a waste of time or a distraction from the "real work"
of photography (see also Gimenez and Thomas Chapter 1, Adams Chapter 4 this
volume).

    Action research is a process in which a specific problem is identified and an
experimental "intervention" designed and tested with a view to gaining insight into
the problem and ultimately solving it (John Elliott, 2001; David Kember, 2000).
This particular intervention, undertaken at a large Arts and Design university in
the United Kingdom, explored the experiences of students in reading weekly set
critical texts for this unit in their second year. It is based on the pedagogic principle
that effective engagement with such texts is crucial in students' development as
photojournalists, and that "theory resistance" is detrimental to their engagement
with higher education as a whole, as well as to this photographic practice.

    Because I have found that using metaphors is often helpful in explaining the
value of critical texts, as well as how to tackle the reading involved--imagery such
as sieves, onions, chopsticks and maps, for example, can help illustrate selective or
step-by-step approaches to reading--I designed an intervention based on visualiza-

tion, in which students could collaboratively create visual models or metaphors by
making simple drawings, and then discuss the implications of their drawings (Sarah
Pink, 2006; Gillian Rose, 2007). Arlene Archer (2006) argues that rather than being
tied solely to verbal representation, academic literacies can and should account for
other modalities, notably the visual. Visualizing ideas through drawing might be
understood both as a way of communicating, inasmuch as visual literacy is an aca-
demic literacy, and as a practice that might usefully "cut through" the power relations
around difficult language, inasmuch as it transcends verbal language. This validation
of a visual or pictorial approach is particularly useful among photojournalism stu-
dents, who are often more comfortable communicating through (and about) images
than words (see also Coleman Chapter 18, Stevens Chapter 19 this volume).

    The intervention was based upon the following hypotheses: 1) students would
find drawing helpful in articulating their feelings about reading; 2) they would ben-
efit from recognizing that they were not alone in their concerns; 3) they would be
able to create models for more effective reading; and 4) I would learn from seeing
how the students represented their struggles, enabling me to design better teaching
and learning activities. Of these hypotheses, the first, second and fourth were proved
correct, while the third did not turn out as expected. Transformation for the teacher
is a key part of the findings of my action research. More important than this however
is the movement for students from "resistance" to acceptance of the contribution
that reading theoretical texts can make to their practice as photographers, and also
from a place of intimidation and shame in the face of difficult theoretical language to
empowerment and (following bell hooks, 1994) freedom. In this process, the atmo-
sphere within the teaching space is completely transformed, as trust is built between
teacher and students through making explicit the tacit "oppression" of language.

DRAWING ON/AS AN ACADEMIC LITERACIES APPROACH

    Students embark on the BA (Hons) Photojournalism course with a view to
becoming photographers: from the beginning of the course they are practitioners
of photography first and foremost, rather than writers or theorists. My approach
in teaching theory must be sensitive to this. I aim to encourage students to take
what they "need" from texts--to gain the confidence to be selective in what they
read based on their own interests and practice, without being dismissive of the rest.
There are a number of hurdles involved in this. My view is that while it tends to
manifest itself as a dismissal of the value of theory, "theory resistance" is most often
rooted in a lack of confidence; a belief that critical texts are too difficult, provoking
a defensive and/or fearful reaction. The academic literacies model provides a frame-
work for acknowledging the pressure faced by students as they negotiate unfamiliar
literacy practices (Mary Lea & Brian Street, 1998). These are understood as social

practices that often "maintain relationships of power and authority" (ibid., p. 168).
A key element distinguishing the academic literacies model as the basis for this
intervention is its attention to the problem of tacit-ness or implicitness, which is
rooted in power relations: the student experience of having to adapt to "academic"
language is often stressful, and as Lea and Street (1998, p. 2006) argue, teachers of-
ten fail explicitly to acknowledge this, instead maintaining a tacit expectation that
students must either navigate these differences independently or fail to progress.
Students thus either occupy a privileged position "inside," with access to academic
discourse, or are excluded and disempowered, particularly in relation to the teacher.
Theory resistance is an understandable response to this situation, in which, accord-
ing to the academic literacies model, there is a clear need to make tacit assumptions
about academic language more explicit, and to find ways of empowering students
in relation to language. Tamsin Haggis suggests that "collective inquiry"--open
dialogue or negotiation between students and teachers--is one important way of
working at this empowerment (2006, p. 8).

    Feeling that a text is too hard is one issue. Another, which I encounter frequent-
ly among students, is that it is irrelevant. Writing in the context of feminism, bell
hooks spells out the urgent political stakes implicit in this assumption, explaining
how language can widen the perceived theory/practice gap in dangerous ways:

         many women have responded to hegemonic feminist theory that
         does not speak clearly to us by trashing theory, and, as a conse-
         quence, further promoting the false dichotomy between theory
         and practice .... By internalizing the false assumption that theory
         is not a social practice, they promote ... a potentially oppressive
         hierarchy where all concrete action is viewed as more important
         than any theory written or spoken. (hooks, 1994, pp. 66-67)

    The complexity of theoretical language is often seen by photojournalism stu-
dents as a sign that it is not useful; that it is firmly divided from practice or "con-
crete action." hooks presents this in hierarchical terms that arguably contrasts with
what Lea and Street say about power relationships, highlighting a tricky double
standard: students recognize that some types of language are of a higher, more
exclusive order than others. They often conclude, however, as a direct consequence
of this, that academic language is not valuable. Rather than aspiring to be part of
the conversation, they reject it in principle because of its very exclusivity; objecting
to an "oppression" which in part they themselves are implicated in constructing.
hooks' work signals a valuable link that needs to be made between academic lit-
eracies work which centers primarily on language and literacy with other fields in
which there is an essential relationship between political activism and theory, such
as feminism, and, indeed, photojournalism.

                                                                                                      57

THE ACTION RESEARCH INTERVENTION

    The action research intervention involved gathering data over the course of one
ten-week term. In keeping with an action research approach, this data took a num-
ber of forms. It included drawings, questionnaires and detailed notes made in the
course of a number of sessions in which I recorded what students said.

    In week one of the autumn term, I asked the students to read a fairly complex
chapter from Roland Barthes's (1977) book, Image Music Text. The following week
I conducted two identical hour-long sessions with the two halves of the student
cohort. Each began with an informal discussion about the experience of reading
the text, during which I noted particularly how it had made the students feel. I then
introduced the concept of academic literacies, firstly by explaining that in academic
reading and writing, power relations are in play because of the power that language
has to both include and exclude; and secondly that an important step in addressing
this power imbalance is to have an explicit, clear and inclusive discussion about
such issues rather than leaving them unspoken. I explained my belief that creating
visual models of what difficult academic reading "looks like" might be helpful, and
that it was important that we do this collaboratively, to explode the myth that, "I'm
the only one who doesn't get it."

    I asked the students, in collaborative groups of four or five, first to draw their
negative experiences of reading the Barthes text, visualizing what it was like. I then
asked them to imagine and draw a more positive reading experience. Overall, twen-
ty-four drawings were made in the course of the two sessions, using colored marker
pens on A2-sized paper. In some cases the collaboration involved one student doing
the drawing based on suggestions and directions by others; in other cases several
students worked on different parts of the drawing at once, or added elements one
after another as ideas developed. We then discussed the drawings, and in the weeks
that followed I asked the students questions about how this exercise had affected
their experience of reading, recording their answers in my notes. Most importantly:

      · How did they approach/tackle the text(s)?
      · How did it feel?

    In the final week students filled in an anonymous questionnaire about the term's
reading experiences overall.

INITIAL FINDINGS: DRAWING READING

    When reflecting on the initial experience of reading a difficult text, students'
comments, which I noted during our group discussion, ranged from the very emo-
tional--"I felt stupid", "it made me angry"--to critical judgments about the text
itself--"I felt it was badly written", "there was too much assumed prior knowledge

58
                                                                            An Action Research Intervention

of words and concepts"--and accounts of strategies that they used to try to tackle
the text. These included reading particular paragraphs "again and again," constantly
having to refer to a dictionary, "or I wouldn't have got through it," and beginning
by reading in close detail but eventually giving this up and just skim reading be-
cause, "I felt fed up." The fact that much of the language used was so emotive con-
firms hooks's assertion that students can perceive theory as "oppressive" in a very
real way and consequently feel compelled to "trash" it (1994, pp. 66-67).

    Illustrations 1 through 7 in Figure 3.1 are scans made from a selection of the
students' original drawings, and highlight some overarching metaphorical themes.
Firstly, the linear journey, race, climb or obstacle course (illustrations 1, 2 and 3
in Figure 3.1)--these implying an assumption that reading is necessarily a rigidly
linear process of "getting from A to B". Secondly, the appearance of incomprehen-
sible symbols and codes (illustration 4) brings to mind Lea and Street's point that
students must adapt to, organize and interpret entirely "new ways of knowing"
within the university (1998, p. 157). Most significant, though, was the number
of symbols pertaining to access or barriers, as evidenced in all of the drawings
illustrated here, but particularly in illustrations 5, 6 and 7 in Figure 3.1. I noted a
comment from one student who had drawn circles representing inclusion and ex-
clusion, that, "the circle has to let us in. It has to be accessible." From an academic
literacies perspective in which the negotiation of access is an important concept,
this was revealing--particularly the implication that access is controlled by the text
(or the author of the text), which may or may not "let us in," rather than the power
of access lying with the reader.

    Having been asked to make "negative" drawings and then "positive" ones, the
students seemed to find the former much easier than the latter, indicating that
(imagined) success was harder to visualise than (experienced) failure. It is perhaps
unsurprising, then, that the "positive" drawings illustrate feelings and states of be-
ing (illustration 6) rather than models or strategies for action. As the development
of strategies was one of the goals of the project, this was rather disappointing. How-
ever in light of some of the other findings, it began to seem less relevant.

    When we discussed the drawings together, I noted two key conclusions that
were reached by the students. The first was that adopting a non-linear approach
to a text--for example skim reading it and then going back to the most relevant
sections--might be "okay." This illustrates that while strategies for action were
not necessarily represented in the drawings themselves, discussion of the drawings
pointed towards them. Interestingly, the second conclusion was that there might
be other things to gain from a text than comprehension, such as an appreciation
of language, or even relishing the challenge of reading. While the first conclusion
was related to action, the second was more about attitude. Overall, the exercise
confirmed that effective reading practices cannot be taught or "delivered" as such.
As Haggis has argued, they can only be "described, discussed, compared, modelled

                                                                                                      59

and practiced" (2006, p.10). This exercise involved the first four of these. The fifth
would come later as the term progressed.

ONGOING FINDINGS: PRACTISING READING

    As I continued to ask students about their perceptions of reading in subsequent
weeks, I tried different methods of structuring our seminars in response to what
they said, looking for the best ways to facilitate discussion about the weekly set
texts. Many continued to express frustration, and while the number of students
actually doing the reading increased, some were still reluctant to engage. When
asked if the earlier drawing exercise had impacted how they approached texts, most
said no, but as we talked further, it became apparent that some were beginning to
approach reading in a more flexible, non-linear way, as we had discussed, and were
finding this helpful. In week five, sensing that many in the group still felt disem-
powered, I set up a small group activity which involved them in looking through
that session's set text in small groups for any "nuggets" that particularly related to
the theme of the seminar. This worked well for the following reasons:

      · It was achievable even for students who hadn't done the reading in ad-
         vance.

      · It encouraged independent exploration of the text according to their own
         initiative and/or interests rather than the teacher's agenda.

      · It explicitly demonstrated and validated a selective approach to reading
         according to specific goals and lessened the pressure to "take in" and
         comprehend the whole of the text. Some students wanted to engage at a
         deeper or more thorough level, but for others who felt excluded, this was
         a valuable first step.

    Through this exercise, most students were able to identify something, howev-
er small or basic, and thus "access" a text that had previously seemed to exclude
them. I encouraged them to adopt a similar approach when they read the following
week's text, so that each person could come to the seminar prepared to offer an
observation. The following week's discussion flowed more easily and there seemed
to be less frustration. Subsequently I developed the above small-group exercise by
asking students to look at the text together, identifying one point they agreed with
and one they disagreed with. This had the same benefits as above, with the added
benefit of encouraging critical thinking (David Saltmarsh & Sue Saltmarsh, 2008),
giving students permission to agree or disagree with the author in their own terms,
and providing an accessible framework in which, at the very least, every student
could feel empowered to have something to say.

    At the end of the term, students were asked to complete an anonymous ques-

                                                                                                      61

tionnaire about their experiences. The sample was small (twelve out of twenty-eight
students responded), but the results were striking, and can be summed up as fol-
lows:

      · The majority (7/12) seemed to see (or remember) the drawing exercise as
         being primarily about feeling and expressing rather than learning, con-
         structing or illustrating.

      · A surprising number said that they found reading the weekly set texts
         both difficult and enjoyable/useful.

      · Most (10/12) said that the drawing exercise caused them to think about/
         approach/engage with the course readings in a different way.

      · However, of those who said that the exercise had led to change, not many
         were able to describe this change in very specific detail.

    It seems that the primary change experienced by these students was in attitude,
feeling and perception about reading rather than a shift in comprehension or strat-
egy. For example, two students wrote that they did not necessarily find the reading
any easier as a result of the exercise, but that they did find it less intimidating.

CONCLUSIONS

    Of my initial indicators of success, it is those relating to the atmosphere in the
teaching space and levels of discussion and participation in which I have observed
the most significant changes, and which represent the key outcomes of the project.

    As I continued to work with this group of students throughout the following
two terms, the atmosphere in our seminars was very different. Students seemed
more open and relaxed, and perhaps the most obvious change was that they were
much more willing to talk. Conversation about concepts and texts began to come
more naturally. This, I think, was largely a result of what I learned and how I was
able to use this knowledge to develop the structure of seminars in more effective
ways. For example, for me it was hugely beneficial to literally see the problem of
theoretical language as experienced by students. Seeing texts represented as mara-
thons, black holes, tornadoes, and mazes helped me to identify with their difficul-
ties in a very immediate way. As Lea and Street point out, difficulties in navigating
different registers of academic practice are often attributable to the "contrasting
expectations and interpretations of academic staff and students" (1998, p. 157).
From my own perspective, this process helped to narrow this gap in expectations,
and the change in atmosphere was largely due to an increased level of trust. The
intervention in itself demonstrated that I am interested in the students' struggles,
and that my goal in teaching theory is to contribute to their development as pho-
tographers--not just to foist my own (possibly irrelevant) interests on them. As

noted in the questionnaire results, students seemed to relate to the drawing exercise
more as a mode of expression than a strategy for constructing something for future
"use." An important benefit of this was in confronting feelings of shame and iso-
lation. Thus as well as building trust between myself and the students, the process
of making struggles explicit increased trust between the students themselves, and
perceived barriers to collaboration were broken down.

    Overall, the transformations seen in the interpersonal dynamics within the
classroom were as marked as changes in the students' individual reading practices.
This was not what I had anticipated, but since the problem initially identified was
"resistance," as opposed to lack of understanding, this can be seen as a successful
outcome. I might conclude that my primary findings are emotional rather than
intellectual, and, following bell hooks, account for students' holistic experience
of learning as "the practice of freedom" (hooks, 1994, p. 4). More fundamentally,
they should be understood in terms of the academic literacies view of literacies as
social practices (Lea & Street, 1998, p. 158), in which power relations are played
out and identities are forged. Some elements of the intervention might be usefully
repeated with subsequent student groups, but most important for the future are the
lessons learned about these social practices of literacy: listening to and negotiating
with students, making tacit expectations explicit, acknowledging how serious the
oppression of these expectations can be, and navigating them via a genuinely col-
laborative process.

STUDENT-WRITING TUTORS:
MAKING SENSE OF "ACADEMIC
LITERACIES"

      Joelle Adams

    This chapter draws on a small-scale study of the student-tutor experience to
illustrate how student-tutors make sense of the "academic literacies" framework,
as set out by Mary Lea and Brian Street (1998). By "student-tutors" I am referring
to students who engage in supporting other students' writing as part of their work
on an accredited undergraduate module. The module is Teaching Writing, which
offers third-year Creative Writing students an opportunity to develop their ped-
agogical knowledge and skills. Participants engage in a wide range of practices as
student-tutors, including one-to-one peer tutoring in the university's Writing and
Learning Center, designing and leading subject-specific academic writing and edit-
ing workshops within the university, and facilitating creative writing workshops in
the community (see also Good Chapter 3, this volume).

    In recognition of the challenges students often face in making sense of theory,
I carried out a small scale intervention study which involved devising a series of
activities to help student-tutors understand the key tenets of academic literacies
theory and apply the principles in their tutoring practice. I asked students to create
a diagram of based on Lea and Street's (1998) introductory article, to help them
identify the key concepts, to apply the principles to practice through observation
and in their own tutoring, and to record their reflections in their learning journals.
These activities acknowledge the professional context of the module and some of
the "signature pedagogies" (Lee Shulman, 2005) in education: that is, observation,
application, and reflection.

    Data extracts included in this chapter are drawn from diagrams and journal en-
tries by student-tutors who studied the module in the academic years 2010/11 and
2011/12; permission has been given by student-tutors for their work to be used, but
all names have been changed. In my attempt to make sense of their learning experi-
ence, I draw on Roz Ivanic's (1998) work to consider how "aspects of identity" and
"possibilities for self-hood in the socio-cultural and institutional contexts" (Ivanic,
1998, p. 27) figure in the student-tutors' experiences.

STUDENTS' CONCEPTIONS AND OBSERVATIONS
OF ACADEMIC LITERACIES

    Students read "Student Writing in Higher Education: an academic literacies
approach" (Lea & Street, 1998) prior to one of the initial module workshops. In
the session, students created diagrams to help them clarify the relationship between
the three approaches to writing in higher education outlined by Lea and Street--
study skills, academic socialization and academic literacies. Students then shared
diagrams with the whole class and reflected on the exercise in their journals.

    First, in Figure 4.1, Sally's representation clearly signals a hierarchical rela-
tionship between different elements. She positions being "academically literate"
as being built on the foundation of study skills and academic socialization, but
is informed by one's "previous experiences, etc." or what might be considered the
"autobiographical self " aspect of identity (Ivanic, 1998, p. 24). These "previous ex-
periences, etc." form the basis for students' academic experiences. The placement of
the"really good graduate" at the pinnacle of the pyramid shows that Sally interprets
the model as privileging being "academically literate" as part of achieving success;
it would seem that Sally is interpreting Lea and Street's model referentially and
normatively (as describing a particular level of literacy knowledge) and as applying
to the whole student experience (and beyond).

                   Figure 4.1: Sally's conception of academic literacies
                           from reading Lea and Street (1998).

    In her journal, Alex uses a bull's-eye (see Figure 4.2) and, like Sally, a layered
pyramid to demonstrate a sense of "construction"; however, Alex inverts the pyr-
amid, with study skills at the narrow base and academic literacies situated at the
wide top, demonstrating her conception of academic literacies as `broader', all-en-
compassing approach, than the study skills or academic socialization approaches to
teaching writing.

    During the work around academic literacies on the module, students often
claim that an academic literacies approach subsumes other approaches, an argu-
ment made by Lea and Street (1998); Alex's "bull's-eye" diagram is indicative of
how students think of an academic literacies approach as encompassing both study
skills and academic socialization. The idea that academic literacies subsumes other
approaches is evident in the way both Sally and Alex place academic literacies the-
ory at the "top" of pyramids; study skills and academic socialization are phases or
goals one passes through on the way to the summit.

    What is unclear is whether students like Sally and Alex see academic literacies as
a theory--they seem to be using it as a description of a hierarchy of literacy exper-
tise. Though the students are learning how to become writing teachers and tutors,
their conceptions of the model seem to be understood through their experience as
individual students and with concerns, as with Sally's note, about becoming a "really
good graduate." The "student" part of their identity may be influencing their en-
gagement with the academic literacies framework: they may not yet identify them-
selves as being in a position to step outside their current experience and concerns to

work with theories of language and literacy in their own teaching practice.

WHAT WE SEE AND DO: HOW STUDENTS RELATE
ACADEMIC LITERACIES PRINCIPLES TO PRACTICE

    After the diagram activity, students commented in their learning journals: their
comments illustrate the different ways in which they grappled with Lea and Street's
framework and tried to connect it to their understanding of teaching and learning
writing, as well as to their own experience and perspectives as writers. Extract 1
for example illustrates how Anne distinguishes between academic socialization and
academic literacies:

Extract 1: Anne's Conception of Academic Literacies
after Reading Lea and Street (1998)

         Academic socialization sees the tutor as a gateway between the
         student as a learner and the student as a professional. It address
         [sic] the way that students interact with their field and interpret
         tasks, but it fails to teach the students how write [sic] at an aca-
         demic level. Academic literacies argue [sic] then that the prob-
         lems with student writing lies [sic] in the level of knowledge and
         identity rather than skill or socialization. The student perceives
         academic literacies as the ability to write "in a certain way" for
         "for a certain audience."

    Extract 1 illustrates Anne's attempt to understand the framework and a some-
what partial understanding. A key point she seems to be taking from the Lea and
Street is a contrast between the theoretical position they advocate--a view of writ-
ing as to do with knowledge and identity--and the way in which students tend to
view academic writing, that is as the ability to "write in a certain way for a certain
audience." However, she then deconstructs her own experience of academic writ-
ing, as in Extract 2.

Extract 2: Anne's Application of Academic Literacies Theory
to Her Own Experience

         This all rings true in my own experiences. When I write an essay
         I adopt a voice appropriate for a student audience at times and
         not a voice which comes from a place of knowledge, as an aca-
         demic talking among other academics.

         Other times I stumble when I do have the right voice in my
         writing because I realize I don't KNOW very much about my
         subject. I don't know how to research, what to research or how
         to put all the facts together in a seamless piece of academic
         writing. It's forced, fractured. I believe that the more you know
         about the field the easier it is to write and present.

    It's interesting to note that in the first extract Anne is attempting to express her
learning/sense-making around academic literacies in a conventional impersonal ac-
ademic style, whereas in Extract 2 she is expressing her sense-making as it relates to
her personally, not only in the content, but in the language that she uses. Her anx-
iety about writing about the theoretical is perhaps signaled through the language
errors at sentence level in Extract 1; in contrast, when she writes about the personal
in Extract 2, Anne's writing contains fewer grammatical errors. Her "discoursal
self " (Ivanic, 1998,p. 25) is less confident ("forced, fractured") when she struggles
with the theoretical issues of academic literacies and more confident when she's
writing about what she knows: her own experience.

    In her attempts to make sense of academic literacies, in Extracts 3 and 4 Laura
addresses the emancipatory possibilities of writing; Laura seems to see what Ivanic
has called "possibilities for self-hood in socio-cultural and institutional contexts"
(Ivanic, 1998, p. 27) in relationships between teachers and students engaged in
creative writing and the wider contexts of "political and social power."

Extract 3: Laura's Understanding of the Emancipatory Power
of an Academic Literacies Approach to Teaching Writing

         [academic literacies theory] treats literacy as political and social
         power, acknowledging the variety of communicative practices
         whilst also taking into account the identity of the learner and
         institution.

    Laura's reflection on the effect of applying academic literacies principles, in
Extract 4, shows great emotion; her use of italics and punctuation, such as the
exclamation mark, highlights the importance of this insight to her. What Ivanic
refers to as her "discoursal self " is excited by the "possibilities for self-hood" in her
disciplinary context.

Extract 4: Laura's Reflection on the Emancipatory Power
of the Academic Literacies Approach

         This is incredibly important to creative writing! I see teaching

                                                                                                      69
Adams

         creative writing as teaching a social and political form of power,
         as well as a subject in which identity is fundamentally important.

    Laura's analysis of the relationship of academic literacies theory indicates that
she understands core principles of the framework, including its focus on power and
identity, and that she sees possibilities for application. In Extract 5, Laura reflects
on how the diagram activity affected her understanding of academic literacies and
begins to consider how she will apply this knowledge.

Extract 5: Laura's Reflection on the Diagram Exercise

         I found [the diagram exercise] to be an extremely clever method
         for clarifying the teaching in our minds, discussing it with our
         peers and contextualizing it. I found it incredibly useful because
         it made me simplify the teaching for myself.

    Students on the module find the reading troublesome at first because they often
have not read much critical or scholarly writing to this point in their degree pro-
gramme; making meaning from the text in groups encourages them to share and
debate their understanding, while the diagram encourages simplification of com-
plex ideas. The following examples show the range of conceptions students have of
academic literacies principles, and highlight some similarities in how they privilege
the approach above other ways of teaching writing.

    In Extract 6, Christine reflects on her observation of tutorials in the Writing
and Learning Centre, a service providing academic writing advice to students on
any course at the university.

Extract 6: Christine's Observations of Tutoring Practice

         The writing tutors didn't simply tell the students what was right
         and wrong with their work, instead they asked many questions
         and got the student thinking and analyzing their own work in
         order to understand for themselves how they could improve their
         work. This demonstrates the academic literacies theory because
         the student is made to develop their own knowledge and under-
         standing and to adapt these within each subject that they study.

    Christine sees academic literacies principles in practice when students are en-
couraged to take responsibility for their own learning. Similarly, Edie tries to ex-
plicitly use an academic literacies approach to structuring her peer-led session on
professional copy-editing; Edie has chosen to run a workshop on editing because

70
                                                                                         Student-Writing Tutors

it closely aligns to the course outcomes. She analyzes her tutoring approaches in
Extract 7.

Extract 7: Edie's Analysis of Her Own Teaching

      · A study skills approach: practical assessment of students' editorial skills;
      · an academic socialization approach: open discussion within the class

         about why editing is important; and
      · an academic literacies approach: checking to see that students have im-

         proved understanding of the importance of editing and what is required
         of them.

    For Edie, an academic literacies approach means engaging students at a me-
ta-cognitive level. Edie does not simply wish to teach editing skills; she also hopes
to clarify the rationale for learning how to edit and empower students to meet
expectations.

    In her tutoring practice, Laura explores the issue of identity, making a con-
nection between academic literacies and creative writing. The following extract
demonstrates her explicit exploration of identity for students on a Creative Writing
course, where creative outputs constitute the "academic" assessed work (as opposed
to traditional critical essays, for example). Laura seems to be making connections
between what Ivanic (1998) refers to as "autobiographical identity" ("we tend to
write what we know") and "possibilities for self-hood" in the relationship between
student and teacher.

Extract 8: Laura's Consideration of Identity When Teaching Writing

         In an unusual way I [as a student-tutor] will have an insight
         into the student's identity from looking at their writing; we tend
         to write what we know, in fact this is encouraged in creative
         writing, so it will be possible to gain an understanding of my
         student's psychology more so than in other subjects.

DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: MAKING SENSE
OF ACADEMIC LITERACIES AND ISSUES OF IDENTITY
IN LEARNING

    The design of the learning activities on the Teaching Writing module encourages
students to define the key concepts of academic literacies theory (including the con-
cepts' relationship to one another), apply the theory, and then reflect on the experi-

                                                                                                      71

ences to deepen their knowledge. I ask students to keep a reflective journal precisely
because of the connection between writing and meaning-making; this low-stakes
and relatively informal writing provides an opportunity for students to develop their
understanding of theories introduced on the module before they attempt to critically
discuss them in a traditional essay. Anne's discomfort around finding a voice when
writing about areas she feels she has little knowledge highlights the need to allow
students a safe environment in which they can practice articulating their thoughts
(without being formally assessed). The learning activities on the module are designed
to move away from a "study skills" approach to teaching students how to write, teach
writing, and write about teaching and not only socialize them into the academic
conventions, but provide a platform for considering how their own identities and
contexts might influence their own writing, learning, and teaching practices.

    The issue of identity also influences the ways students on the Teaching Writing
module experience learning, teaching, and assessment. The Teaching Writing stu-
dents often have not written (what they consider) "academic" pieces of work be-
fore: their previous output is mainly creative or reflective texts rather than critical,
academic essays. Again, Anne's uneasiness with writing about theory demonstrates
how little these third-year students may have been required to engage with schol-
arly literature before taking this module, which raises questions about how the
"signature pedagogies" of Creative Writing develop students' critical thinking and
rhetorical communication skills.

    The diagrams show how students define academic literacies, while the journal
extracts demonstrate how students reflect on their experience of applying the the-
ory. There is some evidence that students accept the benefits of using an academic
literacies approach over a "study skills" or "academic socialization" approach, par-
ticularly when they begin applying the principles to their peer-tutoring practices.
Laura sees a connection between concepts of identity and her practice as a creative
writing student and teacher, Christine sees deeper learning fostered through stu-
dents' self-assessment of their own writing, and Edie's application of the academic
literacies theory leads her to design teaching activities that focus on students' un-
derstanding, rather than simple skills.

    Laura considers how issues of identity might affect teacher/student relation-
ships in Creative Writing and makes a connection between academic literacies and
creative writing. Her reflections raise interesting questions about how we might
view other forms of writing through an academic literacies lens. For Creative Writ-
ing students, creative output is "academic writing" because it is how they are as-
sessed. The issues of privileged ways of writing, power, epistemology and identity
raised by Lea and Street (1998) may influence debates about the craft and teach-
ing of "creative" writing as much as they do the conversations about "academic"
writing. The work the students do to critically analyze and apply principles of the
academic literacies framework challenges aspects of their identity, but also opens

up, as for Laura and Edie, possibilities for self-hood in their identity as teachers
when they focus on the empowerment of others.

    Analysis of the extracts above is only a small beginning towards exploring how
student-tutors can use principles of academic literacies theory in relation to their
pedagogic practice and their own writing (both academic and creative).

"HIDDEN FEATURES" AND "OVERT
INSTRUCTION" IN ACADEMIC
LITERACY PRACTICES:
A CASE STUDY IN ENGINEERING

      Adriana Fischer

    Project-based report writing is currently a regular academic literacy practice in
Portuguese medium Engineering Programmes at the University of Minho (UM),
Portugal. Such work aims to position students as professional engineers building
scientific and professional knowledge. However, one recurring problem in the writ-
ing of the project based reports is the gap in understandings and expectations be-
tween students and teachers about the forms and norms governing the reports.
This gap in understanding has been highlighted in "academic literacies" work more
generally (Mary Lea, 2004; Mary Lea & Brian Street, 1998; Theresa Lillis, 2006)
and the question of how we might address this gap is the focus of this contribution.
Specifically, my aim is to explore the extent to which "overt instruction" (The New
London Group, 2000) on report writing as a genre can resolve the gap in under-
standing and whether features considered to be often "hidden" in pedagogy (Brian
Street, 2009) can be addressed through overt instruction (see Street, Lea and Lillis
Reflections 5 this volume).

    Two main questions motivated my pedagogic research and analysis:

      1. Are "hidden features" inevitably constitutive of academic literacy practic-
         es?

      2. Can overt instruction disclose the features hidden in academic literacy
         practices?

THE PEDAGOGIC CONTEXT AND THE INTERVENTIONIST
ROLE OF THE "LANGUAGE EDUCATOR"

    Between 2010 and 2011 I worked on an Industrial Engineering and Manage-
ment (henceforth IEM) Integrated Master's Degree Programme at the University of

Minho, Portugal. I was invited by the teachers to work as an Assistant Researcher at
IEM between September 2010 and January 2011 in order to support the students
and the teaching staff in producing and disseminating the outcomes of project
reports. In total 12 teachers (subject specialists), four educational researchers work-
ing alongside the teachers and six student groups with seven students in each were
involved. I was one of the "educational researchers" and the only person specifically
focusing on language and literacy: the teachers explicitly sought my cooperation--
as a "language educator." Considerable effort overall was put into supporting the
programme and the students' activities.

    Students in their first semester of the academic year regularly work with a Proj-
ect-Based Learning (PBL) methodology to develop technical competencies asso-
ciated with four particular courses. A Project Based Learning (PBL) methodology
typically involves students working on a group project drawing on a number of
disciplinary fields (Sandra Fernandes, Anabela Flores, & Rui Lima 2012: Natascha
van Hattum-Janssen, Adriana Fischer, & Francisco Moreira, 2011). In this course,
the PBL involved four key disciplinary/ knowledge areas: industrial engineering,
calculus C, computer programming, and general chemistry.

    The project in this instance was entitled Air2Water and the task was to design a
portable device capable of producing drinking water from air humidity. The final
report writing that students needed to produce had a word length of 60 pages,
including three main sections--Introduction, Development and Final Remarks.
Students were provided with a "Guide" and a list of assessment criteria which in-
cluded the following: clearly stated objectives, a clear structure, evidence of sound

reasoning and conceptual rigor, evidence of the capacity to reflect and engage in
critical analysis with group members, appropriate use of formatting and layout,
and appropriate referencing. Overt instruction with regard to academic literacy on
the part of the teachers included the formulation and sharing of these explicit as-
sessment criteria and giving oral feedback on reports at different stages of drafting.
However, it was considered that additional overt instruction in academic literacy
was needed in order to narrow the gap in understandings between students and
teachers which led me to develop, with another educational researcher, three key
"interventions" to take place at three key points in the 19 week course (see Figure
5.2 for schedule). The first involved a workshop focusing on the groups' spoken
presentation of the project, the second a workshop focusing on the writing of the
project report, and the third a series of sessions with each group where I fed in
comments and concerns by teachers and listened to students' perspectives on their
writing. The goal of these interventions which took the form of workshops involv-
ing students and teachers (see for example, Figure 5.3) was to provide additional
overt instruction in language, discourse and writing conventions that seemed to
remain hidden despite explicit guidelines and teachers' oral feedback throughout
the programme of work around the project.

    As I discuss below, the interventions constituted an additional form of overt
instruction. However, it's important to note that they also made visible specific
features of this particular literacy practice that had remained more deeply hidden,
often to both teachers and students. Drawing on academic literacies ethnographic

approaches (see for example Lea & Street, 1998; Lillis, 2001, 2008) I sought to
tease out these more hidden features using the following tools: observation of ac-
ademic literacy practices within course based instruction, analysis of preliminary
and final drafts of project reports, and reflections (mine and teachers') on the in-
tervention workshops. In the rest of this paper I outline the programme of work,
the specific workshop interventions I designed and facilitated and discuss brief data
extracts drawn from one of the six groups of students at IEM, working together to
produce a project report.

    The project was developed over 19 weeks; it had ten key pedagogic tasks--de-
signed by the subject specialists--and three workshop "interventions" (see Figure
5.2).

    The first draft of the project report was handed in by the students in week 8.
Until that moment, overt instruction had been given in different ways: the students
had received assessment criteria and oral feedback (based on the assessment criteria)
from the teachers on student presentations. Giving oral (rather than written) feed-
back on this programme is in line with feedback practices in higher education more
generally in Portugal. The teachers' oral feedback comments on presentations had
involved several recurring criticisms. These included: 1) lack of justification for the
choices and decisions that were made; 2) lack of explanation about what was inno-
vative; and 3) lack of critical reflection. What's important to note here is that the
teachers were both critical of the students for not fulfilling these expectations and
therefore meeting the assessment criteria, but also concerned about how to provide
adequate support to enable students to meet such criteria. In a fundamental sense,
the specific nature (conceptual and discoursal) of these three elements that teachers
were critical of were hidden in some ways to teachers as well as to students. In a
meeting (week 5), one of them stated how difficult it was to "manage feedback,"
and it was agreed that "giving students written feedback" might be helpful.

    Given the concerns that the oral feedback were proving insufficient to support
the students in developing the three elements mentioned above in their reports, I
designed a workshop where I aimed to explicitly raise and address teachers' con-
cerns (see Figure 5.3).

    After the workshop, Group 2--the group I am focusing on in this paper--
made efforts towards responding to the concerns raised. For example, in their draft
report they explicitly signaled the innovative nature of their project:

         Because this project is complex and innovative, it needs good

78
"Hidden Features" and "Overt Instruction" in Academic Literacy Practices

         management and staff organization. (Intermediate Report1);

and they wrote that their goal was:

         ... to lead a creative and dynamic project that can make a differ-
         ence in the market ... to contribute to finding a solution in a
         responsible and realistic fashion. (Intermediate Report)

    The explicit mention of creativity and dynamism--and the contribution that
the project seeks to make--indicated that the group understood to some extent the
teachers' expectations about explicitly marking innovation. The group also provid-
ed some justification for their choices and decisions pointing to the need for "good
management and group organization."

    They also made efforts towards signalling group processes and collective group
decision making, an element that is mentioned in the assessment criteria and one
that teachers were looking for:

         A proposal was made to create a company .... At first, Angola
         and Sudan were defined as target markets ... it was concluded
         that there was no average relative humidity in that country,
         hence this option was discarded. (Intermediate Report)

ONGOING TEACHER CONCERNS AND TEASING OUT
HIDDEN FEATURES

    While all the groups' reports indicated evidence of progress towards responding
to teachers' comments, by week 9, teachers still had major concerns about the proj-
ect report writing. In an extended tutorial (week 8) these concerns surfaced when
each group presented their written report--accompanied by an oral summary--to
seven teachers of the programme. In this tutorial the seven tutors who had by this
stage read the "intermediate" draft of the project report discussed their concerns
with the group members. I observed all tutorials and recorded the feedback from
the teachers to students. Based on a transcription of their feedback, key ongoing
areas of concern were as follows:

      · Lack of focus and coherence across sections of the report
      · Lack of sufficient integration of course content from the four subject

         areas (see Figure 5.1)
      · Insufficient discussion of the proposed device
      · Need for greater clarification about the innovative nature of the project
      · Need for clearer justification for the different decisions made

    Because these comments by teachers were recurrent and the students were not
succeeding in responding in ways expected while writing the intermediate report, I
consider it useful to describe them as "hidden features" in this particular pedagogic
context; as already stated these features were hidden from both the teachers/tutors
and the students. The teachers did not explicitly articulate what they meant, e.g.,

            Talk Around the Intermediate Report

            (1) Integration of course content areas. How is this evident in the Table of Contents and
            in the report sections?
            (2) Textual coherence. What is the "common thread" of the report?
            (3) Where and how is innovation signalled? What are the arguments or the justifications
            associated with the portable device and the objectives of the project?
            (4) Critical view of the work and the results. Where is it signalled?
            (5) Introduction. How is the theme contextualised? Are the objectives of the group and
            the project presented? Is the structure of the sections appropriate?
            (6) Conclusions. What can be highlighted as innovative in the study? Was the group
            able to integrate the content areas? How? Are there any limitations to the study? What
            are the benefits to the group of this type of teaching/learning? What are the benefits of
            PBL from a technical-scientific point of view?

how innovation could be shown and evidenced in the project report and the stu-
dents could not grasp what the teachers felt they were intimating. Rather, teachers
made evaluative comments about what was not being achieved, leaving students
guessing at what teachers seemed to actually require.

    Based on the comments in the extended tutorial with teachers, I designed a
third intervention workshop (week 12): this involved talk with students around the
Intermediate Report. I designed the workshop discussion with students around the

key concerns expressed by teachers (see Figure 5.4).
    In the Intervention Workshop 3, where students and I talked through key

points derived from teachers' comments and concerns, students were able to rec-
ognize some of the concerns of teachers that I presented to them. For example,
following discussion of the teacher comments in relation to their specific report,
one student reflected on the changes they had made while also mentioning the
difficulties they continued to face:

         We have added sections--in the Contents and in the Report--that
         were missing. The relationship between some aspects--"the com-
         mon thread of the Report" was not noticeable .... Related to the
         area of Introducing Industrial Engineering we wrote about project
         management, we wrote all the techniques. But, in addition, we have
         to apply the concept of chemical equilibrium, for example, our
         equations, our experiments, our device. I think it's quite difficult. I
         feel that in PBL--we need more help. (Student 1).
    Indications that the workshop intervention helped students produce a report
more aligned with the assessment criteria and teacher expectations can be illustrat-
ed by comparing a table of contents at week 13 with one at week 18 (see Figure
5.5). Some of the key changes are listed in Figure 5.5.
    However even at this stage students said that they struggled to make sense of the
comment for the need for "clarification about the innovative nature of the project".

     Strengths: easy to construct and to carry with backstraps, facilitates easy access to any
     situation and space
     Weaknesses: if the material used to construct the device is heavy and/or if too much water
     is in the portable device, it may damage people's backs

                   Figure 5.6: Strengths and limitations of the device.

                              "Hidden Features" and "Overt Instruction" in Academic Literacy Practices

They felt that innovation--the way that they proved that the device was really por-
table--was already clearly stated in their report:

         We were the only group to explain certain aspects. In one of
         the oral presentations, we mentioned that we believe our device
         is different from those of all other groups. We were the only
         group that effectively worked with the portable device ....
         This was our understanding of innovation ... (Student 3:
         emphasis added)

    The group had also presented images of the device (named "AirDrop") as well
as showing weakness and strengths (see Figure 5.6).

    Following both overt instruction from subject specialists and three intervention
workshops, students were both making progress towards understanding expectations as
evidenced both in their report drafting and talk around their writing, but students were
also still confused about why and how they were failing to meet teacher expectations.

DRAWING CONCLUSIONS FROM THE PROJECT

    I opened this paper with two questions:

      1. Are "hidden features" inevitably constitutive of academic literacy practices?
      2. Can overt instruction disclose the features hidden in academic literacy

         practices?

    With regard to the first question, on the basis of the programme and the consid-
erable intervention discussed here, I would argue that hidden features are inevita-
bly constitutive of academic literacy practices. Subject specialist and teachers often
"know" what they are expecting students to produce but: a) they are not used to ar-
ticulating such discursive knowledge; b) it may be that it is far from clear what the
nature of the knowledge expected is--this may be particularly the case when the
knowledge to be produced cuts across disciplinary and theoretical/applied frames
of reference, as in project based learning; and c) the ideological nature of literacy
practices--that is, the doing of any literacy practice inevitably involves fundamen-
tal issues of epistemology (what counts as knowledge here now) and power (who
can claim what counts as knowledge) even though this ideological nature of literacy
is not acknowledged. Furthermore, the dominant autonomous model of literacy
(Street, 1984) encourages a transparency approach to language and a transmis-
sion understanding of language pedagogy (Lillis, 2006) whereby both teachers and
students assume that taking control over language and knowledge making is (or
should be) a relatively straightforward issue. But as this pedagogic research study
indicates, this is far from being the case. Teachers in this project were aware that
they were not articulating what was required and unsure of how to do so. They

                                                                                                      83

were also frustrated at the students' incapacity to act on explanations. At the same
time, students were convinced that they had produced what was required but their
voices were not listened to in some key moments of the process. Students also rec-
ognized some of the difficulties they faced without necessarily having the resources
to resolve them.

    With regard to the second question, I collaborated with the PBL teachers and
designed specific interventions aimed at making visible the academic literacy prac-
tices required in this specific context. These were partly successful, as evidenced
by the changes students made to reports, the decision by teachers to use addition-
al forms of feedback in future programmes (to include written as well as spoken
feedback) and a general awareness raising of the many aspects of producing a re-
port that are not easily or quickly communicated. The interventions also signaled
the limitations in overt instruction: after a range of interventions involving overt
instruction, at the end of the programme students still did not understand why
their reports failed to do what was required and important gaps between students
and teachers perspectives--for example whether "innovation" had been explicitly
signaled--remained. Producing knowledge from across a number of disciplinary
boundaries is a complex task: ongoing dialogue between teachers and language
educators and students, facilitated by ongoing research into perspectives and un-
derstandings, as was begun to be carried out in this project, would seem to be the
most promising way forwards.

MAKING SENSE OF MY THESIS:
MASTER'S LEVEL THESIS WRITING
AS CONSTELLATION OF
JOINT ACTIVITIES

Kathrin Kaufhold

I would like to thank Sue Smith,* for her patience, and seemingly never end-
ing questioning to make me decide what really interests me.

                                       *Sue Smith is a pseudonym for the supervisor

    The above quote is an acknowledgement preceding a master's thesis. The au-
thor, Vera, was a sociology master's student when I met and interviewed her
about her thesis. This acknowledgement underlines Vera's perception of her su-
pervisor as playing a key role in the evolution and success of her thesis. What is
remarkable about this case is how Vera was encouraged to draw on her creative
writing experience which she gained through her leisure time activities in the
past. Vera incorporated aspects of this experience when writing her thesis largely
as an autoethnographic account. Moreover, her supervisor not only expressed
her excitement about the project but also engaged with Vera's topical interests.
In the following, I will introduce Vera and aspects of her thesis development.
The focus will be on the interaction with her supervisor and their negotiation
of standards for thesis writing within the institution and the sub-discipline they
were working in. I will demonstrate how, unaware of the existence of an academic
literacies perspective, Vera and her supervisor exemplified certain key aspects of
the transformative approach that academic literacies aims to encourage. These
were the exploration of different ways of knowledge making, the role of creative
approaches to language use and the negotiation of accepted institutional norms.
In broad terms, "transformation" here pertains to opening up textual forms that
are understood to be standards of thesis writing, both by the institution of higher
education and the writer.

    The discussion is based on a notion of "doing a thesis" as a constellation of
activities that are carried out jointly by the student and other co-participants, and
as influenced by students' past experiences and future-oriented goals. My aim is

to show how master's theses viewed as a constellation of joint activities (Theodore
Schatzki, 1996) potentially provide a space for a dialogic pedagogy and, in this
process, contribute to ever evolving understandings of what it is to do a thesis.1

VERA AND HER THESIS

    I met Vera on a postgraduate module on research methods and asked her later
if she wanted to participate in my study on academic writing of master's theses.
In our three subsequent interviews we talked about her thesis development based
on samples of her academic writing. We drew links to past writing as part of
her literacy history (David Barton & Mary Hamilton, 1998) and imagined fu-
tures (David Barton, Roz Ivanic, Yvon Appleby, Rachel Hodge, & Karin Tusting,
2007). Vera researched a particular British seaside resort as place of liminality and
carnival. Her thesis commenced by describing the status and historical reception
of the place. The main part focused on an analysis of her personal experience of
the resort. Vera explained her methodology in a separate chapter where she linked
it to feminist autobiographical approaches. Her autoethnographic section was
written in a style that oscillates between literary fiction and sociological theory
complete with flashbacks to childhood episodes. Writing her thesis made her
reflect not only on her experience of the place but also on how to use language
in order to convey this as experiential narrative yet with academic rigor. Vera's
work on her thesis thus highlighted issues at the heart of an academic literacies
approach, such as reflecting on and exploring alternative ways of meaning mak-
ing (Theresa Lillis & Mary Scott, 2007). To gain a fuller understanding of Vera's
work within the sociology department, I observed departmental thesis work-
shops, researched literature foregrounded in our conversations, and interviewed
Vera's supervisor and other students.

    Education was very important to Vera. She had attended a grammar school,
then started an undergraduate degree in psychology and theology, changed uni-
versity and completed a degree in sociology. As her secondary and undergraduate
education was influenced by having to deal with illness, she described starting
the sociology master's at her new university to be a great achievement. What
struck me most about her story was her wealth of experience in creative writing.
In our first interview, she told me how, as a teenager, she wrote poems, songs, an
autobiography and, together with a friend, material around a sci-fi TV series. She
finished off this list proudly announcing that she submitted a piece of fan fiction
for her GCSE2 in creative writing and received a very good mark. With this mark,
her leisure time writing had been validated by a formal education institution and
it seemed important for her to add this point. Being complimented for her writ-
ing style was a recurring topic in our conversations. She mentioned how she had

regularly been chosen as scribe for group work assignments in her undergraduate
studies and how her supervisor expressed enjoyment in reading Vera's work. From
the start, Vera insisted that in both her writing for leisure and for formal educa-
tion she was creative in the sense of "putting something into the world". In our
third meeting, she explicitly returned to this link and mused on how writing the
autoethnographic part of her thesis reminded her of her past autobiographical
writing. Nevertheless, her references to her undergraduate writing activities also
underline her practical knowledge and experience in academic writing.

    At the same time, Vera was uncertain about her thesis. As suggested in her
acknowledgement (at the beginning of this chapter), finding a suitable topic was
complicated and lengthy. She felt that Sue accompanied her in this process with
"patience". She had indicated a topic area in her proposal that was to be handed
in before May, the start of the dissertation period that lasted till the first week
of September. Yet it took her until June before she felt able to outline her topic.
This insecurity became most visible in a work-in-progress meeting at the end of
June. Here students presented their topics to-date to each other. When it was
Vera's turn, she appeared rather nervous. Bent over her paper, she read out her
presentation quickly while showing some photos from the research site projected
to the whiteboard. My field notes of the day describe my impression of her pre-
sentation:

         Vera was very uncertain about it all, started reading a print out
         very quickly, her supervisor said `slow down' and then it got bet-
         ter. This idea apparently just came a week before or so. Vera later
         said that it felt like the creative writing piece for English lit.

         Seems to be at the periphery in the academic culture although
         she used complex expressions and lots of theory stuff that made
         it hard to follow at the start. (Extract from field notes, 23 June
         2010).

    This impression of insecurity was supported by Sue's comment in our interview
in which she characterised Vera as "a bit shy".

    Yet, Vera had not chosen a safe and traditional topic but worked, encouraged
by her supervisor, at the periphery of what was possible under the wider umbrella
of sociology and within the specific subfields and neighbouring areas represented
in the department. She perceived it as connected to a more literary, impressionistic
approach which was familiar to her from her creative writing. At the same time,
her text was dense with abstract, sociological concepts. The interweaving of a more
literary style and more mainstream academic elements are particularly evident in
the following excerpt from her thesis. The passage is part of her introduction to a
section on the meaning of the beach as a constitutive element of seaside resorts:

                                                                                                      89

         There is a kite hovering skilfully in the sky, young children pad-
         dling in the pools that have settled full of seawater near the steps,
         a few people have dared to venture into the sea, but not as many
         as are in the pools. Some of the children, and the adults, are
         building sandcastles. In the paper "Building Castles in the
         Sand ...", Obrador-Pons wants to create a "livelier account of
         the beach that incorporates a sense of the ludic and the perfor-
         mative" (Obrador-Pons, 2009, p. 197). He argues that descrip-
         tions of the beach are focused on the visual; and that they are
         unable to fully explain the meaning of the beach. (Extract from
         Vera' thesis, p. 30)

    In the initial description of this extract Vera evokes the dynamicity of the
scene. People are involved in numerous activities. They paddle, venture and
build. There is a change in pace from the peaceful "hovering" and "paddling"
to the dramatic "venture." Starting with the wider scene, she zooms in on the
focus of this section. With this scene-setting based on her experience, Vera leads
into a discussion of an extended meaning of sandcastles orientated on academic
literature. She uses a direct quote and a paraphrase, standard conventions of ac-
ademic writing, to indicate different ways of theorizing the beach. This was not
just a story. Vera provided a theoretical discussion. As suggested by my observa-
tions above, Vera was clearly negotiating the boundaries between her experience
and expectations of what sociological work entailed and new possibilities that
had opened up for her gradually. Specifically during her master's course, she en-
countered and deepened her understanding of new research approaches through
participation in course modules, literature, conversations and guidance from her
supervisor.

    In our third meeting Vera spoke more confidently about her choices. When I
mentioned this to her, her mixed feelings towards her approach became apparent:

         V: It's probably because I've actually written the autoethnograph-
         ic--started the autoethnographic. Because that was the bit I was
         scared about.

         K: The stepping into the unknown.

         V: Yea. Yea. It was like, ok, let's take a great big jump into some-
         thing crazy. (Extract from interview 3).

    Vera acknowledges her initial insecurity. She talks about it in the past tense
indirectly acknowledging the change. She characterizes her work not just as some-
thing different and new, as I suggested, but also as "something crazy". Vera enjoyed

her fieldwork and her writing building on her creative work but she was also aware
that she was following a more risky route as she had not worked in this way before
academically and she did not consider her approach as mainstream.

VERA'S THESIS AS SPACE FOR DIALOGUE
AND NEGOTIATION OF STANDARDS

    As indicated in the acknowledgement, this "jump" was supported by her super-
visor, Sue. Vera appreciated that she had been asked many questions to clarify her
own interests. This seems to point to an open dialogue between supervisor and stu-
dent, a genuine engagement with the interests of the author (Theresa Lillis, 2003).
I did not have the opportunity to observe a supervision session as Sue felt it would
not be a good idea with Vera being shy. Nevertheless, the interviews with Vera and
Sue provide a number of insights into the nature of the dialogue that characterized
their relationship in supervision.

    A concrete example of how Vera felt supported by her supervisor, besides dis-
cussing literature and data was given in our second meeting. At that point, Vera had
written a draft of her first chapter and started to write about her methodology. She
had discussed her draft with Sue the day before. When we talked about the way she
wanted to approach the autoethnographic part, Vera commented on the previous
supervision:

         I said to [Sue] yesterday, I should have done a creative writing
         degree because she um she started reading it and she goes, oh,
         don't you write nicely. And I said, people have said that before.
         I should have done creative writing not, um, not sociology. And
         she said, well, in a way, sociology is creative writing and this is
         definitely creative writing. Because if I hadn't got some sort of--
         if I hadn't got an ability to write then I wouldn't be able to do an
         autoethnography at all. (Extract from interview 2)

    In this "small story" (Michael Bamberg & Alexandra Georgakopoulou, 2008;
James Simpson, 2011), Vera recounts a conversation about her writing on a me-
ta-level in which Sue complimented her style. For Vera this fitted with previous
comments on her writing and the pride she expressed in listing her past leisure
time writing in the previous interview. Moreover, she repeatedly characterized her
academic writing as less mainstream and underlined her enjoyment in playing with
words. Vera had encountered feminist approaches before. And she had read cri-
tiques and challenges of autoethnographic approaches. Thus, she was aware that
more than her experience in creative writing was required for her project. Sue did
not only encourage Vera in rejecting Vera's sense of insecurity but also linked cre-

                                                                                                      91

ative writing explicitly to sociology, specifically the methodological approach of
feminist-inspired autoethnography. With the above story, Vera demonstrated how
her desire to be creative in her writing matched the value system of the sub-disci-
pline in which she and her supervisor worked. In reporting her supervisor's speech,
she constructed an authoritative legitimation.

    On the other hand, it's clear that Vera also acted on her idea about existing
conventions that would still apply for her thesis. This aspect can be illustrated poi-
gnantly in an instance from our conversation about her draft in the second inter-
view. Looking at her draft, Vera quoted some language related feedback from Sue:

         V: "Don't use the word don't" and "paraphrase some quotes."
         Because it makes it sound better if I use "do not" or "`cannot."

         K: Ok.

         V: Which is a fair enough comment, really.

         K: Yea. Which is interesting though. Because it--it puts it back
         to kind of standard.

         V: Yea, well, that is the standard section, though. (Extract from
         interview 2)

    Here Vera immediately evaluates Sue's feedback by providing reason and agree-
ing. Although Sue's comments first of all refer to the surface structure of the text,
they reveal that in all its freedom there are still certain expectations that are shared
or easily accepted by Vera. When I voice my surprise about this convention, Vera
opens up a distinction between her initial two sections, which she identified as
"standard," and her autoethnography.

    Both Vera and Sue were aware of tensions between the possibilities afforded by
the approach and those afforded by the thesis as assignment format. They did not
discuss these differences explicitly--contrary to pedagogic initiatives based on an
academic literacies approach (see Mary Lea & Brian Street, 2006). Instead, Vera
had realized this because of the different purposes of sections in her thesis:

         I wanted that more traditional sociological bit so that it had still
         got, you know, some of the features of a real [thesis]. Because it
         needed the history in it and I don't think I could have done that
         autoethnographically and I don't think I could have done the re-
         search method bit autoethnographically. It had to be different. I
         just don't think it would have worked. (Extract from interview 3)

    Vera had a notion of a generic "traditional sociological" thesis formed through
a mixture of her undergraduate experience, her expectations, and the initial thesis

workshop in which general advice was given and sample theses discussed. Again,
she positioned her thesis as different, yet felt she needed to fulfil some require-
ments. She could not imagine introducing the background and the methods sec-
tion in an alternative way. Moreover, she could not imagine writing a thesis without
such elements. In her and Sue's understanding of the thesis, these were necessary.

    The idea of unconstrained creative writing was challenged even within her au-
toethnographic section. Vera listed in her thesis some features she found in the
literature to be included in an autoethnography such as reflexivity, others' voices
and theoretical analysis. These guidelines provided some orientation for her as a
novice in the field as well as a quotable legitimation for her approach: "It's cause I
do want it to be academically acceptable and I don't want them to turn round and
go, it's not." In this quote she also positions herself as less powerful than the faceless
"them," an institutional body who decides about academic acceptability. She felt
compelled to play to their rules but within the logic of her alternative approach.
Sue facilitated this experiment through encouragement and providing space for an
open dialogue. Vera's case demonstrates a two-way interaction between working
with more diverse approaches that become established at the periphery of main-
stream academia (Mary Hamilton & Kathy Pitt, 2009) as well as "accommodating
to institutional norms" (Mary Scott & Joan Turner, 2004, p. 146), more specifical-
ly, marking regimes and conventional expectations.

TRANSFORMATION IN THE LIGHT OF HISTORY,
FUTURE AND NORMATIVE STRUCTURES

    Vera's thesis was influenced by a plethora of factors some of which have been
discussed in this chapter. She expressed this point when looking back at her work:
"Well, I think I wouldn't have done it had I not been at [xx university]. I'd never
have done that," that is, she would never have considered drawing so extensively on
her experience and love for using language more playfully. She felt that possibilities
of knowledge making were opened up to her at this particular university in which
she completed her master's studies through the combination of people and theoret-
ical perspectives she encountered here. Her ability to use these possibilities for her
own purposes also depended on her interests as well as the practical experience and
knowledge she had acquired while participating in various writing-related activities
within and outside formal education. Building on these repertoires (Jan Blommaert
& Ad Backus, 2011) to the extent she did entailed reflections on the way she was
using language. Our interviews certainly contributed to this too.

    The format of one-to-one supervision sessions together with Sue's approach
provided space for Vera's specific interests and perspectives. Within the assessment
format of a thesis, Vera was able to make choices about her topic, her method-

                                                                                                      93

ological approach and her language. The specific way she chose to structure her
autoethnography, rejecting other possibilities, was intricately connected to who she
wanted to be in her work. After talking about the relations of her thesis to creative
writing, she half-jokingly explained how she wanted to write her autoethnography:
"I have got this like imaginary thing like vision in my head of me just some sort of
bohemian in a café on the seafront with my laptop". With the word "bohemian"
she signaled an imagined self as artist, underlining her affinity to creative work. She
could now see how to use this side of her as a resource for her academic work to
an extent she could never do before. Her approach, which emphasized a narrative
style, could incorporate this image.

    As there were possibilities, there were also constraints. Norms emerged in the
interplay of the requirement for the thesis to be assessed, Sue's notions of surface
features of academic texts, the values of the sub-discipline indexed in the guidelines
for autoethnographic research, and Vera's expectations of what a "real thesis" entails
(see also Badenhorst et al. Chapter 7 this volume). While each thesis is unique in
its specific constellation of activities influenced by a variety of historically situated
factors, these norms allow us to make sense of a piece of writing and to recognise a
"thesis" (Anis Bawarshi & Mary Jo Reiff, 2010). For instance, Vera started her au-
toethnographic section with a description of pondering questions that came to her
mind at her arrival at the seaside place. I immediately interpreted them as research
questions which she confirmed. While Vera's instantiation of a master's thesis con-
tributed to the constant evolution of understandings of what it is to do a thesis,
these changes are constrained through normative structures that govern what can
be imagined as a thesis. These norms derive from historically situated shared under-
standings of thesis practices, that is, activities, ways of writing and feelings that can
be accepted as belonging to what it is to do a thesis. These understandings also in-
clude practical knowledge of how to do something and are connected to a range of
goals and desires the order of which can shift from situation to situation (Schatzki,
1996). Explicit guidelines can therefore only be orientations and never capture
every possibility. Vera's choices and interpretations of advice made sense to her and
Sue as part of the thesis research and writing. Thus, Vera's case demonstrates that
master's theses can provide a space for negotiating alternative ways of knowledge
making within a complex web of activities, experiences, expectations and purposes
as well as notions of norms in academic writing.

THINKING CREATIVELY
ABOUT RESEARCH WRITING

      Cecile Badenhorst, Cecilia Moloney, Jennifer Dyer,
      Janna Rosales and Morgan Murray

    Writing is an essential requirement of any graduate student's programme. Over
the course of their graduate career a student will write hundreds of pages, much
of it for assessment purposes, and will be expected to do so in complex ways. Yet,
in spite of the centrality of writing to their academic success, formal instruction is
often uncommon. At many universities in Canada, in many cases, the only explicit
writing instruction graduate students will have received by the time they complete
their programme is a requisite undergraduate English Literature course, possibly
an English Second Language class for international students, and perhaps a visit
with a peer-tutor at an overworked writing centre. For the most part, learning to
write academically takes place, or is expected to take place, implicitly. However, in
a context where language, genre, and stylistic conventions are governed by disci-
plinary norms that are constituted by competing and conflicting discourses, im-
plicit learning becomes problematic. What counts as evidence, for example, will be
different in philosophy and anthropology. Many of the conventions and norms of
academic writing are subtle even for experienced writers, yet students are expected
to learn and practice them without explicit instruction (Sharon Parry, 1998). From
an academic literacies approach, we argue that academic writing is a social practice
constituted by prevailing ideologies (Theresa Lillis & Mary Scott, 2007), rather
than a transparent generic skill.

    The purpose of this pedagogic intervention was to offer an intensive co-curric-
ular, multi-day (7) workshop to graduate students on "thinking creatively about
research." The workshop was developed from an academic literacies perspective
and had a central focus of explicit pedagogy. Memorial University is the only
university in Newfoundland and Labrador, Canada and has some 17,000 students
enrolled annually. The university is situated in St John's on the remote island of
Newfoundland. There are few opportunities for graduate academic development
and our team proposed "thinking creatively about research" to introduce a more
collegial and interactive approach to research writing than was currently being
experienced. We conceptualized "creatively" as different, new, and innovative.

We applied for and received funding to pilot the workshop in two faculties. We
then invited a volunteer cohort of students from Memorial University's Graduate
Program in Humanities and the Faculty of Arts in Fall 2011 (nine participants)
and a second offering occurred in Winter 2012 with graduate students from the
Faculty of Engineering and Applied Science (13 participants). In this chapter, we
focus on the Arts cohort. The majority of those who attended were international
students from Eastern Europe, China and South America, others were from main-
land Canada and only a few were local. All the students attended the workshop
voluntarily in addition to their regular coursework and teaching duties. Students
in the Arts cohort came from Philosophy, Anthropology, Music, and the inter-dis-
ciplinary graduate programme. The evaluation of the intervention was framed by
one overarching question: Did students find the pedagogy to be transformative
and empowering in their approach to research writing? (For overview of workshop
schedule, see Table 7.1.)

TRANSFORMATIVE PEDAGOGIES

    Antonio Gramsci (1971), Michel Foucault (1995) and Paulo Freire (1986) have
all argued that certain ways of thinking and doing become dominant over time,
and begin to appear as natural parts of our taken-for-granted world. Transformative
education, which challenges the normalizing forces inherent in most education, has
two complementary components. First, it allows the individual to learn new ways
of "seeing" the world, and to act upon that. Second, it makes visible the tension
created between living within the system but thinking outside it; from contending
with issues on a daily basis while, at the same time, moving incrementally towards
something new (Peter Mayo, 1999).

    Like other practices in academic environments, writing is shaped by accepted
"norms" of particular disciplinary discourses. There are rules that govern how to
cite, what to cite, what questions to ask, and what constitutes an acceptable an-
swer (Robin Lakoff, 1990). Lakoff (1990) further argues that academic language is
oblique and implicitly understood practices maintain the exclusivity and authority
of the discourse, distinguishing those who understand discourse conventions from
"others" who do not. Writing assessment practices that require students to repro-
duce the "voice" of the discourse in their writing often "militate against creativity
and individuality" (Liz Cain & Ian Pople, 2011, p. 49). Rather than exploring
innovation in their research and writing, students find themselves trying to act as
ventriloquists for their disciplines (Amanda Fulford, 2009).

    Dealing with this problem from an academic literacies perspective, this project
uses a pedagogy of explicit instruction, and non-traditional approaches to research
writing in an attempt to open students' eyes to their positions and roles within their
respective disciplinary discourses, and provide them with a range of techniques and

perspectives to allow them to engage the tension of living inside the system but
thinking outside it.

THE WORKSHOPS

    The 7-morning workshop was based on a curriculum developed at a South Afri-
can university in a context of transformation and change in higher education. The
curriculum was encapsulated in a book (Cecile Badenhorst, 2007); the workshops
for the Faculty of Arts cohort were adapted from this source. The workshop takes
a participant--who has already started their graduate research and has collected
data or achieved some results from this research--through the process of research
writing from conceptualization to final draft. There are two parts to the workshop
to simulate two stages in the writing process: composition (Part 1: four consecutive
mornings) and revision (Part 2: three consecutive mornings) with homework as-
signed after each morning's workshop. Between the two parts, participants had a
month to write the first draft of their chosen research project. While we emphasized
the iterative and recursive nature of writing, we found the two part structure useful
for focusing on specific issues. Three key questions informed the design of the ped-
agogy and shaped the activities and materials:

      1. What does the writer need to know about academic and research dis-
         courses?

      2. What does the writer need to know about writing and creativity?
      3. What does the writer need to understand about him/herself as an aca-

         demic researcher/writer?

    These questions guided the content, materials and activities. The pedagogy
was experiential (David Kolb, 1984). Participants were given information often
in the form of examples, research articles, and theories to deconstruct; they then
had to apply what they had learned; they reflected individually and in groups; then
they extracted key learning points and reapplied this in new learning situations.
The curriculum was continuously spiralling and hermeneutical. For example, an
issue such as "extracting a focus from the complexity of their research topics" was
introduced in the morning, participants would complete an activity on it in class,
they would read their activity to the group and the group would give feedback.
The students then applied that activity to their research in the homework activi-
ties. That homework was debriefed in groups the following morning and learning
was mediated again by the facilitator after the group work. The following day's
activities built on the previous day's ones. All activities contained scaffolding--
mini-activities that built on one another--to cultivate participant confidence:
developing a safe environment was an important element, as were group work
and dialogue.

                                                                                                      99
Badenhorst, Moloney, Dyer, Rosales and Murray

    Each workshop morning was divided into three sections (see Table 7.1). In
Part 1, through dialogue, activities, and handouts (research articles, samples of re-
search writing) participants each day discussed issues such as academic discourses
(e.g., what counts as evidence in different disciplines, how arguments work, re-
search writing genres and so on) and they were taken through theories on writing
(e.g., writing as a process, what goes into writing, why writing is so difficult, how
self-criticism can paralyze a writer, how academic writing is situated in a discourse
of criticism and what constitutes a writing identity). Although we provided infor-
mation on current research in this area, for example, work on disciplinarity by Ken
Hyland (2008), our purpose was not to present "best practices" or solutions but
rather to allow participants to develop an understanding of the epistemological
nature of academic writing and to allow them to decide how they would write from
the range of choices we presented. The final part of the day was devoted to "play."
Play was important to the pedagogy because it encouraged participants to move out
of their usual ways of writing and thinking. The play activities used concept map-
ping, free-writing and sketching to revise sections or thinking in their drafts and
involved activities to do with developing authority in writing, seeing research from

different points of view, trying out different voices, thinking about representation
in the research (who we are representing, how and why). An example of "play" ac-
tivity was to free-write about the research from the subject's point of view (e.g., the
participant, the organization, the document) or to sketch a research project as if it
were on a stage in a theatre

    Part 2 followed the same pedagogy and emphasis on play. The focus in this sec-
tion was on revision, structure and coherence, and the discourses around producing
a finished product in a particular discipline. We also engaged with the emotional
aspects of writing such as dealing with criticism, how to give and get feedback and
what to do with feedback.

STUDENTS' EXPERIENCES

    While there is much that can be said about these workshops, the participants
and the pedagogy, we have chosen to focus on how explicit instruction and play
lead to transformative learning since we feel these were catalyst elements.

Explicit Instruction

    Explicit instruction is most often used to make the invisibility of assessment
more visible in education but as Sally Mitchell (2010) has argued the intentions of
transparency are not always seen in the outcomes. Making assessment criteria clear
can lead to a compliance attitude where the student focuses on the criteria and not
on the learning task. This workshop was not assessed and we felt that explicit in-
struction--essentially a meta-instruction about activities--would promote dialogue
and discussion. For example, when we proposed an activity, we asked students: Why
have we included this activity? Why do we need to know this? We were explic-
it about the nature of academic discourses, about the pedagogy and about what
we asked them to do. We provided no answers or solutions (since there are none)
but allowed students to find their way through dialogue. For many students, their
intuitive writing practices were at odds with the way they thought they ought to
write as academics. The explicit instruction highlighted the epistemological nature
of writing and how it is tied to particular perceptions of knowledge, some of which
are privileged in university contexts. This allowed participants to see that there was
no "wrong" way to write but rather there were choices about whether to conform,
how much to conform or if to conform at all. Rather than "fixing" writing that was
"weak" or "poor," we emphasized understanding their particular discourse/audience
requirements and then making decisions based on their own epistemologies and
power base. The following student comments, written during the workshop, illus-
trate a growing awareness of their own writing. These direct quotes from workshop
participants are included with permission. All names have been changed:

                                                                                                    101

         This class is interesting because it helps me to realize the way I
         write is not wrong. (Charlie, 5)

         I learned a fair deal about the writing process ... which was a
         pleasant surprise. (Ernest, 5)

    We also emphasized that they could make choices about what they wrote about.
This is where they could be innovative, creative and original. For many students, it
was a relief to feel that there was a choice after years of being squeezed into a mould
and not being allowed to do things differently:

         Yesterday's workshop was interesting to me because things started
         coming to me quicker than they usually do. At one point during
         our exercises I stopped thinking about what I was going to say
         about myself and my research and just wrote. I think I'm getting
         to a more honest place regarding where I'm at. (Veronica, 9)

    We discussed the consequences of challenging disciplinary ways of writing, why
one would want to do that and what the alternatives were. We related these discus-
sions to their position in the discourse, and their roles in the university. We partic-
ularly focused on their identity as researchers and writers and how research writing
was tied into developing an identity as a researcher/writer (Frances Kelly, Marcia
Russell & Lee Wallace, 2011). We asked them to free-write about their identity, to
sketch themselves in relation to their research and to constantly reflect on them-
selves, their research topic and their goals with this research project. The following
comments indicate a re-connection with themselves as researchers:

         In my research and writing I have noticed that it is getting easier
         to focus on what I am looking for and what I want to say. I
         think I am going to start getting up early to do a little sketching
         in the morning so that I can give my mind a chance to warm up
         before I tackle things like Heidegger or Kant or God knows who
         else. (Veronica, 12)

         It's not that I discovered a magic formula to get rid of my aca-
         demic obligations. But I realized I can commit to what I want to
         do, find my way and do it. I find that the ... discussions really
         help. (Jaromil, 11)

The Importance of Play

    Play was a central component of the pedagogy for two reasons. First, the ele-
ment of play allowed participants to move out of their usual way of writing and

102
                                                                                             Thinking Creatively

thinking; and second, we wanted students to have "flow" experiences while writ-
ing. "Flow," argues psychologist Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi (1990), is an optimal
experience that happens when people experience feelings of intense concentration
and deep enjoyment. For the play activities we used metaphor, "illogical" ques-
tions about their research, concept mapping (Tony Buzan & Barry Buzan, 2006),
free writing (Peter Elbow, 1973) and sketching (Yeoryia Manolopoulou, 2005).
Participants enjoyed the coloured blank paper and coloured felt markers they
were given to work with. We explained to participants that like the Billy Collins
poem "Introduction to poetry" (Collins, 1996; also available at http://..loc.gov/
poetry/180/001.html), we wanted them to drop a mouse in their research and see
which way it ran, or to hold their research up to the light like a prism and watch the
colors changing. We did not want them to tie their research in a chair and torture
the truth out of it. Although sceptical and hesitant at first, students soon embraced
"play" enthusiastically. They found that play allowed them to focus on ideas rather
than rules and conventions. New and novel ways of looking at their research made
them feel unique and showed them that they had something worthwhile to say, as
these quotes illustrate:

         Some of the activities opened my eyes to the potential of creativ-
         ity in [academic] writing that I had not thought possible. (Tip,
         5)

         I thought about the problem [in] my problem statement, trying
         to pinpoint something out of several problems. We played with
         words and images, which was a fun way to deal with the task on
         hand. I don't know if these words and images are going to guide
         me toward clearer words or statements or even clearer ideas but
         they're there. (Sasha, 9)

TRANSFORMATIVE LEARNING

    It is difficult to assess if an intervention results in transformation and we
would not want to claim that a series of seven morning workshops over two
months could generate such results. The process of transformative learning is
often difficult to measure because it includes complex experiences that involve
"cognitive questioning, invested deliberation, contradictions, new possibilities,
risk-taking, and resolution" (Kathleen King, 2005, p. 92). It also includes de-
veloping confidence and self-efficacy in a particular domain. Our key evaluative
tool was the students themselves and the writing they produced. We found that
participants did leave the workshop with a new sense of themselves and their
position within the system in which they worked. Our aim was not to change
their epistemologies, but to open them to their own ontological and epistemolog-

                                                                                                    103
Badenhorst, Moloney, Dyer, Rosales and Murray

ical claims in their research and the epistemologies inherent in the writing tasks
they were asked to do on a daily basis (Badenhorst, 2008). Participants discussed
the myriad components of research such as conceptualizing research, designing
a research project, developing a methodology, collecting data, analyzing data,
synthesizing results and evaluating research contributions--not as generic con-
cepts--rather as conceptions of what constitutes knowledge and what knowledge
is valued. They recognized the tension of working inside the system while think-
ing outside it--but that the choice of action was their decision. The following
quotes indicate this growing awareness:

         The workshop helped me to see where I stand in relation to my
         thesis. (Kei, 11)

         What surprised me the most about my writing during the break
         [the break between the two parts of the workshop] was how sta-
         ble it felt. I wrote a little almost every day and it developed into
         something good and less stressful even though there were still
         some things I hadn't figured out. (Veronica, 37)

         What surprised me was that I actually understood what was
         going on, rather than writing in a lost way. (Farah, 38)

    We discussed disciplinary norms regarding citations, evidence, authority and
expectations regarding graduate writing. Towards the end of the workshop, this
is what students articulated about the practical application of writing within a
discipline:

         I was surprised at the very useful conceptual map (very colour-
         ful), which was the base of a successful and productive meeting
         with my supervisor. (Jaromil, 5)

         My supervisor has noted that I am beginning to write with more
         clarity or at least it is the best quality I have produced after two
         years. (Evals, 2)

         I realized my methodology, my area of inquiry [was] arts-based
         research. This has changed completely my understanding of what
         I would do if I continue [with] a PhD (Evals, 8)

CONCLUSION

    Ultimately, our aim was to explore how the pedagogic intervention manifested
in practical changes and to understand the choices participants made in relation to
their disciplinary writing and perhaps even to see how this extended even further

104
                                                                                             Thinking Creatively

to other actors in the institution, such as research supervisors. To this end we are
conducting in-depth interviews with students who participated in the workshops.
This chapter's focus centred on the pedagogic intervention, particularly the ele-
ments of explicit instruction and play. The most interesting conclusion we drew
from the intervention was the difficulty students faced when we could not provide
them with a right or wrong answer to an activity. Used to being rule-bound, par-
ticipants found themselves faced with unending possibilities. This same difficul-
ty became their opening to innovation, enjoyment and insight. Rules were not
abolished but revealed. The purpose of revealing the rules was not only to enable
students to succeed but to allow them to make choices about how they wanted to
succeed. The explicit instruction did not focus only on "best practice" or templates
of conventions but on opening up critical dialogue and complex questioning about
research and writing in disciplinary discourses. Through dialogue, intense writing
and play, participants began to experience change in their approach to writing,
the way they saw themselves as writers and their perceptions of writing research.
While we cannot unreservedly label this "transformational," this research indicates
that students did experience incremental movements towards something new. The
following comment indicates the elusive nature of this change:

         I've barely had time to think over the past four days, and haven't
         really had time to do the [workshop] homework due to a lot
         of other obligations, yet when I finally got home from campus
         last night at 11p.m. and sat down to relax for a minute, I felt
         compelled to write, and not with any intent in mind or for any
         academic purpose and what came out was a kind of problem
         narrative of what I'm working on in a way I had never remotely
         conceived of before. (Neville, 11)

DISCIPLINED VOICES,
DISCIPLINED FEELINGS:
EXPLORING CONSTRAINTS AND
CHOICES IN A THESIS WRITING
CIRCLE

      Kate Chanock, Sylvia Whitmore and Makiko Nishitani

    Each author has contributed to this account, but we do not attempt to speak
with one voice, for we occupy different positions in the university and come from
different perspectives, as will be seen. To avoid confusion, therefore, Kate has pro-
duced an "I" narrative in which Sylvia and Makiko speak within quotation marks.
All of us have then considered and amended the resulting article before submitting
it for publication.

    When Mary Lea and Brian Street articulated the concept of Academic Literacies,
it spoke to the concerns of many Australian teachers of what was then, and still is
now, known generally as academic skills (a role with various labels, but most often
"Learning Advisers"). Although we were employed to impart the habits, forms, and
conventions of academic performance, we resisted the delineation of our role as
"study skills" support. The "how-to" focus was neither pedagogically effective nor
intellectually persuasive, and (led by Gordon Taylor et al., 1988) many of us were
re-framing our teaching to start with the "why-to"--the purposes and values un-
derlying the diverse forms, practices and language of academic work encountered
in the disciplines. Such teaching can, however, remain "assimilationist," supporting
students to produce writing that is "a demonstration of the acquisition of institu-
tional, subject or disciplinary knowledge and insiderdom," without questioning the
context within which this all takes place (David Russell, Mary Lea, Jan Parker, Brian
Street, & Christiane Donahue, 2009, pp. 411-412). When Learning Advisers are
asked to work with students to improve their "academic literacies," it is usually in
conjunction with courses that discipline students and their writing in both senses of
"discipline," that is, control and intellectual training (Russell et al., 2009, p. 413).

    It is possible, however, in some classes that focus on writing in or across par-
ticular fields, to find ways to talk about what the conventions enable and what

they constrain, and how much room there may be for "informed choice". It is this
effort at opening up spaces in which we can encourage "informed choice" that we
consider transformatory. This is an account of one such discussion, in the context
of a Thesis Writing Circle for research students in the Faculty of Humanities and
Social Sciences at an Australian university, to which the authors (the staff conve-
nor, and two student members) belong--an example of an "alternative [space] for
writing and meaning making in the academy" (Russell et al., 2009, p. 404, citing
Theresa Lillis, 2006; for discussions of the purposes and benefits of writing circles,
see Claire Aitchison & Alison Lee, 2006; Wendy Larcombe, Anthony McCosker,
& Kieran O'Loughlin, 2007). For students engaged in the high-stakes enterprise
of writing a thesis, where everything depends upon its acceptance by a few autho-
rized and authorizing readers, the writing circle provides an alternative readership
of people who are unconcerned with how the writing reflects on the writer (or the
supervisor) in terms of mastery of content, theory or method, but who focus in-
stead on how satisfying their texts can be for both writer and reader. This involves
negotiating with each other on many levels simultaneously, about the grammar and
punctuation, the sound and feel, the clarity and comprehensibility of their texts;
and it suggests ways of negotiating further with supervisors about the possibilities
that these discussions identify.

    What I contribute, from a background in Applied Linguistics and long exposure
to the faculty's disciplinary cultures and discourses, is what Sara Cotterall describes
as "a guide who can help demystify the writing process and provide opportunities
to discuss and experience different ways of writing" (2011, p. 415). Following my
invitation on the faculty's postgraduate email list, interested students decided to
meet fortnightly for an hour to share and respond to one another's writing. Our
meetings follow participants' concerns, either flagged in the email accompanying
their 1,000-word submissions, or arising in discussion at the meetings. These dis-
cussions exemplify the distinction Theresa Lillis has described between evaluative
"feedback" focussing on "the student's written text as a product," and "talkback,"
which focuses on the "text in process," and recognizes "the partial nature of any
text and hence the range of potential meanings, [in] an attempt to open up space
where the student-writer can say what she likes and doesn't like about her writing"
(2003, p. 204).

    Our circle had been meeting only a few weeks, and several students had ex-
pressed an interest in knowing more about "voice," when Sylvia, whose turn it
was to submit a piece for response, asked us to think about whether her writing
was "pedestrian." This concern arose, she explains, because "I have always been
extremely careful in my writing to ensure that I have not embellished or distorted
archaeological evidence. Therefore (although perhaps not always consciously), I
have generally avoided the use of the first person to prevent falling into the trap
of becoming "too creative," particularly if the subject matter is not associated with

108
                                                                      Disciplined Voices, Disciplined Feelings

direct personal experience." Sylvia's piece was, in fact, an exemplary piece of archae-
ological discussion, and it was probably fortunate that the second piece submitted
that week, by Makiko, was very different, while also very appropriate for her dis-
cipline of anthropology. The texts suggested, and the discussion confirmed, that
we were looking at "disciplined" voices, about which the writers had "disciplined"
feelings. Their contrasts afforded a way of approaching Sylvia's question in terms
of academic literacies, rather than in terms of a personal style derived simply from
personality and constrained only by taste.

    On receipt of both submissions I circulated an email ahead of that week's meet-
ing, suggesting questions the members might like to bear in mind while reading
them:

      · Whose voices do we hear in each text?
      · What is the relationship of the writer to the objects she's investigating?
      · Is this different in different disciplines?

         In other words, how far is the writer's presence in, or absence from, the
         text a matter of personal choice and how far is it a convention of the dis-
         cipline? Why do different disciplines have different conventions about
         this? (And do they change, and if so, why?)

    I also attached a handout looking at voice as a constrained choice via a com-
parison of theses in different disciplines, and different sections within the same
thesis, to facilitate consideration of how much choice a writer has (for full details of
handout, see Chanock, 2007; for extracts see Figure 8.1). I included extracts from
the writing of one writer who, while including a very unconventional, narrative
and even lyrical "Prologue" in his front matter, had placed before it a highly con-
ventional, analytical thesis "Summary" which would serve to reassure his examiners
about his academic competence--absent from his published book (Christopher
Houston, 2001) although the Prologue remains (a paragraph from each is shown
in Figure 8.1).

    Drawing on discussions of these examples and students' own writing, it was
possible at the writing circle meeting to identify what it was about Sylvia's and
Makiko's pieces that shaped the "voice" we heard as we read them. In Extracts 1 and
2, which are selected because each one explains a decision the researcher has made
in relation to her analysis, I have indicated the features on which our discussion
focussed, by putting grammatical subjects in bold and verbs in italics. I used the
same "marking up" in copies I distributed to the writing circle members ahead of
our discussion of these pieces.

    In Sylvia's piece, which was an explication of the meaning of a particular month,
the wayeb', in the ancient Mayan calendar, the voice was formal, impersonal, and
distant. This distance, from both her object of study and her readers, was created
by particular language choices: a technical vocabulary, use of third person only, and

                                                                                                    109

    Summary
        This thesis examines the Islamist political movement in Turkey, with special reference to
        its activities in Istanbul where I did my fieldwork from October 1994 to December 1996.
        The thesis identifies the particular characteristics of political Islam in the Turkish context.
        The movement's situating of itself in opposition to the enforced civilizing project of the
        Turkish Republic is argued to be the key to understanding its politics.

a preference for passive verbs, with processes, practices, ideas, or texts more likely
than people to be the grammatical subject of her clauses. Together, these choices
created an objective stance congruent with the ethos of Sylvia's discipline, in which
it is the object of study, not the researcher, that is the focus at all times. (Archaeolo-
gy has developed, over the last hundred years, from an amateur pursuit to a science,
and it seems possible that its avoidance of subjective language may reflect the desire
to put its origins behind it.) In these extracts, ellipsis indicates minor factual details

Extract 1: From Sylvia's Writing

         The most intriguing month in the Haab' calendar is the
         wayeb' .... The wayeb' was perceived by the Maya and the
         Mexicans who had a similar calendar, as an "unlucky and dan-
         gerous" period (Tozzer, 1941, p. 134; Boone, 2007, p. 17). This
         reaction has been documented by Landa and the other Spanish
         priests who had the opportunity to observe the behavior of the
         indigenous population after the Spanish conquest (Landa in
         Tozzer, 1941; Durán, 1971, p. 395, pp. 469-470). The wayeb'
         represented the transitional stage between the old year and the
         ensuing New Year. Hence, this short five day month also had
         cosmological associations for the Maya. The intention of this
         section is not to present an analysis of the entire New Year festi-
         val, but to focus on the transitional stage of the wayeb' because
         of the perceived negativity and danger associated with these five

         days. Wayeb' events relating to period endings, rituals, a death,
         an intriguing accession and a birth date, have been detected in
         the Maya inscriptions researched for this dissertation. Further-
         more, it is known that the contemporary Kiché Maya still regard
         the five days of the wayeb' as ominous (Tedlock, 1992, p. 100).
         The wayeb' has an obvious literal meaning in relation to time.
         However, it is apparent that this short five day month is also
         associated with a profound metaphorical dimension connected
         with transition and change.

    Makiko's piece for anthropology, in contrast to Sylvia's analytical treatment of
her material, presented a narrative of Makiko's decision to use a particular term to
describe the people she had chosen to study. The writing was relatively informal,
personal, and engaging, an effect created, again, by particular language choices:
largely everyday vocabulary, first person narration, and active verbs whose subjects
were most often people (indeed, twelve of these are "I," the researcher herself ). The
most striking contrast with Sylvia's piece was that, in Makiko's, the subjectivity of
the researcher was explicitly reflected upon, as an integral part of the object and
process of study.

Extract 2: From Makiko's Writing

         Throughout my thesis, I call my main participants, women of
         Tongan descent in their twenties and early thirties, girls which is
         a native term in a sense that other people at Tongan churches or
         people in different age groups or men's groups call them girls ....
         The reason why I employ a non-cultural or non-ethnic term to
         refer to them is derived from my bitter experience when I had
         just started my fieldwork in the late 2006. I attended a Tongan
         church regularly to broaden my network among the congrega-
         tion so that I could ask people to participate in my research. At
         that time, I explained to people that I was studying about Ton-
         gans in Australia. Then, a girl in her twenties responded by asking
         me, "Oh, so you think I'm Tongan?" This was one of my em-
         barrassing moments because I felt like my naïve stance had been
         revealed even though I had read about how identities of children
         of migrants were diverse and often located in between where
         they live and Tonga. During my fieldwork, I actually encountered
         similar questions several times, especially when I wanted to talk
         to people who distanced themselves from Tongan gatherings. So
         what else can I call them?

                                                                                                    111

    The consensus of the writing circle was that Makiko's writing was livelier and
more accessible than Sylvia's, but interestingly, members had different feelings
about the language choices that made it so. Some admired the accessible first per-
son narration of the writer's dilemma and its resolution; one member commented
"from my film and media background," on the way in which "voice" in a piece of
writing possibly creates pictures in reader's mind. "... I see [Makiko] talking direct-
ly to me (as TV presenters do) as well as see the moving images of her field work,
her experiences and relations to research participants. I can imagine I walk behind
her to the community." Others, however, were uncomfortable with the anecdotal
and personal character of the writing, which they felt would undermine their au-
thority and be unacceptable to readers.

    In fact, neither of these students' discursive "voices" was unconstrained, despite
the apparent freedom of Makiko's writing, for as Makiko confirmed in the discus-
sion, it is part of the ethos of anthropology that the writer should reflect upon her
own position in, and therefore influence on, the research she is reporting. Many
scholars have remarked upon students' acquisition of a disciplined voice apparently
by osmosis from the discussions they read and hear, a discourse that is "privileged,
expected, cultivated, [and] conventionalized" (Patricia Duff, 2010, p. 175; see also
Tony Becher & Ludwig Huber, 1990, p. 237; Sharon Parry, 1998). Both Sylvia and
Makiko had evidently internalized a disciplined voice, which they experienced as
more or less "transparent," to use David Russell's (2002) expression. Russell argues
that because researchers' apprenticeship to the discourse of their discipline is grad-
ual, their writing seems to them like "a transparent recording of speech or thought"
rather than "a complex rhetorical activity, embedded in the differentiated practices
of academic discourse communities" (Russell, 2002, p. 9).

    The writing circle, however, created a space in which members could examine
how their academic socialization had shaped their writing. It is this recognition
of, and reflection upon, their own socialization as manifested in their writing that
takes the discussion beyond that socialization and into the territory of Academic
Literacies. It has been observed elsewhere that mixed disciplinary membership in
writing groups proves very useful to participants because "it gives them other dis-
ciplinary examples against which they can position their experience of writing and
allows them to make explicit issues and ideas that have been largely tacit" (Phyllis
Creme & Colleen McKenna, 2010, p. 164; cf. Denise Cuthbert, Ceridwen Spark,
& Eliza Burke, 2009; Ken Hyland, 2002, p. 393).

    Makiko's reflections very much confirm this:

         Until I attended the writing circle, I had little idea about the
         diverse styles and voices among different disciplines. The mixed
         reaction toward my subjective writing in the circle surprised me
         because I had never thought that the way I wrote was difficult to

112
                                                                      Disciplined Voices, Disciplined Feelings

         be accepted by people from different disciplines. Having majored
         only in anthropology since my undergraduate course, I think I
         naturally learned the appropriate styles without acknowledging
         that different disciplines have different styles. Of course, my
         thesis is not comprised of personal accounts: in some reflexive
         sections I use many subjective words, and in the other part which
         shows my research data, I write in rather impersonal ways. Since
         I had unconsciously written in different styles, the experience in
         the inter-disciplinary group led me discover the difference, and
         changed my perspective when I write. After the session, I became
         more conscious about my use of words, and started to think more
         about how potential readers would see the way I write.

    In considering the pieces discussed in the meeting on which this chapter focuss-
es, Sylvia and Makiko found that they appreciated the "fit" between their authorial
voice and the ethos of their discipline. One minor aspect Sylvia decided to change
was the repetition of "month" as the subject of so many of her clauses; but for the
purpose of this passage justifying her choice of focus, she opted to preserve the
authority that she felt derived from an objective voice (cf. Creme & McKenna,
2010, p. 162).

    If exploring the constraints and choices involved in academic writing some-
times serves to make it more "internally persuasive" (Mikhail Bakhtin, 1981), as
on this occasion, does this mean that the activity has failed to be transformative? I
do not think so, for the discussion itself creates a space for thinking more deliber-
ately about voice. In so doing, it enables the goals of "academic literacies": to make
writing less "transparent" and to raise awareness of the multiple, yet constrained,
possibilities for expression. Sylvia was satisfied that her "demonstration of ... in-
siderdom" was at the same time "a personal act of meaning making" (Russell et al.,
2009, p. 413). However, in exploring alternatives, the group acquired the linguistic
tools (such as the options of active or passive voice, concrete grammatical subjects
or abstract nominalizations, first or third person, narrative or analysis, technical or
lay vocabulary) to change their voice if any of them decide they want to--including
Sylvia, who writes:

         Through the analysis and discussion of each other's work by the
         students in this multi-disciplined group, I have become more
         aware of the impact of one's writing style on the reader. It is
         apparent that the level of creative "control" in writing varies
         according to the discipline, with some subjects such as Media
         Studies enabling a greater level of freedom. Nevertheless, the
         feedback has helped me to improve the creativity in my writing

                                                                                                    113
Chanock, Whitmore and Nishitani

         and not to be afraid of including my own "voice" where appro-
         priate.

    We see this, indeed, in a subsequent piece, where Sylvia takes first-person own-
ership of some reservations about her sources:

         I found it surprising that there is not a greater level of compati-
         bility between Sahagún's auguries for the first days of the trecenas
         and those of the Telleriano-Remensis .... I consider there are
         some questionable aspects associated with the Telleriano-Remen-
         sis. For instance, in the section relating to the veintenas .... From
         my perspective, this indicates a surprising lack of understanding
         of this "unlucky" month and does call into question the reliability
         of some of the scribes and artists associated with this work.

    Since the writing circle discussion on which this article focuses, our circle has
talked about such strategies of negotiation as asking supervisors for their views
on particular language choices; writing two versions for supervisors' consideration;
voicing an oral presentation differently from a written chapter; or postponing ex-
perimentation in the belief that later, as "licensed" scholars, they will be able to
take more risks. Research students are already well aware of their liminal status in
the scholarly community, and the power relations surrounding their candidature;
what the writing circle gives them is an awareness of the technology of expression,
the interplay of discipline socialization and individual desires and aspirations, and
the social nature of what can otherwise seem like individual concerns (see Kaufhold
Chapter 8 this volume). What is transformative about the writing circle is not that
it makes people write differently (although it may); but that instead of thinking of
writers and writing as good or bad, they are thinking of both as situated. "Informed
choice," in this context, is informed by a greater understanding of how they are sit-
uated by disciplinary voices (see also Horner and Lillis, Reflections 4 this volume).

HOW CAN THE TEXT BE EVERYTHING?

REFLECTING ON ACADEMIC LIFE

AND LITERACIES

      Sally Mitchell talking with Mary Scott

        One of the tenets of Academic Literacies research is recognition of the per-
        sonal resources that an individual brings to any situation, practice, or text.
        In any inquiry the student writer is not bracketed off from the object that
        she or he produces. Students bring to their writing and study, experiences,
        values, attitudes, thoughts which are personal as well as "academic" or "dis-
        ciplinary"--though they sometimes struggle to negotiate these, and can be
        constrained by the ways in which discourses silence as well as give voice to
        individual meaning-making. As for students, so, of course, for all of us ...

        In this piece Sally Mitchell reflects on a conversation with Mary Scott, one
        of the key participants in the development of Academic Literacies as a field,
        and explores what personal trajectories and biographical details can suggest
        about how a disciplinary (disciplined, theorized, academic) stance and ethos
        can develop.

    Mary Scott (2013a) has recently written a personal, theorized account of her
involvement, as a teacher and researcher, with the writing of university students.
She frames this journey, which has taken place over a number of years, as "learning
to read student writing differently". I was interested to talk to her about this, and
how her biographies--personal, intellectual, professional and institutional--have
shaped her thinking and work as someone who, if we think of Academic Literacies
as a grouping of certain interrelated people, as much as interrelated ideas--is a key
figure. The relationship between people and ideas--peopled ideas--seems signifi-
cant, perhaps particularly when we are talking about a field which is also a profes-
sion and a practice. Certainly important texts in Academic Literacies explicitly use
who the authors are, and where they have come from as part of what they have to
say (I'm thinking of Roz Ivanic and Theresa Lillis both who drew on practice to
begin theorizing).

    When Mary opened our conversation by sharing what's new in the field--the
idea of superdiversity--she talked about how the idea is being tested and contested
by various players, differently located geographically and theoretically, politically
Mitchell with Scott

and temperamentally. Her interest is in seeing new knowledge as developing, multi-
ply influenced and as voiced, rather than as "presented," self-contained and abstract.
This stance lies behind Mary's email list which distributes information to colleagues
across the world about conferences, books and talks, as well as in the more ground-
ed termly meetings she has hosted since the early/mid 1990s at the Institute of
Education in London. Both are characterized more by their sense of plurality and
capacity than by a particular framing. "I wanted [them] not to be doctrinaire," she
says.

    Mary studied for her first BA in English and Latin at Rhodes University, South
Africa. This was followed by a postgraduate year for which she received a BA hon-
ours in English Literature. (The shifting meaning of university qualifications is a
significant theme in the conversation). At Rhodes, she had an "inspirational" tutor,
Guy Butler, who was also a poet. He wrote a poem called "Cape Coloured Bats-
man" when he was in the army in Italy, and was subsequently criticized for having
neo-colonialist views: "It was the first time anybody had written a sympathetic
poem about a colored man, but he wouldn't write it now." "Views," then, are not
the sole property of individuals; they are caught up in time, part of social, polit-
ical, historical moments and movements. So, for example, Butler set up a Study
of English in Africa Centre, and it takes me a while to realize there might be any
progressive significance to this; to me, it doesn't sound progressive at all--per-
haps the opposite. But Butler was challenging the assumption that English meant
British English taught in South Africa mainly by academics from Britain--a kind
of colonialism within colonialism. Mary herself was entangled with this struggle
over language and nation. She was "British by descent" and, at age 16, to fund
her study she was given a grant by the "Sons of England Patriot and Benevolent
Society" which committed her to teaching English in schools for three years. The
Society was concerned at a shortage of good English teachers: "Afrikaans would
take over, English would be excluded". The economic hand-up committed her to
more than safeguarding English in schools however; it marked her positioning in
English-Afrikaans politics. More or less the contract was: "Now if we give you this
money ... you'll teach for three years--will you promise us you'll never vote for the
Nationalist government?"

    Having paid her dues teaching English (in fact it was largely Latin which the
schools thought was more of a rarity), Mary took up an invitation from Guy Butler
to return to Rhodes and teach--"poetry, drama, rather than the novel." Other pres-
sures then saw her move to Cape Town; her father in particular was anxious that
she should get a professional qualification and she enrolled to do a two year BEd
with a teacher's certificate while teaching full-time in the Department of English at
the University of Cape Town (UCT). It was a pre-requisite at the time that to do
a BEd you should have another first degree in a subject discipline--not so today.
Mary wrote her thesis on the teaching of Shakespeare in schools, though "schools"

did not include black or coloured schools:

         I'm writing about South Africa, and education in South Afri-
         ca, with a thesis on the teaching of the Shakespeare play in the
         secondary school. And I'm looking at the kinds of theories that
         teachers were drawing on in what they were doing, and looking
         at some examples of students writing about Shakespeare. And it
         was all terribly much ... something I think that would probably
         have been done in Britain. There was no local politics included
         in it. Well, why Shakespeare? It was taken for granted, you know,
         the classics, the canon, and Shakespeare at the top. ... In all the
         education, there was an Anglocentric subtext all the time.

    Experiences of this kind perhaps shaped in Mary a visceral mistrust of catego-
ries, an uneasy relationship with institutions and a scepticism about the orthodox-
ies of disciplinary meaning making. Another recollection from South Africa shows
the political subtext pushing into the foreground of her thinking:

         In the days when I did English Literature, there was an empha-
         sis on the close study of the text, even to a ridiculous extreme. I
         remember trotting out the received wisdom to a student at Cape
         Town University; he'd said something about the life history of
         some author. And I said, "Oh no, that's not relevant, you just look
         at the text." And he said, "Why is it not relevant?" And I went
         away and thought, "Gosh, I've been talking--you know--I'm just
         trotting out something without thought. Oh, he's got a point."

    Mary's own scholarship still reflects the close attention/sensitivity to texts that
her literary training gave her, but recognizing the myopia of English's bracketing
of the text's producer perhaps prepared her to critique and challenge the bound-
aried-ness of disciplines and fields, domains, territories that she encountered, ne-
gotiated and was subject to. When finding less encouragement to pursue scholar-
ship and teaching at UCT, than with Guy Butler at Rhodes, she along with other
contemporaries applied for grants to study overseas--and in the mid-1970s found
herself at the Institute of Education in London. She took the "Advanced Diploma
with special reference to the role of language in education" taught by Nancy Mar-
tin, Harold Rosen and Margaret Spencer, and she taught part time in secondary
and language schools while gradually taking on a fulltime academic post.

    When Gunther Kress arrived at the Institute of Education in the early 1990s
he and Mary together set up the MA in the Learning and Teaching of English with
Literacy. Their collaborative work on this programme established a lasting respect
and interest in each others' work: there was perhaps a meeting of ex-colonial minds
(Gunther was born in Germany, brought up and educated in Australia) because

                                                                                                    119

though their "official" disciplines were different--Literature, Linguistics--they
shared insights into texts/language in and across contexts, how texts are received
and how, and who produces them: a sensitivity to the importance not only of who
you're writing for (audience) but of who you are writing:

         I think Gunther has always thought about the learner. And I
         liked that. And the writer in the text. So, he concentrates on
         texts but he doesn't leave out a view of the writer--it's a writer
         bringing certain resources and assumptions and expectations,
         and what those are.

Is she talking about "identity" here? Well no, for a South African, identity is a
problematic term:

         It goes back to history again, personal history .... I think of it as
         Jan Blommaert's' "ascribed identity," and we had to carry identity
         cards in South Africa, and I had one saying I was white, and, you
         know, the Pass Laws and all that. That's what immediately comes
         into my mind--people putting others in brackets and racial
         categories ...

    With Mary and with Gunther, recognition of the writer is never just a way of
looking at texts, it's a way of interrogating where the power lies, what assumptions
it rests on, how it maintains itself, how it subjects or subjugates those who come to
it for a share. This is perhaps why Mary has preferred the notion of the "subject"--
both agent and recipient of categories, discourses, agenda: "identity" for her doesn't
admit of a two-way process (see discussions of Norman Fairclough and Gunther
Kress in Mary Scott, 1999; see also Scott, 2013b).

    During the 1970s and 1980s in the United Kingdom the increased recruit-
ment of higher fee-paying international students led to a greater recognition at an
institutional level of the utility of language teaching. Mary was conscious of the
conflicting discourses here: literary texts/student texts, a discipline/training, home
students/international students, literate/illiterate. In the implicit or explicit cre-
ation of binaries the "versus" often also brings about the creation of deficit. "What
is being edited out in the terms we use?" she asked.

    Some of the international students were sponsored by their governments and
seeking qualifications of higher currency than those in their home country--higher
currency, though not necessarily of higher intrinsic value (an echo of Mary's own
experience of taking two degrees classed as bachelor's in South Africa, that elsewhere
and in later years might be classed as bachelor followed by master's). At the same
time, many practicising UK teachers were taking their qualifications to degree level.

    The Institute decided to offer a BEd for those teachers who had got certificates,

120
                                                                                                      Reflections 1

from the days before there was a BEd, so a conversion BEd. They had Certificates
of Education, they'd come from training colleges, and many of them were in very
senior posts.

    Mary offered a "morning programme" to the BEd students:

         So, what I tried to do then, with the morning programme, the
         students would meet on a Monday morning, and beforehand,
         they would have read some text relevant to the Tuesday evening
         lecture. And they'd be given a question to consider. Now, as time
         went on, they might have to read two texts, and the question
         would get more complicated. And then, on the Tuesday, a
         couple of them would present what they'd done and it would be
         discussed. So that when they went to the Tuesday ... evening lec-
         tures, they'd have some background ... it wasn't just English and
         language. And then we'd meet on a Thursday morning, where
         they could talk about any problems they'd had following the
         Tuesday lectures or any things that had come up that they hadn't
         thought of ... it was very intensive.

    Although this provision sounds like good teaching full stop, its existence also
began in some way to create the role of "language and literacy service provider" in
the institution. In 1994 it was given a more secure and prominent footing, when
with the support of Gunther Kress, Mary got the backing of Senate to establish
the Centre for Academic and Professional Literacy Studies (CAPLITS) with three
important functions: teaching, research and consultancy.

    In making this move Mary recognized that, despite her mistrust of prefixed
distinctions or compartments, within institutions such compartments are often
convenient. They attract resource and status and they allow innovation and per-
haps resistance (agency), and even whilst they demonstrate compliance to, they
are a symptom of an institutional framing. In this framing the institution is cast
as providing the things people lack (its deficient recipients), and the ideology is
one in which socialization is largely a one-way process towards the reproduction of
institutional norms. This emphasis continues to pervade provision in the United
Kingdom. Reflecting on a seminar being held later in the academic year to focus
staff on the issue of assessment, Mary comments:

         From what I can understand, it's all about how to make the
         norms clearer, that sort of thing. No thought about the people
         who have been learning here, and how the institution needs to
         change.

Yet in a world of diversity which is increasingly becoming recognized as a world of

                                                                                                    121

superdiversity, the "meeting of norms seen in a very narrow way is not the solution".
    While, like most institutions, the Institute does not easily cast a critical eye on

its role in the education of students from across the globe, the process in the initial
establishment of CAPLITS and in Mary's own thinking has been much more re-
flexive and developmental. As I've mentioned, Mary describes her progression as a
researcher as "learning to see [students'] writing differently"; she refers elsewhere to
seeing the student text as "a hypothesis" (Mary Scott & Nicholas Groom, 1999; see
also Mary Scott & Joan Turner, 2009). But she is also aware of and acutely teased
by the question of how research insights relate to, or translate into, practice:

         Alright, I can look at this text and see there are all these assump-
         tions and things, but do I look at that simply in terms of how I
         must lead the student on--the way they should be?

    Mary doesn't have any answers if answers were to be in a set of practices. And
I'm not sure the tension she points to is a resolvable one, or a question that a teach-
er/researcher could be expected definitively to solve. Perhaps it is enough that the
answer lies in the question; the act or acts of reflexive awareness. For me, I realize,
this is what having an "Aclits" orientation means--not so much a pedagogy but a
framing of pedagogy which keeps the questions open and keeps questioning, even
itself. The question of what moving the student on might mean, or look like, without
once again casting the student as deficient, could be said to be the key dilemma
for the academic literacies practitioner/researcher, but the willingness to hold that
question might also be thought of as their key characteristic. A kind of tempera-
ment. Reflecting on our conversation, this seems to hold true in Mary's case. She
mistrusts the reductionism in simple or single explanations or models, resisting for
example, the reading of "Study Skills, Socialisation, Academic Literacies" as distin-
guishable approaches ("are they models?"), and she is aware of complex framings
that impinge on and shape the teacher--making her a pragmatist as well as an
idealist.

           SECTION 2
      TRANSFORMING
THE WORK OF TEACHING
INTRODUCTION TO SECTION 2

    This section continues a focus on pedagogy, but with the angle of investiga-
tion emphasising the teacher--identities, practices, normative assumptions and re-
sources for change--as the site of transformation. The chapters cover such themes
as the value of teachers learning from one another in collaborative partnerships,
questioning and challenging their own assumptions and situating practice within
disciplinary contexts of meaning-making.

    Throughout, there is a focus on transformative pedagogical practice as intimate-
ly linked with transformations in teachers' own understandings of the possibilities
for re-thinking prevailing norms and for generating new forms of meaning-mak-
ing within the disciplinary and professional contexts in which they are working.
Transformation is understood by the authors in this section as meaning more than
simply "change," in that it incorporates a new degree of self-awareness and a greater
ability to think about one's own beliefs and active role in the complex and difficult
processes of engaging with a transformative stance in one's teaching practice. The
chapters demonstrate the value for students' learning and sense of agency and po-
tential for their own transformation that can be brought about through teachers
negotiating with and allowing transformation in their own personal understand-
ings and professional identities.

    The section opens with Cecilia Jacobs's discussion of an institutional, cross-dis-
ciplinary initiative in South Africa that sought to challenge dominant framings of
academic literacy, as taught in generic, skills-based courses, through the develop-
ment of collaborative partnerships between Academic Literacies and disciplinary
lecturers. These partnerships were shaped by a shift of focus away from students
and deficit models of language proficiency to lecturers and their pedagogy, and
the chapter shows how possibilities for more transformative understandings and
pedagogical practices were enabled through the "doing" of teaching, including joint
curriculum and assessment design and co-research. The author draws attention to
the ways in which complementary outsider/insider positions can work to bring
tacit disciplinary conventions into explicit awareness. The next chapter by Julian
Ingle and Nadya Yakovchuk also considers the transformative potential of collab-
orative teaching and curriculum design, here in the context of sports and exercise
medicine and the task of preparing BSc students to write a research project to pub-
lishable standard. The authors reflect on their experiences of developing a series of
workshops that explicitly foregrounded questions of disciplinary knowledge con-
struction, identity and power as a way of fostering greater insight and the ability
to negotiate in a more conscious way some of the conventions and epistemological
positionings found in medical research writing. Whilst acknowledging their ex-

                                                                                                    127

periences of limitations of an Academic Literacies approach, they suggest that be-
coming more aware of disciplinary meaning-making practices and one's emergent
identity within this context is itself transformative, for teachers as well as students.
Exploration of the transformative potential of collaboration, this time between
disciplinary teachers and academic developers, continues in the paper by Moragh
Paxton and Vera Frith, who consider the ethical imperative for, and challenges of,
embracing a transformative pedagogy in the field of Biological, Earth and Environ-
mental Sciences. Whilst the authors argue that in a South African context norma-
tive approaches are to an extent essential to bringing about greater equity amongst
all students, they illustrate how working with teachers to help them recognize how
actively working with students' prior knowledge and practices can be a resource for
fostering change and empowering students to overcome barriers to learning.

    The next two chapters look at the relationship between standard written (An-
glo-American) English norms and the experiences of students who are using En-
glish as an additional language. Maria Leedham contributes to thinking about
transformation by challenging a traditional framing of "non-native speaker writ-
ing" as deficient compared with that of the "native speaker" (taken as the norm)--
an assumption found in many corpus linguistic studies. Instead, she brings a more
nuanced perspective to bear and asks what we can learn from disciplinary lecturers
about proficient student writing irrespective of the writer's first or second language.
Through close textual analysis and interviews with lecturers, she shows that using
visuals and lists (preferred by Chinese native speakers) is as acceptable as writing
in extended prose (preferred by British-English native speakers) in the disciplines
of Economics, Biology and Engineering. She argues that this disciplinary flexi-
bility is often not acknowledged in approaches to writing tuition offered by EAP
and academic writing teachers who are predominantly familiar with more essayist
and discursive meaning-making conventions from their own, generally humanis-
tic, backgrounds. She suggests that a willingness to question one's own normative
views about writing is essential to a transformation of teaching practice towards
recognizing the diversity, rather than the deficits, that writers bring with them to
the academy.

    The next chapter by Laura McCambridge focusses on the context of an inter-
national master's degree programme at a Finnish university, where English is used
as the institutional lingua-franca and students come from widely diverse linguistic,
cultural and academic backgrounds. In this context, she argues, tensions around the
need for clear and explicit writing guidance and for accommodating diverse writing
practices are particularly exposed. She frames this as a "clear practical dilemma"
for Academic Literacies of finding a workable "third way" that avoids the pitfalls
of both overly implicit and obscure and excessively prescriptive and normative ap-
proaches to teaching writing. Drawing on interviews with lecturers and students,
the author points to the importance of student agency, teachers' preparedness to

question their own assumptions and room for negotiation and consciousness-rais-
ing in order to create more constructive and transformative learning opportunities
for both students and teachers.

    The last three chapters in this section focus on the meaning-making practices
of teachers and the unique resources and perspectives they bring to the teaching
relationship. Jackie Tuck's chapter is concerned with an exploration of the mean-
ings of writing and the teaching of writing that disciplinary lecturers bring to and
extract from their teaching practice. Drawing on empirical ethnographic data from
interviews, assessment materials and audio-recordings of marking sessions from
participants working in different universities and disciplines in the United King-
dom, she argues that transformative pedagogic design can only flourish where the
lived experiences and perspectives of both teachers and students are taken into
account. In her study she found that meaningful engagement, such as the feeling
of making a positive difference to student writing, was as important as pragmat-
ic considerations, such as time and available resources, in providing an incentive
for teachers to transform their practices beyond often unproductive routines. She
also shows the ways in which transformation of students' engagement with aca-
demic writing is inseparably bound up with teachers' own transformations. Her
findings suggest that what counts as a positive change needs to be negotiated and
seen as worthwhile for both students and teachers, and she argues that nurturing
the conditions for teacher transformation is as crucial for effecting positive change
as is providing incentives for students to engage meaningfully with their writing.
Kevin Roozen, Paul Prior, Rebecca Woodard and Sonia Kline consider teachers'
developing practices and identities. They argue that in the same way that students'
histories and experiences of literacy can enrich learning in the classroom, so can
teachers' histories and literate engagements beyond formal educational settings play
a key role in transforming pedagogical practice and student learning. The authors
present three vignettes of teachers working in school and university contexts in the
United States, drawing variously on their experiences of a creative writing group,
blogging and fan-fiction writing to enrich their classroom practices. The vignettes
illustrate the opportunities for transformative pedagogy that can come from rec-
ognizing the rich complexity of teachers' identities and creatively linking them to
classroom practice. The final chapter in this section by Jane Creaton investigates the
way lecturers' written feedback practices both regulate and can be used to contest
and transform norms of knowledge construction and student identity. The chapter
looks in particular at the under-theorized area of professional doctorate writing and
draws on an analysis of feedback comments to highlight the unique features of the
student-supervisor relationship in the context of professional practice. Based on her
findings, she suggests that programme-level discussion amongst colleagues can un-
cover tacit assumptions and normative practices that can be shared with students,
and she offers an insightful feedback response to her own text that models both the

                                                                                                    129

goal and the challenges of transforming--and transformative--practice.
    The two Reflections in this section offer perspectives from North American and

French traditions of writing pedagogy and research to illuminate convergences
and differences in how researcher-practitioners work with the concept of Academ-
ic Literacies in different cultural and institutional contexts. In conversation with
Sally Mitchell, David Russell discusses the history of a critical approach within
the Writing Across the Curriculum and Writing in the Disciplines movements in
North America, suggesting that aspects of these traditions offer a critique of the
normative/transformative continuum as conceptualized in Academic Literacies. At
the same time he acknowledges the extent to which writing consultants accommo-
date disciplinary teachers' perspectives on writing conventions and epistemological
practices, for both pragmatic and institutional reasons--but he also argues that
there is potential for writing teachers' own transformation through interactions
with a diversity of other perspectives. Isabelle Delcambre and Christiane Donahue
consider areas of overlap and divergence in how transformation is understood and
worked with across the different fields of Littéracies Universitaires in France, Com-
position Studies in the United States and Academic Literacies. Whilst University
Literacies shares with Academic Literacies a notion of socially negotiated meanings
between teachers and students, transformation in the former tradition concentrates
on the writing knowledge and practices of students that need to evolve in order for
them to participate fruitfully within new disciplinary communities of practice: un-
like Academic Literacies, it does not adopt a critical stance towards the disciplinary
writing practices themselves. By comparison, the tradition of Composition Studies
in the United States is seen to share the critical transformative goal of Academic
Literacies, with first-year composition courses providing sites of resistance, nego-
tiation and transformation of practice which value the inherently dynamic and
open-ended process of learning--and in this sense are to be distinguished from a
more integrative approach to norms and conventions found in disciplinary writing
practice and teaching.

OPENING UP THE CURRICULUM:
MOVING FROM THE NORMATIVE TO
THE TRANSFORMATIVE IN TEACHERS'
UNDERSTANDINGS OF DISCIPLINARY
LITERACY PRACTICES

      Cecilia Jacobs

    This chapter covers what Theresa Lillis (2009) refers to as "living the norma-
tive, transformative space" through the experiences of a group of academics at a
South African university of technology. Four dominant institutional discourses
framed the way academic literacies were understood at the institution: "knowl-
edge as something to be imparted, and the curriculum as a body of content to be
learned"; "academic literacies as a list of skills (related to writing and reading and
often studying) that could be taught separately in decontextualized ways and then
transferred unproblematically to disciplines of study"; "academic literacy teaching
as something that was needed by English Second Language students who were
not proficient in English (the medium of instruction)"; and "the framing of stu-
dents, particularly second language speakers of English, in a deficit mode." These
institutional discourses typically saw students as the "problem" and the reason for
poor academic performance, while it also absolved lecturers from critically reflect-
ing on their practice, and the institution from critically reflecting on its systems.
These institutional discourses gave rise to dominant institutional practices such as
academic literacy teaching through add-on, autonomous modules/subjects/cours-
es, which were marginal to the mainstream curriculum. Referred to as "service
subjects," these courses were taught by academic literacy (language) lecturers who
straddled academic departments, faculties and campuses, were itinerant and mar-
ginal to the day-to-day functioning of departments, and often hourly paid tempo-
rary appointments or contract positions. Given these institutional discourses and
practices, alternative forms of responsiveness were explored through an academic
literacies initiative with a deliberate shift of focus from students and their language
proficiency to lecturers and their pedagogy. The purpose of this initiative was to
challenge the above-mentioned institutional discourses by transforming academic

literacy teaching at the university from the prevailing separate, generic, skills-based
courses taught by academic literacies lecturers, to an integrated approach where ac-
ademic literacies (AL) and disciplinary lecturers worked collaboratively to integrate
academic literacy teaching into various disciplines.

DESCRIPTION OF THE ACADEMIC LITERACIES INITIATIVE

    The initiative, detailed elsewhere (Cecilia Jacobs, 2008), was implemented as a
three-year institutional project that brought together ten partnerships between AL
and disciplinary lecturers. The partnerships worked collaboratively on developing
linguistically inclusive, integrated mainstream curricula. The emphasis was thus not
on add-on approaches or "patching up" perceived language deficits but on engaging
both AL and disciplinary lecturers in new ways of teaching disciplinary literacy
practices, which I have termed "collaborative pedagogy." These ten partnerships
in turn formed a transdisciplinary collective of twenty academics, which was the
institutional platform that networked the discipline-based partnerships between
AL and disciplinary lecturers. The partnerships became the vehicle for integrating
academic literacies into the respective disciplines by exploring the discursive prac-
tices of those disciplines, while the institutional project team provided a transdisci-
plinary space for those academics to explore their professional roles as tertiary edu-
cators. The collaborative processes, occurring in the ten partnerships as well as the
transdisciplinary collective, appeared to enable the explicit teaching of disciplinary
literacy practices through unlocking the tacit knowledge that the disciplinary lec-
turers had of these literacy practices.

    So instead of AL lecturers teaching separate courses, they worked collaboratively
with disciplinary lecturers on unpacking what the literacy practices of the discipline
of study are (tacit knowledge for disciplinary lecturers) and then developing joint
classroom activities to make these practices explicit to students. Some partnerships
moved beyond just making these practices explicit and inducting students into the
literacy practices of the discipline (the normative), to opening up curriculum spac-
es where the literacy practices of disciplines might be critiqued and contested by
their students (the transformative). The partnerships also involved team teaching,
where AL and disciplinary lecturers collaboratively taught in ways that embedded
reading and writing within the ways that their particular academic disciplines used
language in practice.

    Without a roadmap for how this process might unfold, these partnerships
engaged in collaborative teaching practices as a meaning-making exercise. It was
through collaboratively planning their lessons, jointly developing the teaching ma-
terials, the actual practice of team teaching and then co-researching their practice
that some of these lecturers developed alternative understandings and practices re-
garding academic literacies to those understandings and practices that had domi-

nated institutional discourses. This initiative was undertaken as an institutionally
organized pedagogical project, and involved AL and disciplinary partnerships across
a range of disciplines and academic departments, including science, radiography,
architecture, mechanical engineering, electrical engineering, law, marketing, human
resource management, business administration, and public administration. The ini-
tiative aimed to shift lecturers' "ways of thinking" about academic literacies from
the "normative" towards the "transformative" (Theresa Lillis & Mary Scott, 2007).

CONCEPTUAL FRAMING

    I have drawn on theoretical frameworks and empirical research from the broad
field of academic literacies research (James Gee, 1990, 1998, 2003; Mary Lea &
Barry Stierer, 2000; Mary Lea & Brian Street, 2006; Theresa Lillis, 2001, 2003;
Brian Street, 1999, 2003). My work was informed by early theoretical models em-
anating from the New Literacy Studies, such as the "ideological and autonomous
models" of literacy (Street, 1984), as well as more recent constructs emerging from
the UK perspective on academic literacies research, such as the normative (identify
and induct) and transformative (situate and contest) approaches to academic liter-
acies research and practice (Lillis & Scott, 2007). Twenty years down the line, the
autonomous model of literacy and normative approaches still appear to dominate
understandings of academic literacies teaching at the institution where my research
was located. This would suggest that there is a need for ongoing research into the
practice of academic literacies teaching in higher education and the understandings
that underpin these practices.

    The literature suggests that a transformative pedagogy requires lecturers to move
beyond the normative "academic socialization approach" which seeks to encultur-
ate students into disciplinary literacy practices, to the teaching of Academic Liter-
acies. A transformative pedagogy would require lecturers to open up curriculum
spaces where the literacy practices of disciplines might be critiqued and contested.
This chapter briefly reports on the findings from an initiative which engaged a
group of partnered AL and disciplinary lecturers (from a range of disciplines) in
collaborative teaching practices with a view to shifting from a normative towards a
transformative pedagogy. The chapter will explore the range of understandings that
these lecturers brought to their collaborative practices, and analyse how some of
these understandings shifted over time.

    I have used the three theoretical orientations to the teaching of academic liter-
acies (skills, socialization and literacies), offered by Lea & Street (2006), as a tool
for analyzing how participants in my study understood their teaching of academic
literacies. The findings are drawn from an analysis of the transcripts of narrative in-
terviews and focus group sessions, in which the twenty AL and disciplinary lectur-
ers participated. My data revealed that all three of the orientations to the teaching

                                                                                                    133
Jacobs

of academic literacies discussed in the conceptual framing above were evident in
the understandings that these lecturers brought to their approach to the teaching of
academic literacies, as I illustrate with some excerpts from my data set.

ACADEMIC SKILLS UNDERSTANDING

         I can see they don't do well, maybe not because they don't know,
         it's because they can't express themselves. So I picked that up re-
         ally, that it really is a language barrier, nothing else. Nothing else.

         If students can't speak English properly then you must take
         students with a higher level of English. They must be put on
         support programmes to improve their language. What else do
         you want? I mean that's enough. The (institution) is doing that.
         It's doing enough. You don't need to do more.

    These participants understood academic literacies teaching as being about pro-
moting general language proficiency, enabling students to understand English as a
medium of instruction and using grammatically correct English. This understand-
ing is underpinned by the notion that the barrier to students' success in their disci-
plines of study is the medium of instruction, and this academic literacies pedagogy
is firmly located within the autonomous, add-on support model. The classroom
activities tended to focus on semantics and vocabulary, rather than on literacy prac-
tices. This understanding was expressed in teaching materials that made content
knowledge accessible to students by simplifying the disciplinary language of au-
thentic academic texts of the disciplines, including substituting technical termi-
nology with common-sense terms wherever possible (see Street et al. Reflections 5
this volume).

ACADEMIC SOCIALIZATION UNDERSTANDING

         Nowadays I would look at it much more in terms of the less
         tangible skills that you actually impart to your students which
         then helps them in the learning in the classroom, and helps
         them access the language. The glossary ... was very tangible,
         and crossword puzzles and annotating text and things like that.
         Whereas now, I think I'm far more open to how you get the
         students' pathways through learning, how to assert your subject,
         as well as learning the language of the subject and the language
         they need to write it academically. There's a whole underground
         layer, under learning, which depends upon it. Sort of a bedrock

134
                                                                                   Opening Up the Curriculum

         layer of basic tools that allows the learner to access the different
         languages. And possibly, I think (at the start of the project) I
         was also still looking at language more in terms of medium of
         instruction.

    This participant understood academic literacies teaching as being about uncriti-
cally inducting students into the literacy practices of the disciplines. However what
is interesting in this excerpt is that she appears to have shifted in her thinking. She
describes her initial understanding of academic literacies pedagogy as being about
"tangible skills" and refers to classroom activities involving glossaries, crossword
puzzles and annotated text. This would point to an academic skills understanding
with a focus on language per se rather than practices. She then goes on to describe
her emerging understanding of academic literacies pedagogy as involving "learning
the language of the subject and the language they need to write it academically."
She then refers to a process of inducting her learners into the "basic tools" that
allow the learner to access the disciplinary languages. This understanding was ex-
pressed in teaching materials that sought to make explicit to students the rules
underpinning the literacy practices of her discipline.

ACADEMIC LITERACIES UNDERSTANDING

         Initially one could have said you only need to know the words
         and the meanings to understand (the discipline) better. But
         you need to do more than that. What I'm saying is you need to
         be able to place the term where it comes from, what it means,
         what the implications are, how just one word changes the whole
         meaning, how language sets up relationships of power, how
         it sets up relationships of equality or inequality. So it's getting
         deeper into conceptual understanding of these things. And I
         think it's not only a matter of having certain language proficien-
         cy, it's more than that .... It's because words ultimately operate in
         a context, but it doesn't only operate in the context of a passage
         or in the context of a book. It operates in the context of a reality,
         of a life; it operates in the context of your experience.

    This participant understood academic literacies teaching as being about making
visible for students the ways in which their discipline operated as a site of discourse
and power. His pedagogy went beyond just giving students access to the workings
of disciplinary discourses, to include how these discourses might be contested. This
understanding was expressed in teaching materials that sought to make explicit
the relationships of power within the discourses of the discipline and its literacy
practices.

    The participants in my study had worked in collaborative partnerships over a
period of three years. Through their collaborative pedagogy they not only devel-
oped and shared understandings of academic literacies teaching, but also shifted
from their initial understandings. These shifts seemed to move along a continuum
of understandings, from an academic skills understanding at the outset (and some
participants never managed to shift from this understanding), to an academic so-
cialization understanding (in the case of a number of the participants), to an aca-
demic literacies understanding (in a few cases).

    I have found it useful in my data analysis to represent these shifts as points
along a continuum of understandings of the teaching of academic literacies (see
Figure 9.1).

    There were many factors influencing why some partnerships were more suc-
cessful in shifting than others, such as similar age, compatible personalities, shared
life experiences, common educational vision, comparable levels of commitment,
previous collaborative engagement, disciplinary expertise and disciplinary status
(Jacobs, 2010). While one would expect that text-based disciplines would be
more open to the academic literacies approach than disciplines that grant status
to knowledge which is empirically constructed, this did not emerge in the data.
This was partly because most disciplines at a university of technology are of the
"empirically constructed" kind. Interestingly the disciplinary lecturers who shift-
ed most towards the academic literacies approach were from the disciplines of
architecture and radiography, neither of which would be regarded as text-based.
For those partnerships who shifted from their initial understandings of academic
literacies teaching, it was about both parties sharing their different perspectives
about what it means to be literate in the discipline, with the AL lecturers bringing
outsider knowledge of the teaching and learning of literacies, and the disciplinary
lecturers bringing insider knowledge of the discursive practices of their particu-
lar disciplines. The following excerpts, from two different disciplinary lecturers,
illustrate how the collaborative pedagogy led to shifts in their approaches and
perspectives:

         We needed someone from the outside to be able to see because
         once you are inside, you're the player, you don't see everything.

         But the person (AL lecturer), the spectator so to speak, can see
         the whole game as it were, and that perspective is important.
         Just to bring you back and say, "Look this is what I can see," and
         maybe you can't because you're so focussed, you just see your
         own role and not how it fits into the broader picture.

         Just working with a language person (AL lecturer) you suddenly
         realize that you're veering way into the discipline, like talking out
         from the discipline rather than bringing people in with you, into
         it, that's always sort of hard when you're in something ... you're
         very familiar with all these things and this other person can't ac-
         tually see it ... they can hear you but they really aren't sure what
         you're actually meaning. And it's only when you move outside
         it like that, that is where I found the language person helped a
         lot ... the language lecturer saying to you, "Sorry, it is not really
         very clear at all," that I found very, very helpful.

    In both excerpts from the data the disciplinary lecturers describe themselves
as insiders to the discipline who found it difficult to "see" explicitly the discursive
practices of their disciplines and they describe the AL lecturers as having an out-
sider perspective which they found useful in helping them make explicit their tacit
insider knowledge. This type of collaborative engagement, in the planning of their
joint teaching materials and team taught lessons, led to pedagogies that sought to
make this tacit knowledge explicit for their students.

DISCUSSION

    How the participants in the study understood the teaching of academic liter-
acies was linked to their collaborative pedagogy. In revealing the nature of disci-
plinary literacy practices and disciplines as sites of discourse and power, lecturers
needed to make these often invisible processes explicit for students, and teach them
the literacy "rules of the game." Few of the partnerships reached this level of under-
standing, and this was evident in their jointly developed teaching materials and in
the actual practice of their team-taught lessons. An example of teaching materials
demonstrating this level of understanding is illustrated in Table 9.1:

    Table 9.1 illustrates for students the progression of a professional term as it
moves through different contexts, from the classroom (immobilization device) to
practical demonstrations simulating the real world of radiography practice (im-
pression and cast), to the clinical environment with real patients (mask). It demon-
strates to students that in radiography practice there are specific forms of language
usage for interacting with patients, for interacting with fellow professionals and
for use in an academic environment. It also demonstrates that within the multi-

                                                                                                    137

disciplinary team of professionals there are more formal terms (impression) and
more informal terms (cast) used. The purpose of the pedagogy would be to make
explicit to students not only which terms are suitable for which contexts, but also
why. For example in the simulated clinical context it would be acceptable for fellow
radiography students to use the informal term (cast) when talking to each other,
but in communication between the practitioner and the students, it would be more
acceptable to use the more formal term (impression). Although the environment
remains the same here, the power differential invokes a more formal term in the
latter case. So students learn the appropriate terms, as well as how these terms are
used by different hierarchies of experts both within the discipline of radiography
and its practice in the real world. This opens up a space in the curriculum where
such hierarchies might be critiqued and contested.

    For lecturers to teach in this way, they needed to make the conceptual shift from
a normative towards a transformative pedagogy. My research has shown that such
shifts in the conceptualizations of lecturers was enhanced by a collaborative peda-
gogy, and it was in the doing (planning for and engaging in this collaborative ped-
agogy) that both the literacy and disciplinary lecturers were able to re-shape their
"ways of thinking" about their literacy teaching practices, and ultimately transform
their classroom practices. The "ways of doing" these collaborative partnerships in-
volved the following:

      · Collaborative development of teaching materials that attempted to make
         explicit for students the workings of their disciplinary discourses.

      · Team teaching, where literacy and disciplinary lecturers shared the same
         classroom space.

      · Joint design and assessment of tasks focussing on disciplinary literacy
         practices.

      · Co-researching this "new" collaborative approach to the teaching of
         academic literacies.

    The "ways of thinking" and the re-shaping of their conceptualizations of the
teaching of academic literacies happened in the discursive spaces where this collab-

orative engagement took place (e.g., the workshops, the planning sessions for their
team taught lessons, and in the process of designing their teaching materials and
assessment tasks and in researching their practices). Through these activities they
confronted issues of disciplinarity, transgressed their disciplinary boundaries, and
in a process of shared meaning-making they came to understand what it meant
to teach literacy as a social practice, reveal the rhetorical nature of texts and make
explicit the ways in which disciplinary discourses function in powerful practices.
The outsider position of the AL lecturer in relation to the discipline complemented
the insider position of the disciplinary lecturer. The outsiders, through a process
of interrogation and negotiation, helped shift the disciplinary lecturers to more
explicit understandings of the workings of disciplinary discourses and the rules
underpinning the literacy practices of their disciplines, and from this perspective
they were better able to understand how to make this explicit for their novice stu-
dents (Jacobs, 2007).This shift of perspective appeared to be a key factor in moving
lecturers towards a transformative pedagogy. The collaborative engagement with an
outsider enabled disciplinary lecturers to have some critical distance from the disci-
plinary discourses in which they were so immersed and in some cases this translated
into transformative pedagogy which sought to go beyond simply identifying and
inducting students into dominant disciplinary conventions, by making explicit in
their teaching the contested nature of the knowledge shaping their disciplines. The
collaborating partnerships drew on a range of pedagogical strategies which helped
shift their teaching towards a more transformative pedagogy, such as developing
learning materials which interrogate not only the words, symbols, diagrams and
formulas through which their disciplines communicate meaning, but also the ac-
tions and practices underpinning these expressions of discourse; and using texts
that demonstrate the practice of disciplines and illustrate how a discipline "reads
and writes" itself in the real world.

    The reality for most partnerships though, was that they taught within that grey
area between the "normative" and "transformative," as they shifted uneasily along
a continuum of understandings (Figure 9.1), experiencing moments of "insider/
outsiderness" (Theresa Lillis & Lucy Rai, 2011) in their collaborative engagement.
While psycho-social and disciplinary factors influenced to some extent whether
lecturers shifted or not, it was in the interplay of these factors and how they impact-
ed on the balance of power within the collaborative partnerships that movement
beyond the grey area between the "normative" and "transformative" occurred or did
not. However, the process of bringing disciplinary lecturers' tacit insider knowledge
to more explicit awareness requires time for interrogation and negotiation between
AL and disciplinary lecturers. When such time is not invested, these collabora-
tions tend to have unproductive consequences and set up patterns of inequality. To
maintain relationships based on equality, the collaborative space needs to be free
of disciplinary alignment, and both AL and disciplinary lecturers need to occupy a

                                                                                                    139

central position in the partnerships, with neither feeling peripheral to the process.
    My findings seem to suggest that it was the process of shared meaning-making

through collaborative engagement that facilitated movement towards transforma-
tive pedagogy. To sustain such collaborative engagement, institutions of higher ed-
ucation need to create discursive spaces where academic literacies and disciplinary
lecturers could work across departmental and disciplinary boundaries. Such discur-
sive spaces need to transcend the silo-nature of universities and address issues such
as how to develop classroom materials that highlight the complex (often hidden)
social practices that determine the principles and patterns through which disci-
plines communicate meaning, and then how to mediate such materials in a collab-
orative pedagogy.

    A transformative pedagogy, which requires lecturers to move beyond simply
identifying and inducting students into dominant disciplinary conventions, would
require lecturers to open up curriculum spaces where the literacy practices of disci-
plines might be critiqued and contested. But in order to critique and contest such
practices, lecturers would need to interrogate the "ways of knowing" in their dis-
ciplines, as well as the "modes" and "tools" that their disciplines draw on to create
disciplinary ways of knowing. The insights from such interrogation then need to
be translated into explicit pedagogy. This is the challenge confronting all academics
and one in which academic developers, particularly AL practitioners, could play a
more progressive role than they are currently playing in the context of higher edu-
cation institutions in South Africa.

        Writing can be a means of knowing and being in the world. That kind of
        writing requires self-examination, self-awareness, consciousness of the pro-
        cess of writing and reading.

theme continues in the classroom, a disarticulated skeleton without limbs asleep on the
desk, a loose foot lying by its head, with painted markings, caveman-like. The skull lies
with its cheek on the desk, the cranium to one side, a vanitas without clock or book.

IDENTIFYING THE SPACE
    Each year more than twenty Bachelor of Medicine students from the Barts and

The London School of Medicine and Dentistry (Queen Mary University of Lon-
don) and elsewhere choose to intercalate (insert) an extra year of study in the field
of Sports and Exercise Medicine to qualify for a BSc (Hons). This chapter discusses
the work of designing and co-teaching a series of writing workshops that prepare
students to write a 6,000-word research project. The project is their most signifi-
cant piece of assessed coursework, and is intended (with guidance from the Centre
for Sports and Exercise Medicine (CSEM) tutors) to reach a standard suitable for
publication in the British Journal of Sports Medicine (BJSM) or as a conference
paper.

    If disciplinary writing is bound to the social practices in which it is realized
(Romy Clark & Roz Ivanic, 1997; Theresa Lillis & Mary Scott, 2007), then to
begin to grasp the ways power and identity inform and maintain such practices
may help us discover more about the character of writers and their writing. Our
question in designing the workshops was whether exploring aspects of the ways
power and identity are manifest within the sports and exercise medicine discipline
would help students to position themselves more effectively as researchers and writ-
ers. Our response drew on the critical frame of Academic Literacies (Mary Lea &
Brian Street, 1998; Lillis & Scott, 2007), in particular its "emphasis on dialogic
146
                                             Writing Development, Co-Teaching and Academic Literacies

methodologies" (Lillis & Scott, 2007, p. 11) and "a transformative stance" (ibid.,
p. 12). What we set out to develop was a small scale exploratory case study in
which co-teaching, reflections and discussions fed into subsequent teaching and
reflections. In putting together the workshops we designed a number of activities
to open up dialogue and to foreground questions of disciplinary knowledge con-
struction, identity and power that would perhaps enable students and teachers to
explore, and in some cases question, some of the conventions and practices around
research writing in medicine.

SHARING THE SPACE

    Our collaboration with the CSEM began in 2006, in response to concerns
raised by staff and external examiners about a marked disparity between the ability
of the students to articulate ideas orally and in writing. From the outset, the Inter-
calated BSc (iBSc) Course Lead was closely involved in the design of the syllabus,
workshops and materials, and keen to co-teach the sessions. The four writing work-
shops are now co-taught by the Research Supervisor1 (henceforth referred to as
RS) from the CSEM and a member of Thinking Writing, a staff-facing curriculum
and writing development initiative at Queen Mary University of London (http://
www.thinkingwriting.qmul.ac.uk/). There has been an increasing commitment by
CSEM to this work: the workshops are now fully integrated into the module design
and its assessment structure, whereas for the first five years of our collaboration they
were additional to its core content. In addition, a three day semi-structured writing
retreat that we piloted and co-facilitated in 2010 has now been permanently incor-
porated into the programme, as a further point of transition for those students who
are keen to publish their projects.

    What we hope the presence of a disciplinary tutor working with a writing
specialist signals to students is that research writing is not a prosthesis (Elainne
Showalter & Anne Griffin, 2000) or "skill" they can attach to themselves, but is
inseparable from the ways in which knowledge is constructed and represented in a
discipline (Charles Bazerman, 1981; Mary Lea, 2004; Jonathan Monroe, 2003). As
such, this work is loosely grounded in the Writing in the Disciplines approaches to
writing development (Monroe, 2003, 2007; David Russell, 2002). More broadly,
it reflects a growing consensus within areas of the work around writing in high-
er education about the "need for writing development, wherever possible, to be
embedded within disciplinary teaching, and taught and supported by disciplinary
teachers, precisely because of a recognition that writing and thinking are, or should
be, integral processes" (Sally Mitchell, 2010, p. 136).

    The outlines and syllabus Julian was working with could be characterized as
encompassing a range of approaches and methodologies from Roz Ivanic's "Dis-
courses of Writing" framework for describing writing in higher education (2004, p.

                                                                                                    147
Ingle and Yakovchuk

255). The activities included, for example, student reflections on their writing and
reading processes (a process approach), and, following John Swales and Christine
Feak (2004), looking at the moves, features and language in systematic reviews and
research papers from the BJSM (a genre approach). Many of the activities used
could be broadly characterized as falling within the domain of "academic social-
ization" (Lea & Street, 1998; Lillis, 2001). And while there was no problem with
the course, since the potential for publication was very important to students and
the CSEM, we began to feel it was worth trying to shift the approach and broaden
the range of activities in order to help students negotiate and understand better
their transition into research publication, thus enabling a more "comprehensive
approach to the teaching of writing" (Ivanic, 2004, p. 241). Our co-teaching ap-
proach enabled disciplinary staff and writing tutors to open up a dialogue, bringing
their specific understandings in situ to the tasks being written, a dialogue the stu-
dents were very much at the centre of. Simply put, we wanted to "make space for
talk" (Lillis, 2001, p. 133).

    The co-authors occupied the space in different ways: Julian, from Thinking Writ-
ing, had the coordinating role and co-taught the sessions with the CSEM RS, but
he also had the benefit of preparing and reflecting on the sessions with Nadya, also
a member of the Thinking Writing team at the time, which helped re-articulate the
teaching and brought an external voice when interviewing the tutors retrospectively.

TRANSFORMING THE SPACE

    To explore more general questions about writing and knowledge construction,
and to expand the range of writing students might use, freewriting activities were
designed that would prompt discussions about broader aspects of the discipline.
One example was a slightly contentious statement as a prompt: "Most medical
research, and therefore writing, is about confirming and enlarging existing beliefs,
not in developing new ones."

    Here are extracts from two freewrites:

         To an extent, medical research is about confirming existing
         beliefs, but if this were the case, no truly groundbreaking dis-
         coveries would be made. A lot of great scientific writing flies [?]
         against the current dogma. I feel this is the case because to con-
         firm what is already known is futile and, in some regard, a vanity
         project. But to write of something truly new, that falls outside
         our belief system but happens to be true, is where real progress is
         made within the discipline.

         ... ethics and money/finance define modern medicine esp in the
         UK and with the NHS. Research will usually take place in fields

148
                                             Writing Development, Co-Teaching and Academic Literacies

         where finance is available. eg. A previous project on this course
         was looking at hamstring activation + EMG. [My] the person
         doing the study first wanted to look at kicking in taekwondo,
         but then was told by his supervisor to look at running/football
         because that's where the money is.

    Although each student had their own take on the statement, most showed a
concern with how this disciplinary community operates. In the second extract,
the implication is that what gets research funding often has to conform to internal
and external pressures; while at the same time it illustrates a "consciousness [of ]
the social context of writing [and] the nature of the discourse community they
are working in ..." (Clark & Ivanic, 1997, p. 233). What also came out of the
discussions after the freewriting was how clinical practice changes in response to
new insights derived from research, and the significance of this nexus of research,
writing and practice.

    For students as emergent researchers, we considered that it was particularly rel-
evant to make more visible "the centrality of identity and identification" and "the
impact of power relations on student writing," following Lillis and Scott (2007, p.
12). Through discussion and reflection, we hoped to explore the multiple identities
of these students (novice academic writers, novice researchers trying to achieve
"legitimate peripheral participation" (Eitienne Wenger, 2008, p. 100), supervisees,
future medical practitioners, possibly future academics, etc.) and how these identi-
ties may shape the way in which students engage with their writing.

         There is no room to breathe or express yourself. You could say
         this is typical of medicine as a whole subject, not just research.
         (A student's freewrite).

    This extract demonstrates the tension between the desire for self-expression and
the disciplinary and institutional constraints that one has to negotiate. A further
example of how such tensions and power relations manifest themselves emerged
from a discussion about author order in a journal article the students had been
reading--they were keen to question the status of each author and what their posi-
tion in the list might mean. In response, the RS explained that in medical sciences,
the author order is not linear: first and last authors carry most weight; usually, the
first has done most of the work and the last is the most important in terms of status,
funding grants, and publications (but may often contribute very little to the actual
writing apart from signing it off). How work was allocated and who came next in
the pecking order of second and third authors were questions of debate and often
compromise.

    Although initially unaware of the hierarchy of author order, the students al-
ready had some sense of their identity as researchers and the difficulties of negoti-

                                                                                                    149

ating their status within this research community. There was a discussion of their
concerns about the role of student researcher being abused, for example, that they
could be used as free (and unacknowledged) labour on research projects. The RS
explained that they had to "earn their spurs" or "serve their time" in the research
community in order to move towards the status of last author. Interestingly, both
metaphors come from two tightly structured and very hierarchical institutions--
the army and the prison system.

    Once the students' awareness of the significance of author order had been raised,
the presence of a struggle with their place in the research community was evident
in subsequent aspects of the course. In a presentation by a journal editor, one of
the students followed up a point about lack of recognition of their role because of
being shifted to third author in the research project. What emerged was a conflict
of interests between the students, who needed to be first or second authors to get
extra points in their Foundation Programme process,2 which would improve their
chances of employment, and their supervisors, who also needed to be in poll posi-
tion to maintain their academic careers as researchers and ensure they met appraisal
and national evaluation requirements for sufficient publications (for the system
used in UK context see http://www.ref.ac.uk).

MAKING "SPACE FOR TALK"

    By opening up their classroom, there was in one sense a break with the tradition
of writing and researcher instruction in the CSEM. Rather than an "add on" ap-
proach or the induction from within the discipline itself, the co-teaching explicitly
set out to open up and maintain dialogue among all participants, thus transforming
the teaching space itself and making the students more open to talk and engage.

         NY: Did you notice anything specific about how students react-
         ed to two tutors teaching them?

         JI: To me, certainly at university level, it seems to unsettle that
         normal dynamic--in a good way.

         RS: It makes it a bit less formal I think, which is important as
         well. Rather than just being talked at, they are more likely to
         engage if there's two people at the front talking. They are more
         likely to also talk themselves, as opposed to if there's just one
         they don't want to be the second person talking. ... That drew a
         lot of interaction from them.

         JI: That's right, I think it pulls them in.

    In feedback, students commented on the value of having a different perspec-

150
                                             Writing Development, Co-Teaching and Academic Literacies

tive on writing, perhaps because it may help them position their own disciplinary
writing as one of many types of research writing and made the mystery around
academic writing less mysterious (Lillis, 2001).

    There was also a visible transformation for the tutors involved. The RS had pre-
viously learned the disciplinary conventions of research writing though "osmosis"
(Lillis, 2001, p. 54) and the complex socialization that takes place in writing one's
doctorate. While academics tend to have a tacit understanding of how knowledge
is articulated in their discipline, they do not always "know that they have this rhe-
torical knowledge and cannot readily explain this to others" (Joan Turner, 2011,
p. 434). The writing sessions helped the RS to make this tacit knowledge explicit
to himself and the students. The writing tutor, in turn, gained considerable insight
into not just the way scientific knowledge is represented in writing, but also the
nature of the discipline and science in general. In response to Nadya's question
about the benefits of co-teaching, the following exchange exemplifies some of the
insights for both co-tutors:

         RS: A lot of the writing processes you go through and all the
         writing aspects ... although I may have had some of the skills I
         wasn't aware of the skills I did have, so in terms of transferring
         that to teaching I didn't know what I'd needed to try and teach,
         but having Julian come in from a completely different world had
         helped to put perspective on that for me ...

         JI: For me what it's been is the process of learning about scien-
         tific writing, or writing for this very specific journal actually ...
         but also a little bit about the broader discipline and how research
         methods are used, and how you go about analyzing data and
         things like that .... It has undermined illusions or preconcep-
         tions that I had about science writing ....

         NY: Could you elaborate on that?

         JI: [For me] ... science is always something that was set in stone,
         and couldn't be questioned, and is utterly rigorous ... but what
         was happening was very exploratory and tentative and ... this is
         the best possible hypothesis for this particular context, so I saw
         it as much more context-bound .... There wasn't nearly as much
         certainty that I assumed existed in the sciences and that was
         purely my preconception of scientific thinking.

    These shifts in the thinking of the tutors also became manifest in their teach-
ing practices. There was a trajectory along which tutors inched into each other's
disciplinary spaces as a result of sharing the space. Through these dialogic en-

                                                                                                    151
Ingle and Yakovchuk

counters, they became briefly at home in each other's disciplinary languages. For
example, Julian felt more able to join in critiques of experimental methodologies
when looking at systematic reviews of specialist areas of sports medicine, while
the RS felt comfortable discussing linguistic features such as redundant language
when, in a whole class activity, the students applied it to one of the RS's pub-
lished abstracts.

LEAVING THE SPACE

    Do the practices, insights and changes described reflect Lillis and Scott's claim
for "the explicit transformational interest that is at the core of academic literacies
work" (2007, p. 23)? For these students, the fact of participating in these writing
workshops may have led to a transformation in their understanding in its most
basic sense of learning something they did not know, which may be no different
from other learning situations. One could argue, therefore, that what we have done
has less to do with the "transformational approach" (ibid., p. 13) of Academic Lit-
eracies but more about the transformative nature of learning. Similarly, the insights
gained by the co-teachers from the shared experience of teaching the students were
perhaps no different from those of any practitioner given the opportunity to reflect
on their teaching.

    While these reservations may be valid, we maintain that aspects of this work
are more than this and go part of the way towards a transformative approach by
locating the conventions of medical science in relation to contested traditions of
knowledge making. We would therefore suggest that the "complex insider knowl-
edge" (Ivanic, 1998, p. 344) that is required of these students to negotiate the two
very different social practices of writing for assessment versus writing for publi-
cation is fostered through this approach to co-teaching. Our discussions and the
small-scale but overt focus on power, identity and epistemology may have helped
clarify and make explicit some of the "values, beliefs and practices" (ibid.) within
this sub-discipline. Expanding the range of textual practices (and, possibly, ways
of making meaning (Lillis & Scott, 2007)) that students engaged in has, we hope,
helped them refine their understanding of the discipline and their positions within
it. Through discussing the opportunities for our pedagogical practice that an Aca-
demic Literacies framework offers, and by reflecting on some of its limitations, we
have hoped to make a contribution to current debates on the relationship between
Academic Literacies theory and practice. In particular, co-curricular design, the
use of co-teaching and the potentially transformative nature of the discussions that
took place are areas that offer some directions in further exploration of the "design"
potential of Academic Literacies.

RE-ENTERING THE SPACE

    The writing work described here started from the premise that opening up and
foregrounding questions about knowledge, meaning making, power, and identity
would lead to insight for both teachers and students, allowing them to position
themselves as writers and researchers in a more conscious way, and to become more
aware of how their discipline works and how their current and emergent identities
may be mapped onto the disciplinary canvas.

    We hope that this work will allow those involved (students, disciplinary teachers
and writing developers) to re-enter and locate themselves in the disciplinary (and
also institutional/departmental/academic) spaces in a slightly different way--with
enriched insight and deepened understanding of the complexity and multifaceted
nature of "knowing and being" in the academic world. Returning to Wideman's
quote in the epigraph to this chapter, then, we could perhaps transform and extend
it to writing in academia in the following way:

         Academic writing can be a means of acquiring, developing and
         demonstrating disciplinary knowledge, as well as experiencing
         and having presence in the academic world. This kind of writ-
         ing requires examination of the multiple identities that one has
         to negotiate in the process of producing a piece of academic
         writing, awareness of how these identities interact with wider
         structures and relations existing in academia and beyond, and
         consciousness of the processes and practices surrounding the
         production, transmission and use of academic texts.

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

    We would like to thank Dylan Morrissey, Christian Barton and the staff from
the Centre for Sports and Exercise Medicine, for the warmth of their welcome
and the insights and expertise they have shared. We would also like to thank Sally
Mitchell (without whom this work would not have been possible) for her thought-

NOTES

1. It should be noted that the Research Supervisor post in CSEM is usually a six-month,
fixed-term contract aimed at a practicing physiotherapist who has recently completed
his or her PhD. This, therefore, entails forming a new collaboration each year with the
appointed co-teacher(s).

TRANSFORMATIVE AND
NORMATIVE? IMPLICATIONS FOR
ACADEMIC LITERACIES RESEARCH
IN QUANTITATIVE DISCIPLINES

MEANINGS OF TRANSFORMATION IN SOUTH AFRICAN
HIGHER EDUCATION

Social Transformation

    Transformation can mean many things but it has very specific implications in
the South African higher education context. Although there has been a marked
improvement in equity of access to higher education in South Africa since 1994,
equity in completion rates remains racially skewed and disappointing (Ian Scott,
Nan Yeld & Jane Hendry, 2007). Transformation, at the formerly white and priv-
ileged institution of the University of Cape Town, therefore involves reappraisal
and reorganization of teaching and learning in the university in order to cater to
a growing black student population, many of whom are second language speakers
of English from poor, rural, or urban working class backgrounds. It is a priority
to ensure that completion rates are increased, reflecting that higher education and
students' experience of it are transformed (see Thesen Reflections 6 this volume).

Pedagogic Transformation

    Academic developers teaching in foundation courses and extended curricular pro-
grammes such as the one discussed in this chapter have a very clear mission, which is
to focus on preparing students for epistemological access, defined by Wally Morrow
(2009, p. 77) as "learning how to become a successful participant in an academic
practice." We recognize that there is a mismatch between teaching approaches and
student experience at our institution, mostly because staff come from very different
backgrounds from those of the students. Therefore we work with the staff helping

them to understand students' prior and existing knowledge-making practices and to
critically explore the way students' prior knowledge and practices may enable or pres-
ent barriers in the learning and teaching of new, unfamiliar, or what we think of as
"mistakenly familiar" conventions (as we illustrate below), discourses, and concepts.
We see our role as change agents in the broader university, improving the effectiveness
of teaching and learning in the interests of both equity and development.

ACADEMIC LITERACIES AS TRANSFORMATION

    In the context of science and maths education at the university level, we find
the tension highlighted by Theresa Lillis and Mary Scott (2007) between normative
and transformative approaches to language and literacy particularly heightened.
Lillis and Scott (2007, p. 13) have highlighted the transformative role of academic
literacies research as being interested in discovering alternative ways of meaning
making by considering the resources that students bring as "legitimate tools for
meaning making." They have contrasted this with the normative understanding
of academic literacy which tends more towards "identifying" disciplinary conven-
tions and "inducting" the students into correct ways of thinking and writing. In
our particular context we are acutely aware that--given the history of apartheid
and the ongoing crisis in South African schooling including the lack of resources
and breakdown of a culture of learning and teaching in the schools--normative
approaches that involve inducting students into existing and available discourses
are essential. Where we locate the transformative dimension to our work is in the
following two key elements: 1) a rejection of a deficit position on students and the
semiotic and linguistic resources they draw on and enact in higher education; and
2) a commitment to understanding and uncovering existing and prior practices
that may enhance or present barriers to learning and teaching. We will illustrate
this argument by discussing some of the data from an academic literacies research
project in a foundation course in the Biological, Earth, and Environmental Scienc-
es (BEES) at the University of Cape Town.

THE CASE STUDY

    Through researching a collaborative initiative aimed at integrating academic
literacies in this course, we have developed a three-way conversation between the
academic literacy, numeracy studies and science specialists, which has informed
the curricular design. Most of the students, in a class which averages around 50
students, came from educationally disadvantaged backgrounds and many of them
were speakers of English as an additional language.

    In 2010 and 2011 students in the BEES course were required to write a scientif-

156
                                                                                Transformative and Normative?

ic research report which acted as a central focus for formative assessment. Numera-
cy and academic literacy specialists offered teaching and learning activities through-
out the year to prepare students for the writing of the report. Assessments explicitly
addressed these activities and built incrementally towards the final scientific report.
After a series of lectures and Excel-based tutorials on the analysis and interpreta-
tion of data, they were given data and a series of directed questions which guided
them through its analysis. These were presented in the form of a structured Excel
spreadsheet, on which the students could perform the statistical analysis, create the
charts and graphs and write the descriptions of the results. This data analysis was
carried forward into the results section of the final scientific report. In doing this
project students were engaging in a very diverse range of modes integrating verbal,
graphic, pictorial and mathematical representations in order to make meaning in
the natural sciences.

    In 2011 we developed a collaborative action research project between the aca-
demic literacy, numeracy studies and science specialists aimed at further develop-
ment of the pedagogy and curriculum for this course. Our research project follows
the typical action research spiral: Plan, Act, Observe, Reflect (Stephen Kemmis
& Robin McTaggart, 1982). A key finding emerging from this phase of the proj-
ect was that a much greater degree of collaboration between the people teaching
students about writing the research report was needed in order to integrate the
different aspects taught and hence allow students to produce a more integrated
product. In 2012 we moved into the second action research cycle as we designed
and planned changes to the course on the basis of our early findings.

    We used Academic Literacies research methods to gain insights into the practices
and assumptions students drew on as they learned to write about quantitative infor-
mation in science. This involved adopting an ethnographic stance, orienting both
to texts and to writers' perspectives: we analyzed early drafts of student writing and
then interviewed students about their writing. Instead of assuming that the student
is cognitively unable to grasp the concepts, we recognize the socially situated nature
of literacy (Mary Lea, 2004; Mary Lea & Brian Street, 2000; Lillis & Scott, 2007;
Street, 2005) and that if we are to appropriately address students' needs and help
them to become successful participants in the science disciplines, it is crucial for us
to understand and build on what students know and to uncover prior practices and
conceptions that may enhance or present barriers to further learning.

    In the following sections we illustrate how we have worked with students to
uncover prior practices and assumptions. We describe the ways in which students
were understanding quantitative concepts (Theme 1) and highlight some of the
prior schooling practices that may be impacting the way students write in the nat-
ural sciences (Theme 2). Finally, we outline some implications of these findings for
teaching, curriculum and staff development.

THEME 1: CONCEPTS IN NUMERACY
    Quantitative information and concepts are conveyed through language, often

using precise terminology and discipline-specific forms of expression which are
associated with specific quantitative ideas. Writing about quantitative information
involves using terms and phrases that often include everyday words, but which
have specific meanings, and which convey a richness of conceptual meaning. An
example is the word "rate," which has an everyday meaning (speed) but in more
technical contexts is used more broadly to describe ratios of various kinds, not only
those that express changes with respect to time. Understanding the term "rate" in a
given context involves understanding the significance of describing a quantity not
in absolute terms, but relative to some other quantity, which is for most students
not a trivial concept. Learning to use terms and phrases of this kind correctly (and
with a proper understanding of the concepts to which they refer) is fundamental to
quantitative literacy and is essential for a science student.

    In their writing of a scientific report many of the students used quantitative
terms and phrases inappropriately, often in a manner that was grammatically cor-
rect, but conceptually incorrect, revealing that they either did not understand the
specific contextual meanings of the terms they were using or that they did not un-
derstand the concepts the terms refer to, or both. One example of a phrase applied
incorrectly is "is proportional to"1 as illustrated in Figure 11.1.

                Figure 11.1: Graph and description from student's report.
158
                                                                                Transformative and Normative?

    We will discuss this example to illustrate how the ethnographic approach helped
us to gain a better understanding of what the students were signifying by their use
of this term and of the origins of this usage. We will then suggest how this insight
helps us to teach the use of quantitative language more effectively.

    Because many students had used "is proportional to" to describe relationships
that were not proportional (that is, where the two variables were not in a constant
ratio with each other), in the interviews we asked, "What does it mean when you
say one thing is proportional to another?" All but one student expressed their un-
derstanding in a manner similar to this: "... if the other one increases the other one
which is proportional to it also increases ...." Further questioning revealed that all
these students believed that this was a sufficient condition for proportionality; or in
other words, that "is proportional to" defines any relationship where an increase in
one variable is associated with an increase in the other. So for example, when shown
a sketch of a graph showing an exponential growth situation, students confirmed
that they understood this to be a case of proportionality.

    When asked where they first encountered the use of a phrase like "A is pro-
portional to B," all students said their first encounter with the term was in physics
lessons at school. For example, a student sketched a formula of the form "V  p"
and said "mostly in physics ... for formulas where you are maybe told the volume
of something is directly proportional to this ... as this increases the other increases
the change in this, if this changes it affects the other one"; whilst saying "this,"
she pointed to the p in the formula, and when saying "the other one" to the V. In
school physics it is common to use the symbol `' to represent "is proportional to"
in a formula. This disguises the fact that the relationship being represented is of the
form V = kp, where k is the constant of proportionality (that is, the constant ratio).
In explaining that if V is proportional to p, then as p increases so will V, a physics
teacher is making a true statement, but it seems that in many cases teachers have
not prevented students from concluding that the converse is true. It is easy to see
how if whenever a student hears the phrase "is proportional to" it is in the context
of noticing how one variable is associated with an increase in the other variable,
they will conclude that this is what the expression means.

    In reading students' written reports we might have been tempted to discount
the incorrect statements about proportional relationships as "poor English" but
through questioning students about their writing we gained rich insights into an
unexpected realm of their experience. From the point of view of what many of
the students apparently learned in physics classes, their use of the phrase "is pro-
portional to" was a correct description of the relationship they were describing, so
simply correcting the language would have been merely confusing to them. For us,
the realization that students' incorrect use of this phrase is not a superficial slip, but
rather an expression of an entrenched conceptual misunderstanding, has been very
useful. It helps us to appreciate that if we want to teach students to use quantitative

                                                                                                    159
Paxton and Frith

words and phrases appropriately in context, we must first make sure they properly
understand the concepts to which the words refer before attempting to teach the
conventional ways of expressing those concepts. It is through talking to students
about the understanding underlying their choices of expression that we can find
out which concepts we should give attention to. The insights gained in this way will
(and already have) changed the nature and emphasis of our teaching in this course.

THEME 2: STUDENTS' PRIOR PRACTICES IN WRITING FOR
SCIENCE

    There has been extensive research indicating that the transition from school to
university is complex and that students have difficulty trying to reconcile the discur-
sive identities of home, school and university (Ken Hyland, 2002; Roz Ivanic, 1997;
Moragh Paxton, 2003, 2007a, 2007b; Lucia Thesen & Ermien van Pletzen, 2006).
However we had not realized that local schools had recently started teaching academ-
ic literacy practices such as report writing and "referencing" and that the way these
were taught conflicted quite markedly with university academic literacy practices.

    Students spoke about their experience of writing school assignments for life
sciences and geography as being very "free." They reported having had freedom to
use any form they liked:

         In geography you could do anything, there were no rules or
         anything you just wrote like you were writing your own diary ...
         point form, flow chart and mind map ...

    They were required to write scientific reports at school, but it seemed--from stu-
dents' accounts--that this involved collecting information from the World Wide Web
and cutting and pasting it into the text. Students also reported that in school writing
opinions or claims unsupported by evidence were also acceptable. The students were
surprised at the fairly rigid genre and discourse of the university research report in the
natural sciences and that their lecturers had expected them to "write only facts" and use
supporting evidence drawn from the readings or their own graphical and numerical
results. The students believed they had been taught to reference at school, yet they had
found university referencing practices very different and very rigorous:

         (At school) you didn't have to all the time do in-text referencing,
         you just had to do like something of a bibliography, we were
         used to that ... like writing which book it comes from.

    At school, referencing often meant simply pasting URLs into a bibliography,
and there was no need to acknowledge explicitly those whose ideas and words the
students were drawing on. In fact, the idea of acknowledging outside sources in the
text was quite foreign to them.

    This research has been transformative for us because it has made us aware of new
school-based digital literacy practices and made us more sensitive to the precise chal-
lenges facing the students. We recognize that the transition from school to university
literacy practices demands new self-understandings and the development of new iden-
tities around authorship. The experience of interviewing the students not only made
us aware of conceptual difficulties they experience (and their origins), but also gave
us a great deal more insight into students' lived experience of schooling and of being
new university students, which we believe has made us into more empathetic teachers.

CONCLUSION

    The action research project has been important for teaching and curriculum
development, and significant changes were incorporated into the curriculum based
on the findings of the first action research cycle. We have found that it has been
critical to understand the way students are constructing understanding and to get
to know their prior practices and discourses so that we can address these in our
teaching of concepts and of university literacy practices. Based on the research
findings which show that students are confused about some of the quantitative
concepts, we have incorporated fuller explanations of these concepts and pointed
students to the reasons for their confusion. In addition, the research has highlight-
ed changes in school literacy practices that we were not aware of. It has given us the
opportunity, as we assist students in taking on new scientific identities, not only to
signal distinctions between school and university discourses, but also to note that
the disciplines of mathematics and science call for a particularly rigorous approach
to use of language and genre. This is perhaps particularly true in our country which
is itself in the process of change and where we, as teachers, have to respond regular-
ly to changing structures and changing discourses.

    Thus the collaborative research project has been very useful in informing the
on-going development of the curriculum, but has also contributed to our own ac-
ademic development. The science discipline specialist, through participating in the
academic literacy and numeracy workshops, has realized that she needs to embed
the teaching of these literacies and concepts in her own teaching throughout her
course (which for us would represent the best-practice scenario): she has changed
and developed her curriculum accordingly. The science discipline and numeracy
specialists have learned the importance of the language they use in conveying con-
ceptual information, while the language development specialist has gained insight
into the role played by numeracy in a broader conception of academic literacy.

LEARNING FROM LECTURERS:
WHAT DISCIPLINARY PRACTICE
CAN TEACH US ABOUT "GOOD"
STUDENT WRITING

      Maria Leedham

    This study brings together the methodology of corpus linguistics and the fram-
ing of academic literacies in an exploration of Chinese and British students' un-
dergraduate assignments in UK universities. I consider how student writing, par-
ticularly that of non-native speakers (NNSs),1 is traditionally framed as deficient
writing within corpus linguistics, and discuss how an academic literacies approach
challenges this assumption.

    One finding revealed through the analysis is the Chinese students' significantly
higher use of tables, figures, images (collectively termed "visuals"), formulae and
writing in lists, in comparison with the British students' writing, and the chapter
provides data on this from Economics, Biology, and Engineering. Detailed explo-
ration of individual assignments in Engineering together with interview data from
lecturers in the three disciplines suggests that high use of visuals, formulae, and lists
rather than writing mainly in connected prose is a different, yet equally acceptable,
means of producing successful assignments. This is in marked contrast to the usual
focus within English for Academic Purposes (EAP) classes on traditional essays
written in continuous prose. In this paper I argue that writing teachers could use-
fully draw on an academic literacies approach as a way to expand their ideas of what
constitutes "good" student writing and to transform their pedagogical practice in a
way that recognizes student diversity rather than deficit.

UNDERGRADUATE WRITING IN UK UNIVERSITIES

    Many researchers have emphasized how university students have to learn to
write in ways prescribed by their discipline in order to have their voices heard
(e.g., Nigel Harwood & Gregory Hadley, 2004; Ann Hewings, 1999; Ken Hyland,
2008; Sarah North, 2005), and this point is central to scholars within academic

literacies (e.g. Mary Lea & Brian Street, 1998; Theresa Lillis, 2001). Despite the
growing recognition of disciplinary difference and the importance of student voice,
most EAP classes comprise students from a broad range of subject areas through
practical necessity. At postgraduate level, students are likely to be familiar with the
conventions of their discipline, and to be writing within familiar genres such as a
research report or dissertation. At undergraduate level, however, students are still
learning how to write in their discipline(s) and additionally have to contend with
the recent "unprecedented amount of innovation in assessment" (Graham Gibbs,
2006, p. 20). This plethora of new genres at undergraduate level includes e-posters,
websites and reflective journals and represents a move away from the traditional
undergraduate essay (Lisa Ganobcsik-Williams, 2004; Maria Leedham, 2009; Hil-
ary Nesi & Sheena Gardner, 2006).

    While students may look to writing tutors for guidance in coping with writ-
ing in a new discipline and new genres, most applied linguists (and by implica-
tion most EAP and writing tutors) are "trained in the humanities, where words
are central to disciplinary values and argumentation" (Ann Johns, 1998, p. 183).
Tutors may thus "find themselves relying on disciplinary norms they are familiar
with" (Sheena Gardner & Jasper Holmes, 2009, p. 251) and it is likely that these
norms will include a concentration on "linear text" (Johns, 1998, p. 183) rather
than on the interaction of visuals, formulae and lists with prose. The use of EAP
textbooks does not resolve this problem since, as Chris Tribble points out, "the
majority of the writing coursebooks ... focus on developing essayist literacy"
(2009, p. 416).

EXPLORING STUDENT WRITING
THROUGH CORPUS LINGUISTICS

    The dataset in this study is first approached through corpus linguistics, a rap-
idly-growing field involving the investigation of language use through organized,
electronically-stored collections of texts (or "corpora"). Common methodological
procedures include counting the frequency of textual features, comparing one cor-
pus with a larger "reference" corpus and extracting contiguous word sequences (see
Stefan Gries, 2009, for a readable introduction). Findings from these procedures
are supported in this study by qualitative analysis of selected texts and data from
lecturer interviews.

    The majority of corpus linguistic studies of student writing, particularly NNS
writing, adopt a deficit approach in which NNS writing is compared to either NS
student or professional academic writing and seen to fall short of these "norms."
The language used to report these studies is thus couched in terms of a deficit dis-
course rather than one of variational "difference." For example Gaëtanelle Gilquin

and Magali Paquot (2008, p. 58) suggest that "remedial materials" are required to
help NNSs "overcome register-related problems," and Yu-Hua Chen and Paul Baker
(2010, p. 34) discuss "immature student academic writing ... [across] three groups
of different writing proficiency levels" in their corpora of NNS student, NS student
and expert academic writing. Thus a linguistic proficiency cline is often visualised
from low to high-level NNSs followed by NSs and culminating in the language of
professional academic writers, at which point the NS/NNS distinction ceases to be
noteworthy. In contrast, the academic literacies perspective adopted here does not
dichotomize NS and NNS students but instead views all undergraduates as learners
of writing within the academy, while acknowledging the additional challenges faced
by L2 English writers (see Ramona Tang, 2012b, for studies on this theme).

DATA AND METHODS

    The dataset for this study is a subset of the British Academic Written English2
(BAWE) corpus (Nesi & Gardner, 2012) (see BAWE site for details of corpus hold-
ings) with a small number of additionally-collected assignments from Chinese un-
dergraduates, and comprises texts from 12 disciplines and across three years of under-
graduate study. All assignments achieved a minimum score of 60% from discipline
lecturers (a First [distinction] or Upper Second [merit] in the United Kingdom) and
can thus be said to represent "proficient" student writing since they met marking
expectations to a sufficiently high extent (cf. Gardner & Holmes, 2009). Alongside
the compilation of the BAWE corpus, interviews with 58 lecturers were conducted
to provide an emic perspective on what this proficiency entails and on valued and
"disliked" features of undergraduate assignments (Nesi & Gardner, 2006).

    An initial search was carried out on the datasets to compare the frequency of
single words and contiguous word sequences in the 279,000-word Chinese corpus
with those in the 1.3 million word reference corpus of British students' writing
in the same 12 disciplines to uncover items used statistically more frequently in
the former. The resulting "keywords" include numbers, formulae and references
to data items (e.g., according to the + figure/appendix/equation, refer to (the) +
figure/table + [number]), suggesting that the Chinese students make greater use of
formulae, visuals and numbered lists than the British students (see Leedham, 2012
for a fuller account of the keyword process).

    To determine the usage of these items, the number of disciplines was narrowed
to three (Biology, Economics and Engineering), chosen as they offered a range of
texts across student corpora and year groups (see Table 12.1).

    As several keywords refer to tables, figures and formulae, or appear to be part
of numbered lists, automatic counts were conducted of these textual features (see
Table 12.2).

                                                                                                    165

(Statistical differences are shown between student groups within each discipline, using log likelihood,
* p<.05; ****p<.0001).

    In the BAWE corpus, a "table" is a graphic containing rows and columns while
a "figure" covers any graph, diagram or image. A distinction is made between "lists"
and "listlikes," both of which contain bulleted or numbered items, in that the for-
mer comprise lists of words or noun/verb phrases, and the latter comprise items in
complete sentences and displayed in list format.

    Table 12.2 suggests that both disciplinary differences and student group differ-
ences exist. Texts in Biology contain the most tables and figures, while Engineer-
ing texts contain the most listlikes and formulae. Within the student groups, the
majority of categories in the Chinese corpora show significantly greater use of each
textual feature than the English corpora. Disciplinary variations in these features
are to be expected, since, for example, Biology entails the use of images of natural
phenomena and Economics may involve reports with writing in lists, but it is less
clear why the student groups should also differ in their usage.

    The next stage was to look at these items in the context of whole assignments.
Due to limited space, I confine discussion to a pair of assignments by an L1 Chi-
nese student and an L1 British student within Engineering (see Table 12.3). This
assignment pair was selected as the texts answer the same question within the same
year 2 module at one university, though the spread of textual features appears typ-
ical of those across Chi-Engineering and Eng-Engineering.

Note: The number of formulae for the English text has been altered from the three given in BAWE data to
ten, to correct a disparity in tagging.

    Each assignment is entitled "centrifugal pump experiment," and is divided into
sections with self-explanatory headings such as "introduction" and "apparatus and
methods." While the Chinese writer begins each section on a new page, the Brit-
ish student simply uses a line break before a new section, resulting in the Chinese
writer's assignment containing double the number of pages yet only two-thirds the
word count of the British student's assignment (Table 12. 3).

    The differing quantities of formulae and prose are illustrated by page extracts
in Figure 12.1. Whereas the Chinese student's discussion weaves together formulae
and prose, the British student's response is given as a series of short paragraphs.

    Throughout the assignment, the Chinese student employs lists to both present
data and make substantive points whereas the British student uses discursive prose
(Figure 12.2).

    The top box of Figure 12.2 shows the Chinese student's bulleted conclusion,
given in complete sentences and stating the bald facts of the experiment:

    The experiment yielded the following conclusions:

      · The efficiency of a single stage centrifugal pump at high pump speed
         (3000 RPM) is better than ...

      · The input power with high pump speed increases ...
                   (Extract from Conclusion, 0254g).

    In contrast, the British student's conclusion is more discursive, introducing the
results and relating these to the experiments:

         In this investigation into the performance characteristics of a
         centrifugal pump at different speeds many things were realized.
         Firstly, it was seen that at the two different speeds the character-

    Since both texts have been judged as proficient by the discipline lecturers, (i.e.,
awarded at least a merit), it seems reasonable to conclude that different combina-
tions and proportions of textual features are acceptable. Similar studies of assign-
ment pairs in Biology and Economics revealed wide variation of the use of images
and lengthy captions in the former and of lists and listlikes in the latter (Leedham,
2015) (see also work by Arlene Archer, 2006, on South African students of Engi-
neering using both visual and textual semiotic resources).
    It is difficult to speculate, however, as to the preferred characteristics of student
writing in particular disciplines, and the next section draws on discipline lecturers'
views of valued features.
INTERVIEWS WITH LECTURERS
    Overall, the interviews conducted for the BAWE project indicate that "profi-
ciency" in writing for discipline lecturers relates to a range of criteria, including

                                                                                                    169

(but not limited to) linguistic proficiency, understanding of content, presentation,
clarity, concision, integration of graphics and careful referencing. While a broad
consensus may be agreed on at university, discipline or department level, an aca-
demic literacies perspective entails recognition that the precise balance of accept-
able features may in fact differ from lecturer to lecturer and even from one assign-
ment to another. Part of the task of the student writer is thus attempting "to unpack
the ground rules of writing in any particular context" (Lea, 2004).

    The rest of this section briefly examines interview comments relating to brevity,
use of visuals, and lists in Biology, Economics and Engineering interviews (n=11).

      · Being concise: In Biology, a lecturer commented that "there's never been a
         penalty for an essay that's too short"; similarly, in Economics one lecturer
         outlined their preference for "precision, incision, concision." Engineering
         lecturers valued the ability to be "clear and concise," "succinct," and point
         to a dislike of "verbosity." The integration of formulae and prose in dis-
         cussion and the bulleted conclusion of the Chinese student's text clearly
         adhere to these values (Figures 12.1 and 12.2).

      · Employing visuals: In Biology, it was suggested that a lab report of five or
         six pages should include diagrams, highlighting the visual nature of the
         discipline (e.g., John Dinolfo, Barbara Heifferon, & Lesly Temesvari,
         2007). A "typical" essay in Economics was said to contain both diagrams
         and formulae "as the spine of the essay." In Engineering, meanwhile,
         marks for presentation may include the assessment of diagrams, tables
         and overall layout. The corpus data presented in Table 12.2 points to a
         greater use of visual features by Chinese students in the three disciplines.

      · Writing in lists: Few lecturers mentioned list writing, since the interviews
         were conducted without reference to individual student texts. One Eco-
         nomics lecturer stated a dislike of written work containing "just diagrams
         and incomplete notes" rather than complete sentences. An Engineering
         lecturer similarly remarked that he disliked the use of bullet points as a
         space-saving feature, perhaps viewing these as a way of circumventing the
         occasional setting of page (as well as word) limits. However, in the assign-
         ment pair considered earlier, the list is a bulleted "listlike" (i.e., contains
         complete sentences) so may be more positively viewed as an aid to conci-
         sion and clarity in the writing rather than a means of meeting word limits.

IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE

    This chapter has argued that, for the disciplines investigated, it is acceptable for
students to integrate visuals, formulae and lists in addition to or instead of limiting

responses to connected prose. While studies such as this one can explore the range
of textual features used in successful undergraduate assessed writing, it is not pos-
sible to give highly specific guidance since lecturers in different contexts are likely
to vary in their views on the nature of good writing in particular assignments (Lea
& Street, 1998). Given that EAP tutors frequently have a background in the more
discursive subjects within Arts and Humanities and may be unfamiliar with writing
practices in other disciplines, this section offers suggestions as to how tutors can
increase their awareness of the diversity of undergraduate student writing, and thus
assist students in becoming more effective writers.

    Concrete means of establishing the range of acceptability in a discipline in-
clude exploring corpora (such as BAWE) and analyzing assignment exemplars of
the genres their students are asked to produce. Stronger links with the local context
would also enable EAP tutors to better understand discipline lecturers' expecta-
tions. However, more fundamental to any transformation in EAP tutors' views
are reflexivity in exploring the "taken-for-granted" procedures and practices (Lillis,
2012, p. 245) and a flexible attitude in considering what might be acceptable with-
in unfamiliar disciplines and genres. This open-mindedness moves beyond lexico-
grammatical considerations (e.g., the acceptability of "I" or the choice of passive/
active voice) to exploring assignments holistically and multimodally (Is it ok to
use a table to display results? Can the conclusion be presented as a bulleted list?).
Breadth of vision allows tutors to recognize different ways of achieving the same
end goal in writing, as with the two Engineering texts, and to embrace the different
cultural backgrounds L2 English students bring to their studies.

    Possibilities for transformation occur at all levels, from student to professional,
covering linguistic aspects and beyond: in her report on an interview study of L2
English scholars, Tang (2012a, p. 210) discusses the potential of university schol-
ars from diverse linguistic and cultural backgrounds to "enrich the discussions in
their disciplines." While recognizing that L2 English writers have to learn the rules
of the writing "game" (Christine Casanave, 2002), Tang proposes that increasing
participation of these scholars may "result in an opening up of the community
mindset to allow for different kinds of norms to be deemed viable" (p. 224-225).
Thus aspects of the writing in a community are "likely to shape the future practices
of that community" (p. 225).

    Discipline tutors can assist in the process of change by continuing to embrace
different ways of carrying out the same task, rather than adhering to a UK NS "nor-
mative pedagogic imperative" (Lillis, 2012, p. 240) and by recognizing that both
NS and NNS undergraduate students need help in understanding what is expected
in assignments. This guidance could take the form of exemplars and accompanying
commentary to illustrate possible assignment responses, and allowing dedicated
time within lectures for discussion of their expectations. Discipline lecturers could
also work with EAP tutors to jointly understand the needs of all students and to

                                                                                                    171

more precisely articulate the difficulties which different groups may face.
    This chapter has challenged the common approach within corpus linguistics

research of NNS student writing as in some way deficient when compared to NS
or to "expert" writing, arguing that the Chinese students' significantly higher use
of visuals, formulae and lists function as different, yet equally valued, ways of
achieving success at undergraduate level. A more rounded perspective than can be
found through corpus studies alone has been obtained through the combination
of corpus linguistics with close study of textual features in two assignments and
the emic perspective offered by lecturers. An Academic Literacies approach has
much to offer since this views learning how to write in the preferred ways of a spe-
cific situational context (e.g., a particular assignment set by an individual lecturer
within their university department at one point in time) as a challenge for both
NNS and NS university students, and recognizes that this may be accomplished
in varying ways (Archer, 2006; Lillis, 2012) (see also Ute Römer's 2009 discus-
sion of how both NS and NNS have to develop their competence in academic
writing). For both EAP tutors and discipline lecturers, then, a transformation
within teaching can come about through recognizing the importance of our own
academic and cultural backgrounds in shaping beliefs, and through questioning
our assumptions as to the nature of "good" student writing. Academic Literacies
can assist here in providing the theorization behind such a transformation and in
guiding us towards more diverse ways of viewing good writing, with the result that
NNS writers are viewed not in terms of deficit but in terms of what they can bring
to the academy (Tang, 2012a).

NOTES

1. In this paper I have, for convenience and brevity, used the terms "NS" and "NNS"
while recognizing that these are contentious (see Leung, Harris & Rampton, 1997).
The "L1 Chinese" group refers to students who speak any dialect of Chinese and who
lived in a Chinese-speaking environment for all or most of their secondary education.
"L1 English" denotes students whose self-proclaimed L1 is English and who lived in
the United Kingdom for all or most of their secondary schooling.

2. The data in this study come from the British Academic Written English (BAWE)
corpus, which was developed at the Universities of Warwick, Reading and Oxford
Brookes under the directorship of Hilary Nesi and Sheena Gardner (formerly of the
Centre for Applied Linguistics [previously called CELTE], Warwick), Paul Thomp-
son (formerly of the Department of Applied Linguistics, Reading) and Paul Wickens
(Westminster Institute of Education, Oxford Brookes), with funding from the ESRC
(RES-000-23-0800).

REFLECTIONS 2

THINKING CRITICALLY

AND NEGOTIATING PRACTICES

IN THE DISCIPLINES

      David Russell in conversation with Sally Mitchell

        David Russell, Professor of English at Iowa State University, researches writ-
        ing in the disciplines and professions, consults on writing in HE, and teach-
        es in a PhD programme in Rhetoric and Professional Communication. He
        spent three months in 2005 working alongside Sally Mitchell on "Thinking
        Writing,", an institutional initiative at Queen Mary University of London
        which is influenced by US thinking and practice around "Writing across the
        Curriculum" and "Writing in the Disciplines" and which also draws on as-
        pects of "Academic Literacies."

Sally: To ground our discussion I'm going to start with Mary Lea and Brian Street's
much cited 1998 paper in which they set out a heuristic for looking at data gath-
ered in UK universities in terms of approaches to student writing: a study skills
approach/frame; a socialization approach/frame; an academic literacies approach/
frame. I want to notice that it's not fully clear in the way the paper is often re-
ferred to, whether the three-part distinction is an approach or a frame. In my own
thinking I don't want to commit to either, but prefer to preserve both terms; the
first suggesting pedagogical practices, the second a conceptualization or stance.
In her book on student writing, Theresa Lillis (2001) visited these distinctions
again, adding to them "creative self-expression" as an approach and differentiating
between socialization as "implicit induction into established discourse practices"
and socialization involving "explicit teaching of features of academic genres." I
found that further distinction useful especially in terms of thinking about how
disciplinary teachers (rather than writing teachers) teach writing. She viewed the
approaches to student writing as ranged along a continuum that indexed a vision
of higher education as at one end "homogeneous," with "practices oriented to
the reproduction of official discourses" and at the other `heterogeneous"--and by
association, "oppositional." Pedagogical practices at this end she glossed as "ori-
ented to making visible/challenging/playing with official and unofficial discourse
practices" (2001).

    In our experiences, in our respective institutional contexts, which--important-

                                                                                                    175

ly--are mainly "teacher-facing" rather than "student-facing," it seems to me we
are often involved in interrogating this continuum in terms both of pedagogical
approach and conceptual stance: what do we do? How do we conceive of what it is
we do? And why? Just as the interplay between practice and stance is complex, so,
we find, is the naming of these as either "normative" or "transformative," "assimi-
lationist" or "resisting."

David: It's crucial to begin with the institutional context--and the role played
within the institution. In Thinking Writing at QMUL and in North American
Writing In the Disciplines programmes (WID), we do not teach language courses.
In the day-to-day work of supporting writing in the disciplines (and thus thinking
and learning and development more broadly), staff with expertise in academic writ-
ing/literacies (like you and me) play primarily a consulting or staff development
role with faculties and departments and teachers. We try to listen carefully, under-
stand how literacy operates in the field, department, classroom; how the teachers
and students use and understand it, and we then engage them in reflecting on it.
There's a lot of contact with people in other disciplines than our own (rhetoric,
academic writing, applied linguistics, are some of the names on our hats). And a lot
of meetings, workshops, classroom visits--perhaps to run a workshop for students
with the teacher present or in collaboration with the teacher.

    Working in a unit that is outside any department, with an institution-wide
brief for making change (as is usually the case with WID programmes), provides a
good place to think about difference and what it means to be critical, because stu-
dents spend most of their time in the disciplines, not in language/writing courses
(see Horner and Lillis this volume, Reflections 4). And there is automatically a
great deal of "heterogeneity," because we have all those disciplines (and sub- and
inter-disciplines, not to mention the professions often linked to them). When we
worked together in 2005, we discussed the challenges of talking to academic staff
about their goals for developing critical thinking in their courses or in the wording
of their assignments; for example, "When you say you want your students to `be
critical' what kind of critical do you mean?" And teachers and departments may well
ask us that too.

Sally: In thinking about the work we do in education and writing development,
teacher-facing practice certainly complicates what being transformative at, or near,
the oppositional end of Lillis's continuum might mean. Being critical can imply a
challenge to the forms and functions of authoritative discourse (academic, disci-
plinary, neo-liberal marketization), making these the object of study and interroga-
tion, rather than taking them as unquestioned givens in the making and communi-
cation of knowledge. An example of an oppositional stance would be to challenge

176
                                                                                                      Reflections 2

the "container metaphor" of language or the neo-liberal separation of skills from
knowledge that enables institutions to separate out "content courses" from "lan-
guage courses" and to place one in the service of the other (see Neculai this volume,
chapter 30). A strongly critical response might then involve us declining a depart-
ment's request to provide a stand-alone "study skills" course, or lead to a refusal to
provide help "grading the writing" of a particular assignment while the disciplinary
teacher "grades the content."

David: To pick up the example you used--refusing to serve, or service, a depart-
ment or curriculum or teacher by "grading the writing" is usually tempered, in
North American WID programmes at least, by the offer of different kinds of en-
gagement: reformulating assignments, introducing peer review, collaborative teach-
ing or research, and so on. In time (and sometimes very rapidly--because many
academic teachers are creative and curious), working together on these areas can
lead to critical and transformative practices--the introduction of peer assessment
for example, or popular genres, or debates (John Bean, 2011). Norms then may
begin to shift, to transform, both on the part of the teachers/departments and the
writing/literacies staff. After all, writing/literacies experts also belong to a discipline
(or proto-sub-discipline, however marginal), which can be critiqued by teachers in
other disciplines.

Sally: The question of where the norm is located is also an interesting one. A shift
in norms we've been talking about at work recently is the notion of "student as
producer or co-producer"--of resources, curriculum and assessment. It's gaining
what feels like increasing momentum in the United Kingdom--and as a contrast to
"student as consumer," it feels exciting and radical. But as "student as producer" be-
comes a newer "norm," it is already becoming assimilated to other more pervasive,
powerful agendas in the sector ("employability" is one). This doesn't mean however
that a classroom or programme in which "the student as producer" becomes the
new ethos isn't in some way, at some level, transformative of what had previously
held sway. It's just that the promised radicalism is held in check by larger ideologi-
cal frames. And, of course, even the limited radicalism driving the idea will need to
be tested in practice and scrutinized through research. What does "student as pro-
ducer" look like as/in practice?; what is it like for students to be socialized into this
apparently new way of doing things?; what are the new warrants that will open up
the new practice to criticism and resistance? Looked at this way you can't really fit
any developing practices onto a single point on Lillis's continuum--they'll always
be shifting about over time.

David: Yes, and indeed the very theoretical concept of a continuum at times may
melt down in the crucible of teacher-facing practice, into something resembling

                                                                                                    177
Russell with Mitchell

a multi-party negotiation, as engagements with teachers and the professionals be-
yond them (mutual learning and mutual transformation of practices) might occur.

    Very early on, in the late 1980s, a few critics of WAC, like Daniel Mahala
(1991) argued that WAC should offer a highly political, hard-edged critique of
the discourse of disciplines and professions. In practice, in teacher-facing practice
(redundancy intended) it is necessary to develop allies--and there are some in ev-
ery discipline and university who are critical in various ways--without alienating
potential allies. Writing consultants unfortunately don't have the power to make
others listen to our expertise (as some language/writing teachers have the power
to do with their students). Consultant experts must offer something of value to
engage them in an ongoing dialog. Teachers in the disciplines who take a critical
view of their own or their discipline's pedagogical practice and want to transform it
often show up at our WID workshops. We consult with them or even do long range
teaching change and/or research projects. It's slow work, often.

Sally: So how far did Mahala have a point, in your view? I guess I'm unsettled by the
idea that writing people don't have power (though I concede you're probably right
in some significant ways). But I think we can take power for ourselves too, and one
way is through having some conceptual framework that articulates the assumptions
on which options for practice are based. To have this gives you power--and it's also
a responsibility--to know how your practice is positioned, and what assumptions
(e.g., about language, knowledge, permission) it rests on. It enables you to be critical
and reflexive--and to be open to challenge and change. I think the AcLits frame-
work is useful in this regard--as a critical and reflective tool. But it shouldn't be
taken as a given or an endpoint. New articulations always need to be made--one I
encountered recently that I found very refreshing of my own practice was by Mag-
nus Gustafsson and Cecilia Jacobs (2013). And Mahala's critique wasn't over once
he'd voiced it, was it? From papers you've pointed me to, the strand of critical ques-
tioning and response has continued in WAC and WID--and this is a good thing.

David: I simply mean that writing teachers--like most university teachers--have
been granted the power of the grade, the mark, by the institution, the students, and
the wider society. As teachers we also have much power to determine what we teach
and how. Teachers can require students to write differently or be critical (or pretend
to--as some controversial ethnographic research has shown (David Seitz, 2004)).
But as writing consultants we have not been granted the institutional or social power
to remake curriculums in our critical ways--yet. We must gain that rhetorically, by
persuasion, which is one reason why theories of how power operates institutionally
have been important in WID research--Bruno Latour, Pierre Bourdieu, Anthony
Giddens. So I very much agree that our power will come from having something
intellectually valuable to offer to teachers in other disciplines--but valuable in

178
                                                                                                      Reflections 2

terms of their values as well as those our own discipline(s).
    The question of how oppositional and transformative practice is, and what

those terms mean, and how to frame arguments for outsiders, has indeed had a
long and thoughtful airing in the United States, dating back to the late 1980s,
when WID programmes were first becoming numerous (and some felt--wrongly
it turned out--that they would supplant required first-year composition courses).
That debate often pointed to a central tension, between writing as an uncritical/un-
problematic tool in the development of disciplinary and professional thinking and
practice (so normative, assimilationist and with an apparently "clear mission"), and
the need to contest writing as an agent in the inscription of disciplinary subjects
(so resisting and critical, with a more contested mission). This debate maps onto
critical approaches to academic writing elsewhere (AcLits, clearly, but also some
work in SFL (systemic functional linguistics), LAP, Brazilian/Swiss pedagogical se-
quences, etc. (Anis Bawarshi & Mary JoReiff, 2010)), and there's longstanding and
on-going debate in WID about how and how much it is and should be critical (see
Charles Bazerman et al. 2005, Chapter 8 for a summary).

    But North American WID approaches are also characterized, since their begin-
nings in the 1980s, by a different kind of critical analysis, one that grows out of
research into the rhetoric of disciplines and professions and workplaces that stu-
dents will enter. It seemed presumptuous to many North Americans doing WID
work to be critical of the disciplines' discursive practices--or to teach their students
to be literate, much less critically so--without having studied in some detail their
discursive practices: what is important to them, how they go about their work,
including (but not only) the literacy part. A historical and ethnographic research
tradition has ensued, which investigates how knowledge and power are produced
and circulate in the documentary networks of institutions in their practices over
time (as both historical and long-term ethnographic methods make time central).
(For reviews see Bazerman, 2008; Bazerman et al. 2005, Chapters 6 and 7; David
Russell, 2001, 2007, 2008).

    The goal here is to inform a critical approach to supporting writing in the
disciplines that takes into account both the affordances and constraints of disci-
plinary and professional discourse. By looking carefully at how discourses work it
is possible to formulate not only a backward looking critique of how disciplinary
discourses limit students, but also a forward looking critique to discern the poten-
tial in disciplinary discourses for students to develop knowledge and power--and
eventually transform institutions (and their discourse) in positive ways, as the stu-
dents become professionals with power. Dorothy Smith's study of the documentary
organization of medical practice, for example, reveals its deep sexism, but it also
shows how it saves lives, through organizing care (checklists for the surgical pro-
cedures, etc.) (see Dorothy Smith & Catherine Schryer, 2008 for an overview of
these studies). Dorothy Winsor's study of textual power negotiations in engineer-

                                                                                                    179
Russell with Mitchell

ing practice (2003) shows deep class exploitation, but it also shows how exploit-
ed workers exercise agency textually. Anthony Paré's study of Inuit social workers
(2002) reveals the racism of the Canadian social work profession but also the ways
native social workers negotiate the circulation of knowledge to enhance the power
and autonomy of their communities. Theresa Lillis and Mary Jane Curry's study
of professionals doing academic research outside the Anglophone centers of power
(2010) is consonant with WID research in significant ways, as it exposes not only
the hegemonic practices and their effects but also the textual dynamics of that pow-
er and the agentive and resistance potentials for the future.

    This is why cultural-historical activity theory and Carolyn Miller's theory of
genre as social action (1984) have been important in this tradition. They emphasize
the historical and dynamic quality of academic/professional discourses, and their
ties to changing practices (see Charles Bazerman & James Paradis, Eds., 1985, and
for research methods used see Charles Bazerman & Paul Prior, 2004).

    Historical and ethnographic--especially longitudinal--studies of writing in
HE, as well as in the professions beyond HE, provide insight into what I call for-
ward looking critique. Again, as the metaphor suggests, time is key. Writing/lan-
guage teachers typically have students only one or two terms (unless they are pre-
paring writing/language teachers or researchers). But staff in the disciplines often
have them for three or more years, and the department's reputation is at stake in
their preparation, as well as the future of the profession they prepare them for--as
are people's and society's safety, health, and so on, in the case of many disciplines/
professions. So the time scale is different in the disciplines, as are the stakes.

    Encountering teachers and departments in a range of disciplines other than
one's own (e.g., writing studies) suggests ways to reframe the assimilation/trans-
formation dichotomy. Every future professional must "assimilate" to the extent
of assuming the identity of a professional in that field (otherwise she will not be
able to participate or exert agency or, indeed, write in the discipline/profession).
For students--especially those from marginalized groups--entering a profession is
transformative in terms of their lives, and in terms of their potential agency, their
chances in life and their chance to make a difference. And in a collective sense,
every discipline/profession/institution will be transformed, in ways large and small,
by the changing conditions of its practice and the agency of its practitioners--or it
will become obsolete. Transformation, like assimilation, is inevitable, and the two
go hand in hand--but on different time scales. The question then is what sorts of
assimilation and what sorts of transformation occur, not only within individuals,
but also within broader social formations/institutions? And what is the role of the
writing/literacies expert in shaping those things?

Sally: For me that last question goes back to the position taken by the literacies
expert--how strongly critical they want or are able to be. I go along with Miller's

180
                                                                                                      Reflections 2

understanding of genre as in a sense having transformation built in (as she says,
"genres change, evolve and decay"), but I think sometimes in our work with dis-
ciplines we can influence, critically and creatively, the way genres, particularly the
genres that carry teaching and learning along, change and evolve. I like your point
about historical and ethnographic studies. The value of ethnography that includes
observations of classrooms etc. is that it tends to work against the hardening of
categories. Ethnography encourages "a willingness to accept (and run with) the
fact that ... experience has ways of boiling over and making us correct our current
formulas" (W. James, 1978, in Ben Rampton et al., 2004, quoted in Lillis, 2008,
p. 376). I'm quite interested in how the Lea and Street categories (derived from an
ethnographic type study, of course) have given rise to some anxiety that they are
mutually exclusive, that you're in one camp or the other--assimilationist or trans-
forming. It seems a curious reaction to the heuristic.

David: We in North America have certainly seen these kinds of categories compli-
cated, at times transmuted, in the crucible of practice, as I have suggested. Con-
text again is absolutely key. The ethnographic turn in rhetoric and composition
studies came in the 1980s in North America, with the proliferation of WAC/WID
programmes. Much of that research was practitioner-based, as writing consultants
collaborated with teachers in the disciplines. McCarthy's seminal 1987 article, "A
Stranger in Strange Lands" gave us a first window on a student struggling to cope
with writing in multiple disciplines. There followed a large number of ethnograph-
ic studies including eleven longitudinal studies of undergraduates--some following
students from the first year of HE into several years of professional practice--in-
volving sustained engagement between researcher and participants and drawing on
multiple methods in addition to talk around texts. A recent major review of these
studies of student writing at university (Paul Rogers, 2008), as well as research re-
views of qualitative studies (Russell, 2001) and studies in technical communication
(Russell, 2007), suggest that the WID work has much in common with AcLits re-
search--including a lively debate over the meaning of "critical" in ethnography and
the ethical representation of the "other," especially in relation to teaching practice
(Russell et al., 2009; Jerry Stinnett, 2012).

    Indeed, in my view, the most useful recent large scale study of writing in the
disciplines is by Roz Ivanic and her team (2009) in Scotland and England. This was
the product of two years of collaborative research with teachers in three disciplines
in further education colleges, what we call community colleges in the United States.
It involved their multi-modal text production in and outside of class, their mo-
tives--assimilationist and beyond--as well as interventions the teachers developed
and made, in consultation with the writing experts, and their reactions to them.

    Ivanic et al. are quite aware that having a critique is not enough; one has to have
a pedagogy to enact and develop that critique. And as part of that, I would argue,

                                                                                                    181

students must learn the (discourse) practices of their disciplines and professions, as
I mentioned before, or they will fail their courses--and will have far less agency for
transforming professional practices or discourses. WID has a variety of common
pedagogical strategies centered around encouraging critical thinking through writ-
ing awareness (Bean, 2011) and around encouraging critique of the disciplines by
viewing genres as dynamic and linked to practices--often by having students do
ethnographic investigations in one way or another (Bawarshi & Reiff, 2010, Chap-
ter 11). Many disciplines now have a literature on writing in that discipline. Few
of these have an explicit goal to challenge the dominant discourses. But in practice,
they may be taken up in ways that do that.

Sally: Certainly I've found that disciplinary teachers can be innovative and playful
in taking their students towards the disciplinary thinking and forms that they val-
ue. If the conditions are right they are creative and relaxed about setting "divergent"
writing tasks (dialogues, questions, postcards ...) that can give rise to startling ar-
ticulations of sharp disciplinary thinking. The writing tasks are perhaps unusu-
al (transformative of the default pedagogy, perhaps you could say?) but far from
"oppositional": the concern is to socialize--to make the students better students
and graduates of whatever discipline; and for themselves, the concern is to become
better teachers of students in their discipline (which seems to me to be generally
more accurate and richer than simply saying "better teachers of their discipline").

David: I like your formulation "teachers of students in their discipline," which puts
the emphasis on students--without forgetting the discipline. I might add "teachers
of students in and for their discipline," as the students hopefully leave HE to enter
specialized forms of work and knowledge-making.

Sally: Assimilation, then, or transformation?!

David: Well, both certainly, and many things in between and around the dichotomy
or continuum or negotiation. Writing in the Disciplines, since its origin in the mas-
sification of North American HE in the 1970s, has tried more or less successfully to
position itself as an educational reform movement. In 1989, Sue McLeod described
WID Programs as doing "transformational" work, in the sense that they explicitly
push for ways of viewing writing that go beyond the dominant remedial, deficit
model and move towards writing as a way of supporting critical thinking, learning
development and "academic success,"--by which HE generally means graduation
and a job in one's chosen field. One goal of having a WAC/WID programme at
one's university is to call attention to the invisible practices of writing and teaching
and learning and to make the institution aware of them. As a result, WAC/WID has
encountered a great deal of ongoing resistance--but at the same time it has managed
currently to be a feature of over half of all HE and of 65% of PhD degree-granting

institutions in the United States (Chris Thaiss & Tara Porter, 2010).
    Quite a degree of success, but of course there's still work to be done. One area is in

addressing some of the issues around race, class, gender and language background that
have been the subject of research and discussion within the more confined and con-
trollable spaces of Composition. As we've been discussing, this is less straightforward
for WID consultants who must form and maintain alliances in institutional spaces
where these issues may have relatively lower priority than in English departments. It'll
be interesting--and important--to see how the recent critique of WID in this regard
is developed and responded to (Anne Herrington & Charles Moran, 2006).

ACADEMIC WRITING IN AN ELF
ENVIRONMENT: STANDARDIZATION,
ACCO M M O D AT I O N -- O R
TRANSFORMATION?

      Laura McCambridge

THE CONTEXT

    Academic Literacies scholars in past years have identified and criticized two
main approaches to academic writing. On the one hand, many instructors in UK
higher education have been said to treat academic writing as an autonomous cog-
nitive skill rather than a social practice. This, Theresa Lillis (2001, p. 58) argues,
has led to an "institutional practice of mystery" where expectations for writing
are vague, leaving "non-traditional" students who have not long been inducted
into elite writing practices at a clear disadvantage. On the other hand, Academic
Literacies has also criticized what is termed an "academic socialization approach"
(Mary Lea & Brian Street, 1998, p. 158) in which students are explicitly taught or
socialized into the dominant practices of an academic discourse community. This
approach has been said to be overly prescriptive, uncritically reinforcing power
relations and both oversimplifying and essentializing community norms. Having
thus criticized both sides of this apparent dichotomy, Academic Literacies research
is left with a clear practical dilemma: If an implicit approach is too vague and an
explicit approach too prescriptive, what can teachers actually do? How can teachers
help students understand and actively negotiate the writing expectations they face
without prescribing an explicit, standard set of norms? In applying its theoretical
perspective to pedagogical design and practice, academic literacies must find a third
way.

    In attempting to identify such a "third way," this paper focuses on writing prac-
tices and experiences on an international master's degree programme at a university
in Finland. "International" programmes such as these, which are becoming increas-
ingly common in Europe, expose the dilemma of vague versus prescriptive teaching
yet more intensely. These programmes can often be described as "super-diverse" (see

DOI: https://doi.org/10.37514/PER-B.2015.0674.2.13  185
McCambridge

Steven Vertovec, 2007); their temporary communities consist of highly mobile stu-
dents with very varied linguistic, cultural and academic backgrounds, and they are
often explicitly oriented towards a global scale of academia while still clearly situated
in local institutional contexts. Moreover, the programmes typically use English as
a Lingua Franca (ELF), i.e., removed from the local sociolinguistic traditions of
English native speaking communities. The issue of whether and how to integrate
students into a standard set of writing norms in English becomes even more com-
plex in this context--the most obvious question being whose norms to consider the
standard? In an ELF context, assuming that there is a set of normative standards that
should be taught runs the risk not only of foreclosing students' agency in their writ-
ing, but also of reinforcing a global academia in which perceived Anglophone-centre
writing practices are idealized. On the other hand, if expectations for writing are left
vague, students in this super-diverse setting may find themselves with an even more
obscure mystery to solve than those studying in L1 Anglophone dominant contexts.

    Tensions concerning the need for clearer, more explicit writing norms versus
the need to accommodate diverse writing practices arose repeatedly during a longi-
tudinal ethnographic investigation into this context. This paper will overview each
of these two needs in turn, drawing from both teachers' and students' perspectives,
before suggesting possible solutions in the conclusion. It suggests that the potential
for a transformative approach in this context - for students and teachers - lies in
moving away from "in English" as an authoritative rationale in EAP writing peda-
gogy, cultivating students' agency in their writing choices, and encouraging critical
negotiation of practices and expectations.

    The master's degree programme in question is located in a medium-sized uni-
versity in Finland and is conducted entirely through English. Its subject is mul-
tidisciplinary, within the field of culture studies. The programme officially lasts
two years, but students are able to complete their final research projects (i.e., the
master's thesis) part-time.

    For this concise paper, the following data was used:

      · Four sets of semi-structured interviews with three students over two years
         concerning six of their written assignments. See Table 13.1 (pseudonyms
         are used).

      · Interviews with four teachers concerning their experiences with writing
         on the programme and their evaluation of these students' texts. See Table
         13.2 (pseudonyms are used).

      · Teachers' instructional materials for written assignments.
      · Feedback sessions between Megan (one teacher participant) and the

         students.

    The "writing norms" discussed in this paper include any practice or convention

186

that the participants refer to in regards to how a text should be written and what
it should include. Isolating one particular type of norm--e.g., lexico-grammatical,
discourse structure, topic, content, purpose, process--would have been unneces-
sarily limiting; these various levels are clearly intertwined and together contribute
to the completion and evaluation of a text.

           compulsory course on English academic writing/presenting for first year students
           on the programme.

THE NEED FOR EXPLICIT, STANDARD NORMS

    From the teachers' perspectives, more standardized norms were needed due to
the difficulties that students' diverse writing practices often created for evaluation.
They explained that students' varied linguistic, cultural and academic backgrounds
sometimes led to such differences in their texts that they were difficult to under-
stand let alone evaluate. As Antti put it simply, "it is difficult to evaluate those texts

                                                                           187
McCambridge

where you don't understand the meaning."
    Interestingly, although students' texts tended to be different in terms of lan-

guage use and rhetorical style, difficulty in understanding also resulted from differ-
ences in addressivity, i.e., assumptions concerning the imagined reader. Matti, for
example, explained that he had to invite an Iranian student to discuss his essay as a
result of such misunderstandings:

         He came to me to talk about it because I couldn't make out
         what he was actually meaning so we had a long very interesting
         discussion his argument was kind of too compressed that was the
         problem because I don't know the background of Iranian reli-
         gious history quite simply so it was very difficult for me but very
         interesting and important subject and the writer knows what he's
         writing you can kind of conclude it from the text.

    Here, Matti acknowledges that the problem was due to the writer's expectations
of the reader's knowledge; he assumed that he could address either an Iranian reader
or a global reader aware of Iranian religious conflict in his text. In this case, Matti
nevertheless allowed for negotiation of meaning, eventually giving the student a
very good grade after all.

    For the American English teacher, Megan, who was employed to teach the "con-
ventions of research reporting and academic writing" (as stated in the course de-
scription), the diversity of students' texts and lack of standard norms was particularly
problematic. The main pressure seemed to stem from the responsibility she felt to
even out students' differences and bring them into conventional English academic
writing practices, particularly perceived British or American practices. From the sub-
ject teachers' perspectives too, the responsibility seemed to fall to Megan as a native
English-speaking language teacher to make the students' writing fit for an external
reader, primarily in terms of grammar and vocabulary. Several teachers expressed a
lack of authority as non-native speakers in focusing on students' English language
uses themselves; Mikko put it rhetorically, "who am I to judge their language?"

    This responsibility to an imagined external, implicitly native, reader was felt
particularly in regards to the master's thesis. Individual course essays were viewed as
local, for local teachers' eyes only and therefore subject to their flexible preferences.
The thesis on the other hand was viewed as a public research document, as Antti
put it, "a window into what is done on the programme," and therefore subject to
strict English language norms.

    From the students' perspective, the need for more explicit norms arose particular-
ly during the first year of the programme. They all mentioned that the instructions
for written assignments tended to be very general and flexible on many levels (e.g.,
topic, structure, register) and students were expected to be independent. Often at the
end of courses, students were simply asked to write a paper on a topic of their choice

188
                                                                   Academic Writing in an ELF Environment

related to the course content. The students felt that they had no idea where to start
with this freedom, especially since the subject areas were sometimes new and search-
ing through source material was slow work in a second language. They appreciated
when a teacher did give more specific instructions.

    Students particularly expressed frustration at not understanding the content,
structure and linguistic expectations for assignment types that were new to them,
such as summaries, diaries and research proposals. For example, on one course the
students were asked to write reflective summaries of a series of books. When asked
how she found this assignment, Mei showed clear signs of confusion:

         I think it's kind of I don't know it's quite like I said completely
         new for me so I'm just like trying I don't like I said I don't know
         what they want that's what I cannot give them I mean so I would
         just try to use what I can.

    All of the students mentioned that they would search for example texts either
online or from fellow students in order to "imitate" some of their features. They
seemed to do this not only because the text structures were unfamiliar but also
because of their heightened need as second language users to acquire more lan-
guage in order to mimic the voice they are expected to adopt. However, further
frustration was expressed with the difficulty of finding examples that were actually
suitable models for the specific papers they were asked to write. Mei, for example,
noticed the difficulty of trying to transfer what are assumed to be objective, univer-
sal genre norms into her own work, remarking "maybe what we find on the internet
maybe belong to other countries you know maybe other areas so it's not maybe not
what she expects." Moreover, Stephanie mentioned that she found it difficult to
tell from the examples she found which features would be considered strengths or
flaws by evaluators. The implication here was that not only did these students crave
examples, but they craved examples that were specific to the assignment given and
explicitly deconstructed by the teacher.

THE NEED TO ACCOMMODATE DIVERSE PRACTICES

    Despite these frustrations, a discourse of accepting or encouraging diversity and
flexibility in writing expectations also arose over this two-year period. For example,
just after expressing concerns regarding students' very varied written English, Mik-
ko nevertheless stated:

         But the global markets that we are collecting our students cul-
         turally its richness we actually need to think positively about the
         people's academic backgrounds when we make a selection.

    In defence of the freedom allowed in written assignments, teachers explained

                                                                                                    189
McCambridge

that it was in order for students to pursue their own interests on the programme,
especially in relation to the master's thesis. This was actually seen as a strategy for
coping with students' diverse content knowledge in particular. If students could
relate the course materials to their own interests and discover sources that would be
useful for their theses, this could only be constructive.

    Although the students struggled with this freedom at first, they eventually ap-
preciated it during their second year. Stephanie, for example, had previously stud-
ied under strict requirements in Germany, where she took many obligatory courses
on English writing in order to learn, in her words, "don't do this and don't do that
and be aware." During her second year, she claimed that she had benefited from
the more flexible system:

         Stephanie: I think that the thing that helped me to improve a lot
         was that it's like free you can do whatever you want to so you can
         actually like write about those things you enjoy writing.

         Laura: Is that what made you more ambitious?

         Stephanie: Yeah I think I enjoy it much more it's well I actually
         enjoy writing nowadays and that's the biggest difference.

    It seems that for Stephanie the freedom to choose the content and to some
extent the style of her texts entailed a freedom to personalize her academic writing
and integrate it into her identity. Mei reiterated this point almost exactly, explain-
ing that in China she had to follow very detailed instructions, whereas on the
programme she has much more freedom. Although it frightened her at first, she
eventually began to enjoy finding ways to relate theory to her own interests. She
too seemed to integrate this process of writing into her identity (and vice-versa):

         Mei: Now if you give me any topic, give me certain time, I can
         write, somehow it helps you. I mean that's how the people who
         study culture and literature and everything see the world when
         they look carefully enough, they can see something behind.

    Importantly, Mei feels she is beginning to "see the world" as a scholar and writer
in her field. She contrasted this enthusiasm with her earlier experiences of simply
trying to "deal with the teacher."

    When Anita, one of the subject professors, was asked specifically whether she
would like students to be taught a particular set of norms for writing their papers,
she replied that definitely not. Referring mostly to text structure, but also touch-
ing on lexical norms, she explained, "it would be very boring if everyone wrote in
a kind of strict what is for me an Anglo-American analytic ideal." Instead, Anita
hoped that teaching on writing would make students aware of options, the under-
lying logic behind those options, and their underlying ideologies. She explained

190
                                                                   Academic Writing in an ELF Environment

that students should be made aware of how various practices might help them in
writing, but should nevertheless be expected to make their own choices, using their
own judgment.

    It was also clear that applying a simplistic "one size fits all" set of writing norms
within a clearly diverse sociolinguistic context would not necessarily address indi-
vidual students' writing difficulties. It was difficult for teachers to tell whether a
feature of a student's text they found "weak" was due to disciplinary background,
home culture, language level, lack of effort or something else entirely. For example
in giving feedback, the English teacher, Megan, tended to generalize a student's
writing issues as being due to clear-cut cultural or register differences in writing
practice. In one instance, Mei began a paper by writing an introduction of nearly
a page with long sentences and no paragraph divisions. In a feedback session with
Megan, she was told that although in China long sentences and paragraphs may be
acceptable, it "doesn't work well in English." Mei later told me that she was actually
used in China to using shorter sentences and had been trying instead to length-
en her English sentences in order to seem less "childish" and to imitate what she
thought was an English norm. In regards to the paragraph length, she explained:

         Mei: I found some examples of research plan on the internet
         and they are doing this .... I know of course in the body of the
         essay you will separate, but I don't know if you can do this in the
         introduction it's not like it's very long ... but of course you know
         when we were kids in primary school we always have this kind of
         exam about like doing the paragraph thing.

         Laura: So you don't think it's true that in China they ...

         Mei: No, no, no, no.

    In exotifying and essentializing the student's cultural background, the teacher
positions herself as an ambassador of new cultural practices into which the student
must be socialized. She thus misses an opportunity for more meaningful negotia-
tion with the student over the logic behind her choices and her actual dilemmas in
writing.

CONCLUSION

    The frustrations expressed by students in this data over vague or confusing ex-
pectations for writing mirror observations in previous academic literacies research
in the United Kingdom (see e.g., Lea & Street, 1998; Lillis, 2001). On the other
hand, the problems associated with prescribing standard norms are amplified in
this super-diverse community. This paper set out to identify a third way to ap-
proach academic writing pedagogy. In my view, the data points to two themes that

                                                                                                    191

might characterize this third way: namely, agency and negotiation.
    Firstly, the students themselves found that the process of improving as writers

was a process of acquiring agency in their writing choices and in turn forming iden-
tities as writers in their discipline. This agency and identity could be encouraged
by an approach that helps students to connect writing practices to disciplinary pur-
poses. Kate Chanock (2001, p. 8) put it well that the problem is not with having
criteria, but rather with the only rationale behind the criteria being "because I say
so." I would add to this the rationale "in English, this is how we do it," which is the
equivalent in EFL teaching on writing. Teachers are often themselves unaware that
conflicting practices exist which vary according to discipline, methodology, culture,
text-type and so on. If the sole evaluation criterion for students' writing is its ability
to match one imagined Anglo-American set of norms, both the writing and its
evaluation lose their pedagogical value. Instead, I would reiterate Anita's suggestion
that students (and teachers) become aware of various options in academic writing,
their functions and underlying ideologies.

    This approach to connecting form, function and ideology would in turn benefit
from collaborative methods in writing pedagogy where emphasis is on negotiation
and consciousness-raising rather than prescription. This would mean, for instance,
including those examples/models/templates that students seem so much to crave
and enabling them to become researchers of their discipline's writing practices. Ex-
amples that are close to the text types students are actually expected to produce and
close to what they can themselves achieve are particularly useful. Again, however, it
is important that options are given. The danger in giving only one example which
the teacher alone deconstructs as an ideal text is that the students' aim will simply
be to copy its features. Instead, various examples could be used in order to provoke
negotiation in which both students and teacher can justify their preferences. Nigel
Harwood and Gregory Hadley (2004, pp. 366-374) similarly argue for a "cor-
pus-based critical pragmatic approach," in which teachers and students investigate
their discipline's discourse norms using corpus data.

    It is important to emphasize that accommodating diversity and promoting
student agency does not mean laissez-faire. The point is not to leave students to
struggle and then evaluate whether their work meets a particular teacher's ideals.
As Claudio Baraldi (2006, p. 60) puts it, "conflicts between cultural forms must
be managed, not avoided." One way to manage these conflicts might be found in
the example of Matti's experience with the Iranian student's writing. In evaluating
a text that he did not understand due to the student's very different background,
Matti was prepared to negotiate with the student and actually came to appreciate
his perspective. If teachers allow students space to explain their choices and are even
prepared to question their own assumptions, teacher-student interactions are more
likely to become genuinely dialogic and transformative, and ultimately more con-
structive learning opportunities for students--and in fact for teachers themselves.

"DOING SOMETHING THAT'S REAL-
LY IMPORTANT": MEANINGFUL
ENGAGEMENT AS A RESOURCE
FOR TEACHERS' TRANSFORMATIVE
WORK WITH STUDENT WRITERS
IN THE DISCIPLINES

      Jackie Tuck

    A number of studies drawing on academic literacies have focused on the per-
spectives of academics as writers (e.g., Lesley Gourlay, 2011; Mary Lea & Bar-
ry Stierer, 2009; Theresa Lillis & Mary Jane Curry, 2010). However, academics'
pedagogic practices around student writing have generally been investigated with
an emphasis on learners' point of view (e.g., Roz Ivanic, 1998; Roz Ivanic, Romy
Clark & Rachel Rimmershaw, 2000; Theresa Lillis, 2001), though with some ex-
ceptions (Richard Bailey & Mark Garner, 2010; Brenda Gay et al., 1999; Mary Lea
& Brian Street, 1999). This has resulted in a powerful critique of prevailing prac-
tice, without blaming individual teachers (Lea & Stierer, 2000). Much work in the
field over the past decade has also addressed the need for a "design frame" (Gunther
Kress, 1998, 2000, cited in Lillis, 2003) "which can actively contribute to student
writing pedagogy as both theory and practice" (p. 192). Thus pedagogies around
writing are present in academic literacies research as a frequent source of difficulty
for students but also as having "transformative" potential (Theresa Lillis & Mary
Scott, 2007). Here, I broadly adopt Theresa Lillis and Mary Scott's framing of
"transformative" approaches to student writing as contrasting with a more "nor-
mative" stance resting on a number of educational myths (Kress, 2007) including
"the unidirectionality of the teacher-student relation" (Lillis & Scott, 2007, p. 13).
One of the key constitutive elements of this transformative approach is an interest
in eliciting the (often undervalued) perspectives of student writers and in valuing
the resources they bring to meaning-making in the academy.

    However, numerous empirical studies have shown that academic writers' tex-
tual practices are frequently embodied in complex chains of events, in which a

number of different actors play a range of roles in shaping the text, as co-writ-
ers, feedback-givers, proof-readers, etc. (e.g., Nigel Harwood et al., 2009; Lillis &
Curry, 2010). It is therefore impossible to draw neat boundaries between student
writers' practices and those of other social actors such as their academic teachers.
I argue therefore that "transformative" pedagogic design around student writing
can only flourish where "the lived experience of teaching and learning from both
student and tutor perspectives" (Roz Ivanic & Mary Lea, 2006 p. 7; my emphasis)
is taken into account. This helps to ensure that one form of "unidirectionality" is
not replaced by another, and acknowledges that pedagogical relations are open to
contestation and change. It also recognizes that a "transformative interest in mean-
ing-making" (Lillis & Scott, 2007, p. 13) legitimately encompasses the meanings
teachers bring to and derive from their practices around student writing (see also
Roozen et al., Chapter 15 this volume).

    The study I draw on in this paper therefore used ethnographically-oriented
methodologies (Judith Green & David Bloome, 1997; Lillis, 2008) to focus on the
less extensively researched experiences and perspectives of disciplinary academic
teachers, framing pedagogies around writing as a dimension of academic literacies
to be empirically explored, without "making prior assumptions as to which [prac-
tices] are either appropriate or effective" (Lea & Street, 1998, p. 158). Thus my
approach was to highlight participants' understandings of what was satisfactory,
generative and meaningful, or otherwise, in their practice around student writing
as an indication of what might be "transformative" in their contexts.

THE EMPIRICAL STUDY

    The project involved fourteen academic teacher participants, in six diverse UK
universities and a range of disciplines. Initial, semi-structured interviews were fol-
lowed up with text-focused interviews, based for example around marked assign-
ments, or moderation paperwork, generating "talk around text" (Lillis, 2008, 2009).
Other data were collected, such as guidance and assessment materials, audio-re-
cordings of observed face-to-face sessions, or made by participants while marking
assignments. The analytical approach was to weave a detailed picture by moving
back and forth between different sources of data, using individual case studies as
"vertical" warp threads running through the analysis, connected by the weft of
"horizontal" thematic analysis across the study (David Barton & Mary Hamilton,
1998). I was interested in participants' experience of their disciplinary writing work
with students, in their perceptions of its success and what it meant to them. I there-
fore paid attention to ways in which participants' practices and wordings might
invoke broader "discourses of writing and of learning to write" (Ivanic, 2004) in the
academy. This approach showed clearly that individual teachers actively configured
contexts for writing work with students, and positioned themselves within--rather

than simply responding to--their institutional contexts through practice around
student writing. Here I present two (pseudonymous) miniature case studies which
convey something of the complexity of disciplinary writing work with students,
and of how it is experienced, valued and understood by academic teachers.

MINIATURE CASE STUDY 1: MIKE, GEOGRAPHY

    Mike works in a small, relatively new "teaching-led"1 university. He describes
himself as an "enthusiastic teacher of Geography" and in a departmental website
video declares a commitment to professional teaching in the subject. A contrast
emerges between Mike's practice on an "innovative" third year module and his rou-
tines elsewhere, for example on a second-year urban landscapes module. The latter
is assessed through an assignment which Mike describes as a:

         conventional essay ... where students do have to jump through
         the hoops otherwise there's no foundation.

    He collects the anonymized scripts from a locked box after the deadline "and
then they lurk" in piles in his office until he has time to tackle them. Mike's mark-
ing involves a range of specific practices, including scanning for relevant academic
references and key words, and ticking when he finds them:

         ok they've got the basic points about geometry, cleanliness ...
         they get a tick for that.

    He writes marginal comments and finishes with a feedback summary. However,
he believes that these "carefully crafted" messages often go unheeded by students:

         they see 62 and then they put it back on the pile and then they
         go home.

    In his third year feminist geography module, Mike has introduced a new as-
sessed "guided learning log" which cannot be anonymized. He gives a detailed
description in the module handbook, holds an assignment-specific workshop, pro-
vides guidance and feedback for each diary entry, as well as a final summative
assessment. Mike describes how taking on this module proved to be a key moment
in his development as an academic teacher:

         It's almost like an epiphany--that if you understood the material
         that I was teaching properly you wouldn't assess it in traditional
         ways.

    He explains that the new learning log is a hybrid genre of academic writing
in which students must be "personal" and at the same time "scholarly"; through
writing they are coming to grips with "ways of knowing" in this branch of the

                                                                                                    197

discipline, engaging in "feminist critiques of science." Mike's practice around this
assignment involves collaboration with a writing support specialist in his institu-
tion to set up tailored group support sessions. Their work together begins with a
chance conversation in a pub, which Mike believes partly accounts for the success
of the collaboration:

         Because J and I knew each other and I'd had a good relaxed con-
         versation with her perhaps ... she knew exactly what I was trying
         to achieve with this work.

MINIATURE CASE STUDY 2: EMMA, COMPUTER SCIENCE

    Emma works in a prestigious Russell Group university. She is personally inter-
ested in teaching, but believes that the work around student writing she talks about
is "worth zero" in institutions like hers where "research ... is what counts." Like
Mike, Emma adopts contrasting approaches to student writing in different mod-
ules. In one second year module, students produce some computer code and write
a descriptive report: guidelines and brief assessment criteria are provided on the
Virtual Learning Environment (VLE). Emma marks half the one hundred scripts,
describing marking fifty assignments on the same topic as "horrendous"; she also
expresses doubt about its effectiveness:

         I'm not sure that the student, by getting it wrong and then by
         getting short remarks on it which tell him that's not good, actu-
         ally can really improve to be honest.

    Students also dislike the module and the assessment; however, Emma doubts
whether anything will change in future, because although she has offered her "take"
on the assignment to the unit leader, she explains that feeling comfortable enough
to pursue such matters depends on relationships with colleagues, and that "essen-
tially [she has] none with this guy."

    Emma is unit leader responsible for a third/fourth year specialist module. Soon
after arriving in post, she changed the assessment, introducing a very different
working process. Instead of an individual essay on a set theme, students choose
their own topic in small groups, do some initial research and write an "extended
abstract." Groups then meet with both course lecturers to receive feedback, ask
questions and set out plans for completing the project in the form of a "proper
scientific paper." At every stage, students are supported by face-to-face contact:

         We really try to get them to understand that they are not alone
         in this ... we really encourage them to come, and we are not
         making fun of them or ... seeing this as ... just a trivial thing,
         just a student's problem.

198
                                                                 "Doing Something That's Really Important"

Emma contrasts the experience of reading completed scripts with the second year
assignment:

         This is way more interesting to read ... there were fifteen groups
         and all of them have had different topics ... [Emma's emphasis]

    This enthusiasm is echoed in observed group meetings in which Emma and
her colleague make plain their enjoyment of student writing which does not cover
too-familiar territory. For example, to one group Emma says she is really pleased
with their topic, because it will mean "good added value for me and the other stu-
dents." To another, she remarks positively on the "added value for you writing and
for me reading." The idea of "value added" seems to be closely aligned during these
sessions with the level of personal interest and potential for learning which each
assignment topic presents for tutors. In one session, Emma remarks that students
have chosen a nice topic and "you're lucky that I don't know so much about [x],
lucky you." This appears to reverse the usual tutor/student hierarchies around writ-
ing: Emma is openly hoping that students will choose topics which are new to her,
positioning herself as someone who is still learning and curious about her subject,
and students as having something to offer. This message is echoed in VLE guidance
which explains to students that the assignment provides an opportunity to "try out
being the lecturer for a small part of the course."

    Another good reason in Emma's view for introducing this new assignment is
that master's students who also take the module, often from overseas, benefit great-
ly from the chance to practice this sort of research-oriented writing in English in
a UK setting. Although time consuming for tutors, the benefits come later, when
they are supporting their dissertation work. Emma thinks it would be even better

         If we could get the language people ... drag them somehow into
         our courses where there is writing done ... but there is no inter-
         action in this way, it just doesn't happen.

    Another key benefit she sees in this way of working is that it emphasizes a pro-
cess which will be very valuable for students as engineers in the future.

STEPPING OUT OF ROUTINE PRACTICES

    These brief accounts illustrate some themes recurring across the study. Both
Mike and Emma are engaged in routine practices around student writing, which
have negative associations for them as tedious and dreaded tasks with question-
able impact on students (Jackie Tuck, 2012). However, along with other study
participants, both experienced much more satisfying moments in which it seemed
possible to make a worthwhile difference to students' writing practices. These were

                                                                                                    199

often characterized by an opportunity to interact face-to-face with students during
the writing process, either where disciplinary contact time was allocated for the
purpose, or where there was a conscious decision to make time available informally,
for example when Emma and her colleague "really try to get [students] to under-
stand they're not alone." These opportunities enabled academic teachers to work
iteratively and formatively with students' texts, rather than in a one-off engagement
at the point of summative assessment.

    Emma's case illustrates another characteristic of the more satisfying and pro-
ductive moments in participants' disciplinary writing work: the opportunity to
disrupt, even if only briefly, the hierarchies usually associated with student writing
for assessment. For example, Emma's group assignment encourages students "to try
out being the lecturer," she emphasizes to them their future role as engineers, and
that staff will not "make fun" or trivialize their concerns. These moments also often
involved opportunities to collaborate closely with disciplinary colleagues or with
language specialists, often building on existing informal alliances--for example,
Mike's chance conversation in a pub with a writing support specialist. Where these
informal opportunities were absent, as in Emma's case where she has no "relation-
ship" with the second year unit leader, or "interaction" with the "language people,"
participants seemed less likely to step out of routine practices, however unsatisfac-
tory. A thread running through these examples is that pedagogic practices which
participants felt were making a positive difference to student writing also entailed
transformations in relationships with students and colleagues, emphasising dia-
logue and mutual exchange. These opportunities did not simply arise, but had to
be actively carved out through creative trade-offs between what was desirable and
what was possible at different times.

INVESTING IN DISCIPLINARY WRITING WORK

    These findings raise a further question: what made the investment involved in
finding space, time and energy for productive disciplinary writing work "worth-
while"? Again, both Mike's and Emma's cases reflect broader patterns in the study
as a whole. Emma offers an interesting critical reflection:

         Writing is called a transferable skill but I'm not sure that it actu-
         ally is so much, because quite often you only learn when you're
         doing something that's really important.

    Just as students' academic writing may only really develop when they are doing
"something really important" to them, teacher-participants needed good reasons
to step out of the usual routines around student writing. There were pragmatic
and strategic benefits which encouraged them to invest time and effort in produc-
tive disciplinary writing work, for example, where personal reputation within or

200
                                                                 "Doing Something That's Really Important"

beyond the organization was perceived to be at stake, or where time spent now
saved time later. However, equally important was the opportunity for meaningful
engagement, for example, where Emma and her colleague on the specialist module
can learn something new about their subject.

    These cases also point to factors which seemed to discourage academic teachers
in the study from moving beyond unproductive routine practices. Again, questions
of meaningful engagement were as important as pragmatic considerations such
as time or reputation. In some participants' institutions, anonymized assessment
regimes precluded the type of mutually satisfying formative engagement with stu-
dents' texts illustrated in the cases discussed here, except in situations where an
exception could be made, as in Mike's learning log.

DISCOURSES OF LEARNING AND WRITING

    The study also brought to light the ways in which academic teachers' practices
were bound up with discourses of learning and of writing. For example, the invest-
ment Mike makes in an alternative approach to writing on his third year module is
a profoundly epistemological one: sudden insight leads him to make a connection
between students' disciplinary thinking and what they do in writing. What is strik-
ing here is that this epistemological approach seems to contrast with Mike's expe-
rience on other modules where students just "tell you what they think you need to
know" and "jump through the hoops." Similarly, while Emma sees her work with
students on the third year module as helping them understand "what scientific
means in terms of writing," she has no equivalent sense of disciplinary purpose in
her work with the second year students' reports, commenting that "you wonder
why you're doing it." These examples suggest that an approach which downplays
disciplinary meaning-making for student writers is frequently experienced by aca-
demic teachers as rather meaningless and pointless in pedagogic terms.

    This separation in discourse and practice between disciplinary learning on one
hand, and learning to write on the other, where the latter is cast as the content-free
acquisition of skills and mastery of conventions, surfaced repeatedly across the study
in different types of data, including texts (echoing Lea & Street, 1999). However, as
these miniature case studies show, at particular moments and in specific contexts, a
perceived link between writing and learning for students was mirrored in a more epis-
temological approach to writing pedagogy. Albeit briefly in some cases, disciplinary
learning/teaching and the learning/teaching of writing were one and the same.

IMPLICATIONS

    The study described here brought to light a number of ways in which academic
teachers were finding productive--and potentially transformative--ways to work

                                                                                                    201
Tuck

with their students on writing in the disciplines, where there was sufficient per-
ceived incentive for the teacher in doing so. One clear implication for practice is
that it is important to find ways of developing disciplinary writing work by nurtur-
ing academic teachers' sense of personal investment in initiatives which help them
move away from less productive routine practices (see Bailey & Garner, 2010).
"Value-added" can take a number of pragmatic forms (e.g., enhanced reputation,
time saved later) but also key was meaningful engagement: the rewards of mutu-
al learning and the pleasures of collaboration. These case studies show that what
might be transformative for students in terms of academic writing is inseparable
from teachers' own transformation, for example Mike's "epiphany" when he realizes
he can devise an assessment which connects epistemologically with the subject, or
Emma's more incremental realization in the light of experience that writing may
not be an easily transferable skill.

    Academic literacies research has brought to light the importance of a "transfor-
mative interest" in student-writer meanings and perspectives as the foundation for
transformative pedagogies, acknowledging a commitment to helping students to be
successful writers in their own terms. The findings of this study refine this picture,
suggesting that what counts as making a positive difference has to be negotiated:
both students and teachers need to see the point, and to feel that the investment of
time, reputation and other resources is "worthwhile." It is arguably therefore just as
important to nurture the conditions for teacher transformation as it is to provide
incentives for students to engage at more than a superficial level with academic
writing. Although participants in this study were not explicitly drawing on an ac-
ademic literacies framework in their disciplinary work with student writers, these
findings suggest that an academic literacies approach has the potential to support
the development of such conditions.

    One way to work towards this may be to remind academic teachers of what
many already instinctively know when they engage in their own writing for the
discipline: that thinking, learning and knowledge-making are inseparable from rep-
resentation, and that writing is therefore profoundly relevant to learning and so to
teaching in the disciplines. Institutions must support both timetabled and informal
provision if this integration is to be realized. Other challenges must be addressed at
institutional level. It is difficult not to reduce large-cohort written assessments to
"hoop-jumping exercises" with little meaning for staff or students. This is particu-
larly so where students are writing in traditional academic genres such as the essay
which lend themselves to standardized assessment predicated on the assumption of
a single (anonymous) author. Perhaps one way to approach this problem would be
to accept the need in the current context for assessments in which students demon-
strate that they have the "foundation" (Mike), but to dissociate this sort of assessed
outcome more often from the process of academic text production. For example,
more use could be made of multiple choice or short answer assessment in order to

202

free up time for more dialogic and collaborative pedagogies which are the sine qua
non of transformative practice around student writing.

NOTE

1. Study participants often used the terminology of the UK sector in defining their in-
stitutions as either "research-led" such as those in the Russell Group, or "teaching-led,"
for example Mike's institution, a small university specializing mainly in Arts subjects,
established within the past fifteen years. The Russell Group is a large, long-established,
elite grouping of "top" UK research-intensive universities.

THE TRANSFORMATIVE POTENTIAL
OF LAMINATING TRAJECTORIES:
THREE TEACHERS' DEVELOPING
PEDAGOGICAL PRACTICES
AND IDENTITIES

      Kevin Roozen, Rebecca Woodard, Sonia Kline and Paul Prior

    In its efforts to develop a richer, more complex analysis of what it means to be
academically literate, Academic Literacies scholarship has illuminated alternative
ways of being and meaning-making that animate and complicate academic settings,
activities, and identities (Roz Ivanic, 2009; Roz Ivanic & Candice Satchwell, 2007;
Mary Lea & Brian Street, 1998; Theresa Lillis & Mary Scott, 2007). Research
(e.g., Amy Burgess & Roz Ivanic, 2010; Roz Ivanic, 1998; Theresa Lillis, 2001;
Kate Pahl, 2008) has primarily focused on students as agents with significant lives
outside of school, highlighting that the heterogeneous resources and social identi-
ties that students bring to schooling are critical grounds for transforming learning,
contesting dominant classroom ideologies and practices, and forging productive
linkages between the often disparate worlds of school and everyday life. Teachers'
practices and identities, in contrast, have received limited attention, and the his-
tories they bring to the classroom have been configured largely in terms of their
participation with institutional spaces and roles (Gail Richmond, Mary Juzwick &
Michael Steele, 2011). In response to Mary Lea and Brian Street's (1998) argument
that "[i]n order to understand the nature of academic learning, it is important to
investigate the understandings of both academic staff and students about their own
literacy practices without making prior assumptions as to which practices are either
appropriate or effective" (p. 158), we present here three vignettes drawn from larg-
er case studies of three teachers: Lisa (eighth grade English Language Arts), Dave
(ninth and twelfth grade science) and Kate (university-level composition). Rebec-
ca's case study of Lisa focuses on how her participation in a creative writing group
outside of school influenced her instruction, Sonia's case study of Dave looks at
his participation in digital literacies and the National Writing Project, and Kevin's
case study of Kate seeks to understand how her participation in fan-fiction writing

Roozen, Prior, Woodard and Kline

relates to her other literate engagements (Kevin Roozen, 2009, 2011). Each of
these cases exploring teachers' identities as literate persons in the world suggests the
importance of locating teachers as well as students in the laminated trajectories of
their sociocultural lives (see also Tuck Chapter 14 this volume).

    We draw from a body of work that understands the construction of identity
as an ongoing process of weaving together multiple streams of activity over time.
Drawing on Erving Goffman's (1974, 1981) work on framing and footings, we
understand the interweaving of multiple historical streams as a pervasive process
of lamination of activities, artifacts, and identities (Paul Prior, 1998; Paul Prior &
Jody Shipka, 2003). In this sense, identity is located not within and determined by
a particular social setting, but rather along trajectories of participation that stretch
across, and thus draw together, multiple sites of engagement (Ole Drier, 1999;
Dorothy Holland, William Lachicotte, Debra Skinner & Carole Cain, 1998; Ron
Scollon, 2001; JohnVan Mannen, 1984; Etienne Wenger, 1998; Stanton Wortham,
2006). Although it is not common, some teacher educators and researchers have
recognized the laminated nature of teachers' identities and practices (e.g., Janet
Alsup, 2006; Deborah Britzman, 1991; Christine Casanave & Xiaoming Li, 2008;
Mank Varghese, Brian Morgan, Bill Johnson & Kimberly Johnson, 2005). For
example, Deborah Britzman (1991) describes teaching

         as a struggle for voice and discursive practices amid a cacoph-
         ony of past and present voices, lived experiences, and available
         practices. The tensions among what has preceded, what is con-
         fronted, and what one desires shape the contradictory realities of
         learning to teach. (p. 31)

Educators' reflections on and negotiations among those resources can transform
or disrupt their classroom identities and practices (Alsup, 2006). In this chapter,
we argue for including laminated identities among the available tools in teachers'
repertoires. Beyond mapping the laminated trajectories of teachers' identities and
practices, then, we suggest that--much as students' histories with literacy beyond
school can enrich classroom learning--teachers' histories can likewise play a crucial
role in shaping pedagogical practices in ways that can reconfigure student learning.

    By tracing the trajectories of teachers' situated practices across settings, we
attempt to better describe how fundamentally laminated teachers' identities and
practices are, and to begin exploring how lamination may (or may not) lead to
transformative teaching practices. Informed by Academic Literacies and sociocul-
tural approaches that emphasize the ways people and practices develop by tying
together seemingly disparate activities across a range of representational media
(e.g., Burgess & Ivanic, 2010; Pierre Bourdieu, 1990; Bruno Latour, 2005; Jay
Lemke, 2000; Prior, 1998; Paul Prior & Julie Hengst, 2010; Scollon, 2001, 2005),
our analysis aims to make visible how three teachers at different educational levels

and in diverse disciplinary fields in the United States weave together everyday and
professional worlds and identities, transforming in at least some key ways their
teaching practices.

Lisa: "A Teacher Who Also Is Working Towards Becoming a Writer"

    Lisa, in her seventh year as a middle school English Language Arts teacher in
New York City, wrote extensively outside of her classroom--meeting with her cre-
ative writing instructor and/or writing group on a weekly basis, yet she hesitated to
identify herself as a writer: "I'm someone who writes but I think a writer is someone
who publishes things .... For the most part I'd say I'm a teacher who also is work-
ing towards becoming a writer." Although Lisa drew a sharp distinction between
her rights to call herself a teacher and a writer, as I (Rebecca) looked closely at her
actions and talk, I concluded that they tell a somewhat different story--one where
Lisa's literate activities across sites are complexly laminated. For example, in my
observations of both her writing classroom and creative writing experiences, Lisa
used the specialized discourses of creative writing to represent the routine practices
of creative writers (e.g., writers "bury" obvious parts of their writings, writers con-
stantly pay attention to their lives to get ideas).

    Transcripts of discussions between Lisa and her writing instructor, Will, and
Lisa and her eighth grade student, Esmerelda, demonstrate Lisa's focus on "brave"
writerly practices. At a coffee shop in downtown New York City, Lisa and Will be-
gan their meeting by discussing Joan Didion's (1976) essay Why I Write, which Will
had asked Lisa to read beforehand. Lisa told Will that she was particularly struck
by a part where Didion said that she sometimes "sits on [an idea] for several years"
before writing about it. Lisa thought this "was pretty brave" of Didion, and said
that she tried to do this, but often felt that she needed to develop her ideas quickly.
Will told her that a "notebook can be really helpful" for saving ideas for a later time,
and that writers often keep ideas around for a long time because "sometimes you're
not ready to write that scene" yet. The next day, Esmerelda, one of Lisa's students,
began a classroom writing conference by telling Lisa that she had worked on her
weekend assignment to make "radical revisions" to her historical fiction story. Es-
merelda had decided that she had too much going on in her story, and was going
to get rid of an extraneous character, revising or cutting all the parts related to that
character. Lisa praised Esmerelda for making such significant cuts in her story,
telling her that "we have a brave writer right here." They read through Esmerelda's
story together, and Lisa gave Esmerelda strategies to help make her story flow after
deleting the character.

    Later, Lisa explained how asking students to make radical revisions, especially
right before a project was due, "used to scare me, but now I think they [students]
are better for it." After Lisa began writing outside of school herself, she regularly

                                                                                                    207
Roozen, Prior, Woodard and Kline

encouraged students to cut large parts of their drafts. Both Will and Lisa tried to
name writerly practices and make them visible to their students, and Lisa's develop-
ing understandings of "brave" writers appeared in both settings. In her classroom,
Lisa used her authenticity as a writer who really does "live this" and "believe in" the
writing process to share the writerly world with her students. She said, "[I want to
give] students certain tools and strategies. For example, here's how you can get ideas
for this, here's how you can plan out a story ... you need to understand how it's
done." My observations confirmed the parallels in Lisa's representations of writing
and writers across sites, and supported Lisa's own report that working as a creative
writer was transforming the way she represented writing and the kinds of writer-
ly roles she invited students to take. Across settings, her words and practices un-
doubtedly "taste[d] of the context and contexts in which[they had] lived" (Mikhail
Bakhtin, 1981, p. 293).

    However, such transformations were not complete. For example, Lisa struggled
to implement some of her own creative writing practices, like peer feedback, in
her classroom. Although she said that getting the students to do "authentic part-
ner critiquing" was a big goal for her and she even videotaped part of her own
peer-writing discussion for her students, in my multiple classroom observations
peers only spent about 6% of total class time talking about their writing (a sharp
contrast to the 35% of the time Lisa talked with Will about her own writing). In
her classroom, Lisa had to designate significantly more time to direct instruction,
independent writing, and general management than in her own writing practice.

    Moreover, we can return to the initial contradiction. Despite Lisa's rich writing
experiences and prominent calls for broadening notions of writing and writers (e.g.,
Kathleen Yancey, 2009), Lisa struggled with her own writerly authority and iden-
tity. Her struggles highlight the need to further explore how deeply rooted cultural
conceptions of writing (where print literacies are often valued over digital and net-
worked literacies) and authorship (where sponsored publication often links tightly
to identity) inform--and disrupt--teachers' identity work and classroom practices.

Dave:"The Accidental Blogger"

    A high school biology teacher, scientist, computer buff, and photographer,
Dave has hosted for almost two years a blog--Things Biological: Insects, Mac-
rophotography, Teaching, Life (http://www.nwp.org/)--that ties tightly together
his practices and identities. Although he calls himself "the accidental blogger," his
blogging is anything but accidental. The genesis, trajectories, and interconnections
of Dave's identities are visible in his blog space, conversations, after-school club and
classroom. Unlike Lisa, Dave does not appear to perceive sharp boundaries between
his multiple identities and practices. By discussing his blog, which in name and
nature serves as a key link of his varied engagements, I (Sonia) aim to explore how

208

this weaving together of Dave's laminated identities and practices transformed his
pedagogical work.

    Dave's blog posts usually include at least one recently captured photograph ac-
companied by text providing background information about the subject (see exam-
ple in Figure 15.1). When Dave knows his Internet access may be restricted (during
a vacation trip, for instance), he uploads posts early and pre-sets them to publish
in his absence. He is the first to admit he is a little obsessed. However, in a video
he created in 2010 during a National Writing Project (NWP) summer institute for
teachers, Dave narrated: "I have to admit that I have never been a fan of blogs ....
Life is short. There are so many other things to do that are more important than
devoting a significant part of your life to writing to an unknown (or entirely absent)
audience."

                    Figure 15.1: Example of a post from Dave's blog.
    What then motivated Dave to begin blogging? On a number of occasions he
posed this question and offered answers. For instance, in his very first blog post he
described two separate catalysts: attending a nature photographer's presentation
and then following the man's blog and previewing blogs from other NWP teachers

                                                                                                    209
Roozen, Prior, Woodard and Kline

during that summer institute. At another time Dave mentioned that his interest in
macrophotography was fuelled when a group of students in one of his extracurric-
ular groups gave him a macro (close-up) lens for his camera as a thank-you gift. He
also described attending a presentation by a retiring photographer, after which he
asked him what he would do with his enormous collection of images. On hearing
that they would be placed in boxes for storage, Dave was dismayed. His decision to
begin a blog, as he retold, was in part an alternative way of storing, organizing and
sharing his photographs. Finally, another classroom event came into play. One of
his students brought to class a gravid praying mantis that produced several egg
cases. This mantis, the egg cases, and the resulting offspring became the focus of the
students' attention and Dave's photographic efforts for several weeks.

    Grounded in these heterogeneous experiences, Dave's blog work has trans-
formed some of his teaching and his students' practices. Now students regularly
share arthropods with Dave, and some follow or comment on his posts. On field
trips his students seek out potential photographic subjects, and Dave credits them
on his blog for their assistance. He talks to them about what makes a good scientific
photograph and shows them how to use field guides and the Internet to learn more.
He uses his own photographs for teaching, and freely encourages educational use
of his images. His stock of photographs is now so large that he has enough mate-
rial to create his own field guide, which he hopes to share with other teachers and
students. Dave's blog has also helped to connect him with a wider community of
scientists, photographers and arthropod enthusiasts. As the only biology teacher in
the school, this connection is really important for Dave: "I now feel more part of
scientific community ... and more up-to-date ... than I ever did, even as a graduate
student." Dave appeared to translate his deep enthusiasm for understanding nature
into a range of practices that aimed to instil a spirit of exploration in his students.

    This account of Dave's practices has centered on his blog, but such blending
of his out-of-school and in-school identities and practices was also evident across
other settings and times--for instance, in relation to his active participation in the
local National Writing Project site and to his after-school club. Dave's identities
and practices as biology teacher, scientist, computer buff, and blogger are so in-
tensely intertwined that to separate them seems futile. Significantly, however, Dave
teaches in a selective admission public university laboratory high school whose
mission to be "a catalyst for educational innovation" allows, perhaps encourages,
such blurring. This is not the reality for many teachers--at what loss, one wonders,
for their students?

Kate: "Showing the Students that I'm a Fan"

    Kate is a full-time composition instructor at a four-year university in the
south-eastern United States. When I (Kevin) asked her during one of our inter-

210
                                                    The Transformative Potential of Laminating Trajectories

views what excited her the most about her teaching, she immediately commented,
"showing the students that I'm a fan." Kate's use of the term "fan" here signals her
membership in a community Henry Jenkins (1992) describes as enthusiasts of pop-
ular video games, anime, movies, novels or other cultural texts who use a particular
text as a source "from which to generate a wide range of media related stories ...
stretching its boundaries to incorporate their concerns, remoulding its character to
better suit their desires" (p. 156). In previous publications (Roozen, 2009, 2011), I
analyzed the ways Kate's deep involvement with fan fiction and fan art profoundly
laminated her engagement with English Studies as a student in high school English,
as an undergraduate English major and in her MA programme in Writing Studies.
Here I extend my tracing of this laminated trajectory beyond Kate's MA work to
address how her involvement as a "fan" textures and transforms her activities as a
professional teacher.

    Working on her fan fiction over the past thirteen years, Kate has published on-
line multiple novels, dozens of short stories and poems and a variety of other prose
pieces from the popular texts at the centercentre of the more than fifty "fandoms"
she participates in, including those dedicated to movies, comics, videogames and a
wide range of novels, anime, cartoons and television shows. In addition, her novels,
stories and poems are frequently supplemented by the many forms of fan art she
creates. According to Kate, "I have such a vivid picture of them [the characters
and scenes depicted in her fan fiction] in my mind, I just wanted people to really
see what they look like. I can describe them in words, but I think people can un-
derstand them better if they can see them." Kate's fan art includes pencil, crayon,
and digital drawings; cartoons; music videos; costumes and clothing; dolls; stuffed
animals; and jewellery based on characters and scenes from the cultural texts at
the center of her fandoms. David Barton and Mary Hamilton (1998) noted that
"being a fan involved a range of literacy activities spanning reading and writing
and incorporating other media" (p. 249). For Kate, being a "fan" clearly involves
engagement with a wide range of textual and semiotic practices.

    The fan fiction and fan art featured on the wiki Kate created for Sonic Wings,
a Japanese video game, offers a good sense of Kate's engagement as a fan. In addi-
tion to the dozen or so short stories she's written based on the characters of Sonic
Wings, Kate's wiki also features two fan novels based on two different versions
of the game, one of which is currently thirteen chapters in length. The wiki also
showcases dozens of drawings that Kate has made based on events and scenes from
Sonic Wings, including "profiles" Kate created for the game's major and minor
characters, each profile containing a representative drawing and key information
about the character.

    Evidencing the lamination of her identity as a fan and her developing identity
as a composition teacher, Kate discussed in one interview her plans for developing
composition courses:

                                                                                                    211
Roozen, Prior, Woodard and Kline

         I'll be teaching the themed, research-based comp[osition] II
         course next semester, and I'm really looking for the opportunity
         to incorporate fan fiction. I want to do it with a theme of anima-
         tion. That means I'll get to show the students a lot of movies and
         cartoons I'm a fan of. I haven't fully planned the course yet, but I
         already have ideas of what I want to show.

    One of the follow-up questions I emailed a few weeks later invited Kate to say
more about the connection she saw between her fan activities and the aims of the
composition course she was planning. Kate responded by writing, "the research
areas [of the university's] new curriculum covers--evaluation, comparison, synthe-
sis, and argument--are all a part of what fan fiction authors (good ones, anyway!)
do." As the semester approached, Kate drew upon her engagement as a fan, and in
particular her experience with anime, to develop two different versions of the com-
position II course, one based on the topic of animation and the second based on
the subject of the South in the United States (a regional categorization still rooted
in the Civil War). Briefly describing these courses in an email interview during the
semester, Kate wrote, "I'm using Squidbillies [an animated cartoon based on squid-
like characters living in the southern United States] in composition II, both in the
animation class and in the south one."

    Kate's emerging professional practices and identities have been shaped by her
broad array of literate activities; what might appear to be stable and homogeneous
professional practices and identities are actually woven from an amalgam of literate
engagements, some of which come from their encounters with formal education
and formal professional development, and some of which come from her "other"
literate engagements as a fan. My sense is that these laminated trajectories have not
only transformed Kate's developing identity as an educator, but also stand to trans-
form how her students encounter and engage with the university's composition
instruction and with writing and literate activity more broadly.

CONCLUSION

    Informed by theoretical perspectives that emphasize the profoundly dialogic
and hybrid nature of literate action (Ivanic, 2009; Ivanic & Satchwell, 2007; Lea &
Street, 1998; Lillis & Scott, 2007), Academic Literacies theories have argued that
the heterogeneous resources and social identities that students bring to schooling
serve as fertile grounds for constructing and reconstructing new identities, disrupt-
ing dominant power relationships, illuminating the affordances and constraints
of various forms of discourse, and, ultimately, transforming classroom spaces and
practices. As a result, Academic Literacies has productively critiqued conventional
approaches to student writing that are oriented towards the monologic reproduc-

212

tion of privileged academic discourses and has called for pedagogical practices and
perspectives that foreground the dialogic interplay of official and unofficial dis-
course practices. Based on our case studies of Lisa, Dave, and Kate, we argue that
the laminated trajectories of practices and identities that teachers bring to school
also deserve close attention and can become a key resource for pedagogies that
create classroom spaces in which students are invited and encouraged to weave
together multiple, seemingly disparate voices, selves, and practices from their own
repertoires. In other words, we suggest that the pedagogical practices that emerge
when Lisa, Dave, and Kate work to blend their laminated trajectories into their
teaching offer one way of putting Academic Literacy theory into practice. When
we trace these teachers' trajectories of practices and identities, much as when re-
search has examined students' literate lives and selves, a complicated picture of
laminated pedagogical practices emerges. Our case studies suggest that Lisa, Dave,
and Kate's blending of everyday and school literacies (in the latter cases promot-
ed by disciplinary interventions like the National Writing Project and graduate
courses in Writing Studies) have transformed the way they teach. We also imagine
that Lisa, Dave, and Kate's laminated trajectories of pedagogical practice have the
potential to transform the way their students encounter and engage with school
literacy practices. Lisa's interweaving of discourses from her creative writing experi-
ences as she conferences with her middle school students, for example, can enrich
their strategies for revision and broaden their representations of literate activity.
The interconnections Dave forges among his blog space, after-school club, and
his classroom seem to be encouraging his students to create and maintain similar
kinds of linkages and enriching their understanding of the multimodal dimen-
sion of literate action. Kate's use of her experiences with fan-fiction as grounds for
her university writing syllabi and tasks can productively complicate her students'
understanding of the distinctions between and hierarchies among vernacular and
school-based literacies. Of course, Lisa, Dave, and Kate drew from some aspects of
their everyday literate and semiotic resources to transform their teaching, but did
not draw from everything or transform all dimensions of school life. Nevertheless,
these case studies, in our view, argue for increased attention to the way linking
teachers' pedagogical practices to their everyday literate engagements can open up
opportunities for transformation, as well as critique, of classroom practice, and for
more fully recognizing, valuing, and promoting such linkages as a key element in
the production of pedagogical practice.

MARKING THE BOUNDARIES:
KNOWLEDGE AND IDENTITY
IN PROFESSIONAL DOCTORATES

      Jane Creaton

    Writing is a central feature of all aspects of the doctoral process. Students are
engaged in textual activities such as the taking of notes, the keeping of research
diaries, the analysis of interview data and the preparation of reports and conference
papers well before they write their thesis. Hence Barbara Kamler and Pat Thomson
(2006, p. 4) conceptualize doctoral research as a continuous process of inquiry
through writing, and for David Scott and Robin Usher (1996, p. 43) research is
"writing and the production of a text." However, despite the dominance of writ-
ing in the process of knowledge production, the area of doctoral writing remains
relatively under-theorized as a social practice. While there is a profusion of self-
help and advice books on the market, most take a skills-based approach in which
deficits in writing can be addressed through learning a set of decontextualized tips
and techniques (Kamler & Thomson, 2004). This "study skills" model (Mary Lea
& Brian Street, 1998) treats writing as a set of technical transferable skills, failing
to recognize how academic writing practices are situated in wider social and insti-
tutional contexts. Although there are guides for supervisors (Kamler & Thomson,
2006) and students (Rowena Murray, 2011) which do acknowledge writing as a
social practice, Claire Aitchison et al. (2012, p. 2) conclude that relatively little is
known about "how doctoral students actually learn research writing, how supervi-
sors `teach' or develop the writing of their students and what happens to students
and supervisors during this process."

    In researching students' and supervisors' perspectives on doctoral writing,
Aitchison, et al. (2012) found that both parties identified feedback as the primary
mechanism through which students learned how to write. The nature and content
of this feedback was crucial to the relationship between supervisor and student and
to the development of the student's doctoral identity. In this chapter, the role of
feedback in constructing doctoral writing practices is explored through an analysis
of the written feedback given to doctoral students. Interviews with students and
supervisors can provide some insight into the perceptions of, and attitudes to, feed-

back. However, previous research has identified an interesting disjuncture between
what lecturers did and what they said they did in relation to marking and feedback
(Barbara Read, Becky Francis & Jocelyn Robson, 2004; Frank Webster, David Pep-
per & Alan Jenkins, 2000). Furthermore, written feedback on student work is a
specific genre of writing, which can itself be seen a social practice. It is therefore a
productive site for the study of the educational discourses which staff engage with
in making and justifying their responses to student writing.

    This study is part of an ongoing practice-based project relating to the written
feedback that is given to students in higher education. An earlier phase of the re-
search analyzed samples of feedback from a range of units in an undergraduate crim-
inology programme to consider how the feedback given to students were shaped
by the departmental, disciplinary and institutional contexts (Creaton, 2011). This
phase of the project analyzes feedback from a very different type of programme--a
professional doctorate--which raises different, but equally interesting issues about
the discourses which underpin marking and feedback. The chapter begins with an
overview of the professional doctorate and then analyzes some of the key themes
that emerge from an analysis of the written feedback that was given to students on
the first stage of the programme. It then goes on to consider the implications of
these findings for enhancing feedback practice and concludes with a discussion on
the value of the academic literacies approach as a tool for pedagogical enhancement
(see also Kaufhold Chapter 6 and Badenhorst et al. Chapter 7 this volume).

THE PROFESSIONAL DOCTORATE

    The feedback analyzed for this study came from a professional doctorate in
Criminal Justice (DCrimJ) programme offered by the Institute of Criminal Justice
Studies at the University of Portsmouth. The Framework for Higher Education
Qualifications does not distinguish between the PhD and the professional doc-
torate: both are awarded for "the creation and interpretation of new knowledge,
through original research or other advanced scholarship, of a quality to satisfy peer
review, extend the forefront of the discipline, and merit publication" (Quality As-
surance Agency for Higher Education, 2008). However, there are some differenc-
es in the structure, delivery and ethos of the awards. Professional doctorate pro-
grammes usually include a series of taught modules as a precursor to the research
phase and in the DCrimJ, students study four taught doctoral level units (Profes-
sional Review and Development, Advanced Research Techniques, Publication and
Dissemination, Research Proposal) followed by a research project which culminates
in a 50,000 word thesis. Students are required to be engaged in a relevant field of
professional activity and in this programme, a wide range of criminal justice sector
backgrounds are represented, including the police, probation, social work and the
law. The teaching of the units is embedded in the criminal justice context and stu-

218

dents link their assignments to their specific field of professional activity.
    A professional doctorate programme was chosen partly for practical reasons--

unlike the largely bilateral and private nature of feedback that is given by a PhD su-
pervisor, the feedback that is given to professional doctorate students on the taught
phase of programme is agreed between a first and second marker, scrutinized by an
external examiner and retained for audit purposes. There was, therefore, an accessi-
ble source of naturally occurring data through which the conventions around aca-
demic and professional discourse could be interrogated. However, the professional
doctorate is, in any event, a rich source of data for the investigation of discursive
practices. David Boud and Mark Tennant (2006) note that the informal, situat-
ed and contingent knowledge generated through professional practice (Michael
Eraut, 1994, 2000) can present some challenges for academic staff inducted in
more formal disciplinary-based knowledge of the academy (Tony Becher & Paul
Trowler, 2001). Whilst dispositional knowledge generated through reflection and
reflective practice is well established in educational and health disciplines, it may
be viewed with suspicion in disciplines located within a more positivist tradition.
The multidisciplinary nature of criminology means that students and staff come
to the DCrimJ with a range of different epistemological, theoretical and method-
ological perspectives. These are reflected in the written texts that are produced for
assessment, and it is these texts and the responses to them, which are the subject
of this chapter.

    The sample comprised 63 assignments which were submitted by students in
2007-2011 for the Professional Review and Development module. This module
is the first one that students take on entry to the programme and includes a
critical review of the concepts of professionalism, professional practice and pro-
fessional knowledge; reflective practice and an introduction to the philosophical
underpinnings of research. Students are assessed through a three-part assignment
which requires them to critique an academic journal article from the perspective
of their professional practice; to provide a reflective account of their personal
and professional journey to the professional doctorate and an assessment of their
learning and development needs; and to critically analyze the concepts of pro-
fessionalism, professional practice and professional knowledge within their own
field.

    The feedback that had been given on these assessments was uploaded to NVivo
for coding and analysis. The first phase of coding was concerned with analyzing
the comments at what Theresa Lillis (2008) terms the transparent/referential level.
These included comments that staff made about student writing, particularly in
relation to surface level features of the text. The second phase of coding focussed
on the discursive/indexical level, looking at the linguistic features of the feedback
indexing wider discourses. This chapter discusses two key themes which emerged
from the analysis of the data: the relationship between professional and academic

                                                                                                    219

knowledge and the negotiation of doctoral identity.

KNOWLEDGE

    Markers made a range of comments about aspects of students' writing, such as
structure and referencing, which also featured in the undergraduate feedback from
the first phase of the project. The most significant difference between the two sam-
ples was the markers' attitude to language which explicitly positioned the student
within the text. In traditional undergraduate essays, markers strongly disapproved
of students using the first person or making reference to their personal or pro-
fessional knowledge or experience. From an academic literacies perspective, these
conventions can be seen as having an ideological function beyond a simply stylistic
preference. The exclusion of personal experience, the absence of the author in the
text, the use of objective prose are all features of a dominant "essayist literacy,"
which privileges the discursive practices of particular social groups. Lillis (2001, p.
115), for example, found that the "institutional rejection" of personal experience
was a particular issue for the student writers in her study, who felt marginalized by
the lack of opportunities for drawing on their own lived experiences as a resource
for meaning making within higher education.

    However, aspects of the professional doctorate assignment required students
to explicitly engage with their personal and professional perspectives. Markers also
made it clear that, even in relation to the more conventionally academic aspects of
the assignment, it was critical to position themselves as a practitioner:

         I think it would have added value to position yourself at the
         outset. As a police officer you would presumably take a particu-
         lar view of this.

         ... although you allude to your profession right at the end, you
         have not explicitly stated why this article is of interest to you in
         your particular professional role/context.

    Elizabeth Chiseri-Strater (1996, p. 127) suggests that locating oneself assertive-
ly and deliberately within a text reflects ethical, rhetorical and theoretical choices
on the part of the researcher. However, for students, these choices are often de-
termined by wider disciplinary and institutional constraints. In the case of the
professional doctorate, the deliberate foregrounding of both the personal and the
professional can be seen as disrupting some of the traditional epistemological and
disciplinary boundaries and practices which have applied in dominant academ-
ic writing contexts. Acknowledging the legitimacy of professional and personal
knowledge requires a reconsideration of the academic writing practices which are
entwined with the particular type of disciplinary knowledge generated in the acad-

220
                                                                                        Marking the Boundaries

emy. It can also make explicit the function that writing and feedback practices serve
in reinforcing power relationships and existing patterns of knowledge construction.

IDENTITY

    A second key theme which emerged from the analysis of the feedback was how
tutors positioned themselves in relation to the students through the feedback that
they gave. Markers often addressed the students by name and made extensive use
of the second person to frame their comments. A more intimate relationship be-
tween the marker and the student was also established through the use of other
metadiscoursal features. The use of hedges and tentative language was prominent,
with markers using phrases such as "would have liked," "wondered if," or "possibly"
when discussing areas of possible omission or further discussion. Even where there
were areas of disagreement, phrases such as "I'm not sure that I agree," or "I'm not
entirely convinced" were used. The feedback was also noticeable for the extent of
personal engagement that markers had with the text. There were examples of mark-
ers responding to points in the student essays with anecdotes from their own pro-
fessional experience, drawing on examples from their current research or sharing
their perspectives on the doctoral journey. There were also numerous expressions
of pleasure and enjoyment in reading the students' work and in the prospect of
working with the student in the future.

    The pedagogical discourses employed by members of staff on this course are in
significant contrast to those at undergraduate level, where feedback was written in a
largely impersonal tone, was more authoritative in nature and disclosed little about
the marker's own position. These differences suggest a renegotiation of the iden-
tities of students and markers at doctorate level. At undergraduate level, there is
usually a very clear difference in status and expertise between the staff and student,
which is reinforced through the form and language of the feedback genre. However,
professional doctoral students often occupy senior positions within the criminal
justice sector and have embarked on the programme with the intention of becom-
ing "researching professionals" rather than "professional researchers." The student
may be seeking academic recognition of their existing professional knowledge and
experience rather than an apprenticeship to the academy. The language used in
the feedback reflects the different nature of the relationship in which knowledge is
exchanged rather than simply validated.

IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE

    Mary Lea & Brian Street (2006) argue that the academic literacies approach has
both theoretical and practical value--as a heuristic model for understanding literacy
practices and as a framework for curriculum development, training programmes and

                                                                                                    221

personal reflection and development. How then can the evidence from this research
project inform current practice in approaches to marking and feedback more generally?

    Firstly, a close analysis of the feedback that staff give to students can provide
useful evidence to monitor and inform assessment practices. Royce Sadler (2005, p.
192) argues that the focus on making assessment criteria transparent is misplaced,
because the difficulties in defining terms precisely simply "sets up new verbal terms
that in turn call for more elaboration, and so on in infinite regress." A more produc-
tive approach, he suggests, is to identify the norms of the assessment community
through a close examination of the nature of, and reasons for, the actual marking
decisions made by tutors. Through this inductive process it should be possible to
identify and convey to students the standards which are embedded in the tacit
knowledge of a particular localised assessment community.

    Arguably, however, these strategies may simply reinforce existing patterns of
knowledge construction and representation within the academy. A central criticism
of the communities of practice approach is that issues of power, authority, and struc-
ture tend to be unacknowledged and under-theorized. The approach does not ac-
count for how particular groups of students may be excluded or marginalized from
the process of legitimate peripheral participation (Romy Clark & Roz Ivanic, 1997;
Lillis, 2001) or how dominant literacy practices may serve as a barrier to engagement
rather than as a shared resource (Lea, 2005). The development of a more coherent set
of shared standards may make for fairer assessment practices, but does not challenge
the role of the university in defining and reifying particular forms of literacy practices.

    Thus, Lillis (2003) argues for a more radical transformation of pedagogical prac-
tice. She uses Mikhail Bakhtin's work as a theoretical framework through which to
argue for a shift away from monologic approaches that privilege the single author-
itative voice of the tutor and towards dialogic approaches which include a range
of discourses and voices. Practical examples of this approach include: "talkback"
rather than feedback on students' written texts, opening up disciplinary content to
a wider range of external interests and influences, and opening up academic writing
conventions to new and different ways of knowing. This, she argues, is the crucial
step through which an academic literacies approach can shift from a theoretical
frame to a pedagogical frame.

    A second practical implication of this research relates to staff development. A
starting point would be to have course-level or programme-level discussions in
relation to establishing what views are in relation to acceptable forms of knowledge
and representation practices within the discipline. What sources of knowledge are
acceptable within the discipline and is there a preferred hierarchy? For example,
should students be looking for theoretical support or to empirical evidence in the
first instance? When looking for sources of evidence, are particular types ruled in
or out, for example internet sources, or newspapers? This exercise is not necessarily
expected to result in a consensus which can apply across all units and disciplines--

222
                                                                                        Marking the Boundaries

it is a rare discipline indeed where a course team would be able to agree on all of
these issues. However, it provides the basis upon which to share some of this tacit
knowledge with students and to highlight or flag up areas where there might be lack
of consensus or certainty.

    Another strategy for explicating some of this tacit knowledge would be the anal-
ysis of written feedback that is given to students within a particular unit or course.
Discourse and/or conversation analysis provides a useful way to identify underlying
assumptions and conventions in particular contexts. It provides an opportunity for
questioning hegemonic or conventional practices within the discipline and for show-
ing how taken-for-granted practices can be explored and made visible. It also has the
advantage of enabling discussions about shared aims and tacit assumptions to be had
without identifying or singling out particular members of staff. These practical strat-
egies to uncover some of the tacit knowledge underpinning judgements about mark-
ing and feedback might provide valuable information about the norms, conventions
and practices of the discipline that can then be shared with students. Alternatively
Ann Johns' (1997) work on "students as researchers" suggests a way of getting stu-
dents to investigate the academic setting in which they are writing and the values and
expectations which underlie the texts they are being asked to produce.

    In the context of the professional doctorate, the application of the academic liter-
acies approach suggests a number of ways in which feedback and assessment practices
could be reviewed. There is evidence of markers encouraging students to reconsider
their academic writing practices and in developing different types of feedback rela-
tionships. However, the giving of feedback remains a largely private and monologic
process and the final assessment--a thesis and viva--is the same as for the tradition-
al doctorate. This might be seen as evidence of what David Scott, Andrew Brown,
Ingrid Lunt and Lucy Thorne (2004) see as evidence of a "colonization" model in
which dominant academic modes of representing knowledge take precedence over
other methods of communication and dissemination. Tom Maxwell (2003) suggests
that this is characteristic of "first generation" professional doctorates, which tend to
conform to existing institutional doctoral practices. However, as professional doctor-
ates become more established, he suggests that "second generation" doctorates offer
a more radical potential to reshape the academic and professional partnerships. This
might be reflected in the development of alternative forms of feedback, for example,
dialogic feedback within the professional doctorate cohort as a whole; alternative
forms of written representations, for example, practice based reports; and alternative
forms of assessment, for example, a portfolio of evidence.

CONCLUSION

    The example of the professional doctorate shows how an academic literacies
approach can connect academic writing and feedback to wider discourses around

                                                                                                    223

knowledge and identity. The analysis of the feedback given on professional doc-
torates suggests that feedback practices are epistemological, in that they involve
judgements about what counts as valid knowledge in the department, discipline or
the academy. They are also ideological, in that they are implicated in reinforcing
existing patterns of power and privilege. Given the crucial gatekeeping function
of marking and feedback, an understanding of how academic staff construct the
boundaries of appropriate knowledge and identities and the extent to which they
may allow them to be contested, is key to an effective theorization and teaching of
academic writing.

CODA: FEEDBACK TO THE AUTHOR FROM THE AUTHOR

Dear Jane,
    This was an interesting and enjoyable read. However, it was interesting to note

that, despite the implied critique of traditional academic writing conventions, this
piece was written largely in accordance with those very conventions. So for example,
it is written in the third person and you have avoided positioning yourself explicitly
in the text. However, your own experience does seem very relevant--you are a mem-
ber of the course team for the programme which is the focus of the research study
and you even wrote some of the feedback that you analyzed as part of the project! I
think it might also have been worth mentioning that you completed a professional
doctorate yourself and encountered some of the same difficulties in negotiating the
boundaries between the professional and the academic with which these students are
grappling. Isn't it the case that your identities as course team member, marker and
(ex)student will give you a particular perspective on these issues?

    The fact that you have found it difficult to write outside the genre (despite the
active encouragement of the editors of this volume to do so) illustrates the problems
that are likely to be encountered in encouraging changes to deep-seated academic
writing practices. A first step may be to set tasks which involve a standard written
assignment but which encourage students to provide some interaction of commen-
tary on the text (for example, asking students to write a couple of feedback para-
graphs on an assignment; using the comment function to provide commentaries
on the text). This allows students to produce conventional academic text but which
also enables some engagement with and critique of the processes through which it
is produced. Maybe you should consider something similar with this chapter?

WHAT'S AT STAKE
IN DIFFERENT TRADITIONS?
LES LITTÉRACIES UNIVERSITAIRES
AND ACADEMIC LITERACIES

      Isabelle Delcambre in conversation with Christiane Donahue

        Isabelle Delcambre is Professor Emeritus at the Université de Lille, France
        and a member of the Théodile-CIREL laboratory. Christiane Donahue is
        Associate Professor of Linguistics, Director of the Institute for Writing and
        Rhetoric, Dartmouth College, US, and a member of the Théodile-CIREL
        laboratory. Isabelle and Christiane have worked together, exploring university
        writing in France and the United States via exchanges and shared projects,
        and have been learning about writing research and teaching in each others'
        contexts for some twelve years. They have published together and separately
        on these topics, in particular as the result of a three-year study of French uni-
        versity student writing across disciplines, led by Isabelle.

Christiane: You have been at the forefront of research about writing in secondary
and postsecondary education in France for decades (e.g., Delcambre 1997). What
is the current status of post-secondary writing research and teaching in France?

Isabelle: Many research fields study university practices--this question is with-
in that context. Aspects that have long been studied include the role of meta-
cognition in university success, and sociological studies (e.g., Pierre Bourdieu &
Jean-Claude Passeron, 1964) about students' trajectories and socialization, their
failure in the first years, their modes of living and studying, etc. Studies of writing
at university, the genres produced there and the forms of continued learning of
writing in university contexts have contributed to establishing this larger area of
university practices as a field, la pédagogie universitaire. In particular, the focus
has been on supporting students' entry into a "writing universe." Not all college
writing is in the form of exams for evaluation. We have asked ourselves, who are
students? Future professionals? Future academics seeking knowledge? Who are
faculty? Teachers or researchers?

    This diversity of purposes for writing indicates a diversity of practices. Possibly,

                                                                                                    227
Delcambre with Donahue

a student who writes as a future professional encounters different genres and diffi-
culties from those encountered by a future academic seeking knowledge; the same
is true for faculty. Descriptions of academic genres in a rhetorical or functional vein
dominated in the 1990s in France. Yves Reuter (1998) was the first to theorize the
question of student writers and their difficult relationship to academic writing. The
question of the author's identity, or the enunciative perspective on writing appears
much later in our research discussions (see the work on "writerly images," Isabelle
Delcambre & Yves Reuter, 2002). The current focus on authorship from an enun-
ciative standpoint is the focus of other research groups in France, most notably the
Grenoble group (cf. Françoise Boch & Fanny Rinck, 2010).

Christiane: Tell me about your first encounter with "Academic Literacies"?

Isabelle: I discovered the debates between Jack Goody (e.g., 1977, 1986) and Bri-
an Street (e.g., 1995) in the 1990s. I was first influenced by Goody's theory about
writing and the construction of thinking that writing provides; and then I heard
of Brian Street's work, incidentally, and I was somewhat astonished that Goody's
theories could be challenged. That shows the intellectual domination of Goody's
theories in France at that time for researchers, who were not so well informed about
research abroad. Later, during a major research project funded by the French gov-
ernment, I met many colleagues from AcLits, and read their essays, discussed with
them, and so on ...

Christiane: What points of shared interest did you find in these discussions?

Isabelle: I was first astonished (and a bit envious) when I encountered the well-es-
tablished importance of university writing research in AcLits. In those years in
France, very few people were interested in such questions, apart from those who
developed a "technical skills" point of view on students' difficulties (less frequent
nowadays, with the development of "pédagogie universitaire"). The AcLits search
for explanations of students' difficulties by the means of concepts such as social
practices, identity, power, empowerment and transformation met, in my opinion,
our didactic points of view on attitudes towards writing ("rapport à l'écriture"),
representations (of writing, of the self as a writer, of knowledge, etc.) and disci-
plinary awareness (for all these concepts, see Yves Reuter et al., 2013).

    But some of these concepts do not receive quite the same definition. For exam-
ple, social practices seem to be, for didacticians, more a range of determinations (his-
torical, cultural and personal) and less a high-stakes object of negotiation, power or
struggle. In the same way, when we talk about representation there have always been
questions about what was intended. In fact, in Educational Sciences, this term,
borrowed from social psychology, is quite ordinary, referring to the ideas that peo-
ple construct about writing processes, writing's functions, its objectives and so on.

228
                                                                                                      Reflections 3

    In addition, it seems that for AcLits social practices applies to social contexts as
well as to academic contexts, with the same reference to power and domination (see
Street et al., Reflections 5 this volume). In didactics, too, practices are understood
both at the university level and in the social world, but I think that didacticians
have focused on the influence or relationship between the social and the school
world, even in the most ordinary practices of writing. The concept of "pratiques
sociales de référence" (referential social practices) proposed by Jean Louis Marti-
nand (1986), a didactician of technology, is often used to understand the distance
between school genres and socially grounded genres when accounting for the dif-
ficulties students may encounter when trying to fulfill school expectations. Many
conflicts or tensions could happen between these different kinds of practices.

Christiane: The term you have developed in French research is littéracies universi-
taires--university literacies; what are the roots of that term?

Isabelle: This field brings together two long-term research traditions, didactics and
linguistics, to describe practices and written genres in university contexts (though
certainly other fields come into play--psychology, cognition, ethnography ...). "Lit-
eracy" emphasizes the contextual, social and cultural aspects of reading and writing.

    The intellectual history of the term "literacy" in France includes: Goody (1977,
1986) as a point of departure (thus shared in some ways with UK developments);
Françoise Boch et al. (2004) offered attention to university writing in a sustained
way, both theoretically and in terms of practices, but not yet using the term "lit-
eracy"; Jean Marie Privat and Mohamed Kara in 2006 published "La littéracie,"
reflecting on the anglo-saxon tradition of the term; Kara developed "Les écrits de
savoir" in 2009, reflecting on the heuristic functions of writing in research disci-
plines.

    In a different vein, Béatrice Fraenkel and Aïssatou Mbodj (2010) developed
the social and cultural senses of literacy extensively, introducing in France the New
Literacy Studies work, translating foundational pieces such as Sylvia Scribner and
Michael Cole (1981) and focusing primarily on the ethnological dimensions of
New Literacy Studies.

    A new name was needed for this new research field with its particular data,
its multidisciplinarity, its methods and concepts. "Littéracies" allows an echo of
"academic literacies" given the shared ground and objects of attention; it allows at
the same time attention to what is different. It also allows an essential connection
to disciplinary and institutional contexts in the elaboration of practices, but avoids
the link to "académique," seen in French as negative, pretentious, formal; "univer-
sity literacies" is an institutional sphere of discourse production.

Christiane: Why not just "didactics of university French"? Why "literacies"?

                                                                                                    229
Delcambre with Donahue

Isabelle: "Didactics of French" generally refers to the analysis of teaching and
learning French as a language, or to remedial practices; it does not generally take
up the epistemological and discursive activities of writing. A "didactics of writing"
would be meaningless in a French university, in contrast to what US composition
theory had to create when it separated from/opposed English literature as a uni-
versity department and discipline. Because the discipline "French" does not exist
in universities (neither for teaching nor for research), references to a "didactics of
university French" would seem rather to be linked to French as a school subject.

    Why do you think didactics has not developed as a field in Anglo-Saxon tradi-
tions? What are (if there are) the specificities of didactics from your point of view?
To what extent is it possible to link them in the American panorama? Or maybe it
is impossible?

Christiane: This is complex. "Didactics" as a field does not indeed seem to exist
in at least US Anglo-Saxon traditions. We have Education and we have research
in pedagogy, directly informing our teaching. Didactics seems, to me, to fit the
research tradition that resists "applicationism" (by which I mean applying research
results immediately to pedagogical contexts seeking practical applications) in fa-
vor of research that is more detached from the direct realities of teaching. Thus,
didactics of, say, science, focuses on the theory of science teaching and learning as
a research discipline. This gets complicated for writing; if we discuss a "didactics
of writing" we are positing writing as a discipline. And so, here is a strong link to
Composition Studies or Writing Studies in the United States, which takes as its
object the teaching and learning of university writing as a discipline. Where does
"Ac Lits" fit within these framings I wonder?

Isabelle: Unlike "university literacies," whose emergence is linked more to the ex-
tension into university levels of the research questions and themes that had been
constructed for secondary and primary education writing research (didactics of
French), from my point of view, AcLits came about as a specific area of New Lit-
eracy Studies, in order to describe non traditional students' literacies or literacies
associated with new practices (distance learning, new media), and with a critical
vision with respect to the implicit norms and ways of working of the traditional
university. As I understand it, AcLits seeks to understand the specific terrain of
the university; it studies relationships to writing; non-native speakers' encounters
with UK university writing; transformation of practices of writing linked to digital
environments; distance learning and writing; relationships between personal and
university writing; scholars' writing practices. It supports thinking about university
writing as mobilizing relationships of power and forms of identity construction in
which students' writing practices are caught; it develops, in response, a critique of
academic writing conventions and attends to different disciplinary contexts. How

do you generally understand AcLits in relation to your US domain?

Christiane: For me, US-style "first-year composition" has many of the features that
AcLits has developed in terms of writing in the university at large, in the disciplines
and beyond. That is, in the United States we have tended to think of the first year
of college writing as the site of negotiation and resistance. In the theorizing and
analysis of this work, we have sought to understand transformative practices in
these contexts. The domain of disciplinary writing has settled far more squarely
into an integrative model with a sense of norms and conventions, even as it has
argued for writing as transforming the knowledge of the discipline (see also discus-
sion in Russell and Mitchell Reflections 2 this volume). One of the recent trends in
US writing scholarship, the "writing knowledge transfer" research, is relevant here
in a lateral way. The idea of writing knowledge "transfer" was initially focused on
what students learn that can be re-used in subsequent tasks and contexts. What's
interesting is that the goal of integration is more appropriate for the "transfer"
model, while knowledge "transformation," given the dynamic nature of learning
and growth, works with appropriation, negotiation, resistance, critical reflection,
metacognitive reshaping.

Isabelle: I'm thinking now about the connections and differences between what we
refer to as "university literacies" and "Ac Lits." University literacies does not focus
on multimodal or new media literacies, at least not yet. To date, university literacies
has remained a research field without engaging much with pedagogical practice,
while AcLits has engaged both with teaching practices and broader institutional
practices. This is perhaps due to the structure of French universities (where faculty
are more professors and lecturers than "simple" teachers) and to the dominant con-
tempt for pedagogy (due to faculty evaluation models, which do not give credit for
pedagogical activities).

    Perhaps most important: AcLits analyzes students' resistance to university ac-
culturation, reflects on questions of power relations and authority in writing prac-
tices, and seeks perhaps even to encourage these resistances; university literacies'
point of departure is not ideological but descriptive (the descriptive analysis of
university discourses and students'/teachers' representations).

    Transformation in the sense of challenging or resisting dominant conventions is
not the goal of university literacies, at least not to date. Transformation at whatever
level--i.e., opening up debate about what kinds of language/s, conventions, semiot-
ic resources can be used at university, is not important to university literacies. Uni-
versity literacies does not have a critical stance towards practices of writing or evalua-
tion, unlike French didactics in secondary school in the 1980s, which deconstructed
traditional writing exercises and was highly critical of the practices underlying these
exercises (see Jean-François Halté, 1992, for example). University literacies is far too

                                                                                                    231
Delcambre with Donahue

underdeveloped, far too institutionally "weak" to be transformative in this way. That
said, French didactics took 15 years to transform secondary school writing practices,
and even today, traditional practices resurface periodically in some contexts.

Christiane: So, transforming the university itself and its writing practices is not with-
in the current goals of university literacies. But perhaps university literacies seeks
to transform the students' experiences of entering a universe that is in many ways
foreign to what they have known until now? To listen to and understand those expe-
riences? To unseat the dominant view of "writing" as "micro-linguistic competencies,"
especially in light of the changing international nature of language demands? Doesn't
"university literacies" seek to transform, in a way, the French university?

Isabelle: Yes, for sure. University Literacies is grounded in the idea that students
get to the university with writing knowledge and practices that must transform in
order to enter into the disciplinary writing practices that they will progressively dis-
cover throughout the curriculum. And also in the idea that it is the responsibility of
faculty to accompany students in these discoveries, rather than to hope that some-
day such accompanying will no longer be needed. The ANR research project (e.g.
Delcambre and Donahue, 2010, 2012; Isabelle Delcambre & Dominique Lahanier
-Reuter, 2010) showed how much the transition from the undergraduate level to
the master's level profoundly transforms students' conceptions. They talk at length
about the new writing challenges they find as they write their master's theses. Uni-
versity Literacies supports the idea that learning writing is an ongoing task. In that
sense, we can say that University Literacies has a transformative approach, based
on empirical research that allows descriptions of students' and teachers' represen-
tations and creates an understanding of the conditions needed for fruitful dialogue
between these two groups.

Christiane: I'm also thinking that critical discourse analysis--used in Ac Lits and
all about power and authority--has specific, deep roots in French theory?

Isabelle: Yes, but the French theory (Pierre Bourdieu and Jean Passeron, 1964;
Bourdieu 1998; Michel Foucault, 1971), which is the roots of CDA and used in
Ac Lits is not discussed in the French university contexts from where "littéracies
universitaires" emerges (as you showed in your paper with Cinthia Gannett, John
Brereton, Theresa Lillis and Mary Scott--see Donahue et al., 2009). Even if, in
France, Bourdieu is central in sociology, and Foucault in philosophy and literature,
the fields of didactics, linguistics and even sociolinguistics are not really influenced
by Foucault and Bourdieu ...

    However French university literacies does include attention to social context
and status, student success, etc.: Bourdieu and Passeron, for example (with their
extensive focus on social selection, social reproduction), are always on the horizon

232
                                                                                                      Reflections 3

of studies of university students' writing. As an effect of the disciplinary organiza-
tion of the French university, a current rule is not to trespass on others' research
domain. Thus, sociological studies are used as contributions to didactics inquiry
("disciplines contributoires," Reuter et al., 2013), not as main references. Yves Re-
uter does theorize the notion of "tension" as a distinctive feature of writing practic-
es--and this notion can be seen as not so far away from notions of resistance and
negotiation. However, tensions in writing are often presented as a way to under-
stand students' difficulties and to help them to resolve these tensions, to modify
their attitude towards texts and academic writing. In my opinion, they are not
presented as an occasion to modify the academic world or conventions, or only in
a very "light touch" and individual way.

    There are shared interests between Ac Lits and Univ Lits in the attention given
to making visible the implicit expectations of university work, crystallized in a set
of rules; it is a complex adaptation for students moving into the postsecondary
world; students must "affiliate" with the world of the university, and secondary
education cannot prepare them--given the decoding they must do. Seeing it this
way means students are not "missing" something but are in a social negotiation.
Teachers' and students' representations aren't compatible.

    But there are differences between Univ Lits and Ac Lits: university literacies
currently focuses on the need to describe textual objects generally practiced in uni-
versity fields and studies; to identify their specificities (especially those with which
students have difficulty) to facilitate learning and appropriation; to deal with diffi-
culties often associated with new genres, new practices, and the distance between
students' written culture and university written culture.

Christiane: How might the plural "literacies" be important to both Ac Lits and
University Literacies?

Isabelle: It signifies the multiple social and cultural practices in play. It challenges
the idea that literacy is an individual (isolated) cognitive act, as Lea and Street not-
ed in 1998. It allows us to signal that literacy is always linked to social and cultural
practices of reading and writing in particular contexts (disciplines too).

Christiane: What questions do you have for the future of University Literacies and
of Academic Literacies?

Isabelle: Currently, the creation of the "ESPE" (Ecoles supérieures du professorat
et de l'éducation), which take the place of the former teacher-training institutions
inside the universities, is an opportunity for many university structures to think
about writing programmes, first for the teachers-to-be, and then, I hope, for all
the students .... There are also some universities that are thinking about writing
support programmes aimed at PhD students who are "moniteurs," as it was a tra-

                                                                                                    233

dition in the former CIES (Centres d'initiation à l'enseignement supérieur). These
"monitors" were, from 1989 to 2009, doctoral students who were paid to learn to
become university professors and received a particular training while they covered
the small-group work sessions of university courses. Currently doctoral candidates
do this work, but they are no longer trained in a consistent way: what individual
universities do depends on the political decisions made in each university.

    Will we see a didactics of university disciplines taking shape, as scholars like
Francis Grossmann and Yves Reuter have suggested in a 2012 issue of Pratiques? If
it does, it is likely that a deeper reflection on epistemological dimensions of uni-
versity writing practices will develop. In the same way that didactics of disciplines
in secondary school thought through their uses of writing and the specific issues
with writing (not just in French but in the sciences, history, mathematics), univer-
sity disciplines need to elucidate their uses of writing and their textual practices,
beyond the narrow level of linguistic micro-skills.

    As far as AcLits is concerned, we are very intrigued in France by the questions
it asks. The French context does not yet seem ready for some of these questions.
But the University Literacies aspects I've just mentioned seem in some ways quite
shared with AcLits: deeper reflection on epistemological dimensions of university
writing, for example, or deeper understanding of the fluid nature of genres that are
adopted and adapted by different university populations.

                  SECTION 3
    TRANSFORMING RESOURCES,
GENRES AND SEMIOTIC PRACTICES
INTRODUCTION TO SECTION 3

    This section of the book picks up the central concerns of the volume both in
providing exemplars of how the transformative approach is being instantiated in
practice and in foregrounding how Academic Literacies can engage generatively
with other theories which inform approaches to writing. It focuses in particular on
the "semiotic stuff" of writing for knowledge making with an emphasis on chang-
ing textual and semiotic practices in society more widely and the implications of
these for text creation and meaning making. Although the contributions in this
section range widely in terms of both approach and contexts, they all point to the
transformative possibilities in the work they describe. Whilst some focus upon the
theoretical underpinnings necessary for understanding emergent textual configura-
tions, challenging our taken-for-granted assumptions about what we value, others
provide detailed accounts and/or personal reflections of practice around support-
ing student writers. In three of the contributions the "digital" offers an organizing
frame with regard to the changing status of knowledge and the potential for engag-
ing in transformative practices for both readers and writers. All offer a window onto
everyday work that we hope will inspire readers to scrutinize and rethink some of
their/our own practices.

    Fiona English takes a close lens to the notion of genre, arguing that we need to
move on from identifying the features of genres and teaching these to students. Her
research indicates that our concern should be with what genres can actually do and
how they come to shape our thinking and our knowledge production. Her interest
is in how a transformative academic literacies perspective can underpin both class-
room activity and theory with respect to genre pedagogy. For English, genre is no
longer merely a pedagogic goal but becomes a pedagogic resource. Illustrating this
move, she offers examples of what she calls "regenring" and explains what happened
when her students reworked their essays using a range of different genres. This not
only made visible how genres work but impacted on student's disciplinary knowl-
edge, engagement and understanding. English's approach shows how an academic
literacies perspective can actively engage with other theoretical traditions to trans-
form how we might think about writing work. As she points out, genre work in
writing pedagogy is drawn from a range of theoretical traditions but there is a dan-
ger that when these become translated into practice the focus for students is on the
reproduction of genres and, therefore, of knowledge. In contrast, "regenring" draws
in the academic literacies frame, theoretically and methodologically, and helps stu-
dent to engage at the level of epistemology (thus revealing the transformative na-
ture of what she proposes), so that students can become producers of knowledge.

    Lynn Coleman also extends the theoretical lens in offering a further illustra-

                                                                                                    239

tion of how academic literacies can engage generatively with other traditions. She
does this through a detailed exploration of the semiotic practices that emerge when
sets of practices drawn from the contrasting contexts of industry and academia
are brought together in a graphic design course. Her interest is in broader struc-
turing processes and how texts come to be within the curriculum, arguing that
combining academic literacies research and Bernsteinian perspectives can help us
to understand how curricula, subjects and assessment practices are constructed. In
this respect she explores "scamping," a term used in graphic design which refers
to the process of making ideas visible through creating a drawing or sketch. She
highlights the literacy practices that support scamping and uses Bernstein's concept
of recontextualization to illuminate how these practices emerge from bringing to-
gether those from both professional and academic domains. She argues that we can
track the privileging of particular literacy practices as professional-based practices
intersect with and become transformed by academic-informed values and practices.

    The transformative possibilities of visual representation are at the heart of Fay
Stevens' chapter as she explores the value of collaborative journal writing in rela-
tion to issues of self and identity. Her concern is with the potential of collaborative
journals for both individual and collective transformation. She contrasts students'
expression of loss of identity and lack of creativity in their assessed academic writ-
ing with their experience of contributing to a collective journal and being able to
represent who they felt they were or wanted to be. Stevens provides examples of
the richness, diversity and combination of text type and image in this collaborative,
social and creative space. Although contrasting strongly with the academic writing
tasks with which they are more familiar, contributing to the journal appears to have
enabled the students to develop an awareness of self, both in relation to being at
university more generally and being a writer in a particular discipline. The entries
created by the students suggest that image is central to this process of transforma-
tion and meaning making. In addition, Stevens draws on a range of theoretical
perspectives--which broaden what we might traditionally see as those associated
with academic literacies--to develop her argument that the journal is a method of
inquiry rather than merely a space for writing.

    Claire Penketh and Tasleem Shakur's concern is with a collaborative blog as an
emergent textual practice. They outline how they used blogging in order to help
make visible both students' and tutors' reading and writing practices. The blog was
introduced on a course in human geography as a way of helping students to explore
their understanding of key texts and make connections between these and their
broader experiences. They did this by encouraging students to combine words with
"found" images in their postings to the blog. Although the authors acknowledge
that the reading of postmodern texts--a prerequisite for this course--was both
challenging and difficult for students, the blog provided a shared space where stu-
dents were able to explore what it meant to read and write differently in this context

using the combination of word and image. Penketh and Shakur believe that this
gave their students the freedom to read in unpredictable ways, rather than always
expecting the text they were reading to be transparent. The blog was not only po-
tentially transformative for students, in relation to their reading practices, but also
for the teachers as authors, who found themselves rethinking the role of writing in
enhancing reading, which, they suggest transformed their own practices.

    A transformative approach to meaning making is a key orientation to the work
of Gillian Lazar and Beverley Barnaby. They consider the meaning and value of
grammar outside of a prescriptive agenda and how working with grammar can re-
late to an academic literacies approach that scrutinizes the dominant values, norms
and institutional practices around academic writing. Working with both university
lecturers and students on the thorny issue of "poor grammar," they ask whether an
academic literacies perspective can usefully incorporate a specific focus on gram-
mar, when on the face of it this might signal a "study skills" approach. In tackling
this conundrum, they offer worked through examples of the activities they intro-
duced to students to help them reflect upon the relationship between choices of
grammatical forms with aspects of their own identity. The authors explore some of
the tensions that emerged between students' desire to "learn the rules" and the ex-
ploratory approach that they were asking students to engage with, which met with
some resistance. They also examine their experiences of working with academic
staff and moving away from surface level notions of grammar towards consider-
ations of meaning making. They conclude that the role of the writing specialist is
always to provide spaces for questioning and exploration in order to enable both
students and their teachers to recognize the power of genuinely transformative atti-
tudes towards grammar and its relationship to meaning making.

    Diane Rushton, Cathy Malone, and Andrew Middleton's interest is with the
integration of digital technologies into writing work with students. In attempting
to open up possibilities for transformation, they consider the relationship between
the spoken and the written word. In their chapter they report on the use of Digital
Posters, which they have found offer students a different kind of space for them to
experiment with their own academic voice. The authors argue that this contrasts
with what is possible when students are working on their own academic writing.
The screen capture technology they use relies on visual prompts from just one pow-
er point slide. Key to its success is that it requires students to respond verbally and
spontaneously and that creating their own Digital Posters helps them to engage in
their chosen topic in ways they are then able to take forward into their own aca-
demic writing.

    Helen Bowstead's call for transformation goes out to academic literacies re-
searchers and practitioners themselves, who, she believes, should be transgressing
and challenging normative texts in their own work if the field is going to have a
lasting impact on what we expect from our students. She develops this position

                                                                                                    241
Introduction to Section 3

through a personal account of reflection and her dissatisfaction with the way in
which, she argues, we attempt to impose one voice on our students, despite the
diversity of an international student body. Her interest is in working with personal
narrative and textual forms that embrace student heterogeneity, and in doing so
she brings some complementary theoretical perspectives to sit alongside the aca-
demic literacies literature. Bowstead examines and questions her own complicity
in imposing rules and norms around writing that the academy sanctions, which
she suggests serve to make invisible issues of personhood for her students who are
bringing rich experiences from outside the academy. She concludes that although
academic literacies has opened up spaces for the exploration of meaning making,
identity and power it is perhaps the case that those working in the field are not
doing enough to actually challenge the institutional practices which are implicit in
the kinds of texts they/we produce.

    In the final chapter of this section, Colleen McKenna raises important ques-
tions about the spaces the digital offers for the transformation of writing practices.
Through an expansion of Lea and Street's original framework, she demonstrates the
dialogic and oppositional potential of some forms of digital academic writing. Her
interest here is in the possibilities that online writing offers to be transformative for
readers and writers, academics and students. Drawing on examples of digital texts
from both these groups, she introduces the term "intertext" in order to capture
the ways in which online texts are much more than a translation from one text
type to another. She argues that digital intertexts always bring dimensions that are
highly significant in the processes of meaning making and can disrupt the ways in
which we build academic arguments and subvert the taken for granted conventions
of academic writing. Although design always has rhetorical requirements that are
central to meaning, McKenna illustrates how digital academic texts are offering
new possibilities for reader-writer relationships, text production and distribution.
Her contribution reminds us of the dominance and power of historical academic
writing practices but at the same time also points to the slow uptake in valuing
digital textual forms. The latter, she argues, have a transformative potential both in
disrupting institutional regulation and offer different ways and opportunities for
building scholarly identities.

    This section closes with a conversation between Bruce Horner and Theresa Lillis
who seek to understand each other's positions on the link between "difference" and
transformation in the academy. At the centre of their conversation is the question
of what is understood by "difference" and in particular what difference looks like
in semiotic or textual terms. Horner cautions against valuing "different" textual
forms (for example the mixing or meshing of languages) as necessarily indicating a
challenging of dominant conventions, or of assuming that texts which use semiotic
practices that differ from conventional academic writing necessarily signal greater
authorial agency than texts which seem to simply enact dominant conventions.

Lillis agrees that there is a danger of reifying or fetishizing any specific semiotic
form but also argues that there is an urgent need for the academy to recognize and
value a greater range of linguistic and semiotic forms and practices than is currently
the case within dominant assessment regimes. Horner argues that a way out of
any potential impasse is to adopt what he calls a "spatiotemporal framework" and,
drawing in particular on the work of Lu (e.g., 1994), emphasizes that a pedagogic
goal must always be to explore with student writers the significance of their choices,
whether these be, as Horner states "to iterate conventional discursive forms" or to
make "ostensible breaks" with these forms.

GENRE AS A PEDAGOGICAL
RESOURCE AT UNIVERSITY

      Fiona English

        In this chapter I want to consider genre as a dynamic and transformative
        resource in the learning and teaching portfolio. I argue that conventional
        approaches to genre tend to be both limited and limiting with their emphasis
        on what genres look like and what they are for and argue instead that it is
        more helpful to explore what genres actually do, how they shape our thinking
        and the knowledge we produce. Using examples taken from a larger study
        (Fiona English, 2011), the discussion shows how such an approach can en-
        able students to develop not only a meaningful genre awareness but also a
        deeper understanding of their disciplinary knowledge.

GENRE AND ACADEMIC LITERACIES

    Genre has been an important category in writing pedagogy for many years but
has taken different forms depending on different theoretical frames of reference. In
the United States it has been firmly based within the long standing rhetoric and
composition tradition whereas in the United Kingdom, for example, it has been
more linguistically oriented following Michael Halliday and Ruqaiya Hasan (e.g.,
1989) whereby genres are seen as social processes that enable us to shape texts in
particular ways to achieve particular goals (e.g., Jim Martin, 1993). This approach
with its strong focus on the features, or elements, (grammatical structures, lexical
configurations and organizational strategies) that typify a given genre has been very
influential in the teaching of writing at school (e.g., Tom Gorman et al., 1990) and
at university (e.g., Ken Hyland, 2007).

    However, with the increasing drive for quick "solutions" to the "problem" of
student writing in the climate of a "skills" over knowledge (Ron Barnett, 2009),
emphasis has been placed on a "how to" approach and much genre-based writing
pedagogy has come to concentrate on producing genres rather than on producing
knowledge. A genre becomes simplified into little more than a template (a report,
an essay etc.) and so long as the "elements" are in place, an appropriate a successful
text, it is supposed, will emerge. As Gunther Kress (1994) warns, "Effective teach-
ing of genres can make the individual into an efficiently intuitive, and unreflecting,

DOI: https://doi.org/10.37514/PER-B.2015.0674.2.17                                    245
English

user of the genre .... The genre will construct the world for its proficient user. Is
that what we want?" (p. 126).

    This divorce between content and form ignores the reality of the writing ex-
perience and the many different kinds of work involved and writing comes to
be viewed as technique, a means of displaying knowledge. It is here that an aca-
demic literacies perspective can intervene by offering a critique to such thinking,
foregrounding writing as knowledge making instead of transmission (e.g., Theresa
Lillis, 2003) and in so doing, offer a thicker description of what it means to write
at university or school both in the context of research and pedagogy (e.g. Mary
Lea, 2004).

DOING ACADEMIC LITERACIES

    The work I discuss here presents an example of how academic literacies can
work in both pedagogy, in underpinning classroom activity, and theory, in encour-
aging new thinking about taken-for-granted literacy practices such as genre. It also
confirms that academic literacies, far from being a methodology, as it is sometimes
taken to be, is more an epistemology, a way of thinking about literacy as negotiated
and contested practices (Lea & Brian Street, 1998) within the specific and complex
communicative landscape (English, 2011) of the educational institution.

    The example I use emerged from a credit-bearing first year module option that
I developed whilst working as an academic literacies practitioner at a specialist uni-
versity in London. The module was institutionally understood as "study skills" but
as I had been given free rein over the content, I was able to develop a programme
around practices rather than skills, oriented towards learning at the level of analysis
and critique so as to encourage students to reflect their own textual interactions.
Genre was obviously a key topic, but rather than adopting the kind of model-
ling approach that typifies study skills courses, we problematized such fixed-form
concepts and explored instead how genres developed out of specific practices and
why. Following on from this, the final assignment involved students reworking an
essay that they had already submitted for their major studies (e.g., politics, social
anthropology, linguistics, economics) using any genre they liked, a process I now
call "regenring." I asked them to also submit the original essay alongside the new
version as a point of reference for me.

    The students chose to rework their essays using a range of different genres
including journalistic (a tabloidesque report on a time travellers conference on
political systems), pedagogic (an "information" booklet for 11 year-olds on the
use of loan words), and, most popularly, dramatic (e.g., a simulated radio debate
and phone-in with Freidman and Keynes; a play in eight scenes enacting an eth-
nographic study of the "built environment"). What the students produced far

246
                                                               Genre as a Pedagogical Resource at University

exceeded any expectations I had, not just in terms of the quality of the writing
and the evidence of their genre awareness, but, more importantly, on the impact
that this work had had on their disciplinary understanding and engagement. They
were more "alive" than the essays and the students seemed to have enjoyed writing
them, something that was commented on in interview:

         It wasn't so much having to reproduce facts and saying the right
         thing to get the marks, it was more of an exercise in doing it the
         way you wanted to. (Peter)

    Whatever the genre used, it quickly became clear that there had been a pro-
found shift, not only in terms of what I might once have thought of as generic
"shape" but in the materiality of the work itself. Regenring involved far more than
simply relocating material from one "frame" into another. It had had a profound
impact on the students' knowledge and understanding as well as on their own
sense of involvement. As Dan, one of the group pointed out, commenting on his
play:

         And I felt that by using the characters ... I found myself free or
         freer to express my opinions or my ideas of my feelings toward
         the subject in a way that the purely conventional way of writing
         didn't or wouldn't allow me. (Dan)

CASE STUDY

    For the purposes of showing the effects of regenring, I have chosen to discuss
"Sonia's" work. She was taking a degree in African Studies and had completed the
first term of the course but was already disaffected with her studies. She comment-
ed on this when talking about her reasons for choosing the regenring assignment.

         Since I've started university I've felt myself struggling with the
         academic work and yearning to do something creative. This
         assignment seemed like a good opportunity. (Sonia)

    The following extracts come from different parts of an essay written in response
to the following instruction, Give an account of the origin and present day function of
one African lingua franca, and reflect the tone of the whole essay.

Extract One

 [-1-] The word "Swahili" is Arabic in origin and means coast. Swahili is spoken on the East coast
       of Africa by many as a first language and has spread into the interior as far as the Congo as
       a lingua franca. Though Swahili uses words adopted from Arabic, English and Portuguese, it
       has the definite structure of a Bantu language and is written in the Latin script.

                                                                                                    247
English

 [-2-] Swahili is presumed to have started its life in the region of the Tana River estuary and to
       have spread further when Arabs and Persians settled in the area due to trading, thus spread-
       ing the language along their trading roots. In 975 Ali Ben Sultan al Hassan Ben Ali bought
       the island of Kilwa in exchange for a few bales of textiles and it became an important trad-
       ing centre encouraging the use of Swahili along the coast south of the Zambezi River.

 [-3-] There are a very large number of Swahili dialects that have derived from specific social
       situations, some of which are dying out because of a change in social circumstances. Due to
       the function of some of these dialects, such as the mode of common communication in the
       army and work force the dialect has undergone considerable simplification and lost much of
       its structure until it can only be called a pidgin.

    The first thing that strikes us about these extracts is that Sonia has adopted a
literal approach to the task. The extracts typify the whole essay in their encyclo-
paedic exposition of the topic and the assertiveness with which the information
is presented seems at odds with the "struggle" that Sonia refers to above. There is
a textbook type quality about the discourse which, as Bruno Latour and Steven
Woolgar (1986) point out in their discussion of "statement" types (pp. 75-88),
tends to present information as uncontroversial fact, using unhedged assertions in
contrast to "authentic" professional disciplinary debates and arguments. In Sonia's
essay there is no commentary on the information presented, nor is any indication
given of its sources apart from the list of four references at the end. In fact, although
it is obvious that Sonia has been able to identify relevant information and use
certain linguistic terms of reference it is not clear whether she has understood the
relevant body of knowledge or whether she has simply located it.

    In contrast to the essay, the regenred work offers a very different take on the
topic. Her alternative title, Culturally Confused, indicates a different kind of under-
standing of the topic compared to the original essay. It problematizes the idea of a
"lingua franca" by locating it in the context of culture and identity. The new version
is produced as a dramatised scenario of a father telling a bedtime "story" to his two
children aged eight or nine and in the process becomes grounded in a "real world"
context. Extract Two is a good illustration of this.

    The demands of the genre, characterisation and setting and the to-ing and fro-
ing of dialogue between the children and the parent, force Sonia to shape the infor-
mation differently. The "facts" of the essay are now represented as dialogue which
means they are discussed rather than presented, argued over rather than accepted.
Despite the factual exaggeration regarding the number of languages spoken in Af-
rica, this version introduces new dimensions to the work, not least of which is a
"critical perspective," that most elusive, but desired, aspect of student academic per-
formance. Ultimately, in the new version, Sonia has laid claim to the disciplinary
material and instead of merely displaying a series of "facts," as in her essay, she
provides a view on the topic.

    A further aspect of Sonia's regenred work is the provision of detailed supplemen-

248
                                                               Genre as a Pedagogical Resource at University

tary notes. These include contextual notes, which explain why she designed the new
version as she did, and stage management notes, which explain the physical and
interpersonal contexts of the play. In this way Sonia uses both the physical envi-
ronment, as discussed in Carey Jewitt (2005), and the interpersonal histories of the
participants as semiotic resources. The contextual notes demonstrate the strength of
agency that Sonia has in relation to the new work and the confidence with which
she can creatively combine "imagination as well as the intellect," something she feels
unable to do in conventional academic work. Extract Three is an example of this.

Extract Two

 Parent:
 At this point seated in the armchair addressing the children.
 "Can you remember what our bedtime story was about yesterday?"

 Child 1:
 "Yesssssssssss! It was about ...
 [six more exchanges]

 Parent:
 "OK, anyway, today I thought I could tell you the story about how Swahili came to be such an
 important language in East Africa. People always talk about the importance of English as a world
 language but they rarely consider that there exist many other important non-European languag-
 es all over the world. People need to learn one of these important languages so they can talk to
 people who have different first languages to themselves."

 Child 1:
 "Umm ... Why would they be speaking to people with a different language?"

 Parent:
 "That's a good question you bright little spark! Now in the situation of Africa there are two hun-
 dred thousand different languages spoken. It's not like in England. In Africa if you go from one
 village to the next you are likely to find a different language ...."

Extract Three

 The set ... must be minimal and modern with two single beds and an armchair to the left. Perhaps
 the beds could have patchwork quilts on them and the wooden floor a Moroccan rug. A giant world
 map can be stuck to the walls behind the beds, with pins, scribbles and highlighter indicating places
 they have been, want to go, or various important and trivial facts the children have learnt. Some of the
 visible toys should serve an education function and not be associated with popular culture. It is clearly
 a conscientious household striving to create a corner of individuality and safety in a contrary, consumer
 world. ... Through the window should be a view of an intimidating grey city, harsh and cold against
 the bedroom warmth. The city serves as a contrast to the African world the parent talks about ....

    Such information has no place in an essay because essays orient away from "ev-
eryday" experienced knowledge towards academic "articulated knowledge" (Diana

Laurillard, 1993) problematized in Lea (1998). However, these stage management
notes do something that essays also do; that is they provide authorial guidance.
Successful essays do this by choosing specific textual materials such as discourse
links or expressions of modality that indicate how the reader is supposed to under-
stand the writer's intentions, as has been widely discussed (Maggi Charles, 2006,
English, 1999, Susan Hunston & Geoff Thompson, 2000). Writers of plays use
stage management instead and Sonia has made good use of this resource in assert-
ing this authorial control.

    There is a further dimension to Sonia's new version, that of reflection on be-
ing a student, something that is almost always invisible in conventional essays but
which other students using dramatic genres also found themselves doing. In the
present case, it is represented by the children themselves who both guide, through
questioning, and subvert, through challenge and distraction, the father's "story."
Their interventions are intended to shift the discussion away from what he wants
to talk about to what they want to talk about. As his contributions become longer
and longer there is a gradual shift from initial enthusiasm on the part of the chil-
dren towards a growing boredom which echoes, it is tempting to say, Sonia's own
experiences at the time.

Extract Four

 Parent:
 [after a lengthy phase of expounding on the topic of Swahili] "Sorry, I can see you're getting
 bored now--but I just want to tell you one more thing!"
 [he proceeds to tell it ...]

 Child 2:
 "If you lived in Africa people would put sellotape over your mouth or everyone would always be
 asleep!"

    The opportunity to give voice to such feelings would be considered out of place
in a student essay, but here it is made possible by the construction of the plot and
the characters who "perform" it. In fact, the humour of the child's remark in Ex-
tract Four reflects an attitude, not of despair but rather of exasperation, an attitude
confirmed by Sonia's eventual re-engagement with academia.

THE ORIENTATION OF GENRES--
A FRAMEWORK FOR ANALYSIS

    To understand what was going on with this work, I developed an analyt-
ic framework (see Figure 17.1) that could be sufficiently flexible yet theoretical-
ly robust enough to explain how genre choice affected both disciplinary content
and student experience which were the two key aspects that the students reported

                                                               Genre as a Pedagogical Resource at University

during interview. The concept of "orientation" allows for a focus on these elements
by separating them out into two main categories (the social and the material) and
then subdividing them into the more specific analytical categories: contextual ori-
entation, associated with the circumstances and purposes surrounding the produc-
tion, discursive orientation, associated with authorial identity and agency, thematic
orientation, concerning choice of topics and organization and semiotic orientation,
associated with choice of mode (e.g., writing, speaking, performance) and what I
call textual resources (e.g., grammatical structures, vocabulary, gestures).

                      Figure 17.1: The social orientations of genres.

    Working with Sonia's two versions, Tables 17.1 and 17.2 demonstrate how the
framework can be used to reveal the effects of the different genres. It is possible to
consider each category separately by reading across and down each table but it is
also possible to see how the two tables interact by considering how the material
resources that are used (thematic and semiotic) reflect and promote particular so-
cial effects (contextual and discursive). Because of the constraints of space, I can
only offer the tables as exemplification. A full explanation can be found in English
(2011).

    Table 17.1 focuses on the context in which Sonia produced her work and how
that context positioned her. Setting out the differences using the categories in this
way demonstrates more clearly the affordances of the different genres in relation to
the orientations established above.

    Table 17.2 summarizes key differences in the material orientation of the genres.
It considers how each version is organized, the themes they include and the modes
and textual materials they use in their production.

                                                                                                    251

    Taking both tables together it is possible to see how the social is reflected in
and promoted by the material (thematic and semiotic), and the material in turn,
reflects and promotes the social (contextual and discursive). Using the analytical
tool of orientation highlights, the ways in which genre choice affords different ways
of knowing, different ways representing and different ways of experiencing.

CONCLUSION
    In this discussion I have argued for a new direction in genre pedagogy using the

of how this approach to genre enables students to engage at the epistemological
level that academic literacies argues for, as has been well documented in Lea and
Street (1998), Carys Jones et al. (1999) and more recently in Lillis and Mary Scott
(2007). The analytical framework, which draws on social semiotics (e.g., Kress,
2010), serves to reveal the transformative nature of the regenring activity offering
insights not only into the nature of academic knowledge and the close association
between the genres used and the knowledge produced, akin to Basil Bernstein's
(2000) vertical and horizontal discourses, but also into the experiences of students
in their attempts to interact with the disciplines they have chosen. Working with
students in this way also encourages the critique that academic literacies thinking
promotes and provides the opportunity for students to position themselves as pro-
ducers of knowledge rather than as merely receivers.

    The discussion also raises questions about the genres that typify university ed-
ucation and the ways that they constrain how disciplines can be understood. I am
not arguing for the abandonment of essays, nor am I suggesting that they are a poor
way of helping students reflect on their disciplinary material. What I am suggesting
is that we incorporate a wider range of genres into the learning and teaching rep-
ertoire, even including tasks such as the regenring activity described here. In this
way it may be possible to encourage "new ways of looking at old questions," as one of
my lecturer informants put it when asked what they hoped to see in their students'
assignments. However, this will only be achieved if we develop new ways of asking
those questions and offering students new ways to explore them.

HOW DRAWING IS USED
TO CONCEPTUALIZE AND
COMMUNICATE DESIGN IDEAS
IN GRAPHIC DESIGN:
EXPLORING SCAMPING THROUGH
A LITERACY PRACTICE LENS

      Lynn Coleman

    Most students in higher education are typically required to demonstrate their
learning and thinking through the production of some form of written text, often
an essay. However, in course environments where knowledge forms and practic-
es are constituted visually or rely heavily on other semiotic resources for mean-
ing-making, this is frequently not the case. Students in such academic contexts
demonstrate their learning and give expression to their thinking in predominantly
non-written and visual ways. This chapter draws on an aspect of a larger research
study that used academic literacies as its theoretical and methodological frame-
work. The study explored the literacy practices of students completing courses in
visual art and media fields at a vocational higher education institution in South
Africa. In these courses, students demonstrate their learning primarily through the
production of visual, digital and print-based products such as film clips, posters,
logos, photography, and three-dimensional (3D) product-packaging.

    In this chapter I draw attention to students completing a graphic design (GD)
diploma course and how they use drawings as the primary way of communicating
their design ideas. Drawings that are used in this manner to visually articulate de-
sign ideas are called "scamps" and the process associated with creating such draw-
ings is called "scamping." Scamping is also a valued practice in the professional
context of GD where the designer is expected to translate information provided by
a client and visually capture their concepts with scamps. I explore the process of
scamping through a literacy practice lens but also subject this analysis to a further
reading centred on how assumptions about knowledge in the academic and pro-
fessional domains influence, guide and give value to the literacy practice itself. The

discussion illustrates that a consideration of knowledge recontextualization pro-
vides an explanation of how professional knowledge practices influence the literacy
practices privileged in the academic domain. The exploration of scamping in this
graphic design context provides a good example of the evolving semiotic practices
in higher education that result when different sets of practices drawn from industry
and academia are brought together. A further implication of this intersection of
practices is the creation of a pedagogic space where the lecturer is able to act as a
co-constructor in the creation of assignment texts alongside the student.

THEORETICAL FRAMING

    Academic literacies as a field of research has typically focused on writing in
higher education (HE) (Theresa Lillis & Mary Scott, 2007). However, a steady
shift in this focus has seen the field's theorization being brought to bear on "new
contexts" of vocational and professional studies (Mary Lea, 2012; Mary Lea &
Barry Stierer, 2000; Candice Satchwell & Roz Ivanic, 2007), and the increasingly
expansive range of communicative practices in the academy (Chris Abbott, 2002;
Arlene Archer, 2006; Lucia Thesen, 2006). South African researchers have also
explored the potential of visual communicative modes as an additional means
whereby students can demonstrate their learning (Archer, 2006; Thesen, 2001). In
recent research Mary Lea (2012) has argued that the nature of the texts students
are required to produce for assessment purposes in HE are increasingly coming
under the influence of a global shift from traditional discipline-based courses to
professional programmes. She also proposes that an academic literacies lens can
be generative for exploring the new assessment and learning spaces created as the
inherent tensions between "professional practice-based knowledge and a theorized
written assessment of that knowledge" jostle for position in HE (Lea, 2012, p. 94).
My work is located along this new trajectory and explores meaning making and
learning in vocational practice-based course environments where the construction
of written texts is less prominent. In my research the concept of literacy practice
is conceptualized in terms of epistemology (Lea, 1999, 2012). This understanding
allows me to highlight the productive connection between curriculum theorization
and the argument that literacy practices and knowledge in learning environments
are embedded in each other.

CONSIDERING KNOWLEDGE IN THE CURRICULUM

    Academic literacies has been valuable for exploring how students demonstrate
their learning through their production of written and non-written texts. As a field
of research however, it has been less helpful in providing the theoretical tools to
explore the broader structuring processes implicated, but not directly visible, in the

                                                      Exploring Scamping Through a Literacy Practice Lens

literacy practices that support the creation of assignment texts. Lea predicts that
"as academic, disciplinary and professional boundaries shift and blur" academic
literacies researchers will be required to focus not only on the "micro-practices" of
text production but also cast their inquiry to broader institutional practices, like
the curriculum, in order to fully understand the new learning spaces being created
in the academy (2012, p. 109). Such a framework is already an imperative with-
in vocational HE as the impact and influence of the professional domain cannot
be excluded from conceptualizing how curricula, subjects and assessment practic-
es are constructed. Simply focusing on the literacy practices used by students to
demonstrate their learning does not go far enough in explaining how such practices
become privileged or the role the professional domain plays in structuring such
practices. Basil Bernstein's (1996, 2000) notion of knowledge recontextualization
offers a way of attending to this theoretical gap. Using recontextualization as an
analytical lens provides a language of description for theorizing how profession-
al practices and knowledge become implicated in the literacy practices associated
with assignment production. Recontextualization describes the processes through
which knowledge produced outside the educational context (in the disciplines or
in the professional domains) becomes transformed, adapted and re-appropriated to
constitute content subjects and the curriculum. Bernstein argues that as knowledge
moves from its "original site to its new positioning, as pedagogic discourse, a trans-
formation takes place" (2000, p. 32). This transformation occurs because as knowl-
edge moves from one context to another, a space is created for ideology to play a
role (Bernstein, 2000). The important outcome of this process is that knowledge
associated with the curriculum, i.e., curriculum knowledge, is, therefore, different
from what might be called disciplinary or workplace knowledge (Johan Muller,
2008). In its broadest sense, the main outcome of this recontextualization pro-
cess is the curriculum (Suellen Shay, 2011). The curriculum is therefore influenced
by ideologically mediated choices of key curriculum role players like lecturers or
curriculum developers. The choices made by curriculum role players' about what
knowledge to include in curricula is therefore also influenced by their assumptions
about the purpose of education and their conceptualizations of learning and teach-
ing or ideal graduate attributes. According to Bernstein, educational knowledge is
de-contextualized or "abstracted from its social base, position and power relations"
as a result of recontextualization (2000, p. 38).

WHAT IS SCAMPING?

    Scamping is a term used in GD to refer to the process of making design ideas
visible by creating a drawing or sketch. Scamping relies strongly on what graphic
designers in education call hand skills, i.e., a suite of skills requiring the use of one's
hands to cut, mount and manipulate a variety of materials, the foremost of these

                                                                                                    259

being the ability to sketch and draw. Hand skills are often contrasted with the use
of technologies such as the computer or digital design tools when creating design
products. Scamps are characteristically small drawings or sketches produced with
pencils onto layout or photocopy paper. The materials used to produce scamps,
that are cheap and easily erasable, function to give the scamping process a rehearsal
quality, imbuing the scamps with a provisional or draft status. Multiple scamps are
typically produced to explore a single idea and these are commonly drawn along-
side each other. Unsuitable ideas are simply crossed out and newer iterations are
drawn alongside the discarded drawings, as shown in Figures 18.1 and 18.2.

           Figure 18.1: A series of scamps produced for a logo design project.
    Because scamps are produced with impermanent and relatively cheap materials,
the need to create a final, perfect design idea or concept is circumvented. Placing
multiple draft ideas together on the same sheet of paper suggests that they all share
the same status as potential "final" design concepts.
    In the course, scamps are distinguished, on one level, from finished or final draw-
ings on the basis of the "mark-making" materials used. Final drawings are commonly
presented separately, can be mounted and are completed using gouache, paint, or
copy markers on cartridge or bleed-proof paper; thus mark-making materials that are
expensive and difficult to alter. In addition to being distinguished by their material

qualities, scamps are also contrasted with other forms of drawing practiced in the
course, specifically perceptual or naturalistic drawing associated with Fine Art:

         I'm saying it's drawing but it's different drawing ... there's per-
         ceptual drawing which might be more what the Drawing subject
         does ... scamping is drawing for design.

  Figure 18.2: Scamps showing how a student experimented with a logo design idea.
    In the interview extract above, Tessa, a course lecturer, alludes to the notion that

the curriculum conceptualizes the act of drawing in different ways. The subject
called Drawing, places focus on naturalistic and perceptual drawing commonly
associated with the Fine Art discipline. The subject privileges personal expression
using various observational and rendering techniques to create realistic images of,
e.g., a landscape. When Tessa says "scamping is drawing for design" she is associat-
ing it with the activities of a designer who is more concerned with creating a visual
message that meets a very specific purpose. Examples of this can be seen in images
above of the logo scamps students produced for a Cape Town based organization.
The scamps attempt to represent visually what such a logo might look like and
show how the students experiment with image, text, typography, layout, composi-
tion and placement of their logo concept. In the course, lecturers talk about scamp-
ing as an image generating tool where one's conceptualization and thinking about
a design product is visually expressed. This understanding is captured later by Tessa
when she says "Scamping is really conceptual drawing"; suggesting that the prima-
ry semiotic purpose of scamping is the visualisation of conceptual ideas and the

                                                                                                    261

main way in which a creative or design concept becomes translated into a concrete
and visual form.

SCAMPING AND ASSIGNMENT PRODUCTION

    Scamping cannot be fully understood without relating it to the way assignments
are completed in this course. Scamping is integral to the "Design Process"--a cur-
riculum constructed procedure that guides and sequences the different tasks and
activities students are required to undertake when completing a design-based as-
signment. A description of how assignments are meant to be produced is provided
by this sequential six-stage process. Each stage is named and a description of the
function the stage serves in the overall assignment construction process is provided.
Scamping takes place at stage three of the process where students "put pencil to pa-
per" and visually give meaning to their conceptual ideas. The design process is often
directly incorporated into assignment briefs, with this practice especially evident at
the 1st and 2nd year levels.

    The design process aims to guide student assignment practices; however, it also
provides direction for the role that lecturers are required to play as students con-
struct their assignments. For example, the process explicitly requires students to
"Show the lecturer what you are doing" and "Consult with [your] lecturer." Lectur-
ers also need to "Sign off" or approve concepts before students are allowed to move
onto the next stage of assignment construction. The process suggests that lecturers
are continually involved in activities building up to the construction of the final
assignment text. Additionally, periodic opportunities for lecturer-student interac-
tion in the act of such text design and construction are also created. Helen, another
lecturer in the course, highlights how this role is pedagogically constructed when
she describes what happens when students show her their scamps.

         I look at the scamps ... and the student might say right these
         are the ones that I've come up with and then I'll say okay, "This
         looks promising or that doesn't because that's been re-done so
         many times" .... So I will give them guides saying this is a good
         potential option, this one not so much or that one, it's too,
         futuristic or it's too this or it's too that. So I will give them guid-
         ance. They'll be showing me their ideas on paper ... and then I'll
         say fine if you like it then maybe take that one further or show
         me more variations.

    The lecturer's primary role is to comment on the quality of the work, and in
the lower levels of the course this might involve approving or rejecting scamps. As
Helen's description suggests, lecturers might propose alternative approaches and
encourage students to be more exploratory and creative with a concept. These feed-

262

back moments provide opportunities for lecturers to offer guidance on how to
overcome design related problems, while also checking that students are sticking to,
or meeting, the requirements of the brief. In the course context, scamping and the
production of assignments more generally also includes a prominent collaborative
aspect. The lecturer is involved in providing continual feedback throughout the
production of the assignment text, even though the creation of the text is under-
taken primarily by the individual student.

SCAMPING IN THE PROFESSIONAL DOMAIN

    In the discussion above I have shown that scamping is a fundamental semiotic
practice that allows students to express and communicate their creative ideas and
conceptualization through drawing. I have also suggested that the act of scamping
is underpinned by conventions and rules, embedded and regulated by the curric-
ulum and pedagogic practices that prescribe the material qualities of scamps and
the function of scamping during assignment construction. These literacy practices
support scamping as the key means of communicating design conceptualization.
Scamping is, however, a practice rooted in the professional context. In the follow-
ing extract, Helen explains how scamping is a fundamental aspect of the profes-
sional designer's practice.

         ... as a designer you should be able to internalize what your cli-
         ent is giving you and be able to translate that information onto
         paper into a visual that the client can see .... So we're teaching
         them that, once they've got the research or once they've got their
         information they should be able to start translating that onto
         paper or into some sort of visual format for your client to see ....

    Helen describes how, in industry, scamping as a practice is associated with translat-
ing "information into paper on to a visual that the client can see," suggesting that the
designer is expected to visually represent their conceptualization of information provid-
ed by the client through scamps. She also recognizes that industry-referenced practices
shift and change when incorporated into the academic domain. Helen's reference to
"research," that is the first stage of the design process, signals that in the absence of a
real client the creation of design products in the course has a different initiation point.

USING RECONTEXTUALIZATION TO UNDERSTAND
SCAMPING

    In this section I illustrate how subjecting the data on scamping to a further
reading using recontextualization as an analytical lens helps to illuminate how the

                                                                                                    263
Coleman

literacy practices that support scamping in this context are created through the
bringing together of valued practices from both the professional and academic do-
mains. The act of designing a logo in the professional context is largely dependent
on several variables including the client, the designer(s), the purpose that the logo is
meant to serve, the development timeframe and the budget. This means that in in-
dustry the design process of this logo can be a dynamic, quick and flexible process.
However, when this process is recontextualized into the GD course it becomes the
"design process"--a sequence of six steps usually carried out over six to ten days,
in a classroom and/or computer lab environment where the pace, sequencing of
selected tasks and the evaluation of such tasks are carefully constructed to adhere
to the educational values and principles espoused by the course and its lecturers.
In the process of creating the design process in the GD academic context, a trans-
lation occurs of what it means to undertake design work in industry. Typically, in
industry, the design of any product is initiated by the client. The designer is tasked
with interpreting the client's needs and as a first step visually representing their con-
ceptualization with hand drawn scamps. Based on the data collected, the process of
interpreting the client's needs happens quickly. The ability to draw scamps is prized
as it allows the designer to visually express initial conceptualizations at the point of
interaction with the client.

    In the academic context, the design process, while attempting to capture and
simulate professional design practices, is also a construction tailor-made to ac-
commodate the contextual and educational demands and realities of the academic
setting. Thus, the purpose of the design process, particularly as it is manifested in
assignment briefs, is not simply to provide students with practical direction, for
example, on how to construct a logo. It is also fundamentally about facilitating
students' learning of a variety of conceptual principles about color theory, layout,
and composition that are associated with various sub-disciplinary areas aligned
to GD. The briefs therefore direct attention not only to the sequence and pace at
which tasks need to be completed, often much slower than typically expected in
industry, but they also include lecturer-facilitated explorations of conceptual and
procedural knowledge to support the design work being completed.

    In the academic context, stronger focus is placed on student learning and in this
respect the design process foregrounds the lecturer's role in facilitating this learning.
A simple reading of the assignment practices might suggest that the lecturer simply
"stands in" for the client. However, the lecturer's role is deeply imbued with an edu-
cational function that accounts for a fundamental shift in how the design process is
recontextualized in the academic context. The lecturer's feedback, that is structured
to be continual and supportive, means that in certain instances there is a degree of
co-construction of the assignment text as the lecturer helps the student refine and
polish their ideas, and focus their efforts on meeting the requirements of the brief.
The process of scamping and assignment construction, while mainly individual,

264
                                                      Exploring Scamping Through a Literacy Practice Lens

always takes place in a communal, public and collaborative manner, and the draft
quality of the produced text is as highly prized as the final assignment. This is in
stark contrast to the construction of essays in HE, that is a highly individualistic
and private activity that rarely accommodates the creation of draft or multiple ver-
sions of the same text for review. A conclusion could therefore be drawn that only
the final essay product, rather than the process of its construction, is subjected to
evaluation and the lecturer's role is primarily centred on the evaluation of the final
text.

CONCLUDING COMMENTS

    The purpose of this chapter has been twofold. Firstly, using a literacy practice
lens it describes how students in a GD course use scamping as a way to visually ex-
press and communicate their design ideas and conceptualization. Secondly, I have
presented an argument that illustrates the value of bringing a recontextualization
analysis to the study of literacy practices. Using recontextualization as an analytical
lens, I show how practices valued in the professional domain can come to inform
the type of literacy practices students are required to use when completing assign-
ments in their course. Furthermore, by paying attention to ideological process asso-
ciated with choices about knowledge, recontextualization as an analytic lens offers
a more nuanced understanding of how professional-based practices intersect with,
and become transformed by, the academic-informed values and practices. In this
way this provides insight into processes that give rise to privileged literacy practices.
In the GD context, the literacy practices associated with scamping are forged as a
result of the intersection between academia and industry, foregrounding the visual
but also making provision for lecturers as co-constructors in the creation of visual
assignments. Discussing scamping in GD through a literacy practice lens draws
attention to the ways in which learning and thinking in HE are being continually
mediated by an evolving range of semiotic resources.

"THERE IS A CAGE INSIDE MY
HEAD AND I CANNOT LET THINGS
OUT": AN EPISTEMOLOGY OF
COLLABORATIVE JOURNAL WRITING

      Fay Stevens

    This chapter presents the outcomes of a journal project initially set-up in con-
junction with cross-disciplinary courses in Academic Literacies (Writing in Aca-
demic Contexts, Writing Science), taught at The Centre for the Advancement of
Learning and Teaching (CALT), from 2008 to 2011, as part of a Teaching Fel-
lowship I held at that time. The project sets out to encourage journal writing and
image making, consider issues of collaborative writing, social practice and identity
and promote the transformative role collaborative journal writing can play within
varying academic contexts.

    In 2008, I encountered "The 1000 Journals Project," based around the global
circulation of 1,000 journals: contributed to by those who encounter a journal (in
a café, for example) and left for another person to stumble across. I was intrigued
with the idea of the journal as mobile, independent, and as a particular kind of
space for writing with its own emergent identity. I adapted the concept and intro-
duced a collaborative journal into the academic literacies courses I was teaching.
This project (The Journal Project), aimed to engage with the practice of contrib-
uting to a journal as a collaborative, interactive, academic, and transformative way
of thinking and writing. It is a multi-authored method of communication and
expression that can be shared within the community of writers participating in a
writing-based course. A journal was circulated on a weekly basis and participants
were invited to actively engage with the process of writing and image making in
whatever way they felt pertinent to their writing, studies and life at university. The
journal was presented as a medium through which students could further explore
themes covered in the courses, in a space independent of written assessment. Par-
ticipants were encouraged to be as creative, experimental, formal, academic, and
exploratory as they wished. The outcomes are a collection of seven journals rich in
discourse, imagery and ideas that encompass a wide-range of topics and issues cen-
tral to an Academic Literacies approach to teaching, learning and writing.

    I focus on the following themes: the journal as collaborative endeavour, putting
"self " into the journal, image making and emergent textual practices. Theoretically, I
concentrate on the journal as a method of inquiry via discussion on issues of identity
and construction of "self." I argue that the journals have potential for transforma-
tion, both individually and collectively, within a group of course participants.

THE JOURNAL AS COLLABORATIVE ENDEAVOUR

    Journals are often considered to function as particular spaces for writing (e.g.,
Phyllis Creme, 2008). Here, writing can be seen as an activity that always occurs in
a social context, at both a more local, immediate level and at a broader social and
cultural level. As such, there are different ways in which writing can be understood as
a "social practice" (e.g. Roz Ivanic, 1998; Theresa Lillis, 2001). This might include,
writing within specific academic and disciplinary communities (e.g. Elizabeth Som-
merville & Phyllis Creme, 2005; Fay Stevens, 2009), as well as expressing personal
and social identities. Yet, during class discussions, students expressed a loss of identity
during the course of their studies and targeted academic writing as responsible for it.
This loss was expressed as a stripping away of creativity and being made to write in a
way that felt abstracted and not representative of who they "really are," or want to be.

    All seven journals contrast in terms of coverage and content. It is interesting to
see how the first journal entry shaped the focus and intention of following entries
and how the journals took on an identity of their own. One journal, for example,
set the scene with an opening that focused on gratitude. Following entries respond-
ed to this and as a consequence the journal has spiritual and therapeutic overtones.
In contrast, another journal focused on the complex and composite identity of be-
ing a human scientist. Entries here, focused on the complex nature of the discipline
and a writers' struggling sense of identity within it.

    Collaboratively, all journals, in some way, focused on an individual/collective
and writerly identity and the processes of transformation taking place. More often
than not, this is expressed visually and textually as a process of struggle and nego-
tiation. In general, journals engaged with fluidity, creativity, playfulness, and col-
lectivity, particularly as a series of responses to previous entries. In many respects,
the journals evolved into collaborative safe spaces in which participants developed
a spirit of inquiry, knowledge and wisdom that was directly representative of the
individual but written in collaboration with others.

PUTTING "SELF" INTO THE JOURNAL

    Identity is a modern conceptual construct used in the social and behavioural
sciences to refer to people's sense of themselves as distinct individuals in the context
of community. At a basic level, identity could be said to refer to people's socially de-

268
                                         "There Is a Cage Inside My Head and I Cannot Let Things Out"

termined sense of who they are--a kind of social statement of who one is, referring
to a sense of "self " (aspects of the individual) that draws upon trends (representative
of the collective), so as to present oneself simultaneously as part of a whole and as
unique (Antonio Damasio, 2000). From a corporeal perspective, writing can been
seen as a technique of the body (Marcel Mauss, 1973), a kind of dexterous, woven
movement (Tim Ingold, 2000, p.403) and a sort of fiction created by language and
all that we think of as being language (Jacques Derrida, 1967).

    Corporeal imagery features notably in the journals:
    This includes an image of a hand in the process of writing "words" (Figure
19.1A), where the entry states that "writing can be exciting ... frustrating ... ex-
plorative ... reassuring," while another image is of a figure writing in café (Figure
19.1B). The visual placing of the writer within the space of the journal includes
an entry in which a collage figure bears a striking resemblance to the student who
made the entry (Figure 19.1C) and an image of a person looking through a tele-
scope (Figure 19.1D) and peering into the distance. Accompanying text states:

         I like the idea of some kind of space for ideas, maybe we should
         allow a space like that for ourselves.
    "Self," in some instances, is visually present in other forms. In one example
(Figure 19.2), the participant (human scientist) represents herself as a sequence of
pie charts. Initially, her writing is expressed as two separate circles; what she refers
to as "purely separate spheres of writing," where one chart represents "essay criteria
academic assessed uni work" and the other "for me subjective personal journal dia-
ry." The following chart fuses the circles together. Here, she asks "do they overlap?",
placing her "self " in the middle: a combination of the two spheres of writing. Fi-
nally, she states that "my writing is all part of the same thing, with different aspects
that blend together," with an accompanying circle in which she places "myself as
the writer" in the centre.

        Figure 19.2: Visually working through putting "self " back into writing
    Through the interplay of text and image, these particular journal entries explore
the possibilities of connecting to and representing a "true" or "real" self, that has

somehow become elusive to the writer. Participants demonstrate an awareness that
their academic writing is not just about conveying an ideational content. It is also
about the representation of "self " (e.g., Celia Hunt & Fiona Sampson, 2007; Ken
Hyland, 2002) and expressing a sense of "self " (Peter Ashworth, 2004, p. 156; Phyl-
lis Creme & Celia Hunt, 2008; Kristján Kristjànsson, 2008; Mary Lea & Brian
Street, 1998). Moreover, that it is a social act that involves sharing work with peers
(e.g. Maria Antoniou & Jessica Moriarty, 2008), as well as a set of processes which
may contribute dynamically to knowledge making (cf. Graham Badley, 2009).
IMAGE MAKING

    The concept of text comprises an infusion of words and pictures (e.g., Mike
Sharples, 1999, p. 130) and an interweaving of text and graphic elements (cf. In-
gold, 2007, p. 70). Writing, image and colour are said to lend themselves to do-
ing different kinds of semiotic work, where each has its own distinct potential for
meaning (Gunther Kress, 2010). We could even ask, "where does drawing end and
writing begin?" (Ingold, 2007, p. 120-151).

                     Figures 19.3A and 19.3B: "Mapping identity."
    The interface of image and text is executed in a variety of ways in the journals: text
written around images (Figures 19.1C, 19.1D, 19.5A), as well as images around and
integrated with text (Figures, 19.3A, 19.3B, 19.5C). Moreover, varieties of maps de-

                                                                                                    271

pict and describe spatial and conceptual journeys and places (Figure 19.3 [A-D]).
Maps can function as a form of gesture (Barbara Belyea, 1996, p.11) or "self " (Rebec-
ca Solnit, 2001) on the page, often with the purpose of providing directions so that
others can follow along the same path (Alfred Gell, 1985; Ingold, 2000, p. 241).

    A map of the world (Figure 19.3C), composed of text and a collage of cut out
pieces of plastic bag (with varying designs and colours), includes the statement:

         Will this eventually lead to global citizenship, which is still an ab-
         stract idea, or even a global identity, or will nationalism and tradition
         come out on top. It is with that question that I will leave you, be-
         cause no matter how much I speculate, the fact is; only time will tell.

                     Figures 19.3C and 19.3D: "Mapping identity.

    Here, the participant is mapping out a concept, communicating directly to the
reader as a visual and textual process that facilitates their own understanding of the
topic, as well as an awareness of their thoughts and opinions on it; being both the
writer and reader (writing to "self ") of the entry.

    A "Dissertation Map" (Figure 19.3D), is reminiscent of a pirate map that al-
ludes to the dissertation as some kind of treacherous journey to get to "hidden
treasure." References to London, include a tube-stop memoir (Figure 19.3A) that
reveals an engagement with the collaborative free-sprit of the journal, stating the
information might come in handy if the journal were ever lost and the finder "felt
like roaming around London." Moreover, a map of "Camden Town: Centre of the
Universe" (Figure 19.3B) presents a bricolage of information that includes social
history and memories of previous visits, with a statement that identifies the map as
"a play by play tour of social diversity."

    These cartographical visuals act as evocative mediums for communicating a va-
riety of information--corporeal, individual, composite, spatial and social--where
the reader is required to engage concurrently with text and image and engage with
the process of taking a journey as they "read" the map. Here, images can be seen to
be much more than an adjunct to writing: they do not restate the data or reduce
the need for prose, but offer a kind of separate or parallel "text" for reading and
interpretation (see also Gimenez and Thomas Chapter 1, Good Chapter 3, Adams
Chapter 4 this volume).

EMERGENT TEXTUAL PRACTICES

    The journals demonstrate that when the opportunity arises, the process of ex-
perimentation is fully engaged with. Moreover, that emergent textual practices lead
to a variety of methods and outcomes that engage with issues central to an academ-
ic literacies approach to writing.

    Michel de Certeau (1984) imagined the modern writer as the isolated Cartesian
subject, removed from the world and confronting the blank surface of a sheet of
paper in much the same way as an urban planner confronts a wasteland or a con-
queror confronts the surface of the earth (pp. 134-136). Being faced with the blank
surface of a page is often expressed as one of the most worrying encounters a writer
faces. Interestingly, a majority of entries in the journals subverted the linearity of
the A4 page and presented an interplay of text and image. Figure 19.4, for exam-
ple, is an entry of words and images that rotate around the page. Based around the
theme of "A Night of Wanderings," the entry explores the "ping" of ideas as they
pop into your head in the early hours of the morning and is playful in its approach
to space, imagery, colour and text. Here, the reader not only engages with the con-
tent and visual impact of the entry, but also the gesture of reading, that involves
moving the journal around in varying positions and shapes in order to read it and

                                                                                                    273

engage with the materiality of the journal in a three-dimensional way. As such, the
journal moves from being looked at/read to an object that has tactile multi-sensory
qualities.

    Thematic references to flying (Figures 19.5A, 19.5D) and containment (Figures
19.5B, 19.5C) are also present. The flying images are associated with text that tends
to have a positive and spiritual quality and associated with a sense of realization and
free-spiritedness. In direct contrast, images of containment seem to reflect con-
straint and frustration. In Figure 19.5C, containment is portrayed as a cage that sits
within the mind of a human figure. The cage contains comments such as, "I don't
want to be put into a category." "I am going to learn German." "Do I want to find
a uniform way of expressing myself?" These are expressions of intention somehow
constrained by the cage, but more specifically by the mind of the writer.
CONCLUSION

    A fascinating aspect of this project is the resulting richness of the journal entries,
with regard to the diversity of style of both text and images and the readiness of the
participants to experiment with the process. I am touched by their willingness to en-
gage with the journals and their candour when expressing their sense of self, identity
and relationship with the written word and the visual image. Framed in this way (as

collaborative, social, creative), the journals can be seen to be a powerful transforma-
tive tool for developing an awareness that identities are somehow being challenged
and shaped as an outcome of being at university, breaking the bonds of perception
of academic writing and how this is associated with their sense of "`self," both indi-
vidually and collectively. Moreover, in this case, the journals facilitated a semiotic

means of viewing self through the concept of being a writer in a particular discipline.
    Writers gain opportunities to refine their judgment and decision making as to

when and how they present information visually (cf. Robert Goldbort, 2006, p.
174-194) and these journals are associated with a "spirit of relaxation" associated
with growth (cf. Elise Hancock, 2003, p. 28) and learning that may be fostered
by providing participants with writing spaces that offer them freedom, but also
an opportunity to re-make themselves (e.g., Phyllis Creme, 2008, p. 62, cf. Maggi
Savin-Baden, 2008). Here, writing is a socially-situated set of meaning-making
practices (cf. Lesley Gourlay, 2009, p. 182). As such, journaling can become a
personal journey and tied in with a holistic vision of life (Clare Walker Leslie &
Charles Roth, 2000, p. 93-100). There is a strong sense of desire and anticipation
concerning a shift in a sense of "self " as a process of going to university and the
journals appear to have become containers for an epistemological medium of ex-
pression, associated with a collective sense of "belonging" at university (cf. Mark
Palmer, Paula O'Kane, & Martin Owens, 2009), an individual desire to not lose a
sense of "self " during the process and an awareness that processes of transformation
are taking place. As one participant articulates:

    Academic writing feels like something I've produced that is separate to me and
is passed on to the audience. In comparison journal entries feel more like an exten-
sion of me, and part of who I am.

BLOGGING TO CREATE MULTIMODAL
READING AND WRITING EXPERIENCES
IN POSTMODERN HUMAN
GEOGRAPHIES

      Claire Penketh and Tasleem Shakur

    In this chapter we outline the creation of a "blog" as an emergent textual prac-
tice, designed to promote reading and writing for human geography students in
their final year of undergraduate study. Aware that students on the "Postmodern
Human Geographies" module were frequently challenged by the complexity of
key readings, and, conscious that students appeared to read too little, we made
significant changes to our practices in order to shift student conceptions of the role
of reading and writing in this course. We introduced three strategies: a reduction
in the reading expectation via the use of focused reading lists; the introduction of
a blog where students were encouraged to respond by writing and contributing
images and/or video links; and participation in a field trip to a contemporary art
exhibition where the students, as readers, became observers of contemporary art
work. This chapter will focus on the development of the blog as a means of en-
couraging students to develop their understanding of key texts by creating pieces of
short writing and connecting these with found images. The creation of an explicit
focus on reading and writing practices in this module offers a starting point for us
to explore the transformative nature of the production of this collaborative online
text for tutors and students.

EXPLORING READING AND LEARNING

    There is a concern with encouraging students to "get their heads into their
books" (see also Good, Chapter 3 this volume). The clear relationship between
reading and writing practices is recognized in the development of academic litera-
cies approaches (Lisa Ganobcsik-Williams, 2006, p. 102). Reading in the academy
is acknowledged as a complex and creative process where the reader actively con-
tributes to the making of meaning (Saranne Weller, 2010). There is an acknowl-

edgement that attention should be paid to making the connections between read-
ing, writing and thinking explicit to our students (John Bean, Virginia Chappell &
Alice Gillam, 2011) and Bean (2011, p. 161) advises us that students "need to be
taught to read powerfully," moving beyond reading for meaning to an understand-
ing of how the text works. Such literacy based practices are recognized as forms of
social enterprise where "spoken and written texts--do not exist in isolation but are
bound up with what people do--practices in the material, social world" (Theresa
Lillis, 2001, p. 34). In order to promote students' understanding of how a text
works it therefore seems appropriate to encourage them to lift their heads occa-
sionally in order to connect what they read and write with their experiences in the
world. For us this has involved manufacturing a series of shifts between language,
image and experience by encouraging students to combine, words with found im-
ages in response to their key readings in the form of a blog.

    Before we go on to discuss the blog in more detail it is worth considering the
connections between reading, writing and learning and the blog as a strategy to
enhance our students' understanding. A central concern of this chapter is with the
combination of word and image via the blog. We will now, therefore, explore the
complexities of reading in the academy (Weller, 2010) by referring to two images;
Dusty Boots Line by Richard Long (1988) and City Drawings Series (London) by
Kathy Prendergast (1997).

    Dusty Boots Line (Long, 1988) can be found at http://www.richardlong.org/
Sculptures/2011sculpupgrades/dusty.html

    Long's image, a photograph of a straight line in the landscape, is a simple scuff
from A to B, from anywhere to nowhere. If we conceptualize reading as this "Dusty
Boots Line" it is a means of moving from one point to another, a simple and clear
line in an anonymous landscape. It would be a brief brisk walk, perhaps reading for
information, moving through the text in a predetermined way. This might repre-
sent a simplistic and instrumental view of reading "as a means to an end" discussed
by Weller (2010, p. 89) or "surface" reading (Roberts & Roberts, 2008).

    City Drawings Series [London] (Prendergast, 1997) can be found at http://www.
quodlibetica.com/wordpress/wp-content/files_flutter/1285879161CDLondon.jpg

    The simplicity of walking a clear and unobstructed line contrasts with Kathy
Prendergast's complex image, a hand-drawn map of a city with obliterated and
erased lines. Although aspects of this landscape may be familiar (the River Thames
in the London city map, for example) it is largely unclear and complicated. There
are recognizable elements to which we might be drawn but some obscured path-
ways and a lack of clarity reminiscent of some of the tutor conceptions of reading
identified by Weller (2010).

    We argue here that reading for transparent objectives and predictable outcomes
may not always be the most productive for promoting powerful reading and writing.
The module "Postmodern human geographies: Space, Technology, and Culture" en-

courages students to read and apply the work of key postmodern theorists (e.g.,
Michel Foucault, Jean Baudrillard, Jean-François Lyotard) to their understanding
of space, culture and technology. The material is acknowledged to be complex and
students are encouraged to understand the contested nature of the relationship be-
tween technology, power, and knowledge in contemporary culture via their reading.
Students acknowledged that attempting the reading for the course was problem-
atic and had disrupted their understanding of what it meant to read effectively. In
the initial sessions, students were introduced to readings from a key text, Michael
Dear and Steven Flusty (2002), in order to enable them to make connections be-
tween postmodern theory and human geographies. They were asked to explore what
they already knew about space, culture and technology and the relevance of this to
human geography. We discussed the uncertainties of the topic and many students
found the elusiveness of definitions of postmodernism disconcerting. One of our
students commented on their initial experience of reading one of the key texts:

         Lee: I hated it [reading], the first couple of weeks--a lot of it was
         my misconceptions. It wasn't like your straight line oh this is the
         book, by the time I read this book I'll be able to sit down and
         write an assignment, it wasn't like that ...

         A lot of it was very theoretical--on the whole the texts that you
         read for some of the modules it's black and white you know
         there's an end result there's an essay to write there's an assignment
         to do so I can read and I can copy and paste my way through.

    Here Lee identifies a different kind of expectation in relation to his undergradu-
ate reading, recognizing the differences in the type of material he was asked to read
and his previous experiences of reading and writing at university. In describing his
former experiences of writing he can track a clear and direct line between reading
and writing. He describes a certainty in working to an end result that can be clearly
defined. However, the reading expectation for "Postmodern Human Geographies"
demanded that students work with uncertainty. Although potentially disconcerting
for students, we recognize the possibilities of working with readings that might
promote this different type of learning experience.

    The work of Dennis Atkinson (2011) has been useful in exploring these ideas
about uncertainty in the processes of learning and this has helped us to think about
how we might encourage students to read and write with uncertainty. Drawing on
the work of French philosopher Pierre Bourdieu, Atkinson describes real learning
as an ontological shift involving the potential of a new state "that-which-is not-yet"
(2011, p. 14).

    Atkinson says:

         If we conceive of learning as a move into a new ontological

                                                                                                    281
Penketh and Shakur

         state, that is to say where learning opens up new possibilities,
         new ways of seeing things, new ways of making sense of what
         is presented to us in our different modes of existence, then this
         movement involves, "that which is not yet." Accepting such new
         states involves accepting new states of existence as learners. This
         idea would indicate a space of potential.

    "Dusty boots line" represents "that-which-is" or that which is predetermined
where the potential for real learning is closed down. Prendergast's map, in this
context, represents "that-which-is-not-yet" where uncertainties about the nature of
the text can offer "a space of potential." Uncertainty appears to offer potential for
"real" learning but this can also be problematic. In previous iterations of the mod-
ule there was an implicit expectation that students engage with complex reading
but little work with students on the ways that they might do this. There was also no
explicit reference made to the role that writing could play in enhancing students'
understanding of the course. There appeared to be a mismatch between a module
that embraced an engagement with complex reading yet offered no explicit teach-
ing of strategies to do this effectively. We will now explore the blog as a strategy that
offered an opportunity for students to open up a space for reading and writing in
order to explore these uncertainties.

THE BLOG

    The use of a blog, although new to us as a teaching and learning approach,
is not particularly new or novel but part of an increasing range of technological
approaches (Churchill, 2009; Will Richardson, 2006). The abbreviated "web-log"
offers the potential for connectivity and collaboration via "micro-publishing" (Jer-
emy Williams & Joanne Jacobs, 2004) with the ability to share ideas and poten-
tially reach a wide audience. This use of technology has strong associations with
democracy and accessibility but this is off-set against concerns regarding a flood of
low-level trivia. For us, the blog was an accessible platform where students could
share their experiences of key texts via short pieces of exploratory writing. We con-
sidered these opportunities to write as particularly important since the module was
assessed via spoken contributions to seminars and a final oral presentation. We were
concerned that there were no formal opportunities for students to develop their
thinking via writing about the texts and the blog provided a significant platform
for the students to engage with "thinking-writing" (Sally Mitchell et al., 2006).
The blog was created as an interpretative space where students could work with
uncertainty via "low stakes" exploratory writing (Peter Elbow, 2001). We opted for
a "closed blog" only accessible to our group of students and tutors to support this
comparatively risk free approach.

282

    Importantly, the blog emphasized visual as well as written contributions, and as
tutors we aimed to encourage students to bring something to their emerging un-
derstanding of the text. We wanted to use the blog to support the students' under-
standing by their development of text/image combinations. For example, students
were asked to consider the seemingly impossible task of defining postmodernism
(Figures 20.1 & 20.2). They were able to draw on architecture, fashion, literature,
and film in order to question difficulties of definition and express confusion at their
first engagement with their reading. We designed the blog in order to promote
a collaborative approach to understanding between students. In addition, tutors
modelled their own thought processes via short pieces of writing and uploaded
images that would resonate with key readings. Students were able to read each
other's ideas and see images that others had connected to their readings. This next
section explores the significance of the role that the image can play in deepening
our understanding of language and outlines some of the key ideas that informed
our practices in this respect.
VIOLENCE AND THE IMAGE

    The essayist tradition as the dominant mode of teaching, learning, and assess-
ment in higher education, prioritizes particular language-based practices. In design-
ing the blog to visibly connect reading and writing, students constructed their own
writing in response to the writing of others. Gunther Kress (2011, p. 206) discusses
the centrality of language in learning and teaching where it is accepted as the "major
route and vehicle for learning and knowing." He suggests that the routes we take
through a word-based text can be "taken care of " by established traditions of inter-
preting reader or author meaning (Kress, 2003, p. 50). However, he encourages us to
think about multimodal experiences, acknowledging that there are other vehicles or
modes for learning, which can enrich the ways in which language is experienced. He
suggests that the image, creates a reading path which is not "automatically given or
readily recoverable." It is not only "difference" in mode but the "violence of the im-
age" which "punctures" the language-based system (Jean-Luc Nancy, 2005). Nancy's
description of violence as "a force that remains foreign to the dynamic or energetic
system into which it intervenes" reinforces the significant differences between lan-
guage and image based systems. It is possible that the use of a multimodal approach,
combining images and observation within the reading process, could be employed
to productively disrupt usual reading and writing practices.

    An emphasis in the module on the relationship between knowledge, power
and technology encouraged us to draw on these resources in order to explore the
creation of multimodal texts to promote learning. This could be described as the
creation of a range of semiotic resources informed by Shirley Brice Heath's descrip-
tion of a web or ecology of learning environments (Brice Heath, 2000). Students
engaged with their key reading and were encouraged to respond by introducing
images and or video links that resonated with their understanding of their reading
for that particular week. The inclusion of images was a deliberate attempt to create
alternative spaces for interpretation and exploration, by resisting fixed responses
(Elliott Eisner, 2004).

    As a shared space, the blog was designed to be both democratic and accessible.
Following the taught seminar sessions, students were able to use the blog to discuss
various visionary and experiential geographies, uploading relevant postmodern ar-
chitectural photographs, for example, and links to other literature, whilst making
connections with the writing of peers, tutors and a guest lecturer. The blog ap-
peared to be a useful space for creating multimodal texts as interpretive tools for
making sense of the key readings. For example, one student uploaded an image
from the film Bladerunner in response to a piece of science fiction that had been

              Figure 20.3: A student's response made to "The Ticktockman"
                                 in Dear and Flusty, 2002.
                                                                                                    285

set as a key reading (the "Ticktockman" shown in Figure 20.3). The posting of this
image and the related comments prompted a later discussion between tutor and
student via the blog. This took place outside the usual "face to face" teaching time
and provided useful material for discussion with other students in the next session.
It provided a useful extension of the face-to-face taught sessions and also prompted
interaction with the key reading as students responded to their reading by bringing
images and text to the blog.

SUMMARY

    The use of the blog provided opportunities for regular short bursts of writing
of comparatively informal texts with opportunities for student participation. Ex-
plicit connections were made between reading and writing from the outset and
there appeared to be a greater level of interaction with key readings, evidenced, for
example, in increased levels of participation in the seminar sessions. Students were
active in their participation and contributed to written and visual resources for the
module via the blog. We perceived a disruption to the reading paths experienced
by this group in comparison to previous cohorts and we would attribute this to
the ecology of reading and writing environments that were co-created via the blog.
Importantly, students contributed to the production of these environments, rather
than their consumption, and the responsibility for working towards some form
of understanding was shared by tutor and student. The blog also created a space
for writing to be reintroduced. Although there was no requirement to write for
assessment, the blog created a forum where written and visual sources were valued
for their contribution to collaborative meaning-making. In working with a new
text form, and one that enabled creative combinations of text and image, the blog
made us, as tutors, re-think the role and purpose of writing to enhance reading,
transforming our own as well as students' practices in this respect.

    There is an expectation that students in their final year of study will be con-
fident in their understanding of academic practice. However, students are work-
ing with changing contexts and shifting expectations and there is value in making
reading and writing practices visible for students at every point in their learning.
In working with the blog as an emergent textual practice we were forced to revisit
our own practices, making our own uncertainties visible to our students through
image and text.

WORKING WITH GRAMMAR
AS A TOOL FOR MAKING MEANING

      Gillian Lazar and Beverley Barnaby

    Academic literacies has been described as an "overarching framework" (Joan
Turner, 2012, p. 18) which aims to scrutinize critically the dominant values, norms
and institutional practices relating to academic writing (Caroline Coffin & Jim
Donoghue, 2012). One dominant value, often articulated by some academics and
students, is that "correct grammar" at sentence-level is essential for good academic
writing. However, this focus on sentence-level grammar is often associated with a
top-down prescriptiveness in which "peremptory commands" about correct usage are
linked with a negative evaluation of a person's speech or writing (Deborah Cameron,
2007, p. 1).

    This chapter focuses on a small-scale project at a post-1992 university1 in North
London, in which a number of first-year "Education Studies and Early Years" stu-
dents were referred to a writing specialist by an academic in order to improve their
"poor grammar." The writing specialist had already collaborated closely with the
academic and her colleagues in "Education Studies and Early Years" in developing
three "embedded" sessions (Ursula Wingate, 2011) which were integrated within
the students' modules, and were delivered during course time. The sessions were
broadly informed by a "Writing in the Disciplines" approach, involving collabora-
tion between academics and the writing specialist in terms of the design, content,
and delivery of the sessions, and in encouraging students to engage from the outset
with disciplinary discourse (Mary Deane & Peter O'Neill, 2011). These sessions
aimed to make explicit to students the lecturers' tacit assumptions of what was re-
quired in academic writing assignments (Cecilia Jacobs, 2005) in relation to genre,
argumentation, structure, academic style, and referencing. Nevertheless, even after
the delivery of these sessions, a cohort of 23 students was identified by subject aca-
demics as still having significant problems with writing, primarily with "poor gram-
mar." The academic who referred the students to the writing specialist was moti-
vated by a strong commitment to provide appropriate support to these students, as
weak grammar had been identified by academics teaching on the programme as the
key difficulty which was preventing them from progressing in their studies.

    The writing specialist was interested in unpacking the notion of "poor gram-

mar" with both students and academic staff, since labelling students as having poor
grammar seems to raise an important issue. To what extent can a focus on gram-
mar form part of an academic literacies approach, since an emphasis on "surface
features, grammar, and spelling" is often characteristic of the study skills approach,
which attempts to "fix" students' problems with writing in a top-down, instru-
mentalist way (Mary Lea & Brian Street, 1998). Is a focus on sentence-level gram-
mar compatible with the notion of exploring writing as a social practice, and its
concomitant emphasis on issues of identity? The writing specialist was interested
in investigating some of the views of academics with regards to grammar, partic-
ularly the ways that these manifested in the kinds of comments/annotations they
wrote on student assignments. She was also interested in devising and delivering a
series of classroom-based activities which might enable students to explore gram-
mar in more transformative ways, for example, by investigating how grammar can
be understood as a tool for making meaning, as well as the relationship between
grammar, student identities and the complex power relationships both within the
university and the wider geopolitical context. This chapter thus begins with a brief
discussion of the overall context, and of a small-scale investigation of the views of
three academics regarding "correct grammar" and the ways that these were instan-
tiated in the kinds of annotations that they made on student assignments. Sample
activities for classroom use are then provided, followed by students' reactions to
these activities. We conclude with a brief discussion of some of the tensions and
transformative possibilities arising from this project.

THE CONTEXT

    The project involved working with a cohort of 23 students, identified by the
academics marking their work as having "poor grammar" in an assignment in which
students were required to outline and evaluate the contents of a chapter in a pre-
scribed textbook. The cohort of students was linguistically extremely diverse. It in-
cluded students who described themselves as native speakers of English, but who also
used non-standard forms of grammar typical of local communities in London (Sian
Preece, 2009). The cohort included bilingual or trilingual students who routinely
used grammatical forms which may be considered acceptable in global varieties of
English, such as Indian or Nigerian English, but which are generally considered
wrong in standard British English (Andy Kirkpatrick, 2007). An example of such a
form is pluralised uncountable nouns (e.g., informations, knowledges, researches). A
third group encompassed international students, who had learned some English at
school in their own country. Finally, there was a category of multilingual students,
often refugees, who spoke one language at home with their family, had been edu-
cated in a second or even third, and had then had to acquire English in informal
settings when they arrived in the United Kingdom.

                                                    Working with Grammar as a Tool for Making Meaning

    Given the constraints of timetabling, it was decided that four one-hour "gram-
mar" sessions would be provided. Despite the efforts of academic staff to put
a positive spin on the sessions, some of the students who were referred to the
sessions may have felt stigmatized initially. In questionnaires devised by the aca-
demic following the delivery of the sessions, 69% of the students said that they
appreciated the offer of help, while 31% said that it made them feel "uneasy,"
"uncomfortable," and "let down." Thus, it is clear that labelling students' work as
grammatically deficient played into a very normative view of what constitutes ac-
ceptable academic writing. On the other hand, for many of the students involved,
acquisition of sentence-level grammar in English was a largely unconscious pro-
cess which had never been subjected to conscious analysis or reflection. This had
two negative consequences. Firstly, students were limited in the ways that they
could manipulate grammar to convey different meanings. Secondly, when stu-
dents were asked to proofread their work by lecturers, many of them could not
identify the ways in which their work departed from the grammatical norms that
the lecturers were enforcing.

THE LECTURER PERSPECTIVE

    Why did the academic staff involved in the project consider grammar to be
important, and how did they signal this to their students? What types of grammar
"errors" did they consider significant in student writing? In order to explore these
questions, three lecturers who had marked student assignments on the course were
interviewed. They were also asked to annotate chapter reviews from three students,
bearing in mind the main areas of grammar which they felt should be pointed out
to students.

    The interviews with the lecturers revealed not only a strong consensus about
why grammar was important, but a sense that grammar was not just a surface fea-
ture of writing, but a tool for communicating meaning:

         ... in order to make sure they convey their ideas clearly, they
         need to learn basic grammar. (Lecturer 1, Interview 22/2/2012)

         Grammar is very important, because the meaning is lost if the
         grammar is incorrect. The clarity of expression and communica-
         tion is linked with grammar. (Lecturer 3, Interview 23/2/2012)

    In addition to the interviews, the small sample of marked chapter reviews was
analyzed, which revealed that lecturers had different approaches to marking gram-
mar in assignments. One lecturer simply underlined errors, without providing any
further information; another replaced the error with a "correct" version, while a
third provided a "correct" version, but also wrote some explanatory comments in

                                                                                                    291
Lazar and Barnaby

the margin. Overall, this approach to marking revealed a top-down prescriptiveness
aligned to the `study skills' approach to teaching writing (Lea & Street, 1998).

    When the lecturers' annotations for the assignments were compared, it was
clear that there was both a high level of agreement about which types of errors
should be pointed out to students, as well as a high level of conformity to the
norms of standard British English usage. In the interviews, grammatical areas
which were mentioned as ones to point out to students included "faulty" sentence
construction, incorrect punctuation, incorrect spelling, omission of "little" words
such as definite articles, misuse of tenses, confusion between singulars and plurals
(including pluralising uncountable nouns), and inappropriate word choice. It was
significant that the list included the omission of definite articles and the pluralising
of uncountable nouns, which are often features of non-British varieties of English
(Eyamba Bokamba, 1992; Kirkpatrick, 2007). For students who are "native" speak-
ers of these varieties in countries such as India and Nigeria, the "mistake" may only
become evident in the context of British Standard English.

DEVELOPING CLASSROOM-BASED ACTIVITIES

    In order to devise appropriate activities for the students, an analysis of com-
mon student "grammar errors" in the chapter reviews was undertaken. From the
analysis, it was clear that, in addition to difficulties with grammar, some students
had not understood the overall rhetorical purpose of the review, and had simply
summarized the chapter contents. This suggests that "poor grammar" can some-
times be a blanket term that encompasses other aspects of "poor" writing. The
assignments of other students revealed a good understanding of the purpose of a
review, but were grammatically weak, often in the key areas identified by the lec-
turers. The question which then arose was how to develop students' grammatical
competence in these areas in ways which emphasized the meaning-making poten-
tial of grammar, while also stimulating awareness of what Ann Johns (1997) calls
a "socio-literate" perspective. This meant that the activities attempted to enable
students to make connections between grammar and issues relating to identity and
power relationships in writing. For example, if students routinely used grammar
forms identified as "non-standard" in the British context, either with friends and
family in the United Kingdom, or in more formal settings in their home country,
then what kind of shifts of identity were required for them to use standard forms
in their academic writing? An inventory of classroom activities was developed in
response to this. The design of these activities was also informed by some of the evi-
dence in research into second language acquisition that "form-focused" instruction
(i.e., drawing students' attention explicitly to the form and meaning of a particu-
lar grammatical structure) is beneficial to their learning of grammar (Nina Spada,
2010). The working assumption was that form-focused instruction might benefit

292

all students in the group, even if they were not second language speakers of English.
In addition, the tasks incorporated a number of principles for promoting language
awareness, including discussing the language analytically, employing learner-cen-
tred discovery activities and engaging students both affectively and cognitively (Si-
mon Borg, 1994).

SOME SAMPLE ACTIVITIES

1. Reflection on Different Varieties of Grammar and Students' Iden-

tities

    The aim of these activities was to encourage students to reflect on how the
grammatical forms they utilized might signal particular aspects of their identity,
and to validate the complex hybridity of many student identities as expressed in the
grammar they used. Suresh Canagarajah (1999) has pointed to the difficulties that
students may experience in bridging the gap between the English they use in their
vernacular, and the standard forms used in academic writing. Top-down feedback
comments by academic staff underline the notion that there is only one "correct"
form of grammar, thus potentially stigmatizing non-standard uses of grammar and
the expressions of identity that go along with them.

      a. Students draw and discuss diagrams, detailing their own linguistic profile,
             including the different languages and varieties that they speak, with
             whom they are used and in what context.

      b. Students discuss sentences, contrasting sentences or paragraphs containing
             standard and non-standard grammatical forms, and explore when and
             by whom they might use them. For example, with family and friends
             versus in the university. How might shifting from one repertoire to an-
             other feel?

      c. Students discuss a series of statements relating to grammar:
             Do you agree or disagree with these statements. Why?
             · Using particular grammar makes you a member of a particular club.
             · Grammar can never be wrong; it can only be inappropriate.
             · Changing the grammar I use, changes the person I am.

      d. Students are asked to "think ethnographically" and note down examples of
             different grammatical forms they notice being used in their daily lives;
             these can then be discussed in class.

2. Contrastive Analysis

    The aim of these activities was to emphasize that the manipulation of differ-
ent grammatical forms empowers writers to make meaning in different ways. For

                                                                                                    293
Lazar and Barnaby

example, students compare a number of different sentences or paragraphs contex-
tualized within academic texts, which illustrate contrastive uses of grammar, e.g.,
the active voice and the passive voice; or the use of the present simple and present
perfect, versus the past simple when quoting. Do they reveal any differences about
the writer's position in the text (Ken Hyland, 2002), or about the writer's attitude
to the contemporary relevance of the quote (John Swales & Christine Feak, 2004)?
How would students feel about using them and why?

3. Strategies for "Noticing" Different Grammatical Forms

    The aim of these activities was to draw on some of the strategies commonly used
in English Language Teaching to enable students to analyze the meanings encoded
in specific grammatical forms. This might encourage students to engage cognitively
with grammar, rather than slavishly accepting the "correct form" with no real un-
derstanding of why they might actively choose to use it.

      a. Encouraging students to develop a series of "concept questions," which
             can help them to disambiguate grammatical meaning. For example, in
             relation to the sentence The book is aimed at professional, students could
             apply these questions: Do you mean one, or more than one "profession-
             al?" Is this okay in the version of English spoken in your home country? In
             standard British English, how do you make it clear how many professionals
             there are? Students are asked to apply these concept questions when
             proofreading.

      b. Students are asked to compare a text with numerous grammar "mistakes,"
             with a "reformulated text" (Scott Thornbury, 1997) with none. How
             significant are the mistakes in the original in terms of meaning? In what
             ways does the reformulated text change the meaning? In what ways does
             the reformulated text conform to standard usage? How important (or
             not) is this?

STUDENTS' RESPONSE TO THE ACTIVITIES

    All of the activities above were used in the four sessions with the group. Initially,
the intention was that the students should keep a reflective log of their reactions to
the activities, but disappointingly, the responses to this were limited. When ques-
tioned, students mentioned that they were very short of time as they were working
on assignments that counted towards their final grades, whereas the logs did not.
However, some responses were received:

         I found the activities useful, especially the activity that involved
         us getting into pairs and discussing how our mother tongue

294
                                                    Working with Grammar as a Tool for Making Meaning

         differs from English.

         From my point of view all the exercises we have in the lessons are
         useful but I have find(sic) that punctuation and the use of arti-
         cles as one of the most important points to remember when we
         have to write an essay as it can change the meaning of what we
         are trying to say. It is also important to know when we should
         use singular and plural, as it might mean the opposite of what
         we are trying to explain.'

CONCLUSION

    During the implementation of this project a number of tensions emerged. One
surprising tension was that many of the students were initially keen to "learn rules"
about grammar, and tended to classify any deviance from standard British English
as "wrong." Discussions about the legitimacy and appropriacy of non-standard En-
glish became quite heated, with a few students vehemently insisting on the use of
the standard form in all contexts. There was sometimes a slight impatience with dis-
cussions about the broader socio-politics of language, with students simply wanting
to know what was "correct." This suggests that the views of students reflect the
views about language held in the wider society, including the belief that prescriptive
rules regarding correct usage are valid in all contexts. Thus, one of the tasks of the
writing specialist is to encourage students to question and explore these in order
to genuinely transform attitudes regarding grammar. Nevertheless, most students
were very appreciative that the complexity of their linguistic identities was valued
and seen as a resource, which may not always have been the case within the uni-
versity context. This would suggest that the activities utilized in the sessions were
genuinely transformative for some students in encouraging them to move from a
view of grammar as simply "right or wrong," to one in which grammar is regarded
as a tool that can be manipulated for expressing different aspects of identity in
different contexts. The students thus appeared to develop an improved awareness
of the kind of grammar considered appropriate in an academic context, while also
feeling that their complex linguistic identities were being validated. For example,
a number of students reported on feedback forms that the activities used in the
sessions had changed their views about grammar and its relationship to meaning,
and that they enjoyed the activities in which they were asked to draw on their own
linguistic repertoires.

    Another tension was between the academics' comments that grammar is a tool
for making meaning, and the evidence from their annotations that standard forms
need to be enforced, either by underlining these or providing the "correct" forms
for the student. Theresa Lillis (2003) has called for a dialogue to be at the centre

                                                                                                    295

of an academic literacies approach, but lecturers' annotations about grammar gen-
erally communicate rather top-down prescriptiveness, with little space for encour-
aging critical engagement by students. Perhaps marking annotations could instead
include "concept" questions relating to any ambiguities in meaning arising from
the way a grammatical structure has been used in an assignment. Or perhaps an-
notations could encourage students to consider more deeply the issues of identity
that may arise when they experiment with "new" forms of grammar. Overall, the
collaboration between the writing specialist and academics has been transformative
in initiating a dialogue about how marking methods could encourage a more dia-
logic relationship between staff and students, and in encouraging academic staff to
consider how their marking practices can move from a "study skills" model of writ-
ing to one which is informed by an academic literacies approach. Such an approach
enables academic staff to be more cognisant that the grammar used by students is
not simply a surface level feature of text, but is often a complex manifestation of
students' identities.

    Joan Turner (2004, p. 108) has argued for "the constitutive importance of lan-
guage in the academic context" to be better recognized. As sentence-level grammar
is an essential part of this language, it will continue to generate both tensions, as
well as creatively transformative responses, among those teaching and researching
academic writing.

DIGITAL POSTERS--TALKING
CYCLES FOR ACADEMIC LITERACY

      Diane Rushton, Cathy Malone and Andrew Middleton

    This chapter explores an inter-disciplinary collaboration which set the written
word to one side to explore the student voice in a space between speech and writing.
It presents an emerging Digital Posters pedagogy in which student experimentation
with the spoken word is designed to support their critical engagement with their
subject and by extension their ability to produce the structures of academic writing.
The method has been developed collaboratively over three years by the authors: an
academic, a writing tutor and an educational developer. The approach has proved
liberating for both staff and students and has provided a means of exploring concep-
tions of academic literacies as being about critical and constructive growth through
the students' exploration of language and their representation of knowledge.

THE CHALLENGE

    The massification of UK higher education and the growing diversity of the
student body exacerbate the difficulty of establishing appropriate expectations for,
and engagement with, academic writing. Diversity was central to the challenge in
this case study, which involved students enrolled on two Sheffield Business School
Level 5 (year 2) Business units: Managing in a Global Context (full-time degree,
Erasmus, Chinese students, full-time Higher National Diploma (HND) students)
and Globalization and Business (part-time degree/HND students). The primary
challenge, stated simply, was how to engage these students in writing that promotes
learning at degree level; a challenge further compounded by the teaching team's
diverse understandings of the function of writing.

ADDRESSING THE CHALLENGE

    Colin Bryson and Len Hand (2007, p. 360), in discussing learner engagement,
reflect that "positive engagement ... is unsurprisingly linked to [students] enjoying
what they do" and as Karen Scouller (1998) argues, good performance in essay
writing is linked to students developing and using deep learning strategies. We felt

a fresh approach was required in engaging the students, one that was not likely to
be perceived as addressing a technical deficit and one that developed within the
subject itself. As a team we wanted to create a novel arena; one in which students
could explore their own voices and, ultimately, re-engage with their own thinking
and appreciation of writing as a space for exploring thinking.

DIGITAL POSTERS AND THE DIGITAL VOICE

    The realization that a deeply engaging novel approach to embedding writing de-
velopment was needed coincided with a university innovation project called Digital
Voices. This initiative aimed to explore the value of the recorded voice to enhance
learning and one of the methods being promoted in that work, Digital Posters, ap-
peared to offer a new environment in which students could discover their academic
voice. The Digital Voice project proposed that new, every-day technologies disrupt
existing understandings of the "learning environment" and introduce diverse op-
portunities for using the recorded voice as a way to promote learning. At the same
time, the Digital Voice project was intent on exploring usergenerated media as an
integrated, pervasive phenomenon; not as something distinct and supplementary
to existing teaching and learning concerns.

WHAT ARE DIGITAL POSTERS?

    In this case, a Digital Poster is a video based on a single power point slide and
produced by a student during a two hour workshop. Students are expected to re-
cord a five minute visually rich presentation with spoken commentary. They use
screen capture technology, rather than a camera, to record their PC screen. The
resultant recording is saved as a digital video file which can be played back immedi-
ately in the classroom or later online (see example: http://youtu.be/NitL1LqtG9c).

    Technically, digital posters are made feasible by the simple production process
which involves the use of familiar software (PowerPoint) and less familiar, yet re-
liable and highly accessible screencasting software (Camtasia Studio). Familiarity
and usability are critical characteristics of the Digital Poster method, supporting
the principle that, even though students will be required to work in a way that is
new to them, the technical interface should not raise anxiety or otherwise disrupt
the primary learning activity of talking about, listening to and reflecting on ideas
and knowledge. It is important for the effective engagement of the students that the
activity is straightforward, enjoyable and ultimately understood by them as being
relevant and useful.

    In this case study students used Digital Posters to report on the initial find-
ings from their research into an agreed topic. Prior to attending the workshop, the
students selected four or five images, representing their findings about the topic,

which they were expected to organize on a single PowerPoint slide. It was explained
to the students that they would need to use the images as "visual bullet-points"
to support their commentary on their research topic. The students were required
to work without written scripts and, instead, to depend on their visual cues as
prompts. This was intended to create a structure while allowing them to explore
different ways of explaining what they had discovered. The students were each
given a headset and screencasting software to record their slide and talk. They were
asked to begin by introducing their topic before addressing each of their selected
images. To conclude, they were expected to identify any connections between the
structural components. Once satisfied with their commentary, the students were
able to add zoom and pan effects to their recording using other features in the soft-
ware. This process resulted in the production of a visual and verbal journey around
and then across their slide of images.

WORKSHOP DESIGN

    The workshop is organized around four phases: modelling, presentation, pro-
duction and reflection. The tutor begins by modelling the process in the PC Lab
using a headset and the installed screencasting software. The methods are also ex-
plained on an illustrated handout which students follow later. The modelling in-
tentionally highlights the difficulty of finding the right words and celebrates the
hesitancy found in utterances such as "um" and "err," identifying them as being
symbolic of the thinking required to construct an effective presentation of knowl-
edge. This emphasizes that technical perfection is not an expected outcome of the
exercise and that finding the right words requires some effort and experimentation.

    It is important to stress here, as it is to the students, that the main value of the
Digital Posters method is the formative process of making and thinking about the
different ways they have to present their knowledge. It is the students' consideration
of how they can best visually represent their chosen topic; explain their engagement
with their topic and their knowledge of it, which is important at this early stage
in their assignment. The students become involved in an electronically mediated,
self-regulated, iterative process of talking about their study and rapidly reflecting on
their presentation by making design decisions. The iterative cycle in the Digital Post-
ers concept involves the student speaking and recording, replaying and reviewing,
and then revising and re-recording their presentation until they are happy with it, or
until the workshop moves from the presentation phase into its production phase. It
provides an environment in which students can organize their thinking.

    The structure of the workshop ensures that students are continuously engaged
in making decisions within an ethos of "good enough" production quality, typical
of user-generated digital media tasks (Martin Weller, 2011). Each presentation cy-
cle takes about ten minutes depending on the extent of the revisions the student

                                                                                                    301

determines to be necessary. During the cycle students are asked to listen to the
words they have used, the fluency with which they have used them, the suitability
of the structure they have selected and how these factors enable or hinder them in
making a coherent presentation. The intention, therefore, is not for students to get
anything "right" but for them to explore the open-ended nature of an academic
assignment, the need for them to manage this and to develop a suitable academic
voice (Peter Elbow, 1995, p. xlvi). The task confirms the uncertain, emerging and
fuzzy state of knowledge at this stage in their thinking. The forgiving nature of the
spoken word and the inherent open-endedness of images contrast with the appar-
ent finality of the written word at the heart of the student's anxiety. The spoken
word gives the student room to navigate what they know and to find the appro-
priate structure and vocabulary they need. This multimodal view of literacy readily
accommodates tentative and reflective expression and brings together the benefits
of spatial logic through the visual elements and temporal logic in the use of words
(Gunther Kress, 2003).

    The production phase of the workshop provides some time for each student
to develop their presentation using the software's zoom and pan tools. It allows
the student producer to add visual emphasis and to make connections across the
structure as well as creating a high level view of the topic in conclusion. The final
review phase of the workshop takes the form of a ten minute plenary in which stu-
dents reflect on the method and whether it helped them to explore their thinking
and identify gaps in their knowledge. This metacognitive approach highlights the
importance of language, structure and voice in representing knowledge. It is the
academic equivalent to a warm down exercise in which students talk about their
experience. The following section is largely based upon an analysis of transcripts
from these plenary conversations.

REFLECTING ON THE WORKSHOPS

    This section draws on our classroom observations of students making their dig-
ital posters and, in particular, on the workshop discussion. The data come from
eight workshops conducted with approximately 40 students in the third year of
this work.

    It was immediately evident that students were intrigued by the technology and
engaged positively with it. Beyond some initial shyness, the usual reticence of stu-
dents to speak up disappeared as they began to record their reports. The challenge
of recording a personal artefact appeared to absorb the students, immersing them
in a private space, albeit within the public environment of a busy PC Lab (Figure
22.1). Students sat side-by-side in the lab, each speaking directly to their screens
before playing back the recording. Not only did the use of technology appear to
transform the public space into private space, but it also worked as an interactive

302

mirror, creating a strong virtual audience for some students.

             Figure 22.1: Students producing digital posters in a workshop.
    The impersonality of the technology and the lack of social dynamic helped
some students to focus on the task in hand:

         When you make eye contact with people [in presentations]
         you kind of think you're buying yourself a bit more time. It's
         just different when you're staring at a computer screen. It's like
         "Go"--that's it ...
         Others personified the computer as a listener; their partner in
         their dialogic exchange,
         You can kind of forget you're talking to a screen. You're talking to
         someone. So it's like they're listening and there's a connection there.

                                                                                                    303
Rushton, Malone and Middleton

    The novelty of the technology and the task was perceived positively as being
"fun," "interesting," and "a good way to engage your attention," and contributed to
a high sense of engagement and ownership:

         You learn a lot because you don't want to do it badly. Because it's
         your voice you want to get it right.

    The Digital Poster method requires students to work without a written script
or notes and many students remarked on how the use of images helped them to
structure their thinking. This student's comment was echoed by many others:

         I think it is useful [to think about structure in terms of pictures] be-
         cause you think about a picture in a lot more words than just writ-
         ing. You get an image in your head and you create thoughts around
         the picture. I think it helps to open your mind about the topic.

    As the concept of photo elicitation suggests (Douglas Harper, 2002), the stu-
dents explained that while the pictures made room for thinking, they also created
a focus:

         The pictures help you to concentrate. When you look at them
         your thoughts start to take shape and they help you to focus on
         your topics.

         It was easy to come up with words just by looking at the picture.

    The technology enabled students to capture their words with spontaneity and
then revisit and reflect on this as they mentally redrafted their digital poster. The
interplay of "product" and "process" involving the rapid reversioning of artefacts
seems to locate Digital Posters in a space between speech and writing. The process
encouraged a metacognitive engagement among students alongside their focus on
producing content. Because the method is modelled as an unusual, imperfect, and
transitory media, it created a space for low-stakes, critical self-evaluation.

    Due to the novelty of the medium, the students were not inhibited by precon-
ceived ideas of perfection. The medium acted as a mirror:

         I spoke it initially, but when I listened back I realized I'd said it
         incorrectly ... it emphasizes the importance of having a good
         understanding of the subject you're talking about.

         It's good listening back to yourself because you can hear whether
         or not you know what you're talking about.

    There was some evidence that the iterative process facilitated a shift in tone
from a more personal to a more public, formal voice; one more suited to the aca-
demic context and task. The Digital Poster workshops were an isolated event for

304
                                                     Digital Posters--Talking Cycles for Academic Literacy

the students, but several suggested they might do something similar independently:

         I think it will definitely help a lot [to do more of this at home].
         It's giving me a clearer view about what I'm doing.

         On future projects, if I'm not sure where I'm going, [using pic-
         tures to indicate structure] would help [me] to pick out what are
         the key points and elements which I need to use and which ones
         I need to research more on or change the ideas.

DIGITAL POSTER GALLERY

    The students were given the option of uploading their posters to a "student gal-
lery" in their Blackboard virtual learning environment. This created an audience for
the products, allowing for peer review and comparison. The Digital Poster gallery
also allowed the authors to reflect further on the approach. Having four pictures
on one slide, rather than on a series of slides, meant the stronger students tended
to make the connections between the visual elements, relating them back to an
overarching idea or main point. This was echoed, but not replaced, by the use of
the software's zoom and panning functionality to add emphasis.

    The simple use of visual prompts encouraged students to engage in their top-
ics in ways which could translate into their academic writing. For example, the
relationship between carefully selected graphics and presentational clarity was a
characteristic of the most successful posters. They created a coherent structure and
organization; features that potentially make it easier for the "reader" to follow the
presenter's train of thought, whether in speech or in writing. Feedback was given
on the posters that had been uploaded to Blackboard. This provided an opportu-
nity to deconstruct the best examples and begin to explore with the students how
academic literacy develops, how abstractions such as critical analysis and the use of
evidence and structure translate into language.

CONCLUSION

    A major driver for this work was student disengagement with academic writing
and their difficulty in valuing writing as anything other than a means of reporting
their state of knowledge. Exploration of the Digital Posters method has not only
helped to clarify to the students the significance of aspects of academic writing,
but has been revelatory to us as developers of the method too. In particular the
relationship of academic discourse to student selfregulation (Zimmerman, 1989),
conceptualizations of multiple literacies and multimodality (Kress, 2003), and the
benefits of reassessing digital media-enhanced learning environments have been
influential in developing our own thinking.

                                                                                                    305

    The student production of Digital Posters created a useful framework with
which to engage students as reflective and critical learners despite their reticence at
being challenged. The novelty of the medium, the decision-making associated with
designing the poster presentation, the clear communication required to represent
the state of each student's grasp of their topic, and the immediate feedback coming
through the iterative review, reflection and revision cycle, all contributed to creat-
ing a rich, immersive, intensive and engaging learning opportunity. For us, the shift
from written media to the spoken word and the integration of audio-visual media
seemed to recast the whole issue of student engagement in academic discourse and
academic writing.

    We found that the strongest indication of success in this study was in compar-
ing the eagerness of the students to talk about their experience of constructing their
Digital Posters, and their compulsion to produce "a good take," with their previ-
ous reticence to engage in discussions about academic writing. Looking to further
developments, we are interested in exploring the intertextual and dialogic aspects
(Mikhail Bakhtin, 1981) in the transfer of presented knowledge from one medium
to another, which we hope might help us to engage students more critically with
the relationship between their digital posters and their academic writing.

TELLING STORIES:
INVESTIGATING THE CHALLENGES
TO INTERNATIONAL STUDENTS'
WRITING THROUGH PERSONAL
NARRATIVE

      Helen Bowstead

    In an increasingly diverse educational context, the attempt to impose "one voice"
and one "literacy" on the myriad of "voices" and "literacies" that now make up
our student bodies seems ever more futile and ever less desirable. In this reflective
piece, I suggest that in order to embrace this diversity, those who work in the field
of academic literacies need to challenge and transgress the constraints inherent in
"normative" texts in their own professional writing. By drawing on personal narra-
tive and incorporating alternative textual forms, I hope to both argue and exemplify
how those who work with student writers can, and should, be troubling dominant
academic discourses.

    Early responses to the massification of the British Higher Education system
were very much informed by notions that many of the new type of university stu-
dent were somehow lacking in the "skills" needed to succeed. Academic Literacies
research has done much over the past 20 years to challenge this deficit model, yet,
in my experience at least, the way the attributes and educational experiences of "in-
ternational" students are conceptualized and described still very often perpetuate
the perception that they are somehow "lacking" or "less."

Discourses of internationalization often position Western and
Asian education systems and scholarship in terms of binary
opposites such as "deep/surface," "adversarial/harmonious," and
"independent/dependent" and uncritically attribute these labels
to whole populations and communities of practice. (Janette
Ryan & Kam Louie, 2008, p. 65)

    Within the binaries and generalizations commonly used to describe those who
come from other cultural and educational backgrounds, there is little that does not

reflect traditional Western notions of knowledge production or that encourages a
positive engagement with the rich diversity an international student body brings to
the HE context. In the same way that those students labelled "non-traditional" may
struggle to learn the rules of the game and to participate successfully in higher ed-
ucation, so many international students have also found themselves excluded from
academic discourse because the language skills and modes of knowledge production
that have served them well until their arrival in the United Kingdom are suddenly
deemed "deficient." Ursula Wingate and Christopher Tribble (2012, p. 484) argue
that "all students, whether they are native or non-native speakers of English, or
`non-traditional,' or `traditional' students, are novices when dealing with academic
discourse in the disciplines" and will therefore need support with their academic
writing. But if we accept the claim that all students are "novices," then this begs the
question: Who are the experts? It would seem to me that one answer might be; those
of us who write and publish academic texts. As Theresa Lillis and Mary Scott point
out (2007, p. 18), "the high status academic journal article continues to serve as an
implicit model for the texts students are expected to produce," and in almost every
case that model closely follows the conventions of a "normative" text.

    In my work I support both "home" and "international" students; my job is to
help them improve their written language skills and to adapt to academic culture
in the United Kingdom. I work closely with many students, often one on one, and
while a student's language skills may be the focus of my work, often the personal
and the political intervene:

         Angel came to see me because she wanted to practise her spoken
         English. What shall we talk about I ask her? She doesn't know.
         Well, tell me how you came to be in Plymouth, I say. Angel
         begins to talk. She speaks of life under Saddam Hussein. Of
         chemical warfare and the rising levels of infertility that are the
         terrible consequence. Of twelve nights in the basement of her
         house, hiding in the dark. She tells me how she had to battle
         with a hostile administrative system to be here. Of her determi-
         nation to complete her PhD and take back something of value to
         her homeland. To help rebuild Iraq.

    More and more in my work and in my research I find that I cannot help but
respond to the individuals I engage with, and to what their story is telling me about
them and about the world we live in (see Scott and Mitchell Reflections 1 this vol-
ume). There is a richness, a depth, a multi-layering in these narrative accounts that
fascinate me and which I wish to capture in my writing. Van Maanen (1998, cited
in Jaber Gubrium & James Holstein, 2003) says that how research is presented is
at least as important as what is presented. Conventional academic writing is a pow-
erful discourse that conceals and excludes; as Laurel Richardson argues, "how we

308
                                                                                                    Telling Stories

are expected to write affects what we can write about; the form in which we write
shapes the content" (cited in Gubrium & Holstein, 2003, p. 187). She argues that
traditional modes of representation serve only to conceal the "lived, interactional
context in which the text was co-produced" (Richardson, 1997, p. 139). And so, as
I write about the individuals I meet and the way in which these encounters impact
on my own writing practices, I try to embody these struggles in the shape and form
and content of the text, and to "out" the personal in type (Ken Gale & Jonathan-
Wyatt, 2009). I also write in the hope that this "story-telling" and "story-retelling"
can help to break down some of the cultural, educational and emotional barriers
that position students, and in particular "international" students, both as "other"
and "deficient." Stories reflect the discourses that work upon us and therefore there
is a need to subject personal narratives to a very "intense and focused" gaze in order
to arrive at a better "understanding of the social, of the way individual subjectivities
are created and maintained through specific kinds of discursive practices, within
particular historical moments, in particular contexts" (Bronwyn Davies & Susan
Gannon, 2006, p. 4). Davies and Gannon argue that it is only by recognizing the
ways in which discourse works on us, and we on it, that we can begin to initiate
some kind of change, to begin the vital process of "disturbing and destabilizing
sedimented thinking" (2006, p. 147).

    My work with Angel has spanned several years now. In her initial visits to me
she wanted to develop her spoken English skills. She hadn't been in the United
Kingdom much more than a year then, and had only recently begun work on her
PhD. She struggled to convey quite basic information, both orally and in her writ-
ing, and gaining her doctorate seemed very far away, to both of us. We have been
on a long and eventful journey, one that has revealed much to me about the nature
of writing and the power of language. Angel is a university lecturer in Iraq. She is
highly educated, and she is knowledgeable and passionate about her subject. Both
academically and professionally I am her inferior, and yet because she has chosen to
study in the United Kingdom, she is regarded as the one who is deficient. She has
struggled to acculturise on a number of levels. Not just to the language of the acad-
emy and her discipline, but also to the myriad of other contexts and communities
she must negotiate in order to "survive and succeed." Often her "lack" of language
has been perceived as a "problem." Proof that she should not be here. An excuse to
exclude and dismiss:

         Angel is having a difficult time. She is losing weight again and
         there is a blankness behind her eyes. She has been on placement
         in a local secondary school for the past few weeks so I haven't
         seen much of her. She thought she would be invited to teach, or
         perhaps share some of her expertise. But Angel has been treated
         very badly by some of the staff at the school. They ignore her in

                                                                                                    309

         the corridor and send her on menial errands.

         "Miss, yes you Miss, I need some more lined paper."

         Angel is disappointed in these English women and their behavior
         toward her. I am disappointed too. I have met those kinds of
         people before.

    Discourses can have very real effects on people's lives. Failing to acknowledge
the power discourses have to impact on the way we think and behave, or the way
in which we are complicit in their construction and perpetration, is to become a
prisoner of what Paulo Freire terms a "circle of certainty" (Freire, 2000, p. 39).
If we believe that the world can be ordered and named, if we believe in absolute
truths, then we lose the ability to "confront, to listen, to see the world unveiled"
(Freire, 2000, p. 39). Freire argues that it is imperative that we engage in dialogues
with our fellow men and women and to open ourselves up to what it is that is really
being said. Working with Angel, listening to her stories and becoming her friend,
has expanded my capacity to "know" and has helped me to begin to recognize and
trouble the powerful discourses that are currently being constructed to define and
maintain notions of the Muslim "other." It has also helped me to recognize the ways
in which similar discourses impact on my engagement with all those who might
just as easily be categorised as "not us." One of the things that drew me to write
about (and with) Angel was the way her life and PhD work intertwined. In her re-
search, she explores the communication barriers children who speak English as an
Additional Language experience when they talk about pain and I know Angel and
her family experienced the very same language and cultural barriers every day: An-
gel has lived the "real" experience of the EAL children she has chosen to research.
Yet there is no evidence in Angel's professional writing of the painful and personal
challenges and obstacles that she has overcome in its creation. For though there is
nothing more personal than the work of the "lone scholar," traditional academic
discourse encourages, even insists, that the writer must conceal herself and deny her
subjective experience.

         Angel has had an article published. She is pleased and proud.
         She sends me a copy to read. I recognize her work immediately.
         It is part of her thesis that we have spent many hours writing
         and rewriting. I am intrigued by the smooth, professionalism
         of the piece. It reads as a journal article "should." Gone are the
         awkward sentences and faulty grammar. Her theoretical basis is
         fluently and clearly expounded. The research relevant and appro-
         priately referenced. Angel's work has been fully translated into
         the "accepted" language of the academy. Although I am excited
         for Angel, I am also saddened that she has been so successfully

         "erased" from the text, that there is still no room for the person-
         al or the subjective or the imperfect in the traditional "science
         story."

    I am convinced that in order to challenge the powerful discourses of the "nor-
mative" text and to make way for a richer more varied, and more inclusive notion
of what can constitute "academic" writing, there is an imperative for those of us
who write professionally to reveal our subjectivities in both what we write and in
the way we write. Lillis and Scott (2007) note the value of ethnographic research as
a tool for addressing inequalities but also suggest that the often small-scale nature
of such research projects may have inhibited empirical and theoretical develop-
ments in the field of academic literacies. But writers such as Ron Pelias argue that,
conversely, it is vital that educators and researchers engage more and not less in what
he terms "empathetic scholarship." The notion of a shared humanity is central to
my research and my writing and I refuse to buy into the notion that ethnographic,
even autoethnographic, practices are somehow lacking, less, or deficient. And so,
like Pelias and others, I choose to position myself as a writer, and as a researcher
who, "instead of hiding behind the illusion of objectivity, brings [herself ] forward
in the belief that an emotionally vulnerable, linguistically evocative, and sensuously
poetic voice can place us closer to the subjects we wish to study" (Pelias, 2004, p.
1). I choose to produce texts that create spaces in which both the personal and the
political can resonate and where linguistic norms and textual forms can be troubled
(Helen Bowstead, 2011). Inspired by Laurel Richardson I have experimented with
poetic transcription and in doing so I have experienced the evocative power of
words liberated from the "bloodless prose" of the traditional academic text (Stoller,
p. xv, cited in Pelias, 2004, p. 10). In exploring alternative textual forms, I have
found I am able to write my way into a place where I can not only formulate a
more meaningful response to the social, political and educational issues that I face
in my work, but also give voice to those I work with in a way that both honours
and empowers them (Richardson, 1997):

         Angel sits next to me while she writes. I try not to watch as her
         hand moves across the page. I think her hand will move right to
         left. Awkwardly, as my own would. But it dances across the page.
         There is nothing linear about the way she writes. When she is
         finished, I ask her to tell me what she has written. I write down
         her words but I am not sure I can capture in English what she
         has expressed in her own language. I decide not to try.

         Angel talks of the pity she sees in people's eyes, of how she feels
         "second-rate," inferior. But I do not pity her. I have only admi-
         ration. She has a lion's heart. I imagine how beautiful her PhD

         would have been if she had been able to write it in her own
         language. How much more she would have been able to say and
         express. How she wouldn't have needed me, or her supervisors
         to correct her grammar and shape her prose. But even digitally
         Angel's language is denied her. Kurdish is not a language easily
         accessible in Microsoft word.

    As we move into a new era of funding regimes and shifting student populations,
it is clear that, in many institutions at least, there is going to be a continued and
potentially more aggressive push to recruit internationally. In this increasingly glo-
balized higher education context, it seems to me there is an even more urgent need
for a radical rethinking of "the ways writing is related to much deeper questions
of epistemology and what counts as knowledge in the university" (Ivanic & Lea,
2006, p. 12). I have long felt complicit in something which troubles me greatly. I

know for many students, including Angel, that they get through by following the
rules, rules that I help impose. But even when they become more skilled players
of the game, when they have become more familiar and more articulate in the
language of their subject and of the institution, they often don't have the time, the
energy, or the confidence to challenge and contest the dominant discourses that
they find themselves writing to. Though the academic literacies model has opened
up spaces for students to explore notions of meaning-making, identity and power,
and though it has foregrounded "the variety and specificity of institutional practices
and students' struggles to make sense of these" (Mary Lea & Brian Street, 2006,
p. 376), perhaps what those who work in the field still do not do enough is to
explicitly challenge those institutional practices in terms of the kinds of texts they
themselves create and publish.

    Westernized notions of coherence and cohesion are, like any discourse, are a
construction and, if I can quote George Gershwin, "it ain't necessarily so." I be-
lieve that engaging with alternative writing practices, and by that I mean writing
that is not bound by the "often impoverished perspective on language and liter-
acy that is trumpeted in official and public discourses" (Lillis & Scott, 2007, p.
21), affords professional academic writers huge opportunities for engaging in the
production of texts that embrace and promote forms of knowledge production
that not only reflect and celebrate, but also embody, what it means to be part of
the complex "new communicative order" that is emerging in our ever globalized
world (Street, 2004, cited in Lillis & Scott, 2007). In her discussions with student
writers, Theresa Lillis (2003, p. 205) often encountered "a desire to make mean-
ing through logic and emotion, argument and poetry, impersonal and personal
constructions of text," to create the kind of "hybrid" texts that are "pregnant with
potential for new world views, with new `internal forms' for perceiving the world
in words" (Bakhtin, 1981, p. 36 cited in Lillis, 2003, p. 205). Yet, it is incredibly
difficult for (novice) student writers to transform their writing practices unless
they are exposed to (published) academic work that embodies this desire to trou-
ble academic norms and to explore alternative textual forms. It is not that such
texts do not exist, nor that they fail to meet the highest of academic standards.
Writers such as John Danvers (2004), Ken Gale and Jonathan Wyatt (2009), Ron
Pelias (2004), Laurel Richardson (1997,) Tammy Spry (2011) and Elizabeth St.
Pierre (1997) have all published texts which, though they are often striking and
personal, and sometimes challenging and difficult, easily meet the criteria that
Richardson and St. Pierre (1994, p. 964) suggest can be used to measure texts
produced through "creative analytical processes." That is to say that, as well as
making a substantive contribution to our understanding of social life, these works
demonstrate an aesthetic merit that is both complex and satisfying, and a deep
reflexivity that clearly evidences the author's accountability to the people studied.
And while it is important that "confounding expectations should not become a

                                                                                                    313

new orthodoxy" (Danvers, 2004, p. 171), these are all texts that have a significant
emotional and intellectual impact on the reader (see also Horner and Lillis Reflec-
tions 4 this volume). Therefore, I am convinced that if we wish to develop a system
of higher education "premised upon the explicit aims of inclusion and diversity"
(Lillis, 2003, p. 192), then it behoves us as the writers in the field to seek out and
produce textual forms that embody and embrace the heterogeneity of our student
populations, texts which can act as models of the kinds of alternative modes of
mean-making that our student writers can engage with, and aspire to.

DIGITAL WRITING AS
TRANSFORMATIVE: INSTANTIATING
ACADEMIC LITERACIES IN THEORY
AND PRACTICE

      Colleen McKenna

    Online writing has the potential to be transformative both for readers and
writers. Online texts can be distributed, disruptive, playful and multi-voiced, and
they can challenge our assumptions about power, publication, argument, genre,
and audience. Increasingly, researchers are exploring how academic work can be
performed in digital spaces (Sian Bayne, 2010; Robin Goodfellow, 2011; Colleen
McKenna, 2012; Colleen McKenna and & Claire McAvinia, 2011; Bronwyn
Williams, 2009); however nearly all this work takes student writing as its focus
and all of these cited texts are published in conventional formats (journal articles
or book chapters). An exception is Theresa Lillis, 2011 who manipulates standard
article formatting by juxtaposing texts on a page--but the piece is still subject to
the constraints of a conventional, paper-based journal. Nonetheless, academics
are increasingly turning to digital spaces to write about their work, and a body
of online scholarship, that largely sits outside institutional quality and promo-
tion structures, is growing up, almost in parallel to more conventional genres of
articles, books and reports. Furthermore, online journals such as Kairos, which
publishes only multimodal "webtexts," are promoting peer-reviewed, digital ac-
ademic discourse.

    In this piece I will consider some of the characteristics of digital writing (such
as voice, modality, and spatial design) that are transforming practices of textual
production and reading.1 Building particularly on Lillis's work on dialogism in
academic writing (2003, 2011), I will attempt to demonstrate how certain types
of digital academic writing can be mapped onto her expanded version of Mary Lea
and Brian Street's academic literacies framework, as dialogic, oppositional texts. I
will argue that digital academic writing has a huge potential to represent academic
literacies principles in practice as well as in theory. In terms of practices, I will
draw on digital texts written by professional academics and students, as well as my
experience of writing. I am regularly struck by the limitations of writing academic

pieces about the digital in a paper-based format. So, part of the basis of this chapter
is the development of a digital intertext which explores the ways in which online
academic writing can instantiate aspects of academic literacies theory.
JOURNEYS INTO DIGITAL WRITING

    In order to explore issues associated with doing academic work online, I have
developed a digital intertext which can be found at the following site: http://prezi.
com/ux2fxamh1uno/?utm_campaign=share&utm_medium=copy&rc=ex0share.

    In this context, I am using the term "intertext," borrowed from postructuralist
literary criticism, to mean a text that is in conversation with another and which ad-
dresses similar, but not identical, material. "Intertext" seems more apt than "online
version" because the movement between text types is not an act of translation: I
am not just reproducing arguments expressed here in another space. Rather, while
related concepts are being articulated, the digital environments demand and enable
a range of different textual practices, particularly in terms of modality and spatial
design. (For an example of a rich pair of digital intertexts, see Susan Delagrange's
work on the digital Wunderkammer, Delagrange, 2009a, screen shot in Figure 24.1,
and Delagrange, 2009b).

    A particular challenge in my writing has been the selection of an apposite dig-
ital environment for the creation of the intertexts; "digital" writing can take many
forms, and determining what genre, and thus what technical platform to use has
been more difficult than anticipated. There were a number of issues to consider
such as how far did I want to go back to first principles: for example, did I want
to code the text in html? Did I want to build in opportunities for dialogue with
readers? Did I mind using pre-formatted spaces? Is part of the purpose of this work
to write within easily available and known genres such as blogs?

    In terms of accessibility and familiarity of text type, a blog appeared to be an
obvious choice. The affordances of blogs are that they allow for textual units or lexia
of varying lengths, and they enable hypertextual, multimodal writing with inbuilt
spaces for audiences to respond, so dialogism and hybridity are possible. There is
also a tendency for the growing body of online academic writing referred to above
to be published in this format. However, having initially written a blog on this
topic, I ultimately found that the default organizing principle imposed too much
of a linear, chronological arrangement of material.

    So, after several false starts, I developed a Prezi.2 Although Prezi is largely as-
sociated with presentations rather than texts to be read, there is no reason why
it cannot be the source for text production. Indeed, the journal Kairos regularly
publishes webtexts written using Prezi software. The advantages of Prezi texts (here-
after just Prezi) are that they offer a blank, "unbounded" space in which writing,
images, audio, hyperlinks and video can be arranged. A chief affordance is the ease
with which textual components can be positioned spatially and juxtaposed with
one another; such visual organization is rather more constrained by mainstream
blogging software. Furthermore, Prezis are technically easy to write and the author
can offer multiple pathways through the text or none, leaving the reader to explore
the digital space. The drawbacks with a Prezi are that the dialogic opportunities
and practices associated with blogs are less evident and it is not really designed for
extensive linking with other hypertexts.

    Nevertheless, there is a certain writerly openness afforded by Prezi: there are no
margins or pages--just screenspace. As Lillis (2011) drawing on Lipking suggests,
in printed texts, there is a "danger of fixing the boundaries of our thinking to those
of the published page ..." Digital academic texts have the potential to disrupt our
ways of making arguments and describing ideas. They can foreground space and
process, and they are often characterized by a lack of closure. They challenge what
Lillis calls a textual "unity" and what David Kolb refers to as a "single ply" argu-
ment. Digital texts have the potential to bring dimensions including positioning,
depth perception, alignment, juxtaposition, distance, and screen position, among
others, to meaning making.

                                                                                                    319

MODALITY--DISRUPTIVE AND TRANSFORMATIVE

    As has been suggested elsewhere, one of the defining qualities of digital writing
is the capacity to create multimodal texts (Bayne, 2010; McKenna, 2012; McKen-
na & McAvinia, 2011). Students have suggested that the ability to introduce imag-
es, audio and animation enables them to knowingly disrupt and playfully subvert
the conventions of academic writing and to introduce humour, irony and shifts in
voice that they otherwise would not have considered to be appropriate in academic
texts (McKenna & McAvinia, 2011).

    However, for some students, engaging in this type of work prompts fundamen-
tal questions about what constitutes academic texts and practices. (For example, do
online texts have conclusions? Who is your audience?) Writing in digital spaces has
the potential to throw into relief textual features and reading and writing practices
that are largely invisible with more conventional essayistic work. As Gunther Kress
(2010a) has observed, multimodality shows us the limitations and "boundedness of
language." And beyond that, multimodality offers new and different opportunities
for academic meaning making: "There are domains beyond the reach of language,
where it is insufficient, where semiotic-conceptual work has to be and is done by
means of other modes" (Kress, 2010a). The implication of this work and that of
others, such as Lillis, is that digital texts may help "liberate" writers from the "struc-
tures of print" (Claire Lauer, 2012). Similarly, Delagrange (2009a) speaking of
creating her digital Wunderkammer describes, how, in early iterations of the work,
the written text literally and functionally "overwhelmed" the visual components of
the work. The process of redesigning and rebalancing the work caused her to recon-
ceptualize the topic, and she makes the point that, particularly when working with
visual material, the very act of creating multimodal, digital texts creates a change in
intellectual interpretation, argument and rhetorical approach.

SPACE, ORGANIZATION AND MAKING ARGUMENTS

    A strong consideration when writing digital texts is the rhetorical function of
spatial organization (and disorganization). In these texts, design is a mode: it is
critical to meaning-making and has rhetorical requirements: layout, screen design,
sizing; the positioning and presentation of elements all contribute to meaning mak-
ing (Kress 2010b). Of course, this is not to say that design does not have a semantic
role in conventional texts; however, I would argue that there are many fewer restric-
tions in digital writing, and much more scope to use spaces, gaps and other design
elements. Additionally, digital texts enable multiple lines of argument or discussion
to co-exist. Within individual sections of text or animation, a certain idea might
be developed, but instead of an emphasis upon transitions sustaining a narrative
line across an entire piece, a writer can represent the complexity of a web of ideas

320
                                                                              Digital Writing as Transformative

through a digital text, drawing on a mix of modes:

         It would be misleading to claim that all exposition and argument
         could and should be presented simply and clearly. Often that is
         the best way, but ... sometimes complex hypertext presentations
         would increase self-awareness, make important contextual con-
         nections and present concepts and rhetorical gestures that refuse
         to be straightforward and single-ply. (David Kolb, 2008)

    One such rhetorical gesture is juxtaposition. Digital texts enable juxtaposition
of sections of writing, image, video (among other modes) on many levels: the posi-
tioning within the frame of a screen, through hyperlinks, through pop-up anima-
tion, to name a few. With a digital environment such as Prezi, the sense of juxtapo-
sition can be extended with the simulation of a 3D space; a reader can zoom into
the text to reveal items seemingly located underneath texts on a particular screen.
Or, they can zoom out, revealing "super" layers of writing, imagery, animation that
appears to sit above a portion of the text. Perspective, as well as positioning can
therefore be a feature of juxtaposition. (In accordance with Kress's statement above
about the boundedness of language, this rhetorical device is much better illustrated
in the digital than on paper).

    For Lillis (2011) juxtaposition is a transformative literacy practice that enables
alternative ways of articulating academic knowledge including the enhancement
of the single argumentative line with extra layers of "information, description and
embedded argumentation." Additionally, juxtaposition introduces the potential for
a multivocal approach to academic writing, with juxtaposed texts in dialogue with
one another, thus enabling linguistic and modal variety (Lillis, 2011). Set out in
this way, the practices and features of juxtaposition that Lillis values (plurality of
genre, tone, mode and discourse) are frequently features afforded in digital text
making. In earlier research (McKenna & McAvinia, 2011) we found that students,
almost without exception, used juxtaposition and multimodality in this way when
they were given the opportunity to write hypertext assignments.

    More recently, Bayne has spoken of the liberating impact of offering her MSc
students the option of writing "digital essays." The students use virtual worlds,
blogs, video and hypertext to create digital texts which are experimental and unsta-
ble. She argues that through this work, students are able to interrogate the writing
subject and that there is generally an enhanced awareness of the power relations
between reader/writer. The texts are multimodal, disjointed, and often subversive,
but they are sophisticated, provocative and stimulating (Bayne, 2012). Both the
awareness of power as a feature of academic writing, as well as an awareness of the
authorial self are prominent themes of the academic literacies research, particularly
work by Mary Lea and Brian Street (1998), Roz Ivanic (1998) and Lillis (2001).
Digital texts are useful in enacting these concepts in both practice and theory.

                                                                                                    321
McKenna

    Additionally, Bayne's account suggests the transformative impact of engaging
with multimodality and radically different opportunities for textual organization
that digital texts have on authors: conventional literacy practices are defamiliarised
and writers are potentially awakened to new possibilities for knowledge making. As
one student writer told the author: "It [digital writing] does disturb the standard
writing practices .... I definitely felt that in the hypertext I could not carry on writ-
ing like I did in the essay' (McKenna & McAvinia, 2011). We might ask wheth-
er a similar disruption is achieved through the publication of academics' digital
scholarly work which disrupts the "normative stances towards meaning makings"
(Lillis, 2011) that tend to operate in the academy. For example, Lauer (2011) citing
Marshall McLuhan, writes about experiencing a "hybrid energy" when combining
images and audio in a digital text, that enabled her to reflect more deeply and
differently on her topic. Delagrange, too, observes that it is "impossible to over-
state" the impact upon her argument and analysis of working in a digital space and
attending to design, coding, screen organization and the integration (and disloca-
tion) of different modes (2009a).

CONCLUSIONS: DIGITAL TEXTS
AND ACADEMIC LITERACIES

    Both digital texts (with their discontinuities and instabilities) and the associ-
ated practices (such as the dialogic interaction between reader and writer and the
experimentation with new academic genres) are examples of academic literacies
in action. Lillis suggests that the multivocal, dialogic academic text contests the
primacy of the essayistic, monologic approach to writing that still is dominant in
higher education. In her extension of the academic literacies framework (2003) she
identifies dialogism as a literacy goal, and there is no doubt that digital texts and
their related practices would sit comfortably in extended sections of her framework,
particularly in the way that they make visible and challenge official and unofficial
"discourse practices" (Lillis, 2003). Whereas Lillis asks "what are the implications
for pedagogy?", this paper extends the question to ask what are the implications for
professional academic writing?

    Another component of the academic literacies framework foregrounded by
digital writing is textual production. Textual production--in this case digital cre-
ation and publication--encompasses issues of power, modality, and writing as a
social practice. Indeed a consideration of production highlights a potential point
of fracture between institutional structures (publishers, universities) and writers.
As many have observed, the academy is rooted in print literacy (Bayne, 2010;
Goodfellow, 2011; Goodfellow & Lea, 2007; Colleen McKenna & JaneHughes,
2013), with its inherent and symbolic stability and fixity. Print-based texts are

more easily controlled--both in terms of acceptance for publication and reader
access--than digital ones are. The print "industry" supports a preservation of the
status quo in terms of financial and quality models. And so, while I have been
exploring the disruptive and potentially subversive features of digital writing from
a rhetorical perspective, I feel they are also potentially disruptive from an institu-
tional perspective: allowing scholars to cultivate an identity and readership that is
much less easily regulated by a university, discipline or publisher. Beyond this, it
is worth bearing in mind Delagrange's observation that the production of digital
texts is a "powerful heuristic in its own right" (2009a).

    As more academic texts are published in online spaces, pressure will build for
institutions to acknowledge the merit of the digital, both for students and aca-
demics. That is not to say that I think that conventional essays/articles/books will
be displaced, because as suggested above, these new texts are often doing different
types of intellectual work. Rather, we will have a wider range of genres and readers
as well as a richer understanding about how knowledge can be articulated and
read. As suggested above, a notable journal in this regard is Kairos (http://kairos.
technorhetoric.net/about.html) which publishes refereed "webtexts" (the journal's
term) ranging from recognizable, "conventional" papers that have been format-
ted to enable easy navigation to more experimental forms including powerpoint,
webpages, videos, and Prezi documents. Kairos is designed to be read online and a
founding principle was that a discussion of new forms of writing ought to be con-
ducted in the forms themselves: "As we are discovering the value of hypertextual
and other online writing, it is not only important to have a forum for exploring
this growing type of composition, but it is essential that we have a webbed forum
within which to hold those conversations." (Mick Docherty, n.d.) Beyond such a
forum, the value of digital discourse--which often displays a richness and diversity
of resources that get flattened in the process of making monologic texts--should be
acknowledged in the broader academic community.

    Digital academic texts offer new opportunities for modality, spatial organiza-
tion, reader-writer relationships and text production and distribution. Not only
can academic literacies provide a useful frame through which to view such writing
but, in return, such texts may help extend the literacies model. Beyond that, the
social practices around production, distribution and reception of digital texts offer
fertile ground for future academic literacies research.

NOTES

1. The "naming" of these sorts of texts is still relatively fluid (Lauer, 2012). In this
paper, I am using the terms "digital writing" and "digital texts" to refer to academic
work that is multimodal, created and distributed online, and which resists being easily
"published in nondigital form" Delagrange (2009a).

LOOKING AT ACADEMIC LITER-
ACIES FROM A COMPOSITION
FRAME:
FROM SPATIAL TO SPATIO-TEMPO-
RAL FRAMING OF DIFFERENCE

      Bruce Horner in conversation with Theresa Lillis

        Bruce Horner is a professor of rhetoric and composition at the University
        of Louisville. His work takes place within the context of US Composition.
        In this extract from a longer and ongoing conversation about connections
        between "Academic Literacies" and "Composition" and, in particular what is
        meant by transformation, Bruce explores what he sees as a key challenge--
        how to define and engage with the notion of "difference" in academic writing.

Bruce: A key challenge for us is how to engage with "difference." Scholars of "aca-
demic literacies" commonly conceive of difference in three ways: as a characteristic
of its subject of inquiry--"academic literac-ies"; as a defining characteristic of the
"new" students enrolling in higher education through programmes of massifica-
tion; and as a goal--transformation (see Theresa Lillis & Mary Scott, 2007).

Theresa: When you say scholars of Academic literacies are you talking about "Aca-
demic literacies" as a specific field of work, linked mainly to the United Kingdom, or
are you including work on writing from a range of contexts--like "basic writing"?1

Bruce: I use "academic literacies" to refer to a "critical field of inquiry with specific
theoretical and ideological historical roots and interests" (Lillis & Scott 2007, p. 7),
and more specifically an approach grounded in Brian Street's (1984) "ideological"
model of literacy as social practice and as seeking to involve a "transformative"
rather than "normative" stance towards existing academic literacy practices. But I
would also include in "Academic Literacies," US work--mine too--that arises out
of disciplinary traditions of literary study and cultural theory and in the United
States context often located in the institutional and pedagogical site of "Compo-
sition."

    In general, I think all of us working with academic writing--whatever the spe-

                                                                                                    327
Horner with Lillis

cific institutional or geopolitical location--need to be wary about slippages in how
we think about difference. Such slippage may limit how we understand the goal of
transformation and how that goal is to be achieved in the teaching of, or about, ac-
ademic writing and literacy practices. In that slippage, differences among literacies,
including academic literacies, come to be conflated with differences among stu-
dents, and then these differences are identified with specific textual forms--often
in terms of whether these are recognizably conventional or not.

Theresa: By "specific textual forms" would you for example mean specific uses of
language? Specific languages? Specific levels of formality (or use of language often
associated more with spoken language than written language)? Specific clusters of
rhetorical conventions?

Bruce: The problem is complicated because any one of these levels of language--
lexicon, syntax, register, organization--as well as notational practices more gener-
ally, can be claimed as nonconventional and that lack of conventionality identified
with the (student) writer's social identity. While this is preferable to identifying
such ostensible breaks with convention as evidence of cognitive lack or patholo-
gy, it assumes and reinforces a stability to what constitutes conventional academic
writing while ignoring the role of the reader in producing a sense of convention-
ality or its obverse when reading, and likewise assumes a stability to the social and
linguistic identity of the student writer that also ignores the mediating role of writ-
ing (and reading--Joseph Williams' 1981 essay on "The Phenomenology of Error
is still one of the best accounts of this).

    One recent version is where what are recognized, and known to be recognized,
as instances of code-meshing--e.g., the insertion of representations of African
American Vernacular English (AAVE) in academic essays whose lexicon and regis-
ter are conventionally formal--are fetishized as in themselves doing transformative
work. This shifts attention away from what might be said to assigning special status
to specific techniques of saying. For example, Geneva Smitherman's (2000) inser-
tion into her academic writing of features readers will identify as AAVE is hailed as
in itself doing transformative work. This ignores the actual transformative import
of what she is saying, and also overlooks the way in which her use of such features
signals, primarily, her status as an established academic scholar--it is, after all, only
those with low status who are expected to "watch their language."

Theresa: I understand the potential dangers and I'd probably have used the word
reification rather than fetishization but think fetishization brings a useful nuance
here. But I must say I am sympathetic to the attempt to disrupt strongly regu-
lated production--and reception practices--and I think Smitherman's mixing or
meshing actually adds power to the arguments she is making--in other words the

328

form is not just for form's sake but has an epistemological purpose too. I also think
scholars who try to illustrate how mixing might work in their own writings can be
caught in a double bind here: if they try to play (for pleasure and fun as well as for
serious academic purposes) with resources, they can be accused of using their status
to get away with this; but if the same scholars encouraged students to play, without
doing so in their own work, they'd be accused of making those with lesser power
take responsibility for transforming the academy. I also think that you're overstat-
ing the power that scholarly status confers. As we know from our work on writing
for publication (Theresa Lillis & Mary Jane & Curry, 2010), scholarly status--and
how the language/s used--varies considerably within global scholarly hierarchies.

Bruce: I take your point about published scholarly writing. The danger for me,
which you suggest, is in the tendency to argue for pedagogies that advocate "mix-
ing" of forms as a goal in and of itself, which redirects our energies, and those of
our students, in less useful directions: formal experimentation for formal experi-
mentation's sake, outside and ignoring issues of context, including power relations,
and purpose. More generally, I'm concerned about the slippage between people and
forms. This slippage manifests in the use of a spatial framework whereby students,
writing, and specific literacy practices are located in terms of relations of proximity,
overlap, and hierarchy. Transformation is then understood in terms of resistance,
challenges, or opposition to those relations: "importing" literacy practices belong-
ing to one domain to another; challenging hierarchies among these practices by,
say, granting legitimacy to those deemed subordinate or "vernacular"; multiplying
writers' repertoire of practices, and identities; or deviating from the conventions
and practices deemed "appropriate" to a given domain.

Theresa: I agree that there's always a danger of talking as if domains are hermeti-
cally sealed from each other--as if the "academic" domain were separate complete-
ly from the "home" domain (and I'd guess we'd need to carefully consider how
we construct "home"). But I'm assuming that you aren't saying that we shouldn't
question the dominant/conventionalized practices that have come to be defaults in
specific domains, such as academia? I would be surprised if this were the case given
what I know of your work--you challenge the institutional deficit positioning of
students who are labeled as "basic writers" (Bruce Horner & Min Zhan Lu, 1999)
and in your work on a translingual approach (Horner et al., 2011)) seem to be
calling for us (teachers, readers, writers,) to rethink the ways in which we approach
texts that look "different" in some way.

Bruce: That's right, though I'd put it somewhat differently now than I may have
previously. What I think we most need to challenge, especially at the pedagogical
level, is the stability itself of those dominant/conventionalized practices. We can
and should teach these practices as historical rather than fixed. So whatever prac-

                                                                                                    329
Horner with Lillis

tices student writers (and everyone else) opt to participate in on a given occasion
should be questioned, whether those practices are identified with the dominant or
conventional or not. Many of us (especially those involved in basic writing) have
been focused on rethinking practices identified as different from such dominant/
conventionalized ways, and often to defend the logic of these different practices,
we've tended to engage in a peculiar textualism locating practices spatially but not
temporally, hence as fixed rather than contingent in significance.

    Min-Zhan Lu's chapter, "Professing Multiculturalism," in our book Represent-
ing the "Other" (1999) best exemplifies our position. The example discussed there
of a student who first wrote "can able to" to express having both the ability and
permission to do something, then revised this to "may be able to" shows a writer
exhibiting agency in both instances. As Min argues, "can able to" should be probed
for its logic rather than being dismissed as a simple grammatical error (though error
is always a possibility). Writers can then consider whether to maintain that more
idiosyncratic usage or a more conventional usage, aware that either decision carries
risks and rewards.

    For me there are two difficulties arising from adopting a spatial framework for
understanding difference in academic (and other) literacies, students, and their
literacy practices: first, such a framework appears to grant greater stability, inter-
nal uniformity, and a discrete character to the various kinds of literacies, litera-
cy practices, and student identities than is warranted; and second, active writerly
agency comes to be identified strictly with writers' recognizable deviations from
these (thereby) stabilized practices. This poses a dilemma to teachers pursuing
transformation of seeming to have to choose between either "inducting" students
into dominant literacy practices--to allow for students' individual academic and
economic survival--or encouraging students to resist the restrictions of these con-
ventions, thereby putting their academic and economic futures at risk. The fact that
requiring production of dominant writing conventions appears to align pedagogy
with the (for many, discredited) ideology of the autonomous model of literacy
(Brian Street, 1984), and the fact that the students concerned are likely to be from
historically subordinated populations, and thus in most need of improvement to
their economic situations, make this dilemma particularly acute.

Theresa: I agree that it would be irresponsible for teachers to tell students to resist
conventions when using such conventions is central to success--to passing exams,
to being recognized seriously as a student. But does anyone actually do this, par-
ticularly within disciplinary based spaces? Although I've argued--both implicitly
and explicitly--that a wide range of textual forms (at the level of sentence level
grammars, vocabulary, modes, languages) should be encouraged and debated in the
academy, as a teacher, working with undergraduates and postgraduates in my field

330
                                                                                                      Reflections 4

(applied and social linguistics), I make students aware of the rules of the game and
the consequences of not using these. In some instances, there are opportunities for
me to open up default conventions--for example when I'm setting and assessing
assignments--but as often--and for writing teachers working at the edges of disci-
plinary spaces--this is often not possible.

Bruce: I think you're right that few teachers encourage students to avoid conven-
tional academic conventions in their writing. But the terms for using these--often
couched as "following conventions"--are often paltry and bleak: "do it to get by,"
to survive. That approach leaves the actual contingent nature of deploying specific
forms unquestioned: curiously, again conventional language gets a pass, its signif-
icance treated as a given rather than subjected to genuine questioning. And our
textualist bias leads to a conflation of notational difference with social or concep-
tual difference. Clearly there are times when breaks with conventional language are
demanded insofar as that language stands in the way of conceptualization--neol-
ogisms like translingualism are a case in point. But I suspect that rejection of work
on grounds of its breaks with conventional language is often a cover to reject that
work because of the conceptual challenges it poses (as I think some of the cases in
your 2010 book with Mary Jane Curry illustrate).

    I guess what I'm saying is that we need to shift our metaphors or frameworks
so that we don't get caught up in only ever recognizing transformation as some-
thing that is marked as different in the academy--or only ever recognizing value
in forms our training leads us to recognize as "different." That would seem merely
to flip, while reinforcing, binary oppositions of the conventional/unconventional
while retaining an attribution of stable significance to form alone, treated in reified
fashion. A US example of a scholar's efforts to grapple with the confines of the
spatial framework in pursuing the goal of transformation is an essay by David Bar-
tholomae, "The Tidy House: Basic Writing in the American Curriculum" (1993),
frequently cited as calling for the abolition of a separate curricular space to teach
students deemed "basic writers," i.e., those deemed unprepared to produce post-
secondary-level writing. (see Horner, 1999a, pp. 192-193.) Bartholomae invokes
Mary Louise Pratt's now well-known concept of the "contact zone" to counter what
he sees as the tendency of basic writing programmes to "bridge AND preserve cul-
tural difference, to enable students to enter the `normal' curriculum but to insure,
at the same time, that there are basic writers" (1993, p. 8). The problem, he sees, is
that "the profession has not been able to think beyond an either/or formulation--
either academic discourse or the discourse of the community; either argument or
narrative; either imitation or expression" (Bartholomae, 1993, p. 324). To counter
this, he calls for making "the contact between conventional and unconventional
discourses the most interesting and productive moment for a writer or for a writing

                                                                                                    331

course" (Bartholomae, 1993, p. 19).
    The focus on points of contact promises to allow for the possibility of inter-

action among conflicting beliefs and practices. However, the spatial framework
invoked (the "space" of the contact zone where, in Pratt's words, "cultures meet,
clash, and grapple with one another" (Pratt, 1991) risks reinforcing, by assuming,
the stability of the distinctions that Bartholomae aims to challenge: (basic/normal;
conventional/unconventional; different/normal). Thus whereas his critique begins
by complaining of difference as a product of the basic/normal framework, he ends
up advocating a curriculum that retains the notion of students as different, but that
adopts a strategy of their integration, rather than segregation. As critics have since
complained, the interaction to be advanced is difficult to imagine.

    If Bartholomae's work simply illustrates the continuing limitations a spatial
framework imposes on thinking about differences and pedagogies of transforma-
tion, another example, Roz Ivanic and colleagues' UK study Improving Learning in
College: Rethinking Literacies Across the Curriculum (2009) directly addresses such
limitations. Ivanic et al.'s study initially focused on the ways in which students'
"everyday" literacy practices might interact with and support their learning of the
literacies required in their college courses, and therefore explored the possible "in-
terface" between and among these different literacies associated with different "`do-
mains' of students" lives (2009, pp. 1-2), the "`border literacy practices' and `border
crossing' of literacy practices from the everyday to college" (pp. 22-23). However,
Ivanic et al. ended up calling into question the "ways in which `context,' `domain,'
`site,' and `setting' are conceptualized" (2009, p. 23) and, as well, the associated
metaphors of "boundaries and borders, and of boundary zones, boundary objects
and border-crossing" (pp. 23, 24). Ultimately, they concluded that such metaphors,
"inscribed in the method we had used to collect the data" about literacy practices,
led to a "static two-dimensionality about the Venn-diagram representations and
mapped spaces which follow from talk of `borders' and `border-crossings,'" ren-
dering "the concept of `border literacies'" "untenable" (Ivanic et al., 2009, p. 172):
"we had assumed a border space, but as we moved to bordering as a practice rather
than identifying border literacy practices as entities, we saw that the relationship
between domains and practices was more complex and messy: they co-emerge" (p.
172). As Ivanic (2009) has observed elsewhere, "`whole' literacy practices ... cannot
be recontextualized wholesale into educational settings because the social domain
changes the practice" (p. 114).

Theresa: I can see the problems with setting boundaried framings around lan-
guage, writing, and semiotic practices, but isn't it also the case that the assessment
of student writing in the various disciplines that make up the academy tends to
be driven by quite rigid notions and ideologies about what counts as acceptable

332
                                                                                                      Reflections 4

discourse which is monolithic and monologic in nature? In other words, quite rigid
boundaries exist which student-writers (and teachers) constantly bump up against
rather than being given opportunities to interact with. Isn't the writing space of
"Composition" very different?

Bruce: Yes, you're right. One of the privileges of working in composition in the
United States, at least for many of us, is that the composition course, even the re-
quired first-year composition course, for all its problems, remains a "special writing
space," with instructors given significant say in assessment, as opposed to writing
in other sites--one reason I oppose moves to abolish that course. I sense you're
pointing to the need to direct our energies more to our colleagues outside writ-
ing studies (broadly conceived) and to the public. You've argued elsewhere (Lillis,
2013) that while we might rightly reject commonplace ways of valuing writing in
terms of its ostensible "correctness," that does not absolve us of the responsibility
for (and the inevitability of ) arguing for some kind of valuation of writing. So we
might direct our energies towards discussing these other ways of valuing writing:
for example, its level of engagement, conceptual heft, accuracy, and so on. These are
values that our academic colleagues, as well as the public, might well already share.
Here I think I'm simply echoing your argument (Lillis, 2013) that we advocate for
our own values in language use, as against prescriptivist grammar values invoked as
ideologically neutral "standards."

    Rethinking our metaphorical framings here, I think a temporal-spatial frame-
work--rather than just a spatial one--might allow a conceptualization of differ-
ence and transformation that is both more readily within the reach of ourselves and
our students, and at least potentially of greater consequence. It might help resolve
the dilemma those pursuing transformation of academic literacies face of seeming
to have to ask students to choose between submitting to dominant conventions in
their writing or deviating from these at the risk of academic failure; and it radically
challenges key features of the ideology of the autonomous model of literacy against
which those taking an academic literacies approach are set. I attribute the fact that
we typically do not recognize differences in temporality as differences, or as making
a difference and accomplishing transformation, to the continuing operation of that
ideology in our dispositions to language. I'm thinking of Pierre Bourdieu's caution
that language ideology has "nothing in common with an explicitly professed, de-
liberate and revocable belief, or with an intentional act of accepting a `norm.' It
is inscribed, in a practical state, in dispositions which are impalpably inculcated,
through a long and slow process of acquisition, by the sanctions of the linguistic
market" (Bourdieu, 1991[1982], p. 51)

Theresa: I think the dichotomy may be overstated--I wouldn't see it as choosing

                                                                                                    333
Horner with Lillis

between submitting to dominant conventions in writing or deviating from these
at the risk of academic failure--I think it`s more about focusing on the cracks be-
tween practices, allowing some of the forms to come through IF they enable writers
to work at the kinds of knowledges that they want to work and towards what they
want to mean. For me it's about increasing the range of discourses and semiotic
resources that it's permissible to use in the academy. Obvious examples come to
mind are the use of vernacular forms that you mentioned already--or I guess more
precisely, the use of what have come to be defined as "vernacular" forms. But what
does a focus on temporality get us? Or help us to avoid?

Bruce: My sense is that we should shift our emphasis from what is permitted or
allowed in language (and media) to a focus on what we and our students might
and should be attempting to work at in their compositional work (broadly con-
strued). This focus on temporality gives us the ability to recognize students' agency
as writers, and its deployment both when they iterate what seem to be convention-
al, "permitted" forms and when they deploy forms that are identified as breaking
with convention. Pedagogically, that's a crucial advantage. This focus would cer-
tainly expand the range of discourses and semiotic resources under consideration,
but I worry that framing the issue in terms of those resources in themselves, and
which ones will be allowed, gets us sidetracked into 1) thinking about these as
stable entities with inherent values, rather than focusing on what we might want
to accomplish and why, and 2) mistaking dominant definitions of conventional
resources and their meanings for all that has been, is, and might be accomplished
in their guise. Of course, the material social conditions limiting access to and uses
of particular resources would also come up for investigation. To bring it closer to
home, in terms of languages, a translingual approach that my colleagues and I have
argued for works against both conventional multilingualism and monolingualism:
neither "English" as conventionally defined nor the usual proffered alternatives ad-
equately represent what we have to work with. We are always instead writing "in
translation," in Alastair Pennycook's terms (2010), even when appearing to write
"in English."

    To reiterate, a focus on temporality helps us to recognize the exercise of writerly
agency even in iterations of what we are ideologically disposed to misrecognize as
simply more of "the same," rather than identifying such agency only with what we
are disposed to recognize as deviations from an ostensibly "same" practice. Musical
iteration perhaps best illustrates this: a "repeat" of the same phrase in a melody (e.g.,
standard blues tunes) is both the same as what is repeated and, by virtue of follow-
ing the first iteration of that phrase, different in temporal location and significance,
which is why it is not typically heard as an unwitting mistake. From this perspec-
tive, difference is an inevitable characteristic of iteration rather than exceptional

or alternative. Applied to writing, the question of difference and transformation is
thus no longer whether to allow previously excluded difference to "enter" the aca-
demic sphere in order to achieve its transformation. Instead, it is a question of what
kinds of difference and transformation to pursue, given their inevitability. From
this perspective, such phenomena as hybridity and translation would be seen not as
exceptions but part of the unacknowledged norm, as would the changes to practices
arising from their re-location to "different" domains about which Ivanic remarked.
With difference recognized as the norm, any apparent "sameness" would need to be
accounted for as emerging products of practices. Iterations would be understood not
as reproducing the "same" but, rather, as contributing to the ongoing sedimentation,
or building up, over time, of language practices and the "context" of their iteration
(Pennycook, 2010, p. 125). Context here would be understood as in co-constitutive
relation to utterances and speaker identity, and, as in exchanges between colonizer
and colonized, as creating new meanings and new relationships between meanings,
with the potential to undermine the status and distinction of the dominant and
transform the identities of all the participants (Homi Bhabha, 1985; Pennycook,
2010, p. 44; Pratt 1991).

Theresa: So, in pedagogical terms--what does it mean to adopt a spatio-temporal
framework rather than just a spatial one? How would a shift in framework shape
the work of a teacher of writing (in a separate writing space) or of a discipline in
which students are doing writing?

Bruce: I think it would mean calling into genuine question (with one possible
answer being to confirm) the aims and effects of any iteration. For example, what
might iteration of an ostensible deviation from or reproduction of conventional
discourse seem to accomplish for a writer and particular readers, how, and why, and
so on. If we assume difference as an inevitability rather than an option, we change
our question from one asking whether to allow difference in writing to asking what
kind of difference to attempt to make in our writing, how and why. In posing such
questions, teachers would in effect be assuming not their preference for a "contact
zone" pedagogy or the need to introduce difference into the classroom but, rather,
recognizing the classroom as always already a site of differences, "contact" or, bet-
ter, relocalizing of practices: differences would be identifiable not as characteristics
students (or their teachers) have brought to the classroom, or introduced there, but
rather as always emerging products of specific reading and writing practices. Like
the "errors" commonly, if mistakenly, seen as simply introduced by students "into"
writing, differences are in fact "social achievements" resulting from interactions
between readers and writers (see Horner 1999b, pp. 140-144). So, if students select
to iterate conventional discursive forms, those can and should be put to question,

                                                                                                    335

just as iterations of ostensible breaks with these should be. And of course, given the
contingent and interdependent relationship between context and discourse, these
would be genuine questions for the students and the teacher.

                  SECTION 4
 TRANSFORMING INSTITUTIONAL
FRAMINGS OF ACADEMIC WRITING
INTRODUCTION TO SECTION 4

    Many chapters in this book make reference to the ways in which literacy prac-
tices are shaped by institutional factors but in this section questions of transforma-
tive possibility within normative institutional frames are foregrounded. The chap-
ters take a look at how particular institutional contexts shape and influence what
can and cannot be said about--or count as--academic writing, what its purposes
are seen to be, and how it is experienced by those who produce it. Whilst they
point to practical and conceptual difficulties in challenging institutional norms and
expectations around academic writing, the chapters also record instances of where
successful outcomes--transformations--have been, or might become, possible.

    Corinne Boz describes a project at the University of Cambridge, United King-
dom, which succeeded in shifting work to help bridge students' transition from
school to university away from a focus on the skills of students and onto the ped-
agogical practices of tutors. In doing so the project sought to transform first the
dominant institutional framing of writing as a problem of student underprepared-
ness, and second, the apprenticeship model of teaching in which questions of dis-
course are left under-articulated and assumed to be acquired largely through social-
ization alone. Boz observes that the project contributed to a new visibility in the
institution for issues around teaching and student transition. Tutors who took part
found themselves better equipped to discuss their expectations of disciplinary writ-
ing and at the same time experienced the benefits of engaging in dialogue around
teaching--something hitherto not prevalent or valued in a system based on teach-
ing through individual tutorials.

    Another university initiative designed to make writing visible is described by
Lawrence Cleary and Íde O'Sullivan, who were charged with setting up a Writing
Centre at the University of Limerick, Ireland. To achieve this institutional trans-
formation they drew on influences from Academic Literacies and New Rhetoric,
creating the Centre as an institutional resource that would help students to recog-
nize the situated nature of disciplinary language and to exercise their own critical
agency as producers of various kinds of text. At the same time an emphasis on the
"composing process" would offer the individual possibilities for "perpetual transfor-
mation" of meanings, values and the self. To show how these Writing Centre goals
play out in practice, Cleary and O'Sullivan take us through a strand of teaching in
first year Engineering that moves from close comparative and historical analyses of
textual features to a discussion of language and rhetoric's role in creating authority
and identity for the writer.

    Cleary and O'Sullivan describe the setting up of their Centre as a "political act,"
that is, a principled intervention in the status quo based on certain choices. Other

                                                                                                    341

chapters describe similarly political moves. The Research Training Event series de-
veloped by the British Association for Lectures in English for Academic Purposes
(BALEAP- currently also referred to as Global Forum for English for Academic
Purposes Professionals), and described by Lia Blaj-Ward in her chapter, draws on
Academic Literacies thinking to further the BALEAP goal of equipping and sup-
porting EAP lecturers to become active researchers of their practice. The series is
motivated by a recognition of the way in which the institutional positionings of
EAP teachers' influence and limit the opportunities they have to conduct research,
and it seeks to redress this. The rationale for the work contains a recognition that
developing the status and self-awareness of EAP practitioners is a professional im-
perative if they are not simply to serve, but also to shape, global, governmental and
institutional agendas around the international student experience.

    The agency and institutional positioning of the writing teacher is the subject
of Joan Turner's chapter also. While noting her institution's official claim to offer
students a "transformative experience," her focus is on the "thornier" challenge
of transforming institutional conceptions and expectations--here specifically in
relation to proofreading. She reproduces a dialogue with a colleague that begins
to nudge these understandings and expectations towards greater reflexivity and
critique. Although she makes no claim to have fully achieved "transformation"
through this encounter, Turner nevertheless contends that engaging in such dia-
logues within the institution should represent an important dimension of the work
of the academic literacies practitioner.

    How writing is framed institutionally is frequently a reflection of and response
to wider agenda, national and international. In their chapter, Angels Oliva-Gir-
bau and Marta Milian Gubern, explore the complex framings of what it means to
write academically in a Catalan University that needs to comply with the Bologna
process. They explain how they created an introductory course that aimed to equip
students to write in genres of academic English and at the same time to exercise
critical caution about such genres and the diminution and downgrading of expres-
sions of knowing within their own Catalan language and culture. They reflect on
the difficulty of maintaining these two aims at once, particularly the difficulty of
engaging students in "contestation." They report that students were most likely
to comply with a sense of English as the "language of prestige," and to embrace
"Anglo-American academic genres as the solution to their communication issues,"
making their transformations as learners towards rather than away from the norma-
tive. The chapter sharply highlights what's at stake in such a process of assimilation
from the perspective of a minority language.

    The power of contextual framings and dominant ideologies is also looked at in
Catalina Neculai's discussion of the possibilities for writing that are opened up and
closed down by the neo-liberal agenda in UK Higher Education. She describes how
the "calculative, market-driven spirit" of her modern university has created an em-

342

ployability curriculum which is instrumental in its motivations. At the same time,
however, she argues that this curriculum provides spaces and visibility for more
humanistically-inclined teaching of writing. So whilst the discourse of employabil-
ity frames writing at an institutional--and arguably, sectoral--level, it is possible,
she argues, for smaller groupings or individuals to exercise less compliant forms of
agency. Further, Neculai argues that teaching academic writing as a discipline--"a
functional field with its own meta-codes, discourses and community of practice"--
is a way of transforming its status from "service" to "subject."

    In contrast, perhaps, the "cautionary tale" which Kelly Peake and Sally Mitchell
have to tell restates the difficulties of working meaningfully with writing where
institutional framings identify it as a deficiency of skill that can be overcome. They
describe their attempt to bridge sectoral boundaries by working with secondary
schools on students' writing, detailing how, in order to access funding streams and
institutional agendas, they had to work directly with students and with autono-
mous understandings of and approaches to writing--and language more gener-
ally--as well as with the dominant logic surrounding progression from school to
university. They argue that the limited success of their enterprise came from work-
ing with, rather than challenging these understandings. A more genuinely trans-
formative approach, they conclude, needs to involve work with teachers, exploring
and developing their practices in order to understand and enhance the experiences
of their students. Peake and Mitchell note the irony of reaching this conclusion,
which--but for the persistence and power of dominant framings of literacy and
deficit--they had known all along.

    Transformation then is always an ongoing ideological tussle in which assump-
tions--one's own, one's students, one's collaborators, the institution's--need to be
subject to scrutiny and discussion.

    This section includes two Reflections pieces. The first is a conversation between
Brian Street, Mary R. Lea and Theresa Lillis looking back at research which opened
up the differing perspectives of students and of teaching staff in various disciplines,
and considering the options it presented for taking a transformative stance towards
what is possible in universities. Foregrounding the importance of ethnography as a
way of making visible often taken-for-granted practices (see Sally Mitchell's com-
ments on the importance of ethnography in the Introduction to the book; see also
Reflections 2) they reflect that big institutional issues, such as access and success,
are simply not fixed by deficit-driven skills-based approaches. They maintain that it
is the impulse in Academic Literacies to question and contest that provides a basis
for constructive ways forward in transforming institutions.

    The book closes with Lucia Thesen who reminds us of how institutions are
historically and geographically located and the consequences of such locations for
the ways in which we seek to understand practice, pedagogy and theory. Thesen
explores what a transformative agenda looks like from the perspective of the global

                                                                                                    343

south. Her Reflections touch on many of the themes raised in the book whilst
engaging from the specific geohistorical location of South Africa. She foregrounds:
the experiences and desires of students from communities historically excluded
from higher education, the question of what it means to belong in academia, the
potential threats to other senses of social belonging resulting from taking part in
academia, the impact on meaning making of dominant academic literacy conven-
tions and ideologies of knowledge. In a book where many of the contributions are
from the global north, Thesen's Reflections remind us all of the need to engage
in transnational conversations and, when doing so, to acknowledge the histori-
cal specificity of our speaking positions, seeking to develop shared understandings
without masking difference.

TRANSFORMING DIALOGIC SPACES
IN AN "ELITE" INSTITUTION:
ACADEMIC LITERACIES,
THE TUTORIAL AND
HIGH-ACHIEVING STUDENTS

      Corinne Boz

    Studies of transition to higher education highlight the fact that, in higher ed-
ucation contexts in the United Kingdom, undergraduate students receive limited
one-to-one contact with academic staff. The lack of opportunity for regular, indi-
vidualized contact with teaching staff can cause feelings of alienation and confusion
about academic expectations (Anthony Cook & Janet Leckey, 1999) and can also
be responsible for a lack of knowledge/understanding on behalf of the academic
staff of students' personal/writing histories (see Ruth Whittaker, 2008). Ultimately,
problematic student transitions may lead to issues with student retention (Mark
Palmer et al., 2009). It has been argued that a more individualized educational
experience would help to support students through those initial transition issues
(Whittaker, 2008), although ever-expanding class sizes and increasing student-staff
ratios arising from the massification of higher education would seem to make this
an idealistic scenario.

    The tutorial system at the Universities of Oxford and Cambridge (Oxbridge)
affords the opportunity for close and sustained dialogue with tutors potentially pro-
viding ideal conditions for a supported and individualized transition from school
to university. Given this potential, many people are surprised to find that a project
supporting student transitions at the University of Cambridge exists at all. How-
ever, the following quotations from First Year undergraduates taken from our an-
nual Undergraduate Learning Enhancement Survey illustrate that being prepared
(Gillian Ballinger, 2003; Alan Booth, 2005; Maggie Leese, 2010), adapting to new
expectations, particularly when they are often implicit (Theresa Lillis & Joan Turner,
2001), and understanding new discourses (David Bartholomae, 1986; Tamsin Hag-
gis, 2006; Mary Lea & Brian Street, 1998) are significant challenges in our context
also, reflecting experience across the UK higher education sector more widely:

         Although I think my essay writing skills were developed suffi-
         ciently in a certain way before I arrived, I have found that the
         difference in approach and style has been great and difficult to
         adapt to. (First year student)

         I often felt that my [tutor] was talking to me as if they were
         addressing a third year, not a first year fresh out of school who
         was confronting a subject for the first time in a completely alien
         manner, and in something close to a foreign language. Of course
         there is a jump between A-level and undergraduate study, but
         I often felt as though I was expected to have made that jump
         before I reached my first [tutorial]. (First year student)

         I felt very unprepared; the only advice given prior to university
         (and indeed throughout the year!) was that "people learn in dif-
         ferent ways," without mentioning what these "ways" were. (First
         year student)

    These comments are taken from students who have been very successful at
A-level (or equivalent), they have met or exceeded academic expectations and have
therefore been able to learn and, crucially, present knowledge in the ways that have
been expected from them in their educational contexts to date. And yet, for some,
our annual surveys reveal that the transition to university learning and writing is a
greater challenge than expected.

    In this chapter, I will discuss some of the issues surrounding transitions to aca-
demic writing at university for our high-achieving students and illustrate the ways
in which we have incorporated the theoretical principles of an Academic Literacies
approach into the design and delivery of our transitions project. In addition, I will
demonstrate the ways in which the data, research and experience in our "elite" insti-
tutional context extends the boundaries of current Academic Literacies research to
represent high-achieving students who have been underrepresented by the research
to date (see Ursula Wingate & Christopher Tribble, 2012, for further discussion of
Academic Literacies' focus on "non-traditional" students). For the purpose of this
chapter, I am defining the university as "elite" in relation to its position in the world
university rankings (see Times Higher Education, 2015). In defining our students
as "high-achieving," I intend this to reflect their academic achievement at A-level.
Of those students accepted for admission in 2014, 97.3% achieved the equivalent
of A*AA or better counting only their best three A Levels (excluding General Stud-
ies and Critical Thinking) (University of Cambridge, 2015). In addition, I am con-
sciously moving away from defining students with the dichotomous "traditional/
non-traditional" label as it masks the diversity of the student population and has
become increasingly meaningless (see Elaine Keane, 2011).

                                                     Transforming Dialogic Spaces in an "Elite" Institution

CONTEXT

    The Oxbridge tutorial system is internationally renowned and commands "an
almost mystic, cult status" according to David Palfreyman (2008). In Cambridge,
the tutorial1 constitutes the core of the educational provision provided by the 31
self-regulating colleges with curriculum, lectures, and practicals being provided by
the central university via faculties and departments. Tutorials are described as fol-
lows:

         ... a medium through which students learn to work autono-
         mously, to learn with and from others, to argue and to present
         arguments, to handle problems, to question their own assump-
         tions, and to meet deadlines. (University of Cambridge, 2009)

    The tutorial is designed to allow tutors and students to discuss, explore and
learn from each other (see Paul Ashwin, 2005, for a more detailed discussion of
the Oxbridge tutorial and the qualitatively different ways in which it is perceived
by undergraduates). The number of students within a tutorial most usually ranges
from one to four or five depending on discipline and, in most cases, students will
be required to produce a piece of work for each tutorial. It is significant to note that
this tutorial work is formative and carries no summative assessment. Students are
assessed by end-of-year examinations, in most cases.

    Tutors are selected by the college and are responsible for the academic progress
of their undergraduates. They may be eminent professors or first year PhD students
and are selected for their disciplinary expertise. The system confers a large degree
of freedom on tutors in terms of their approach to teaching, and this allows them
to provide the conditions for an ideal dialogic learning situation where both tu-
tor and student work towards creating new meanings and understandings through
the process of critical discussion. The diversity of experience and pedagogical ap-
proach to teaching does, however, provide a challenge for the university in terms
of accounting for quality of teaching and ensuring parity of experience for all its
undergraduates.

    Although it can be argued that the ideal Cambridge tutorial offers dialogic
space for discussing/learning/creating subject content and knowledge, survey data
from our context demonstrates that the same focus is not always given to dialogue
around disciplinary writing practices and this can be problematic for students. In-
deed, as David Russell et al. (2009) suggest, in their broader discussion of writing
practices in HE, although the undergraduate courses of Oxford and Cambridge are
"writing intensive" they are not necessarily "writing conscious" (p. 402). Students
can find this lack of explicit writing focus challenging as they attempt to under-
stand the requirements of genre and discipline, indicating that if this essential ele-
ment is missing the dialogic situation is less than "ideal."

                                                                                                    347

THE PROJECT

    The Transkills Project was established in 2008, through the Teaching Quali-
ty Enhancement Fund (http://www.admin.cam.ac.uk/offices/education/lts/news/
ltsn17.pdf ). Occupying a collaborative space (resourced by the Education Section,
Centre for Applied Research in Educational Technologies, and Personal and Pro-
fessional Development) outside of faculty, departmental or collegiate structures, it
emerged from institutional discourses centred upon student deficit and the recog-
nition that the traditional academic socialization or apprenticeship model of writ-
ing support (see Lea & Street, 1998) might not address the needs of all students.
Dominant perceptions were that first year students were no longer able to write
on arrival at university, that this inability to write took time away from teaching
disciplinary knowledge and tutors were becoming increasingly frustrated in deal-
ing with issues that were perceived to be the responsibility of the school system.
The initial aim of the project, then, was to investigate the experiences of first year
students in their transition to undergraduate study at Cambridge and provide re-
sources to support them, acknowledging that "transition support should not be
extraneous to the mainstream activity of the institution, but integral to the learning
experience" (Whittaker, 2008, p. 3). It was also our explicit aim for the project to
support all incoming undergraduates and not just those considered to be "at risk"
(see Wingate, 2012; see for discussion of `risk', Thesen Reflections 6, this volume).
In addition, we aimed to embed a scholarly model of support firmly based on our
own institutional data and enhanced by current research into writing and transi-
tions (see Anne Pitkethly & Michael Prosser, 2001).

    In the Cambridge teaching system, texts are produced and discussed for and
within the tutorial context and so enhancing student writing practices involved the
tutorial, the tutor and the student. This engendered a move away from considering
writing as a deficiency in the students' skill set towards an Academic Literacies
perspective emphasising writing as a social practice in which meaning and text are
constructed in dialogue and relations of power are implicated. In moving away
from a traditional skills-deficit model of writing, our project became about, not
only supporting students in learning to talk about and produce effective writing
within their discipline at university, but also about developing tutors' understand-
ing of student writing practices, of the ways in which the students' practices have
been shaped by their previous A-level writing histories, and the tutor's own role
in supporting student writers in transition. It provided an opportunity to support
tutors in becoming more "writing-conscious" (Russell et al., 2009). This is where
our project began to challenge the implicit institutional framing of academic writ-
ing. It is significant to note, however, that in attempting to address the challenge
of supporting students in acquiring academic literacies, we were not attempting
to spoon-feed for, as Ronald Barnett states, "A genuine Higher Education is un-

348
                                                     Transforming Dialogic Spaces in an "Elite" Institution

settling; it is not meant to be a cosy experience. It is disturbing because ultimately,
the student comes to see that things could always be other than they are" (Barnett,
1990, p. 155).

    The design and delivery of our resources has been decided in collaboration with
"experts" familiar with the requirements of each different context and as a result
our provision has been varied in nature. However, we have found that the process
represented in Figure 25.1 is most effective in bringing about changes in both
perspective and experience and most closely reflects the principles of the Academic
Literacies framework incorporated into our approach.

          Figure 25.1: The Transkills Project--the process of creating dialogue
                            around writing beyond the tutorial.

    Figure 25.1 represents the process we have used to engage a range of faculties
and departments, spanning Arts, Humanities, Social Sciences, and Biological Sci-
ences, in enhancing writing support for first year students. Biological Sciences is
used here as an illustrative example of a process used more broadly. In the first in-
stance, we identified a group of Directors of Studies who were willing to act as a fo-
cus group. Issues raised at this initial discussion echoed the wider institutional dis-
course of student deficit with Directors of Studies highlighting the need for online
writing support resources for students. Before developing these resources, however,
the issues highlighted in the focus group discussions (see Figure 25.1) formed the
basis of a series of workshops with tutors. These workshops were open to tutors of
all levels of experience and not presented or perceived as initial "training" for new
tutors but rather an opportunity for dialogue with peers around teaching practice.

    To take into account the time pressures on academic staff, the workshops were
delivered in a blended format with participants receiving an online pre-workshop
resource in advance of a one-hour lunchtime session with a follow-up online re-
source delivered after the workshop. The pre-workshop resource was critical to the

                                                                                                    349

success of this process. Containing a short survey form, it asked participants to
respond to questions pertinent to the upcoming workshop and relating to themes
arising from the student survey data. Participant responses were then available to
the workshop facilitators in advance of the session, allowing them to tailor the ses-
sion to the specific group of people attending. This proved invaluable in ensuring
that the sessions were perceived to be relevant to both individual and disciplinary
context. The comments received via the pre-workshop package were collated and
presented back to the workshop participants in the form of visual maps which
provided an anonymized and less face-threatening way of beginning discussions
around the workshop theme.

    The outputs of the workshops, including student/tutor data, essay samples, and
other documents used, were collated and sent out as a post-workshop resource.
Significantly, however, the discussions and opinions captured at the tutor work-
shops were incorporated into designing the student workshops and online resourc-
es. As Figure 25.1 illustrates, as far as possible, the resources for staff and students
were mirrored, both centring on the same themes drawn from tutor focus groups
and student survey data (e.g., For tutors--Providing Effective Feedback /For stu-
dents--Using Feedback Effectively). Some aspects of the content were also mir-
rored: the same authentic, first-year tutorial essays were included in both tutor
and student sessions, for example. Quotations from tutors were also incorporated
into the student resources and vice versa. This "mirroring" helped the project team
to create an ongoing dialogue, a discussion around student writing outside of the
tutorial context.

    As the colleges of the university are responsible for teaching, the student work-
shops were delivered within the college rather than faculty/department. In the ini-
tial stages of the Transkills project, the project team delivered all workshops in
collaboration with colleges. Later, the project team moved towards a model of facil-
itating workshops for college teaching staff who consequently delivered workshops
to students within their own colleges. To date, 28 of the 31 colleges have been
represented at these sessions.

DISCUSSION

    In creating these new spaces for discussion of discipline-specific academic writ-
ing practices outside of the tutorial context, we provided an opportunity for tutors
to consciously consider their students' writing histories (by highlighting A-level
writing practices), to articulate their own framing of academic writing and have
this debated by peers and to consider ways in which their own teaching practices
could be adapted to support student writing in transition. Crucially, we also creat-
ed space for explicit discussion of the dialogic nature of the tutorial and examined
ways of best facilitating the types of learning situations "where pedagogic practices

350

are oriented towards making visible/challenging/playing with official and unofficial
discourse" (Lillis, 2003).

    Feedback collected from tutors, both immediately following workshops and
three to six months later, suggested that they had appreciated a focussed discussion
on the recent changes to the A-level system and the implications this had for their
teaching practice. Since attending the workshops many felt that they were better
equipped to discuss writing in tutorials. In addition to these factors, however, one
of the most common responses from the tutor feedback was that they valued the
opportunity to talk with other tutors about their tutorial practices. The space these
workshops provided has not traditionally existed within our institutional structures
but was clearly valued by participants:

         Yes my [tutorial] practice has changed since attending the work-
         shops. I have more confidence that the feedback I give students
         is constructive as I try to cover the various points covered in the
         feedback sheets supplied in the workshop i.e., structure, argu-
         ment, content etc. I have also tried to use some of the tech-
         niques suggested by other [tutors] in the workshop. (College
         tutor)

         I have definitely adapted my tutorial practices since attending
         the workshops. I now give much more specific guidance to
         students about essay writing and in particular structuring their
         essays. (College tutor)

         I found the workshops very useful and they have had an impact
         on my [tutorial] practice, primarily in terms of the type of advice
         that I give regarding essay structure .... The workshops were also
         useful in confirming some of the things that I already do in [tu-
         torials] ... and this is useful because, to some extent, we tend to
         carry out [tutorials] in isolation as far as technique is concerned.
         (College tutor).

    We also provided spaces for students to articulate their experience of the tran-
sition from A-level writing to disciplinary writing and provided opportunities be-
yond the tutorial where students could reflect, with peers, on the goals of their texts
and their role as active participants in the feedback process.

CONCLUSION

    In summary, an Academic Literacies framework has allowed us to begin to
reframe discussion of academic writing practices within our institution. It has
enabled us to move discussion away from shifting responsibility onto the stu-

                                                                                                    351

dents for arriving at University with a deficit skill set (the high-achieving profile
of the students here makes this approach hard to justify, in any case). It has also
helped to demonstrate that the traditional apprenticeship model of implicit in-
duction, so often relied upon in the tutorial context, is not necessarily adequate
even for high-achieving students. It has afforded us the opportunity to frame the
discussion in terms of understanding both student and tutor practices, examin-
ing learner histories and the implications of A-level practices and the way these
different factors interact. Discussions are not framed by deficiency in either stu-
dents'or tutors' skills and therefore have not been initiated from a point of blame.
This factor has been significant in fostering engagement across different contexts
within the institution. The project has contributed towards changes in the nature
of dialogue around writing and learning within our institution and, in doing so,
has contributed towards changes in pedagogy at the level of the tutorial. Signifi-
cantly, the work of the project has directly contributed towards the establishment
of a new `institutional space," the Teaching and Learning Joint Sub-committee
of the General Board's Education Committee and Senior Tutors' Standing Com-
mittee on Education, a body with a specific remit to consider issues relating to
the teaching and learning of undergraduates and act as an interface between the
colleges and the university on study skills development, including support for
transitions between school and university.

    In addition to the ways in which an Academic Literacies framework has in-
formed our institutional support of academic writing, I would argue that the ped-
agogical application of the approach in our context is significant in extending the
practical and theoretical reach of the Academic Literacies perspective away from
the focus of early Academic Literacies research (e.g., Lillis, 2001 ) on "non-tra-
ditional" students to illustrate its effectiveness in establishing transformational
spaces in an "elite" context where all students are considered high-achieving.

NOTE

1. At the University of Cambridge, the one-to-one teaching for undergraduate students
is called a "supervision." However, as in any other context this is called a tutorial, and,
to ensure a clear distinction from graduate supervision, I will use "tutorial" and "tutor"
to refer to the teaching session and the teacher.

THE POLITICAL ACT
OF DEVELOPING PROVISION
FOR WRITING IN THE IRISH
HIGHER EDUCATION CONTEXT

      Lawrence Cleary and Íde O'Sullivan

    In 2007, when the authors of this chapter were being selected to get Ireland's
first writing centre up and running, concerns about postgraduate writing for pub-
lication coincided with national and institutional drives to up-skill the population
for participation in a knowledge economy. A feature of our context is that our
institution began its life as a National Institute of Higher Education and maintains
strong ties with local industry to this day. Student retention and transferable skills
development were Higher Education Authority concerns that largely determined
some goals for our target groups. Those groups included mature students, interna-
tional students and students coming in through the Access programme as a conse-
quence of low, or the absence of, Leaving Certification exam scores (http://www.
examinations.ie/). The national discourse about writing at third level in Ireland up
to that time was largely limited to talk about writing development for professional
academic advancement.

    Surveys conducted by Íde in 2005 and 2006 had given us some insight into
teacher and student attitudes towards writing and the teaching and learning of
writing, into the ad-hoc writing development initiatives that were already in play
and into student and staff preferences for ways forward (see Lawrence Cleary et
al., 2009). Both of the authors of this chapter come from backgrounds in applied
linguistics with a focus on academic writing--Lawrence also having the additional,
very positive experience of Janice Neuleib's undergraduate writing programme at
Illinois State University. Given our backgrounds, we both had some idea of how
to satisfy student and staff preferences, but as researchers charged with forming a
systematic approach to writing development based on best practice for students
and staff across four faculties, we had to do our homework.

    Roz Ivanic and Mary Lea (2006) are keen to remind writing developers that
choosing one pedagogical theory of writing over another "is always a political act"

DOI: https://doi.org/10.37514/PER-B.2015.0674.2.26  355
Cleary and O'Sullivan

(p. 14), even if it is rarely recognized as such. The reminder from Ivanic and Lea is
reminiscent of an even earlier caution by James Berlin (1982, p. 765) that choosing
one pedagogical theory of writing over another is more than just quibbling about
which feature of the writing process to favour. "To teach writing," wrote Berlin
(1982, p. 766), "is to argue for a version of reality, and the best way of knowing and
communicating it." The writer-centred approach adopted by our writing centre is
in many ways typical of writing centres in the United States. We do not intervene
in students' papers, but into their processes (Stephen North, 1984), talking to them
about strategies for reaching their writing goals. The authority over their paper
is theirs. Our approach is largely eclectic, drawing on many traditions including
ESP, EAP and corpus and systemic functional linguistics, each uniquely informing
and thereby expanding our understanding of student writing and the writing of
professionals in the disciplines. Crucial to our politics, however, we draw from the
literature on Academic Literacies and one particular form of the US Rhetoric and
Composition model, New Rhetoric.

    This chapter explores the influence of Academic Literacies and New Rhetoric
on the pedagogical approach to the development of writing in one higher educa-
tion institution in Ireland, namely the University of Limerick. A single lesson in
one writing Centre initiative will serve to illustrate how these two traditions can
come together to foster the development of a writing tradition that provides writers
with the tools and materials needed to evaluate any writing situation, to enter into
the discourses relevant to that situation as critical agents in the creation of knowl-
edge--rather than passive recipients of trickle-down ideological and epistemic val-
ues and to consider the implications of their lexical choices and structural strategies
with respect to their credibility and the realities for which they advocate. Though
focusing on a single tutorial, the demonstration reveals much about the politics of
our eclectic approach.

POLITICS AND PEDAGOGICAL CHOICES

    We suspect that most writing developers would struggle to relate Rhetoric and
Composition studies with Academic Literacies studies, especially if their experi-
ence of Rhetoric and Composition is the ritualized curricula of the dominant Cur-
rent-Traditional model that most people think of when they think of first-year
composition. Sharon Crowley (1985) refers to such a model as the teaching of "a
bizarre parody of serious discourse and the process by which it is produced" (p.
159). Correspondingly, John Heyda (2006) links the Current-Traditional model
to earlier models of "vocationally-oriented instruction" that quickly proved capable
of descending into "a writing-by-the-numbers charade" (p. 155). However, Rhet-
oric and Composition is not a theoretical monolith, but harbours many compet-
ing traditions. The value of integrating aspects of rhetorical theory, in particular

                                                      The Political Act of Developing Provision for Writing

the rhetoric advocated by Berlin (1982), Robert L. Scott (1967), Ann E. Berthoff
(1978), Richard E. Young, Alton L. Becker and Kenneth L. Pike (1970) and An-
drea Lunsford and Lisa Ede (1994), is not altogether inconsistent with the values
honoured by Academic Literacies scholars and practitioners.

    The earlier caution from Ivanic and Lea (2006, p. 14), about the politics em-
bedded in writing pedagogy, results from their recognition that, to paraphrase Or-
well's pigs: "All writing is equal, but some writing is more equal than other writing."
Language is "the prime carrier of ideology" (Romy Clark a& Roz Ivanic, 1997, p.
29) and "[w]riting is of strategic importance to the outcome of those ideological
struggles" (p. 21). There is resonance between Clark and Ivanic (1997), Brian Street
(2003) and Paulo Freire (2000) with respect to their ideas about the socially situ-
ated nature of knowledge and the role of hegemonic forces in maintaining value
for particular kinds of knowledge and ways of knowing, not least of which is the
dominant educational practice which subordinates students (learners) to teachers
(knowers). This recognition of the socially situated nature of language and struggles
over how language and social practices mean in any given writing or teaching situ-
ation is reflected in the work of New Rhetoric scholars as well:

         Rhetorical theories differ from each other in the way writer,
         reality, audience, and language are conceived--both as separate
         units and in the way the units relate to each other. In the case of
         distinct pedagogical approaches, these four elements are likewise
         defined and related so as to describe a different composing pro-
         cess, which is to say a different world with different rules about
         what can be known, how it can be known, and how it can be
         communicated. (Berlin, 1982, pp. 765-766)

    Berlin describes reality as one of the elements of the composing process, yet
these components taken together "identify an epistemic field--the basic conditions
that determine what knowledge will be knowable, and how the knowable will be
communicated" (Berlin, 1982, p. 767). The reality we teach is determined by how
we treat each component in the writing process. The New Rhetorician values a
process of truth-making or meaning-making that makes room for each student's
experience of reality and the perpetual transformation of those truths as a result
of the dialectical interplay of writer, reality, audience and language. Truth in this
view of the process is "always truth for someone standing in relation to others in a
linguistically circumscribed situation" (Berlin, 1982, p. 744).

DO YOU WRITE LIKE AN ENGINEER?

Introduction to Engineering, a compulsory module for first-year students in the En-
gineering Choice programme. The writing component of this module might best be
described as a mini-module-within-a-module, comprised of four hours of lectures,
entitled Report-writing for Engineers, and four Do you write like an Engineer? tutorial
hours. The majority of students on this module are from traditional backgrounds,
coming in directly from second-level education having scored well on Leaving Cer-
tification exams (see also Fischer Chapter 5, Paxton and Frith Chapter 11 this
volume).

    Students on this module write three papers for assessment that together con-
stitute forty-five per cent of the student's total grade. The submissions are assessed
by a postgraduate TA and, in the third paper, by two peers. Finally, for each sub-
mission, colour-coded feedback for self-assessment is provided by the writing tutor
with the help of two postgraduate Engineering students.

    After asking "Why do reports from engineers and essays from students in the
Humanities look different from one another?" in the first tutorial, the texts above
are projected onto the screen at the front of the classroom. The tutor inquires into
the differences in proportional representation of colour. Naturally, students point
out the preference for red structures in the text to the left and for green structures
in the text on the right. The text on the left is identified as being from an engineer's
feasibility report, the one on the right as belonging to a teaching and learning spe-

cialist writing for an academic journal.
    Groups of students are instructed to work together to determine the function

of the red and the green with respect to whatever precedes or follows it, be it blue
or green or another red strand. The tutor asks, "What is the passage in red or green
doing?"

             Figure 26.2: Subordinate clauses versus non-finite verb clauses.

    In the samples above, for instance, students are asked about the relationship be-
tween the green and the blue in the first sentence. Eventually, we work out that the
green is defining students, answering the question: Which students? Interestingly, in
the second sample sentence above, students work out that "used to read a DVD," in
red, is doing the same thing, defining the laser. So the question becomes, if they do
the same thing, why does this engineer choose red structures over green structures?

    This is an opportunity for the writing tutor to model the kinds of inquiry with
which good writers typically engage. Perhaps, if we could understand how the red and
the green structures are different from one another, we could say why the engineer
prefers the red structure. When asked about their thoughts on the differences between
the two structures, students usually report that the red structure sounds more factual,
more to the point. The tutor has learned that this understanding of the difference is
intuited and has merit. He then shares two differences between the structures: firstly,
that the green structure contains a conjunction, a word that expresses an explicit rela-
tionship--in the case above, a relative pronoun--and a verb marked for tense--time,
person, number, and mood; in the second sample sentence, two non-finite verbs (a
participle and an infinitive) are left to imply the relationship between the information
in the red structure and that in the blue structure which precedes it.

    If the green structure expresses the relationship more explicitly through the
use of a conjunction, why does this engineer prefer the less explicit relationship
expressed by the red structure, as in the second sample sentence, where the rela-
tionship needs to be inferred? After all, we usually think of engineers as embracing
precision. Asking students to reformulate sentences, changing red structures into
green structures and green structures into red structures, students come to see red
structures require fewer words. Though less precise than green subordinate claus-
es, the red non-finite verb phrases and clauses allow for more information to be
stacked up in a more concise way. Engineers, after all, love concision too. Students
learn that there is a bit of a trade off when choosing this red structure: some preci-
sion in the expression of the relationship is sacrificed in the interest of concision.
But why does the red structure sound more factual than the green structure?

                                                                                                    359
Cleary and O'Sullivan

    At this point, students are informed that at the turn of the twentieth century,
the writing of scientists and engineers looked more like the sample Humanities text
(William Vande Kopple, 2003, pp. 370-371)--hardly any red structures, but lots
of blue and green. What changed? Why the gradual increase in preference for red
structures over green? Students may offer some theories, but it is not a question
they are expected to be able to answer--the question is designed to intrigue them.
Students are asked to speculate on the role of time, person, number, and mood
absent from the structure currently preferred. Students often portray the red struc-
tures as communicating more factual information. An examination of the content,
though, does not reveal more facts. However, that the structure sounds more factu-
al, more certain, is clear. Despite not being marked for tense, the structure seems to
imply modality or degrees of certainty.

    If this structure is preferred by engineers, what allows today's engineers to express
a greater degree of certainty than yesterday's engineers? In the tutorial, this question
is usually followed by a long silence. Students must think about what has happened
over the past one-hundred years. With time, someone volunteers an explanation.
A typical response might be that today's engineers and scientists know more. "We
know more facts" is how they often express it. Sooner or later, students volunteer
that today's engineers have more knowledge to work with and that they have better,
more precise tools. These conjectures agree with the conclusions in the literature:
with more precise and reliable measurements, engineers today feel more confident
about their results and more readily generalize their conclusions (Vande Kopple,
2003, p. 371). The tensed verb ties the empirical observation to a particular time,
implying that the results cannot be generalized beyond its immediate context; a loss
of tense has the rhetorical effect of communicating that the occurrence is typical.

    These revelations about what the various clause structures communicate leads
to a class discussion of cases where it might be inappropriate for an engineer to
communicate such typification and of the effect that misrepresentations of degrees
of certainty might have on the readers' sense of the writer's credibility. This is a rhe-
torical issue, but it is an issue that is basic to identity as well. If a writer wishes for
a text to communicate something about herself, then the writer needs to consider
not only how her language choices signify at the level of denotation, but what is
implied and what acts are performed, if any, by those choices. The tutor argues that
over- or understating the value of the findings in research undermines the reader's
sense of the writer/researcher's credibility. Using a grammatical structure that incor-
rectly implies that a case is typical is to engage in faulty reasoning--not a method
of justifying conclusions that we typically associate with scientists and engineers.
If the degrees of certainty expressed are not reliable, it is only natural that readers
would ask: What else is unreliable? What other evidence is not valid? Can I trust
this writer? If I were to rely on this engineer's conclusions, how would I be viewed
by the engineering community?

CONCLUSION

    This mini-module on the writing for engineers does not challenge the episte-
mology of science. Instead, we indirectly pose the question to students: Are pos-
itivist values alone sufficient for dealing with each and every engineering writing
situation? Is it enough to just be factual? Is that the only kind of knowledge that
counts? We run across sentences like the following in the relevant literature:

         It would appear to be impossible to obtain J~c for tearing and
         cleavage for the same material--either it will fail by cleavage or
         tearing at Q = 0 giving either J~c or J~c; the other must be ob-
         tained from a theoretical model or by extrapolating experimental
         data. (O'Dowd, 1995, p. 463; italics ours)

    And the great thing about having electronic texts projected onto a screen in
class is that we can search for all sorts of examples of the language of uncertainty
and condition, among other features. By asking students to write about issues rele-
vant to professional development, looking at texts on engineering ethics, policy and
education to see how engineers write about those kinds of issues, by delving deep
into the implications of linguistic features common in engineering writing, we are
asking students to reconsider the scope of what it means to be an engineer and to
re-evaluate what counts as evidence in each rhetorical situation.

    However, it is a little more difficult to engage young engineering students in
discussions of how engineering practice is a social practice and about how they are
positioned by the requirements of the module, the course, and the discipline/field,
particularly with respect to how they are positioned by the process by which they
satisfy (or fail to satisfy) those requirements. Though we do not explicitly inquire
into how the values of science cohere with the cultural values students bring with
them into this new third-level educational context, sometimes the inconsistencies
come from the least expected places, and it is the job of the tutor to inquire into
the social construction of the epistemological principles that constitute individual
realities.

    It is interesting that student responses to feedback on their writing--for exam-
ple, requests for literary sources for particular claims or supporting information
or objections to language that calls attention to the author's cognitive or affective
processes or agency--are amongst the best opportunities for exposing some of the
values that they do bring with them into university. Objections to citing and refer-
encing requirements and to prohibitions against allusions to one's own agency are
opportunities for a tutor to lead an examination of the confrontation between the
language and methods whereby students expressed their authority and agency in
the past and how it is expressed in the present writing context. Such objections are
opportunities to examine the role of context in the way that knowledge is best posi-

                                                                                                    361

tioned for rhetorical (argumentative) reasons and how audience and language func-
tion in this new context to affirm or negate the identity a student wishes to portray.
Objectionable practices can become opportunities if viewed as rhetorical strategies
for the creation of both knowledge and identity. A sanction invalidates; a strategy
authorizes. Just as there is guilt by association, there is credibility by association. By
avoiding language that suggests subjectivity, we conjure that sense of indifference
that we commonly associate with the unbiased scientist, an identity to which the
writer perhaps aspires. These are opportunities to examine the language writers use
to establish identity, voice, tone, authority, etc. It is not the goal of our module on
writing for engineers, however, to teach linguistic structures. The module, instead,
demonstrates to students that they must assess how language is working in a given
context in order to make the best determination of whether it is creating the reality
for which they wish to advocate.

    Just as the Academic Literacies approach has capacity also to value the roles
played by the study skills and academic socialization models for writing develop-
ment (Lea & Street, 1998), writing centres are "firmly grounded in an epistemo-
logical mix" (Eric Hobson, 2001, pp. 108-109). Both Academic Literacies and
New Rhetoric approaches view each writing situation as a situated social practice
"always embedded in socially constructed epistemological principles" (Street, 2003,
p. 77) that determine "what can be known, how it can be known, and how it can be
communicated" (Berlin, 1982, p. 766). Drawing on these insights, it is our writing
centre's goal to teach a writing process that both foregrounds the writer's relation-
ship with language, reality and audience in the meaning-making process and makes
possible the conditions whereby she may consciously and critically transform the
epistemic field into which she writes. The writer we hope is thus both informed
and empowered.

BUILDING RESEARCH CAPACITY
THROUGH AN ACLITS-INSPIRED
PEDAGOGICAL FRAMEWORK

      Lia Blaj-Ward

    In a 2007 article which they describe as part AcLits research overview, part po-
sition paper, Theresa Lillis and Mary Scott wrote:

         At this point, we consider that our aims should be to: ... Sustain
         current support and critical discussion systems that exist for the
         development of researchers in academic literacies, acknowledging
         the marginal position of many in this field. (Lillis & Scott, 2007,
         p. 22)

    This chapter addresses the aim identified by Lillis and Scott (2007) through ex-
ploring an initiative to support the development of research literacy among practi-
tioners delivering English for Academic Purposes (EAP) provision for international
students, in the UK higher education system and in other national higher educa-
tion systems where non-native speakers of English participate in courses taught in
this language. Research literacy refers to the ability to engage with existing research
reports and to produce accounts of research that illuminate aspects of EAP practice
in a rigorous, persuasive and engaging way.

    The chapter opens with three scenarios of EAP practitioners preparing to un-
dertake research; it describes the thinking behind a professional association's ini-
tiative to build an EAP researcher support network, partly in response to the three
scenarios; it explores ways in which AcLits course design principles helped shape
this initiative and suggests points for further consideration. The viewpoint reflect-
ed in the chapter is that of the coordinator of the events and follow-on resources
which formed part of the researcher development initiative.

SCENARIOS

    Alexandra works in a language centre in a UK university and teaches in-session-
al EAP, i.e., non-assessed, non-credit-bearing language support for international

students. She designs teaching materials which help international students devel-
op their ability to write postgraduate dissertations. The students in one particular
group she works with have different supervisors with different expectations about
academic writing. Alexandra would like to interview the supervisors and report the
findings in a more formal document, beyond integrating those findings into teach-
ing materials. She is also considering starting a PhD to explore feedback strategies
in more depth.

    Brian is in charge of pre-sessional courses in a different university. Prior to start-
ing their studies for an academic degree, a number of international students are
required to take a pre-sessional EAP course and their acceptance onto the univer-
sity degree course is dependent on successfully completing the pre-sessional. Brian
would like to find out how his students subsequently perform on university courses,
both in order to enhance the quality of the pre-sessional and to encourage subject
lecturer input into the pre-sessional course content; he believes that subject-specific
EAP provision is likely to increase students' academic performance at university.

    Carina is the head of an EAP unit in a UK university. She needs to generate evi-
dence to persuade senior management in her institution that an in-sessional course,
delivered by the unit to support a particular Business programme, is fit for purpose
and a justifiable expenditure. At the same time, she is reviewing staff development
strategies within the unit she leads.

POINT FOR CONSIDERATION

    Alexandra, Brian and Carina are qualified to master's level in their area, but not
all have completed a research-based dissertation or have comparable experience of
academic, practice- or policy-oriented research. Time for academic research and re-
lated publication activities is not formally built into their contracts and workloads.
Their situations can, however, yield valuable insights not only for their immediate
contexts but also for the wider professional community and to develop a theoretical
knowledge base in EAP. What support network can be made available to Alexandra,
Brian and Carina to ensure that their questions are developed into projects with suc-
cessful outcomes?

INSTITUTIONAL SETTINGS FOR EAP RESEARCH

    To place the above point for consideration into the institutional context in
which Alexandra, Brian and Carina deliver EAP teaching, coordinate and/or are
involved in strategic planning of EAP provision, the three scenarios outlined above
are grounded in a UK higher education context, where links between academic
research, on the one hand, and teaching and learning practice, on the other, are
gradually becoming stronger, albeit not consistently so across academia. EAP pro-

366
                       Building Research Capacity Through an AcLits-Inspired Pedagogical Framework

vision is strongly embedded within institutional structures associated with teaching
and learning; staff delivering EAP provision usually hold the status of teacher prac-
titioners rather than discipline academics with research responsibilities. The nature
of institutional mechanisms of reward for research (the UK Research Excellence
Framework, www.ref.ac.uk) means that there may be limited institutional support
for EAP practitioner research. The work of EAP practitioners is often invisible in
high status research publications. Within their institutional context, EAP practi-
tioners may have access to professional development related to the design and de-
livery of EAP provision, but it is less likely that they will be formally supported to
plan and conduct research and they are not legitimate participants in the "research
game" (Lisa Lucas, 2006) in academic life.

    In the United Kingdom EAP-related research is conducted in Applied Linguis-
tics departments, whereas research into the internationalization of higher education
systems, which could potentially be informed by insights from EAP provision and
in its turn have a bearing on international student support, is conducted in a range
of other research-focused departments (e.g., Education, Sociology, Business).These
areas have limited if any input from EAP practitioners like Alexandra, Brian, and
Carina (a notable exception is a study by Diane Sloan and Elizabeth Porter, 2010).

RESTES: WITHIN/OUTSIDE INSTITUTIONAL FRAMEWORKS

    BALEAP, The global forum for EAP professionals (www.baleap.org), has respond-
ed to the situations exemplified by the three scenarios by creating opportunities
for the development of a support network, through setting up ResTES, a Research
Training Event Series consisting of face-to-face one-day training events. Partici-
pants (presenters and audience members) have varying degrees of investment in
research; they may be researching their own teaching practice, working towards a
research degree, conducting institutional research for quality assurance purposes
or interpreting research to construct policies. At the time of writing this chapter,
five one-day face-to-face events have taken place. The events, hosted in 2011 and
2012 by universities in different locations in the United Kingdom, were open to
an international audience of BALEAP members and non-members. The rationale
behind the series is described as follows:

         The academic experience of international students in En-
         glish-speaking countries has gained increased visibility as a result of
         new developments in government policy and legislation. Perhaps
         more so now than ever before, research into English for Academic
         Purposes (EAP) can and should inform decisions made not only in
         the context of individual academic practice but also at the level of
         institutional and governmental agendas on academic aspects of the

                                                                                                    367
Blaj-Ward

         international student experience. (BALEAP, 2011, p. 207)

    Each of the five events that constitute the research training initiative addressed
a separate aspect of the research process: 1. Defining the research space: Literature
reviews and research questions; 2. Methodologies for researching EAP contexts,
practices and pedagogies; 3. Issues in EAP classroom research; 4. Qualitative data
analysis in EAP research; 5. Quantitative data analysis in EAP research. The format
for each of the first four events was half a day of input by an expert or experienced
researcher in the field (a masterclass) followed by half a day of presentations of work
in progress scheduled in a single strand. A call for presentations of work in progress
was issued prior to each event. The fifth event was delivered as a one-day workshop
on quantitative data analysis in an IT suite software.

    In order to pre-empt projecting an image of the research process as a set of
discrete stages through which researchers proceed linearly, resources from the series
are available online (www.baleap.org). Event participants can thus revisit materials,
and BALEAP members not taking part in face-to-face events can work through the
material in an order and at a pace appropriate for their individual interests. The
online resources bring events together as a coherent whole and showcase accounts
of ongoing research.

    The emphasis on presenting work in progress rather than finished accounts
reflects the ResTES ethos of peer learning, i.e., "the sharing of knowledge, exper-
tise, experience, highs and lows in practice and research, pedagogic principles and
professional interests, curiosities and uncertainties" (BALEAP, 2011, p. 207). Par-
ticipants at the events have varying degrees of experience of conducting research,
which creates fruitful peer learning opportunities.

ACLITS: CHALLENGING INSTITUTIONAL FRAMEWORKS

    A programme supporting the development of REF-type outputs such as aca-
demic journal articles (Writing for Publication), informed by AcLits and sponsored
by an academic journal is discussed by Theresa Lillis, Anna Magyar and Anna Rob-
inson-Pant (2010). The research outputs on which the ResTES work-in-progress
presentations focus do not necessarily, however, fall within the Research Excellence
Framework (REF) remit. Nonetheless, AcLits lends itself well as a basis for devel-
oping the ResTES, given that ResTES is intended as a catalyst for research and
as a set of opportunities for practitioners to develop as researchers. This is due to
AcLits' exploratory rather than prescriptive approach to literacy development and
its emphasis on creating spaces in which institutional frameworks and expectations
can be integrated and transformed.

    One particular aspect of AcLits, namely the pedagogic principles for course de-
sign (Lea, 2004; Lea & Street, 2006), informed the development of ResTES. The

368
                       Building Research Capacity Through an AcLits-Inspired Pedagogical Framework

origins of AcLits can be traced back to an endeavour to reframe student academic
literacy not as a set of generic skills or as the object of straightforward enculturation
into the practices of a specific academic discipline but as the site where individual
identities, social practices and institutional frameworks interact and are reshaped in
the process. AcLits has developed primarily in relation to assessed academic writing
within university degree courses, where its perhaps most immediate relevance lies.
The attention it pays to power, authority, institutional contexts, individual and
social practices and identities, however, makes it a robust and flexible framework to
explore ways of supporting EAP teacher practitioners to develop research literacy
in relation to EAP.

    In one of the key AcLits texts, Mary Lea (2004) discusses how she and her col-
leagues drew on the relationship between writing and learning identified through
AcLits research to develop principles for course design, and illustrates these princi-
ples with the help of a case study of an online course delivered globally in English
to a group of postgraduate students working in education-related roles. Four of the
principles put forward by Lea (2004), in particular, resonated with the aims and
the contextual specificity of ResTES. These four principles stipulate that the AcLits
approach to course design

      a. acknowledges that texts do more than represent knowledge,
      b. involves thinking about all texts of the course--written and multimod-

         al--and not just assessed texts,
      c. attempts to create spaces for exploration of different meanings and un-

         derstandings by all course participants,
      d. sees the course as mediated by different participants. Allows spaces for

         this and embeds this in both the course content and the course design
         (Lea, 2004, p. 744).

    The selection of four--rather than the wholesale adoption of all--principles list-
ed in Lea (2004) is underpinned both by the ResTES designers' choice to explore
the situatedness of AcLits and by AcLits' inherent flexibility as an enabling rather
than prescriptive pedagogic framing. A later study by Mary Lea and Brian Street
(2006) offers two examples of courses aimed at different audiences (a programme
developing the academic literacy of pre-university students in the United Kingdom
and a course aimed at supporting law academics to write introductory law course
materials); in their 2006 study, Lea and Street further elaborate on the last principle
selected for discussion in this paper (principle d, see above) by noting that the tutors
and participants

         worked closely ... to collaboratively investigate the range of
         genres, modes, shifts, transformations, representations, mean-
         ing-making processes, and identities involved in academic learn-

                                                                                                    369

         ing within and across academic contexts. These understandings,
         when made explicit, provide greater opportunities for teaching
         and learning, as well as for examining how such literacy practices
         are related to epistemological issues. (Lea & Street, 2006, p. 376)

    AcLits research and the AcLits design frame are closely interrelated, in that the
former generates insights into literacy, teaching and learning which can inform
further course development. The remainder of the chapter elaborates on the ways
in which the four AcLits course design principles identified above are helping shape
BALEAP's researcher development initiative; the "Points for further consideration"
in the closing section of the chapter highlight aspects into which additional re-
search is needed to take the ResTES forward and further refine its design.

ACLITS AND RESTES

    While the overall framework of ResTES was inspired and informed by AcLits
principles for course design, participants were not formally and explicitly intro-
duced to these principles or to the research from which they were derived. AcLits
underpinned the design of learning opportunities; it was not part of the content
explored at ResTES events. Lea and Street (2006) also chose not to introduce the
Law academics on the Writing Level One Course Materials workshops explicitly to
the AcLits conceptual underpinning of these workshops, and instead enabled them
to experience the AcLits approach through the activities designed. They found that
this did not hinder fruitful discussion and academics' exploration of literacy as a
situated social practice. In the case of ResTES, the implicit rather than explicit
presence of AcLits within the series is partly explained by a desire to maximize the
space for presenters and participants to negotiate their own understanding of what
it means to develop as a researcher.

    a. Texts do more than represent knowledge.

    The research texts with which ResTES participants engage either as consumers
(e.g., published research) or as producers (e.g., draft reports or writing produced
for the award of a postgraduate degree) position participants as researchers in the
field and the identity work involved in transitioning from practitioner to research-
er is supported through opportunities to offer constructive critique of published
work and feedback on work in progress. As well as prompting identity work, texts
provide guidelines within which new knowledge can be created. In the inaugural
ResTES masterclass, Ian Bruce, an established researcher in the EAP field (e.g.,
Bruce 2008, 2011) shared with the audience a literature review excerpt from one
of his published texts and invited them to unpack the textual strategies he had used
to position his work among existing research. In the second half of the event, as

370
                       Building Research Capacity Through an AcLits-Inspired Pedagogical Framework

an audience member, he engaged with the "texts" which the presenters of work in
progress contributed to the event (PowerPoint slides, oral commentary, handouts)
and offered constructive feedback on how the projects could be shaped to reveal
more fully the voice of the author, make claims of legitimate participation in the
chosen research field and open avenues for further inquiry.

    b. Think about all texts of the course--written and multimodal--and not just as-
    sessed texts.

    While most of the EAP research shared at ResTES events may eventually be
incorporated into written documents following institutionally-endorsed academic
writing conventions, the aim of the series is to capture snapshots of various stages in
the development of research projects, those stages which are frequently edited out
of final published documents but which are central to developing research literacy.
ResTES presenters may be working towards producing a piece of writing assessed as
part of a postgraduate degree in a specific higher education institution, but within
ResTES emphasis is placed on supporting the journey towards creating new knowl-
edge. While masterclasses unpack published texts, work-in-progress presentations
centre on draft texts which are transformed in the interaction between audience
and presenters. To take just one example of how a multimodal text was used in the
context of ResTES, one work-in-progress presenter at the third event (Issues in EAP
classroom research) chose to communicate the milestones in his ongoing research
journey through the medium of prezi (http://prezi.com/). When complete, his re-
search will be reported in a master's dissertation. As a pedagogic tool to enable peer
learning, the dynamic account of the research process captured the real research
experience more effectively than a draft methodology section following accepted
academic conventions.

    c. Create spaces for exploration of different meanings and understandings by all
    course participants.

    Unlike in the case described by Lea (2004), which involves a course delivered
to a student cohort expected to engage in a pre-established number of teaching
and learning activities for a delimited period of time, the coherence of the ResTES
series comes not from the assessment element linked to the award of a degree but
from participants' own choice about the level of investment they are prepared to
make in this form of professional development. Event participants explore differ-
ent meanings and understandings related to research methodology in the space of
the face-to-face event; EAP professionals who access resources online can relate
these to their own research experience or use them as a starting point for further
involvement in/with research. For example, at the second ResTES event one of
the presenters was an international student conducting doctoral research at a UK
university on pre-sessional courses. The pre-sessional tutors and course directors in

                                                                                                    371
Blaj-Ward

the audience were able to bring to the discussion a different set of understandings
of the way in which access and researcher roles can be negotiated in such a situa-
tion. They were also able to take away a nuanced insight into how they could act as
gatekeepers in their current roles or, had they been conducting similar research to
that of the presenter, the implications of their own roles for gaining access to and
reflecting on relationships in the data collection context.

    d. The course is mediated by different participants. Allow spaces for this and embed
    this in both the course content and the course design.

    As key stakeholders in the training event series, participants have a greater lev-
el of input into the content and focus of each event. Two levels of participation
are associated with face-to-face ResTES events: presenting work in progress and
participating as an audience member. Collaboration between tutors and students
is taken one step further. While in the context of one particular higher education
institution tutor and student roles are often hierarchical and formally assigned, in
the learning and teaching space created by ResTES they become flexible and inter-
changeable; presenting participants become tutors, while at the same time receiving
useful feedback from their audience. One ResTES participant at the fifth event
(not a presenter) attended this event in order to consolidate his knowledge about
quantitative research methodology and, for the benefit of others planning to engage
in/with quantitative research, recommended a number of texts about quantitative
methodology that he had found useful. While participant feedback from each event
informed the design and delivery of subsequent ones, the evaluation sheet for the
fifth event was redesigned in order to facilitate a greater level of participation in the
series, beyond attending the face-to-face events. The redesigned evaluation sheet
invited participants to annotate resources and share information about the likely
extent of their involvement in research (and/or supervision of research projects)
in the near future, as a basis for refocusing the ResTES in response to evolving
researcher development needs.

REACHING OUT

    Plans to evaluate the impact of the training series are in place, to learn how
participants like Alexandra, Brian, and Carina in the chapter-opening scenarios
benefitted from engaging in AcLits-informed development opportunities and to
use the lessons learnt as a basis for taking the series forward. Meanwhile, an open
access, online publication, Snapshots of EAP Research Journeys (Lia Blaj-Ward &
Sarah Brewer, 2013), was chosen as a vehicle for disseminating, to a global au-
dience, research experience narratives written by presenters and non-presenting
participants at ResTES events. The choice was made in line with AcLits' emphasis
on giving participants greater responsibility for mediating learning and teaching

opportunities (in this case, by creating resources that can support the development
of research literacy). It also reflected how

         the ResTES team (BALEAP's Research and Publications
         Sub-Committee) is looking forward to facilitating cross-border
         dialogue about supporting, generating, and using EAP research
         to enhance student experience in a global higher education com-
         munity. (BALEAP Research and Publications Sub-Committee,
         personal communication, 16 September, 2011)

    The current priority to facilitate cross-border dialogue means that in addition
to being of value as a design frame, AcLits can offer a helpful tool for formulating
questions in order to explore the politics of academic knowledge production (Lillis
& Curry, 2010) in the global context and to collect scenarios of EAP practitioners
based outside the United Kingdom which can inform the further development of
ResTES. Some of these questions, based on discussions among ResTES designers
and event participants, are phrased as points for further consideration below and
will be addressed at forthcoming ResTES events and in related publications.

POINTS FOR FURTHER CONSIDERATION

      · To what extent are conceptualizations of EAP shared in the global EAP
         professional context? What EAP aspects are EAP professionals researching?

      · To what extent are EAP literacy, teaching and learning practices similar
         or different across the institutions in which EAP professionals work?

      · What are the commonalities and differences in institutional support for
         EAP in the various institutional/national contexts in which EAP profes-
         sionals work, both as regards teaching and as regards research?

      · To what extent are EAP research methodologies transferable and translat-
         able across institutional/national contexts?

      · What languages and local academic conventions are privileged in the
         contexts in which EAP professionals disseminate their research findings?

      · What kinds of research literacy do EAP professionals possess and what
         research literacy do they need to acquire, in order to make an impact in
         the contexts in which they work, as well as on a wider scale?

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

    I am grateful to Sarah Brewer for her support in developing the ResTES, to
members of the BALEAP Executive Committee, ResTES presenters and partici-
pants, and organizers in the host institutions for their contribution to the events.

ACADEMIC LITERACIES AT THE
INSTITUTIONAL INTERFACE:
A PRICKLY CONVERSATION
AROUND THORNY ISSUES

      Joan Turner

SCENE ONE: AN EMAIL EXCHANGE

         Graduate School Representative (GSR): I wonder if we could
         meet to have a chat about the somewhat thorny issue of PhD
         students getting their theses proofread.

         Ac Lits Practitioner/Researcher (ALR): Yes, an extremely thorny
         issue. Main problem is usually what needs to happen isn't "proof-
         reading" as in the sense of proofing an article before sending off
         to publication. Most changes involve clarification of meaning
         with the original writer, hence time (and money).

SCENE TWO

    Some weeks later, a face-to-face conversation takes place. At the request of the
academic literacies practitioner/researcher, this was recorded:

         ALR: Right, OK--so tell me from your perspective what the
         issues are.

         GSR: OK ... This matter was raised as part of a supervisor work-
         shop. One of the issues raised was about international students in
         particular having their theses proofread--um ... not so much on
         the basis that their English language isn't up to scratch, but more
         to do with the fact that the student is perfectly capable of writ-
         ing and articulating their research and their research outcomes
         in their own language, but no matter how good their English is,
         may not quite get it right in English .... I was hoping that a way

         forward might be to have a small panel of proofreading organiza-
         tions, that we can say to students "we don't recommend any one
         of these but pick from one of these, they understand what they
         can and can't do in terms of correcting your work and making
         suggestions," but then you start getting into where the boundar-
         ies are--and then I'm out of my comfort zone. So that's kind of
         where I'm at, really, but still having the same sort of queries from
         a lot of people, can I have my thesis proofread.

         ALR: At what stage are they asking for that?

         GSR: Quite late on.

         ALR: The final stages ... So, it's a big job then?

         GSR: Yeh.

         ALR: And of course it probably doesn't actually mean proofread-
         ing in the standard sense of proofreading--where you're submit-
         ting an article for publication and you're just making sure there
         isn't a typo or the paragraphs start in the right place or whatever.

         GSR: (somewhat uncomfortable intake of breath) mmmhh, well
         you see, I don't know, you see, I would hope, perhaps naively,
         that it would be at that level, because if somebody's about to sub-
         mit, then there should be a confidence that they're submitting
         something that's worth examining and that is going to pass ...

         ALR: Yeh, um, it is a terribly thorny issue. I mean I know be-
         cause I've worked with a lot of PhD students across the college,
         and I found it was becoming such a ... I mean I wasn't proof-
         reading, I was trying to analyze their English and help them to
         formulate it so that they could actually say more clearly what it
         was they wanted to say--but that was with me reading the text,
         marking it up and then having one-to-ones with them ...

         GSR: So quite close reading then really.

         ALR: Yeh, because you can read a text and you can change it
         and it can mean all sorts of different things. And also, you can
         change one word and it can change the emphasis.

         SGR: Absolutely ... and if you're one step beyond that, they've
         got to sit and defend that thesis in front of examiners who may
         or may not be friendly and supportive, and who may or may not
         pass them, or who may pass them with 18 months corrections or

         something.

         ALR: So I think proofreading's the wrong term really. I suspect
         it's very seldom that proofreading's exactly what they require.
         They do require a lot more input .... It's a grey area. You have to
         say it's "all my own work"--well, is it all their own work? `Cos
         the writing is quite an important part of the work.

         SGR: It's tricky. I suppose ... I can't see the wood for the trees at
         the moment ...

         I don't think there's going to be a straightforward answer, except
         to say that there is particular support for dyslexic students--and
         I wonder whether we can draw on that in some way ...

         ALR: (audible deep breath) but that's a different type of support
         really. I mean, we run in-sessional language support classes for
         PhD students, and my worry is that these students haven't really
         made use of those ...

         GSR: The more you think about it, the harder you try and
         deconstruct it--the harder it's got to put it together again--it al-
         most feels like there's a PhD in there somewhere (joint laughter).

PROOFREADING: A THORN IN THE SIDE
OF WRITING PEDAGOGY

    While it was not explicitly stated in the above conversation, there seems to
be an institutional expectation that the role of academic literacies practitioners is
similar to that of proofreading, and that writing or language centres should either
carry out or facilitate that role. This assumption is implied in Stephen North's 1984
proclamation, born of frustration, in a North American context, that: "[the writing
centre] is a place for learning not a proofreading-shop-in-the-basement" (North,
1984). Similarly, Peter Spolc (1996), in an Australian context, discusses issues of
responsibility when he finds that students expect writing specialists to offer proof-
reading services, a situation he describes wryly as "the skeleton in the academic
skills closet." The continuing experience, internationally, of this assumption on the
part of students has led to many writing and language centres explicitly making the
negative statement on their websites or notice boards that they do not do proof-
reading. Discussions around what to do about the recurring institutional demand
for proofreading also appear from time to time on mailbases such as BALEAP
(the British Association of Lecturers in English for Academic Purposes) or EATAW
(the European Association for the Teaching of Academic Writing). In these discus-

                                                                                                    377
Turner

sions, it is the principles of learning and pedagogical practice that are highlighted in
contrast to proofreading, which entails neither (see also, Joan Turner, 2011). One
participant in a focus group on the topic of proofreading, conducted by the author
with writing practitioners, asserted vigorously:

         We should be working with students to highlight weak areas
         that need to be improved and giving them examples of how to
         improve it but we certainly shouldn't be going through crossing
         every "t" and dotting every "i," I absolutely don't think that is
         our job.

A HUMPTY DUMPTY EXPERIENCE

    Given this rather fraught relationship between writing pedagogy, whatever the
theoretical perspective, and proofreading, it may be seen as positive that the grad-
uate school representative in the above conversation had prefaced her consultation
on proofreading with the understanding that it was a "thorny" issue. This had not
been her initial understanding, however. Rather she had come to see it as "thorny."
In this respect, she has undergone a transformative learning experience, albeit one
that leaves her somewhat "nettled." She has come to understand the difficulties of
deciding "where the boundaries are" between proofreading and "making sugges-
tions" for example. She gives the impression of having become increasingly exasper-
ated by the fact that the simple solution, which "proofreading" appeared to present,
has opened up more and more dilemmas. As she put it:

         the more you think about it, the harder you try and deconstruct
         it--the harder it's got to put it together again.

    This expression evokes the "Humpty Dumpty" nursery rhyme, in which, after
he falls off a wall and breaks apart, "all the King's horses and all the King's men
couldn't put Humpty together again." The sentiment underlines the difficulty of
posing proofreading as a solution to thesis completion and submission. It also jus-
tifies the academic literacies critique of a "quick fix" approach to academic writing,
discussed for example by Mary Lea & Brian Street (1998). The apparent "quick fix"
has fragmented into a number of different "thorny" issues, which can no longer be
re-integrated into a neat whole. Indeed, the "thorns" appear to accumulate rather
than diminish. They include:

      · establishing a boundary with the proof reader that includes spell checking
         and grammar checking but doesn't alter the content of the work;

      · not removing or distorting the student's own voice;
      · defending a thesis in a viva when the student hasn't had complete control

         over word choice;

378
                                                            Academic Literacies at the Institutional Interface

      · students must sign that a thesis is "all their own work," but does using a
         proofreader alter that?

    These are all problem areas that an academic literacies practitioner would in-
stinctively be aware of, hence the professional disassociation of their role with that of
proofreader. These issues also place the practice of proofreading in relation to student
academic writing within an ethical framework. Similar ethical concerns were voiced
by proofreaders themselves in research undertaken by Nigel Harwood and others at
the University of Essex in the United Kingdom (Harwood et al., 2009, 2010).

MEANING AND MASKING MEANING

    In Lewis Carroll's (1871) Through the Looking Glass, Humpty Dumpty declares
that words can mean anything he wants them to mean. In the above conversation,
it is the academic literacies researcher who takes on the role of arbiter of the word
"proofreading" and its meaning. She states:

         Proofreading's the wrong term.

    In fact, the ideological role of the use of the term "proofreading" in higher educa-
tion needs to be unmasked. When it is used in the context of students needing to im-
prove their writing, or bring a PhD up to submission standard, it indexes an insipid
and diluted view of what's involved. It also risks denying those students who have put
a great deal of effort into developing their writing and their English language profi-
ciency, the educational importance of their achievement. At the same time, it masks
deeper underlying issues of international higher education, and its multilingual stu-
dent body, that institutions seem reluctant to address. For example, the institutional
discourse around written English in higher education has not yet engaged with the
wider debates circulating in relation to scholarly publication. These include the role
of academic literacy brokers in the publication of L2 scholars (e.g., Christine Casa-
nave 1998, John Flowerdew, 2000, Theresa Lillis & Mary Jane Curry, 2006, 2010);
multilingualism in composition studies (e.g., Suresh Canagarajah, 2011; Christiane
Donahue, 2009; Bruce Horner & John Trimbur, 2002) and the role of English as a
Lingua Franca in English language teaching, where the acceptability of varying forms
of English is promoted (e.g., Jennifer Jenkins, Alessia Cogo & Martin Dewey, 2011;
Barbara Seidlhofer, 2005). It is incumbent upon an academic literacies perspective,
which I have characterized as "an overarching framework, within which to embed
a focus on the myriad processes and practices associated with reading and writing
in contemporary higher education" (Turner, 2012, p. 2) to engage with these wider
debates, and bring them into their practitioner, as well as institutional, discourse. The
use of "proofreading" as a mechanistic solution to maintaining the status quo skates
over all of these issues, and therefore needs to be resisted.

                                                                                                    379

ENABLING THE TRANSFORMATIVE AT THE INSTITUTIONAL
INTERFACE

    One of the rationales for this edited collection is a focus on the relationship be-
tween academic literacies practices and their "transformative" potential. The notion
of the "transformative" is a powerful one for higher education more widely, as can
be seen for example in the following mission statement from my own university:

         We offer a transformative experience, generating knowledge and
         stimulating self-discovery through creative, radical and intellec-
         tually rigorous thinking and practice.

    The above context of the transformative relates to student experience, and the
proposed changes to their consciousness and thinking patterns as individuals. In
their work from an academic literacies perspective, Ivanic (1998) and Lillis (2001)
chart this kind of transformative development, as well as detail the struggles the
students have with institutional expectations. A transformative trajectory need not
only be one where students adapt to institutional expectations, or where students
(and practitioners) reach a higher stage of learning, or renewed sense of identity,
but can also be one where institutional assumptions and practices change. The
exigencies of international higher education highlight the need for such institution-
al change. Echoing the "ideological stance" (Theresa Lillis & Mary Scott, 2007),
which focuses on the transformative rather than the normative in academic litera-
cies practice, the relevance of the above conversation may be seen in its attempt to
encourage the transformation of mechanistic perceptions of the work of academic
writing, which the use of the word proofreading suggests.

    There is no claim here, however, that any institutional transformation was
achieved in the above conversation. It is nonetheless important to have such diffi-
cult conversations, to resist solutions such as proofreading, which it seems writing
practitioners are adjudged to be able to provide, and at the same time, to keep the
conversation going. One outcome of the above conversation was the suggestion of
further conversations, ideally with the graduate school board, and a presentation at
a future meeting was proposed.

    The institutional interface, then, is an important site for academic literacies
work and its transformative agenda. However, the route to transformation is strewn
with prickly thorns, and not one easily signposted to "mission accomplished."

REVISITING THE QUESTION OF

TRANSFORMATION IN ACADEMIC

LITERACIES: THE ETHNOGRAPHIC

IMPERATIVE

      Brian Street in conversation with Mary R. Lea and Theresa
      Lillis

        Brian Street is Professor Emeritus of Language in Education at King's College
        London and visiting Professor of Education in the Graduate School of Edu-
        cation, University of Pennsylvania. His anthropological fieldwork on literacy
        in Iran during the 1970s and his theoretical work articulating an "ideological
        model" of literacy are foundational in literacy studies. Together with Mary
        R. Lea, he carried out ethnographic research on writing and reading practices
        in UK universities and their 1998 paper is highly cited and debated. In this
        extract from ongoing conversations, several of them recorded, Brian discusses
        with Mary and Theresa the impact of his disciplinary roots--anthropology--
        for studying literacy and his perspective on the transformational orientation
        of academic literacies research and practice.

Theresa: In reflecting on what academic literacies is, I think it's important to con-
sider its strong ethnographic orientation. So I wonder if you can say something,
Brian, about the importance of your own research and disciplinary background, in
terms of anthropology and ethnography for developing this space--this particular
approach to writing, reading and knowledge-making in the academy.

Brian: I think for me it emerged from having spent years working in New Literacy
Studies which itself emerged from an anthropological perspective on language and
literacy and in particular the idea of using ethnographic perspectives to try to un-
derstand what people are actually doing in reading and writing. In the dominant
model--I work in development contexts, quite a lot, where the this model is very
influential--the dominant view tends to be, "people are illiterate, what you need
to do is pour literacy into them, and that once this is done other benefits will auto-
matically happen--social, economic etc." The ethnographic approach says, "Hang
on, look and listen to what literacy practices they're already engaged in." And very
often, the response to that will be "they don't have any, they're illiterate, they're
Street with Lea and Lillis

stupid." An ethnographic perspective forces you to suspend your own assumptions
as to what counts as literacy and to listen to and observe what people are actually
doing. So we've done a lot of that around the world in terms of the New Liter-
acy Studies. It involves challenging what we refer to as the autonomous model
of literacy, the assumption that literacy is just one uniform thing which happens
everywhere, and instead adopting an ideological model, which states that the ways
in which we understand reading and writing are always embedded in power rela-
tionships, ideologies, culture and meaning.

    And that was the basis for looking inside our own systems, in universities and
saying let's apply these ideas here. The dominant perspective here is not unlike the
developing world which is, "Here are these students arriving. Students can't write".
Lots of people say, "Nothing to do with me. I'm a tutor, I teach geography, eco-
nomics. Send them off and fix them." Pour the literacy into them. And what we--
Mary and I--began to develop--was an ethnographic perspective in the same way
as we had done in international contexts. We said, "Let's see what the students are
bringing with them." So one of the things that tells you is that firstly, students are
coming with a variety of ways of addressing reading and writing. The second thing
it tells you is that when they're in the universities in courses, the ways in which
they're expected to read and write vary from one subject to another. The dominant
model, the autonomous model says, literacy is literacy. When they arrive, if they
can do it, fine, if not fix them. And the academic literacies' view I think says there
are multiple versions of this thing "academic literacy"--most obviously that the
writing and the reading requirements of the different disciplines vary. An example I
remember from my own discipline, anthropology, was interviewing an anthropolo-
gist at a university who had marked a student essay and had written in red ink down
the side at the bottom, "You cannot write. Get down to the study skills centre."
And the student (we interviewed him as well) said, "I haven't a clue what they're
talking about! My main major is history. I get good marks; my tutors think I can
write. What's all this about?" And that's a classic example that what the disciplines
expect is quite different. And it's at the level not just of skill but of epistemology.
So in history when this student wrote an essay, the assumption was that you had a
sequence and the sequence was of time across periods which you then connected in
terms of causal events--what happened in nineteenth century England, the corn
laws may affect them then parliamentary moves in the late nineteenth century. In
anthropology, anthropologists are very wary of that sequential kind of evolutionary
move because that's how very often people have seen other societies and anthropol-
ogists challenge this linear sequencing and say they don't want a sequence from,
for example, so called primitive through to intermediate modern to postmodern.
What we want instead are, if you like, structural, post-structural accounts of social
institutions, meanings and people's own models of what goes on. And that's a big

one, people's own models. So apply that to the different disciplines and the writing of
the essay in anthropology, the epistemological, ideological, academic literacy per-
spective and assumptions are so different. And this student--and lots of students
we encountered--have to learn to switch and very often their own tutors don't
realize this because they're sitting in their own little edifice: the history guy sits here
and anthropology there. And they say, "Nothing to do with me. I'm not a linguist
I shouldn't have to teach academic literacy--they should know that already." What
they don't necessarily recognize is that they are actually making epistemological,
ideological literacy assumptions about what they think is a good essay--and the
other tutor will have a different view. Students often recognize it slightly more--
particularly if they're taking mixed degrees. You take business studies, you're doing
economics one term, sociology another, business planning management another,
and each of those will have their own conceptions as to what counts as thinking
and what counts as writing. Now you know it sounds simple enough when I put it
like that but actually, it does involve some kind of transformation of what counts as
writing at university in the thinking and in the eyes of the tutors.

Theresa: So that kind of transformation is in terms of the tutors' own understand-
ings of what's involved?

Brian: Yes and in fact that's one of the big issues. I taught a course at the Univer-
sity of Pennsylvania where we examined these issues with post graduate students
and they began to unpick "hidden features" of academic writing (see Fischer this
volume, chapter 5). They'd been told what the explicit features were you know,
paragraphs, spelling, layout but there were also lots of hidden features--such as
notions of tone, voice, and stance. Tutors implicitly used these hidden features to
mark essays but they weren't made explicit. One point that this illustrates is that it's
not just the students who need support--and if you like transformation--it's the
tutors. And trying to take that idea into the universities and say, okay, you want to
enhance the writing practices of students on degrees, so maybe it isn't enough just
to address the students, maybe you also need to address the faculty and there you
do come up against a block quite often (for further analysis and discussion, see also
Tuck Chapter 14 and Roozen et al. Chapter 15 this volume).

Theresa: So, one goal of Academic Literacies drawing upon ethnography is to make
visible the multiple literacies and the fact that in universities there are different
practices, different rhetorical and epistemological practices associated with differ-
ent disciplines. One pedagogical implication could be in terms of practice. That
what tutors and students need to do is to make visible those conventions--as they
currently exist--and to induct people into those practices. So to make visible, using
whichever tools we have, and obviously there are strong traditions for doing this--
like EAP, English for academic purposes and Contrastive Rhetoric--which have

                                                                                                    385

worked hard to identify, label, make visible and teach key textual and rhetorical
features. So I'm just wondering, from your perspective, is there a difference in terms
of what academic literacies seeks to identify, make visible or engage with?

Brian: Maybe there are two levels. The first is what we can think of as the access
level so Academic Literacies isn't rejecting study skills, socialization--the other
models--it is recognizing that those are necessary parts of the process, if you like,
of academic socialization. But in order to accomplish them you also need transfor-
mation at two levels: one is transformation at the level where the tutors themselves
recognize that they actually have a contribution to make to the teaching and learn-
ing of writing. That writing isn't something separate. This is something that for ex-
ample Sally Mitchell and colleagues have worked very hard at and is obviously a key
goal in WAC and WID (see Russell and Mitchell this volume, Reflections 2). But
the other level--and the bigger one--which became very obvious when working
with mature students (I think some of your work dealt with this, Theresa) where
you get people in midlife coming back to university who've been writing in many
ways--maybe they've worked as nurses and had to write reports--and maybe now
they've hit university and the tutor says "you can't write". Gradually what comes
out is the recognition that this is a different literacy practice and what you would
hope is a kind of negotiation: the student saying "I'm not entirely convinced that
the genre you're requiring for this discipline is actually the best way to go about
it" and the tutor saying "I don't necessarily think that what you learnt in writing
reports as a nurse is the same as what a degree requires which is reflexive critical,
analytic writing." What I would say is, Okay let's negotiate that difference. That's a
transformation. That's a totally different ideological relationship between tutor and
student and between discipline and professional practice. From a literacies--and
academic literacies view--we'd say let's look more closely at what the students are
bringing and look more closely at what the tutors are expecting, then let's talk
about how the two can mesh together.

Mary: I agree and this was my starting point in the early 90s (Lea, 1994). Now,
I'm thinking about this question and notion of transformation--what it is and the
extent to which it is a goal or value of Academic literacies research and pedagogy.
Where do you see "transformation" in relation to our 1998 article?

Brian: I don't think that you and I were directly concerned with issues of transfor-
mation in the article but we were concerned with issues of power in and around
student writing and in taking a specific institutional perspective. Our interest was
in power as process rather than structure and our aim was to make this process evi-
dent. We were definitely articulating what we might call a "change agenda," which
looking back on it now was quite strongly transformational--but maybe not quite
in the Lillis and Scott (2007) sense.

386
                                                                                                      Reflections 5

    There are probably always going to be tensions between the normative and
transformative and how you actually instantiate what we called an academic lit-
eracies model in practice. In some ways, supporting people to access and engage
in literacy practices that are valued, and ultimately powerful, may appear to be
normative rather than transformative. So I think there are always going to be ten-
sions between these perspectives. When we start looking at power it leads us to
ask questions about who has control over resources, what counts as knowledge
or how knowledge is articulated. I think both of us would say that it is issues of
power that run through academic literacies' work in different contexts. That's where
our key issues lay and this is what we were trying to tease out. Central to this, of
course, was our institutional framing, which was not just about students and their
writing. Maybe inevitably though--because the institutional lens is always on the
student--it was that focus which got taken up and, of course, our three models
were articulated around approaches to student writing.

Mary: Yes, I think our interest was as much with tutors and broader institutional
practices as with students. One thing that happened was that in the interviews the
tutors began to give us documents around writing as they talked about their prac-
tices. So we collected a vast range of unsolicited data, in terms of documentation,
which foregrounded this institutional perspective. It was these documents, coupled
with our observations within the different institutions, that made the institutional
perspective so prominent.

Brian: Indeed. And our 1998 paper encompassed that institutional focus in the
"academic literacies" approach, which we contrasted with "study skills" or "academ-
ic socialization." Our intention here was to foreground aspects of practice which
had significant implications for teacher-student interactions around writing. In
that respect we argued that practice around student writing is always located in re-
lations of power and authority and never reducible to sets of skills and competences
necessary for success in the academy. In fact, we recognized then, and it has been
made apparent in subsequent work, that we should not simply separate the three
"models" with water tight boundaries. They are not discrete, and indeed aspects of
each may be evident in the others.

Mary: An important point. I think one way of understanding that relationship is
to take a specific example, like "genre conventions." Traces of these are likely to be
found in all three models in practice but what would be significant analytically is the
way in which genre is being articulated, often implicitly, in different institutional
contexts. "Study skills" can be identified through prescriptive attention to the formal
linguistic features of genre conventions in generic models of academic writing, for
example, "you shouldn't use the first person." "Academic socialization" could involve
disciplinary specialists working with students to help them understand how to rec-

                                                                                                    387
Street with Lea and Lillis

ognize specific disciplinary or subject based genres such as "writing about theory and
practice in social work courses." Issues of genre can also be approached through an
academic literacies lens. Rather than focusing on genre features or what they look
like--teaching genres--an academic literacies perspective is concerned with reveal-
ing how genres create knowledge in particular ways. Or as Fiona English argues, (see
Chapter 17) what genres actually do. From an academic literacies perspective, this
involves working with both students and their teachers to make visible the differ-
ent ways in which particular genres shape knowledge and, ultimately offer students
more control over them and over meaning making processes. In each instance genre
is made visible. The contrasting ways in which this is being done in relation to each
of the three approaches, study skills, academic socialization, academic literacies, sig-
nals difference in the relationships of power and authority between the participants
involved and their engagement and control over meaning making resources. None
of this can be decoupled from institutional decision making about where and how
to locate work around writing and the values and beliefs which underpin this. What
we pointed to in the 1998 paper was that the analytical lens offered by academic
literacies research makes the workings of such institutional practice visible. So this
picks up on the question Theresa asks previously--"Is there a difference in terms of
what academic literacies seeks to identify, make visible or engage with?"

Theresa: Yes indeed. Thinking again about the dominant model of literacy that you
were problematizing in the 1998 paper--I'm wondering whether you see such a
model adversely affecting students from all social groups. I'm thinking about liter-
acy and language, and thinking both locally within the United Kingdom and then
globally--if we think of the position of English in academia, both in publishing
but also in its increasing use as a medium for higher education. If there's an ideo-
logical notion of a standard literacy/language doesn't this have particular negative
repercussions for groups of people from particular social classes--working class--
or backgrounds--users of English as a second language etc.

Brian: Maybe it worked under imperialism--the idea that, "we'll take this narrow
standardized view of English and we'll make that the standard for people moving
up the system." But this has never worked in actual communicative practice. For
example, I was in Singapore at a project meeting where people were speaking ver-
sions of English and Hindi and Arabic; so what we actually ended up speaking
around the table was a mix. At the same time, you can go into a UK classroom
if the teacher is just trying to teach standard English; well these kids are coming
from such mixed experience of everyday life that this standardized dominant mod-
el in southern England doesn't bear much relation to the world they are actually
living in. So it becomes rather isolated. You can use it for a while to set supposed
standards, tick for this kind of accent and this grammar but once they go out into

jobs and start working, particularly international business it looks rather quaint
and irrelevant and all the research shows that. I've more recently been working in
Brazil where universities are expanding and you're seeing the usual statements and
arguments, "Oh look, these nontraditional students, they can't write! Send them to
the skills centre! What are we doing with them at university?"

    An academic literacies view would say, hang on, slow down. Let's look more
closely at what the students bring in. Then let's look at what the tutors are ex-
pecting. Then let's talk about how the two can mesh together. Let's negotiate this.
And recognize that it will vary from one department to another, from one year to
another, from one university to another. And that can create all kinds of resistance
amongst those people who want to a have some kind of uniform standard. That is a
big issue that needs addressing. You can have uniform standards that are, so to say,
monolingual/monoliterate, or you can have uniform standards that involve mul-
tilingual variety and diversity. So there's a communicative point here, do we want
people to communicate? Or do we want them to be able to tick boxes to say they've
met some obscure but rather irrelevant standard?

Theresa: You've both been working this area--both in terms of new literacies and
academic literacies--for some considerable time in a whole range of contexts. Are
there particular challenges or priorities you see for people working in this area, both
in terms of research and in terms of practice. Are there things you think we really
need to pay significant attention to?

Mary: My concern is just how intransigent the deficit model is--even when people
are using the term "academic literacies" to describe what they do, in practice there
still seems to be slippage into "fixing" particular groups of student. More recently
I've been working on literacies and digital landscapes and the use of the term "dig-
ital literacy/ies" is fraught with similar problems. I think that wherever "literacies"
is taken up across post-compulsory education there is a real danger that it loses it
critical edge and becomes decoupled from fundamental issues of power and author-
ity. The challenge for me is how we can regain "literacies" and all that the plural use
signals in terms of contested practice.

Brian: One metaphor I'd use comes from the person from Algeria who was ap-
pointed to follow Kofi Annan as the UN representative in Syria. He said, "All I can
see in front of me is a wall but I know that walls have cracks in them and that's what
I'm going to work on." So that's what we're doing. Universities look like walls but
there are some cracks. The main cracks are the number of students who are seen
as failing, who drop out. And the phrase that tutors in this country use as much
as anywhere is that "students cannot write." So let's address that head on and say,
what does that mean? And what we can do about it? And an academic literacies

                                                                                                    389

view I think can offer a much more constructive view than study skills, academ-
ic socialization, EAP--even some of the rhetoric in the United States which can
get narrow--because academic literacies says "let's question our assumptions about
what counts and how we've arrived at it." And it could be that by challenging our
assumptions we can explain why large numbers of students who could otherwise do
well are being thrown out of the system. So that's the little gap in the wall I think
that we might make our way through.

RESISTING THE NORMATIVE?
NEGOTIATING MULTILINGUAL
IDENTITIES IN A COURSE
FOR FIRST YEAR HUMANITIES
STUDENTS IN CATALONIA, SPAIN

      Angels Oliva-Girbau and Marta Milian Gubern

    In 1999, 30 countries signed the Bologna declaration, which would set the
grounds for the creation and development of the European Higher Education Area,
aimed at making European universities more competitive by progressively elimi-
nating the area's segmentation and by increasing student and teacher mobility (for
details, see http://www.ehea.info). The subsequent process of adaptation caused
a general upheaval in Catalan academia, as many students and teachers resisted
what they perceived as a move towards the marketization of higher education. The
Bologna process had a strong impact on the structure of new degrees and on the
working patterns of university professors of all levels due to the introduction of
seminar work at undergraduate level and more student-focused pedagogies. It also
dramatically shifted the language balance towards English. As a result the already
complicated balance between Catalan and Spanish in education and research is
now being reconceptualized to make room for English and its prevalence as the
academic language of prestige. These efforts towards internationalization have af-
fected students' and faculty's relationship to their background languages and their
self-image as members of academia.

    This chapter looks at the effects on students' attitudes and beliefs, of learning
to operate within academic genres in English. It focusses on a first year course in
the Humanities designed to compensate for the lack of previous programmes in
writing instruction and students' low English language proficiency whilst helping
them develop an academic identity. Both ourselves and our students are members
of a multilingual community in which a minority language (Catalan) coexists with
Spanish and other foreign languages, a community that is being pressurised to
adopt English as the key to internationalization. We argue that teaching method-
ologies based on an academic literacies approach can increase students' awareness

of the elements that make up academic communication, help them analyze the
inter-relationships between these elements, and challenge the status quo in which
minority languages and their speakers are marginalized from the construction of
knowledge. However, we acknowledge the difficulty of engaging students in con-
testing academic genres and roles at a stage when they are still struggling to become
part of the academic community.

DEVELOPING ACADEMIC LITERACIES
AT UNIVERSITAT POMPEU FABRA (UPF)

    Within the Bologna process, the new Humanities degree at UPF (Barcelona,
Spain) requires students to enroll in subjects taught in English to graduate. This de-
gree starts with a two-year period of general courses, followed by a specialized sec-
ond cycle. The general period includes two instrumental courses aimed at preparing
students to deal with the genres of the different disciplines within the Humanities
(Art, History, Literature, Philosophy, and such), one in Catalan/Spanish and one in
English, both during students' first year. Both subjects need to overcome students'
resistance to academic know-how courses.

    In the new European context, academic literacy entails for our Humanities stu-
dents the mastering of academic genres in students' two mother tongues (Catalan
and Spanish), and in English, with German or French courses available as well.
Academic genres, can be regarded as 1) the mediating instruments of academic in-
teraction; 2) the prevailing form of assessment; 3) tools of learning and knowledge
construction; and 4) marks of identity. Academic genres are students' key to their
permanence at university and their long-term learning. Becoming participants in
the academic community requires students to accept the entry rules of the commu-
nity, have their participation sanctioned by the expert members of the communi-
ties, and actively participate in the exchanges of the community so as to be eligible
for acceptance and show adherence to the community. Alongside and through aca-
demic genres, students are expected to acquire the community's collective goals and
knowledge, and prove their value as valid members of this community.

         Academic writing, like all forms of communication, is an act
         of identity: it not only conveys disciplinary "content" but also
         carries a representation of the writer ... our discoursal choices
         align us with certain values and beliefs that support particular
         identities. (Ken Hyland, 2004, p. 1092)

    However, the process of initiation can be problematic for students, as academic
genres can sometimes contradict discourse practices that identify them as part of
their home community, and therefore challenge their values and identity.

    Because of the gradual process through which new members acquire the genres

of a discipline, writing ends up seeming a transparent thing, the simple transcrip-
tion of knowledge and research, what David Russell (1991) called the myth of trans-
parency. As a result professors often misinterpret students' difficulties learning to
read and use genres. The myth of transience (Mike Rose, 1985; Russell, 1991) helps
the academics mask their lack of involvement in students' acquisition of academic
genres behind the assumption that past students did not need any further instruc-
tion, and that it is a problem with the present students only. Such misconceptions
about how students acquire discipline-specific ways of communicating can lead to
a negative view of students' struggles to become part of the academic community,
with language and literacy becoming visible only as a problem to be fixed through
additional or remedial measures (Theresa Lillis & Mary Scott, 2007).

    For non-native English speakers, academic literacy involves an extra challenge,
as the practices of the different linguistic communities cannot be automatically
transferred, even within the same discipline. Apart from the language-related issues
they may find, students are hindered by their own rhetorical identities, which "may
be shaped by very different traditions of literacy" (Hyland, 2004, p. 1091-1092),
determined by often implicit cultural-specific issues that cause a "crisis of represen-
tation and associated instability of meaning" (Barry Smart, 1999, p. 38). Students'
contribution to collective knowledge, and hence their value within the academic
community, is thus undermined by their image as poor producers of academic
discourse in the language of prestige (Aya Matsuda, 2003; Marko Modiano, 1999).

    Based on her study of international students' writing in German, Stella Büker
(2003) classified into four categories students' conflicts in writing academic papers
in a foreign language: the content-specific level, the domain-specific procedural lev-
el, the level of cultural coinage, and the foreign language proficiency level. The first
level covers subject knowledge, as first-year students feel extremely inexperienced
regarding the knowledge of their discipline. Field-specific procedural knowledge re-
fers to the generic conventions that characterize academic writing--students' need
to employ the procedures typical of the field, even if they have not had any specific
instruction in them. Regarding the problems derived from cultural coinage, the
conventions of particular academic communities are strongly influenced by their
different traditions, with, for example, the Anglo-American style being quite dif-
ferent from the Continental style of academic writing (see Lotte Rienecker & Peter
Stray Jörgensen, 2003). Such cultural differences affect both the focus and the form
of the academic genres members write in, and do not solely depend on the language
they are written in. When writing essays, students need to cope with planning,
revising, and putting down in words their ideas according to a topic and a set of
formal rules they are new to. Simultaneously, they need to deal with their deficits
in foreign language competence, even if they choose to do part of the task in their
mother tongue to avoid this problem. However, the main issue regarding foreign
language proficiency is that the students' language issues mask their difficulties at

                                                                                                    393

other levels, as we observed in a preliminary study (Angels Oliva-Girbau, 2011).
Students writing in L2 tend to see their lack of competence in L2 as the only source
of their problems in writing, disregarding the cultural, discipline-specific and pro-
cedural problems they may have.

ACTIVITIES TO DISPEL THE TRANSPARENCY OF WRITING

    The materials for the first-year course on English for the Humanities are aimed
at promoting students' explicit discussion and contestation of their own developing
identities within the activity system of the Humanities as a way to scaffold their
acquisition of the tools and goals of the academic community. It is our belief that
such programmes should include not only textual and contextual work, but also
opportunities to reflect on and negotiate identity issues, which can contribute to
empowering students to see themselves as valid members of the academic com-
munity. During the first two years of the study, we interviewed volunteer students
and distributed questionnaires in order to assess the materials and adapt them to
the context of the new Humanities degree. However, the number of students who
participated in the voluntary interviews was too low to be considered representative
of the students' situation. Consequently, during the third iteration of the course,
we decided to use students' writing on the course as data for our research as well,
in order to provide us with an emic perspective of students' process of initiation.
The reflective activities used in the course have two goals. First, to foster students'
development of their academic persona through the study of academic genres in
relation to the other components of the academic community. Second, to guide
students towards awareness and reflective analysis of the ambivalence latent in their
negotiation of difference between their previous identities and their academic ones,
so that they may become capable of managing their construction of a new academic
identity.

    In order to reach these learning goals, the course instructors 1) teach students
about the components of the academic community in which they intend to partic-
ipate and offer them opportunities to reflect on them through the analysis of texts;
2) promote students' awareness of the cultural, ideological and linguistic aspects
underlying the nature and mechanics of Anglo-American style genres in compar-
ison to Continental genres and how these determine their relation to the other
components of the academic community; and 3) provide room for discussing the
conflicts students experience regarding the construction of their own identities in
relation to their initiation into the academic community, contesting institutional
views on literacy, knowledge, language choices and power relations.

    Activities are intended to promote awareness, analysis and contestation. These
responses do not exclude each other, but occur in a continuum, as awareness leads
to analysis, and both are necessary to create opportunities for students to challenge

their novice status, identity and possibilities within the system. Awareness activities
refers to tasks aimed at raising students' awareness of the nature of the academic
community and its components. Analysis refers to activities that guide students'
analysis of the genres of the discipline and the underlying assumptions that deter-
mine their functions and features. The third category, contestation, covers activities
that provide room for discussion and challenging of the academic community and
its components, students' role, and their process of initiation. As an illustration, we
present two activities that were carried out during the first weeks and the last weeks
of the term respectively.

    First, as follow-up to a whole-group discussion in seminar two, we designed a
collaborative task in which students had to tell out of a list of descriptors which
ones corresponded to canonical Anglo-American or Continental genres, regardless
of the language in which they were written but on the basis of the contents, the
writer's approach, structural features, and such. The list of descriptors was based
on the work of Rienecker and Stray Jörgensen (2003), and adapted to students'
language level. In an on-line forum, students presented one or two of the items
they had chosen and justified their decision in a short paragraph. Firstly, we want-
ed students to become aware of the cultural differences across different discourse
communities. Secondly, we wanted students to see the connection between the
adoption of certain genres and the cognitive processes involved in the construction
and communication of knowledge. And thirdly, we wanted them to develop their
own approach to somewhere in the continuum between Anglo-American and Con-
tinental genres, and take control of their discoursal choices to construct their own
identity as writers. When presenting the task in class, we used practical examples
and students' own experiences to help them understand the descriptors. However,
the exercise made students think that there is a prescriptive dividing line between
genres in one tradition and another, and it made them link genres to the languages
they are written in. Indeed, students viewed their own genres, cognitive processes
and identities as defective and inadequate, in opposition to those of native English
speakers. Writing in Catalan or Spanish became something wrong, something to
be done as a last resort.

    Towards the end of the course, our second activity was introduced. Based on Hal-
liday's functional components of discourse, it aimed at raising students' awareness
of the way genres do things with words, i.e., the functional components of genres
and how they are realized by textual features. Additionally it aimed to expose the
context beyond texts, and to look at the relationship genres establish between mem-
bers of the community, between writers and their individual and collective goals,
and between writers and their texts. The third goal was to help students reflect on
the extent to which a writer's expert/novice status determines the choice of specific
generic features, giving students the chance to challenge the transparency of writing
by exposing the rules of the game. For every section of an essay (introduction, body

                                                                                                    395

and conclusion), students had to write a list of the functions that different sentences
performed in it--such as attracting the readers' attention, illustrating one's argu-
ments, acknowledging the limitations of one's research, and so on. These functions
were then connected to a diagram showing academia as an activity system ( Yrjö En-
geström, 1995; Alexei Leontiev, 1978; David Russell & Arturo Yáñez, 2003) made
up of subjects who share some common goals which they try to achieve using tools
and patterns of interaction that are unique to that community. Students analyzed a
sample paragraph from one of the three sections using the list of functions they had
previously written, connecting linguistic resources to functions. At the end of the
session, students were asked to guess the status of the writers, and their relationship
to the other elements of the activity system, using quotes from the texts as evidence.
For example, the use of hedging in the results section often signaled the writer's lack
of commitment to the contents of the paragraph, and hence his/her novice status.
The use of canonical ("expert") and non-canonical (written by previous students,
for example) paragraphs provided students with a wide range of language resources
to implement, and exposed the heterogeneity of academic genres regardless of their
language and field of use. Though the activity also presented non-expert, non-na-
tive speakers as efficient communicators, we were interested to note that students'
contributions systematically failed to acknowledge this, hence ignoring the gradual
progress in their own and their peers' progress from novice to expert status.

GENRES, IDENTITY, AND THE BUILDING OF AN INCLUSIVE
ACADEMIC COMMUNITY

    The data we gathered through students' participation in these activities shows
an increased awareness of other levels of difficulty besides their foreign language
skills. Thus, their trouble understanding and producing such genres was no longer
purely linguistic, but also determined by cultural differences, problems finding an
audience, lack of content and procedural knowledge, status, and such:

         It's very difficult to change our way of thinking .... I start writing
         in English, but then I forget a lot of things that I wanted to write,
         therefore I first write in Spanish or Catalan and then I translate to
         English. Well, I know it's wrong but if I write directly in English I
         can't control my ideas.

    When asked in different activities to reflect on their problems with academic
genres in English, students realized that they lacked control over content, form,
audience and reception. Even though this lack of control existed in their native
language(s) too, it was exposed even more clearly by their deficiencies in writing in
English, and because of the different planning and writing processes Anglo-Amer-

396

ican writing requires from them. As a consequence, their still insecure academic
identity was undermined by their inability to communicate transparently using
academic genres, certainly in their L1, but even more so in English where they
struggled between their will to create and their will to communicate: "I can start
writing only when my thoughts are totally structured and when I know how I am
going to conclude. So I have the feeling of being paralyzed for a while before start-
ing the writing"; "I often explain more things than are necessary and I often expand
the topic and add some new ones, which is not correct in English texts."

    Students' wish to contribute was still strongly individualistic, rather a personal
challenge than a contribution to collective goals. They felt that they needed to as-
sert the legitimacy of their belonging to the academic community, which depended
solely on their ability to articulate their contributions in an academic manner and
submit them to the approval of an audience superior in status to them. In this
respect, academic socialization overlaps first-year students' entrance into maturity
and their reach for new more powerful and independent roles. At this point, reas-
serting their academic identities was much more important as an individual goal
than the collective goals and patterns of interaction established by the community;
the social construction of knowledge is not feasible when one cannot see oneself as
a legitimate member of the community. Students felt they were constantly in com-
petition with one another: when asked about the functions of conclusions, their
replies were "to undermine the opponent," "to defend your point of view," and "to
completely convince your reader."

    The data gathered during the final seminars of the course seems to indicate that
students reached a later stage of their process of initiation. The students who were
committed to the seminar work appeared to feel more confident regarding the le-
gitimacy of their academic identity, and their capacity to participate meaningfully
in the construction of the ideational contents of their area of interest. In the last
questionnaire, one of the students stated that he/she felt:

         ... prepared to write texts that have coherence, cohesion and a
         complete, clear sense. It is very important, because in this way
         we can express our opinion impersonally, and we will be listened
         to by the world.

    Students' struggle with the acquisition of academic genres is tied up with the
conflicts derived from their process of initiation into the academic community.
Explicit discussion of this process helped deny the transparency of academic genres,
and exposed students' difficulties, thus changing their focus from language to con-
tent, and from tools to goals, functions and relationships. By gaining a deeper
understanding of how to use generic tools and how genres shape/are shaped by
identity, students appeared to gain more control of the image they project and their

                                                                                                    397

relationship to the ideational contents of the Humanities and other members of the
system. More control means that students may be able to make their own choices
by connecting, through generic patterns, their construction of their academic iden-
tity and their representations of the elements that make up the community.

    Language-wise, students started the term in denial of English and the genres
they associated with this language. Then, as the term progressed, they reversed this
attitude to place English as the only language of true academic communication, in
opposition to the creative capabilities of their mother tongue and the genres asso-
ciated with it, which students saw as relegated to private use. The contributions of
students attending the seminars--and the silence of the absentees--evidence the
fragility of students' academic identities. Students either discarded their previous
identities (linked to their mother tongue) as inadequate, or refused to join the part
of the academic community that regards English as its lingua franca. Throughout
the course, we failed to engage students in the series of opportunities the materials
offered for contestation: we found no evidence of a student daring to challenge the
prevalence of English. On the contrary, students seemed to accept their subordinate
position because of their inability to change their background, cognitive processes,
and identities. Rather than challenging academic genres and the cognitive process-
es and values associated to them, the students who participated in the seminars
embraced Anglo-American academic genres as the solution to their communica-
tion issues. Students linked their reading and writing problems to their identities
as Catalan/Spanish writers. By rejecting genres in these languages, they distanced
themselves from the apparently defective cognitive processes and status associated
with users of less prominent genres and languages.

    The increasing internationalization of academia and the widespread view of
English as its lingua franca can create a barrier for students from other language
backgrounds, preventing them from entering the new European university or lead-
ing them to view their own language and culture as inferior to it. However, students
need not be acculturated into the system, as their other identities can contribute
to enrich the academic community. In the new academic community, there should
be room for different views, genres, languages and the different contributions all
these can make. When designing materials for non-native speakers, it is important
to emphasize the multiplicity of literacies in academia, and their corresponding
cognitions, identities and goals. As discussed in this chapter, the course activities
designed within a more genre-based pedagogy sometimes narrowed students' view
of the components of academic communication, and mistakenly presented dom-
inant academic genres as the only possible option. On the other hand, the ma-
terials designed according to the principles of academic literacies were successful
in increasing students' awareness of and capacity to analyze the components of
academic communication, and exposed to some extent the power relations that are
established, negotiated and challenged using genres, between users, communities

and languages.
    Only within the context of plural literacies can minority languages retain their

purpose and relevance. If we fail to enable students to challenge the status quo and
lead them to accept English as the only language of academic communication,
we are depriving their native tongue of prestige, and we are depriving them of the
opportunity to create and contribute meaningfully to the social construction of
knowledge. In fact, the notion of a unique academic literacy would create a linguis-
tic elite and ignore valuable academic contributions just because they come from
the fringes of the system.

ACADEMIC LITERACIES AND
THE EMPLOYABILITY CURRICULUM:
RESISTING NEOLIBERAL EDUCATION?

Catalina Neculai

Against an increasingly oppressive corporate-based globalism, educators and
other cultural workers need to resurrect a language of resistance and possibil-
ity, a language that embraces a militant utopianism, while being constantly
attentive to those forces which seek to turn such hope into a new slogan, or
to punish and dismiss those who dare look beyond the horizon of the given.

                                                           - Henry A. Giroux, 2007

    Academic literacies research (hereafter AcLits) has keenly scrutinized the rap-
port between the knowledge and pedagogies of academic writing in higher educa-
tion institutions and the dominant "institutional order of discourse" (Theresa Lillis,
2001). This sustained scrutiny has produced an understanding of academic literacy
that runs against and problematizes the dominant ideological basis of the academy.
Moreover, AcLits has regarded the mainstream institutional outlook on academic
literacy as a homogenizing force which appears to sand down the differentials in
students' academic, social, and cultural writing practices and identities across the
university. In response to this academic homogenization, AcLits has recognized
the plurality and heterogeneity of academic literacy (see the AcLits special issue of
The Journal of Applied Linguistics 4(1)) and offered solutions for active dialogic and
transparent writing pedagogies (Lillis, 2001, 2005). Since the birth of AcLits in
the 1990s, such theorizing has taken place against the backdrop of an increasingly
neoliberal educational apparatus that has sought to link the formation and muta-
tions of a particular subject--in university parlance, the formation of a particular
graduate--with the economic system of business and enterprise. This neoliberal
educational project has gained dominance by means of certain "techniques of the
self " (Graham Burchell, 1996), amongst which the skills-driven curriculum of em-
ployability is the most evident.

    While AcLits has not overtly engaged with the neoliberal essence of today's high-
er education institutional order of discourse (for a veiled attempt, see Paul Sutton,
2011), it may provide a solid research matrix for interrogating the neoliberal agenda,
and particularly its underlying assumptions with regard to the teaching and learning

DOI: https://doi.org/10.37514/PER-B.2015.0674.2.30                                  401

of academic writing. AcLits may not offer an immediate solution or programmatic
response to neoliberal institutional practices but it could help writing teachers and
researchers in their various local contexts envisage possibilities for contestation, re-
sistance or change (for "utopian pedagogies" of resistance against neoliberalism, see
Mark Coté, Richard J. F. Day & Greig de Peuter, 2007). In this transformative spir-
it, two questions need to be asked: how can we make academic writing less instru-
mental in the reproduction of the neoliberal order? How can we shift our language
and pedagogies in order to subvert rather than maintain this order?

    In this chapter, I explore possible answers to these questions by focusing on a
specific programme initiated at Coventry University, UK, which aims at increas-
ing students' "employability" after graduation (for details, see http://www.coventry.
ac.uk/study-at-coventry/student-support/enhance-your-employability/add-van-
tage/). This undergraduate scheme, referred to as Add+Vantage modules, includes
modules on academic writing which are delivered by the Centre for Academic Writ-
ing (CAW) and in my discussion I focus in particular on a third year module, "Aca-
demic Writing: Your Dissertation or Final Year Project." In my analysis, I implicitly
acknowledge the institutional, curricular, disciplinary, and social spaces of academic
literacies afforded by the employability curriculum while trying to project a coun-
terhegemonic stance in line with the AcLits position formulated at the start. My
argument is that, in pertaining to the employability scheme, the teaching of aca-
demic writing suffers from an inescapable double bind of compliance and resistance
with the neoliberal order. On the one hand, CAW's undergraduate writing provision
mainly exists because of this neoliberal agenda whereby a new university like ours
seeks to trace students' post-graduation career pathways. On the other hand, the
very existence of this provision is vulnerable as it depends, in turn, on the existence
of the employability scheme and on the ways in which the scheme chooses to define
and make room for the teaching and learning of academic writing. This institutional
vulnerability of our modules means that attempting to question or challenge the
neoliberal status quo, its language and writing ideologies is fraught with difficulties.

    At this point, a couple of caveats are worth noting. Firstly, I articulate the fol-
lowing viewpoints and interpretations in my capacity as convenor for the Disserta-
tion module as well as a member of the team of lecturers at CAW who deliver the
suite of academic writing courses (hence the use of the collective "we," representing
our joint efforts to streamline the modules). Secondly, I avow an ideological bias
against the dominant neoliberal values in higher education whereby the teaching
and learning of academic writing are simply instrumental in the production of
"commercially oriented professionals" (Kathleen Lynch, 2006, p. 2). Instead, I
conceive of academic writing development as a process of consciousness-raising, a
democratization of literacy practices, conducive to personal and collective intellec-
tual, social and cultural development.

ACADEMIC WRITING IN THE NEOLIBERAL UNIVERSITY

    The values, principles and relations in our society are dictated by the values,
principles and relations in the marketplace. Succinctly put, this equation represents
the nature of neoliberal ideology, which underlies the contemporary culture of com-
mercial profit, entrepreneurship, commodification and flexible specialization (for a
brief, yet compelling analysis of neoliberalism, see David Harvey, 2005). The im-
plications for higher education in the trans-Atlantic space have been highly visible:
the heavy privatization of its resources (Lynch, 2006), the unabashed promotion of
a market-driven and market-targeted educational system, the loss of critical literacy
(Henry A. Giroux, 2011), "the cult of expertise" (Giroux, 2008, p. 1), increasingly
blunted capacities for democratization, civic engagement, and academic freedom
from the constraints of the market (Giroux, 2008). Academic "performativity" (Ste-
phen J. Ball, 2012), audit and measurements of impact, satisfaction, and perfor-
mance have become unquestioned systemic currencies in the neoliberal academy.

    One of the local consequences of the neoliberal order has been an institutional
concern with employability as a set of formally acquired skills, knowledge and com-
petences. According to this agenda, reaching "the positive destination" at the end
of the university degree is more than an accidental or implicit bonus of learning
and participating in the university cultures, of studying a discipline or a number
of interrelated disciplines. Employment is regarded as the net result of strategic
teaching and learning of work-related skills, supplemented by privileged access to
the world of employers and employment throughout the duration of the degree.
In the United Kingdom, new universities which, historically, have a vocational
orientation, have been even more attuned to the employability programme. Cov-
entry University, in particular, has introduced the Add+Vantage scheme in line
with its corporate mission: "employability, enterprise and entrepreneurship" (Cov-
entry University, 2012b). While the university prides itself on its entrepreneurial
achievements, it also measures its success by the support offered to its students and
by aiming to create cohesive communities and viable local and trans-local partner-
ships. This apparent antinomy between a calculative, market-driven institutional
spirit and a humanistic inclination is also built into the university's undergraduate
employability curriculum.

    The Add+Vantage scheme is intended to add employability value in two ways.
Firstly, it seeks to cultivate in students a set of personal competences required in
the labour market, such as flexibility, decisiveness, self-confidence, or reflectiveness,
alongside a set of pragmatic abilities such as problem solving or written/oral com-
munication skills. Secondly, it attempts to produce a number of pre-defined selves:
the "global," the "creative," the "entrepreneurial," the "influential," the "communi-
ty-focused," or the "e-graduate" (Coventry University, 2012a).

                                                                                                    403
Neculai

    The range of themes under which the various modules are offered include: work
experience and skills, global languages and perspectives, enterprise and entrepre-
neurship, professional accreditation and development, and research skills. While
the scheme is administratively coordinated by the Careers Office, its component
modules are designed and delivered by academic staff in faculties and departments.
Departmental boards of study assure the quality of the module design, delivery and
assessment while student surveys measure satisfaction rates. Add+Vantage serves all
three years of study and although peripheral to the degree curriculum, it is both a
credited and mandatory programme for all undergraduate students; in other words,
it is a prerequisite for graduation. Students enroll on the programme at the start of
every academic year and can choose a different module each year. Students' regis-
tration takes place on a first-come, first-served basis, which means that they may
not always be able to attend the module of their choice. Class numbers are limited
to 24 students, with a module spanning ten weeks, in two-hour weekly iterations.

    In the Add+Vantage programme, the modules offered by CAW sit under the
rubric of research skills. By taking part in the scheme alongside the other faculties,
the Centre for Academic Writing has gained a foothold in one strand of the uni-
versity curriculum which has opened up possibilities for participation in a faculty
board and in departmental affairs, for the creation of a new platform publicizing
and promoting the other kinds of writing facilitation at CAW as well as mediated
access to departmental resources and inside writing practices. Active cross-fertili-
sations happen between the teaching of writing through the scheme, the academic
writing tutors' one-to-one work with students and the lecturers' consultations with
academic staff on their teaching of writing in the disciplines. Thus opportunities
for a systemic, more complex approach to writing instruction within the university
become available to CAW (for a full profile of CAW, see Mary Deane & Lisa Ga-
nobcsik-Williams, 2012).

CHALLENGING DESIGN: WHICH LITERACY?
WHOSE LITERACY?

    In a neoliberal understanding, academic and workplace literacy are regarded
as co-extensive and become reified into something that is always already there in
the form of standards, norms, rules or correctness, said to be defined and dictated
a priori by employers (Romy Clark & Roz Ivanic, 1997, pp. 214-215; Fiona Do-
loughan, 2001, pp. 17, 24). Thus, literacy has become a catalyst in "the production
of particular kinds of knowledge and sanctioned knowers" (Cindi Katz, 2005, p.
231--emphasis mine), which places universities unapologetically, "at the heart of
the knowledge economy" (David Blunkett, as cited in Jonathan Rutherford, 2001;
Katharyne Mitchell, 2003, p. 397). It is in this sense that the pedagogization of
employability cannot be severed from "the pedagogization of literacy" (Brian Street,

404
                                                    Academic Literacies and the Employability Curriculum

1995, p. 113) whereby instilling knowledge of writing legitimates and scaffolds
graduates' future writing-intensive roles in the service economy. The production of
writing in the knowledge economy, characterized by a global reach and trans-na-
tional networked practices, is often seen, by employers and academic institutions
alike, to rest on a generic, stable literacy infrastructure which could be transferred
successfully from locale to locale due to the erosion of national economic and in-
dustrial boundaries. Employers' demands for demonstrable writing abilities are
thus oblivious to the contexts of various communicational acts (Doloughan, 2001,
p. 24) and writing practices. Such disregard for writing in context may in fact pre-
clude transferability and render the undifferentiated instruction of academic and
workplace literacies an unaccomplished project from the start.

    The writing ideology of transferability and objectification transpires in the ways
CAW is called upon to build and teach its three-year set of Add+Vantage mod-
ules, which, upon first reading, represent everything that the AcLits paradigm has
sought to debunk in the writing-qua-skills model. Firstly, the recruitment process
seldom permits students' enrolment on the CAW writing modules for three con-
secutive years, which thwarts possibilities for creating a developmental framework
akin to an undergraduate writing curriculum. Secondly, randomized enrolment
results in amalgamated cohorts of students with different disciplinary affiliations
that are difficult to manage pedagogically. Yet, these two insufficiencies of design
have not remained unchallenged. Historically, we have made efforts to channel the
enrolment process and cluster students in keeping with meaningful differences and
disciplinary affiliations. As a result, the former first year module "Introduction to
Writing at University," a generic, rite of passage-type of module, was divided into
three distinct paths: "Academic Writing for (Applied) Sciences," "Academic Writing
for Social Sciences," "Academic Writing for Arts and Humanities." While we ac-
knowledge the internal variations of these makeshift disciplinary formations (Mike
Baynham, 2000), controlled heterogeneity has secured a commonality of students'
academic affiliations, an academic lowest common denominator, which has helped
forge a more cohesive writing community with each Add+Vantage module and
class. Furthermore, in order to articulate the cultural and critical underpinnings of
literacy practices, another first year module has been developed: "English Academic
Writing in a Global Context." However, unlike year one provision, in the second
and third years, "Developing Academic Writing Skill" and "Academic Writing:
Your Dissertation or Final Year Project" do not, as yet, follow a disciplinary logic.

    There are also other, more subcutaneous ways in which we have questioned
the neoliberal underpinnings of the employability programme. Each module de-
scriptor (see Table 30.1) addresses the employability agenda in an oblique way by
highlighting the contribution of academic writing to students' developments in
their own fields of study while the lexicon of neoliberalism is almost absent in these
descriptors, thus creating a type of resistance through indifference. By engendering

                                                                                                    405

an elsewhere and a pretext for student writing that intersects with the curricular
space of subject degrees, the CAW writing modules also draw upon, help build or
even challenge disciplinary writing spaces. Moreover, through a series of "codes,"
such as genre, criticality, the concept of writing as a process and as discourse, the
module descriptors also create a space for academic writing as a field of knowledge
and practice in its own right. This epistemological space is further expanded and
explored through the writing-infused lexicon of the syllabi and assignment briefs,
and through the relational, writing-aware nature of seminar activities and assign-
ment production. Fully articulating and accounting for the disciplinary hybridity
of students as well as for the inherent variations in their individual writing expertise
and practice still remains a utopian project. However, the changes in design and
practice show that the CAW modules are not stagnant curricular and pedagogical
constructions.

THE DISSERTATION: ADVANCING INTELLECTUAL
LITERACIES

    One example of non-compliance is the third year module, "Academic Writing:
Your Dissertation or Final Year Project." This is a peculiar case in point not only
because of its great success amongst students (six different iterations are currently
being taught, with only three two years ago) but also due to its temporal proximity
to graduation and therefore to the much invoked "positive destination" (see for ex-
ample of this employability discourse http://www.pkc.gov.uk/CHttpHandler.ashx
?id=13188&p=0). Designed as a companion to students' processes and practices
of dissertation writing in their own subjects, the title unsettles the stability of the
dissertation genre by allowing for alternative final year research projects beside the
conventional dissertation. In some disciplines, such as engineering or performance
studies, the alternatives to dissertations are the report on design or the so-called
long essay. During the module, covert tensions exist, at times, between entrenched,
legitimized dissertation writing conventions, such as the classical IMRaD mac-
ro-structure (Introduction, Methods, Results, Discussion), and their disciplinary
or individual project variations, or between IMRaD structures in the social sci-
ences and thematic mappings in arts and humanities projects. Inevitably, depart-
mental academic writing cultures and departmental guidelines (where these exist)
also come into play, making the Add+Vantage module a site of debate over more
stable, consistent meanings of dissertation writing as product, process and practice.
In a sense, the module's success also stems from students' desire for coherent and
consolidated textual and research practices. That is why, turning atomized literacy
practices into synergetic ones, without homogenizing writing teaching and learn-
ing, is a primary pedagogic challenge.

                          nication

    In order to respond to this challenge, the main thrust of the module, which
guides my work as a pedagogue, is the advancement of intellectual literacies as a

                                                                                            407

complex set of literacy practices that are not simply entrenched in and determined
by academic, institutional imperatives. The logic is that by enhancing the intellec-
tuality of my teaching of writing, I implicitly minimize or disregard the mercantile
attributes of the neoliberal order. This task is even harder and very sensitive to
openly acknowledge in formal institutional settings, such as boards of study, since
the neoliberal educational status quo is generally maintained covertly through the
marketing of academic writing as a set of transferable, trans-local and trans-dis-
ciplinary competences. In its attempts to probe the depths of final year academic
writing for research, the module draws attention to the linkages that exist between
modes of active reading, active thinking, and active writing inside and outside of
academia. The dissertation becomes then a pretext for such probing. I do not wish,
however, to invalidate the importance of students' preparation for their graduate
careers, but simply to plead for a holistic, non-segregationist approach to student
career development that could also feature in the teaching and learning of academic
writing through the disciplines. This possibility is, in fact, granted by the relational
nature of academic literacies: the relations between texts and students, between
students' identities and the conventions of their research writing, between students'
thinking, reading, and writing practices.

    During the ten weeks of the module, students bring to the table the diversity
of their individual research projects, the heterogeneity of their writing knowledge
and experience, the fluidity of their disciplinary affiliations. Their intellectual la-
bour is only pre-coded in the themes of the syllabus (see the second column in
Table 30.2) which include: macro and micro-level modes of textual construction;
register, writerly identity, and voice; problem identification, definition, and explo-
ration; critiquing; methodological frameworks; peer reviewing, addressing feed-
back through revising and editing. This generic "technological" design becomes a
unifying principle in class, thus creating a commonality of literacy practices and
a matrix of shared goals. The workshop activities, on the other hand, (the third
column) are centred on the students and propose a relational, constructivist mode
of engagement with writing.

    Furthermore, three features of the "Dissertation" module make of it a more
complex matrix of teaching and learning than the neoliberal skills-driven model
might indicate. First, class activities frame individual writing practices and process-
es dialogically: discussing in pairs or collectively emotional and cognitive aspects
of academic writing in general, and of dissertation writing in particular, exploring
individual knowledge of writing, expectations, frustrations, and challenges through
dialogue and keeping dissertation writing diaries. These are complemented by a
session dedicated to the double peer-reviewing of the coursework draft assigned
for summative assessment. In conjunction with this, formative written feedback
to writing is complemented by "talkback" (Lillis, 2005) in class and during office
hours, thus generating opportunities for one to one tutorials to accompany class

interactions. Second, differences in disciplinary discourses are actively brought to
bear upon discussions by: teasing out variations in formal conventions (structuring
and style in particular); highlighting the tight connection between producing and
interrogating knowledge in students' particular subjects and dissertation projects;
constructing problems and critiquing academic literature from within disciplinary
frameworks, whereby students are asked to explore and share articles relevant to
their work. Last, the module construes academic writing as a subject of knowl-
edge, reflection and evaluation. Students are thus inducted into a new discipline,
a functional field with its own meta-codes, discourses and community of practice.
This transformation of academic writing from an infrastructure of support into a
discipline is achieved in at least two ways: through an assessment design that is ana-
lytical and reflective in nature, either focusing on comparing and analyzing student
and published writing, reflecting on the complex dimensions of one's own disserta-
tion writing or comparing previous coursework writing with dissertation writing;
by means of a reading list that telescopes the field's recent incursions into academic
writing as product, process and practice. These two approaches come together in
the requirement that students substantiate their analyses and reflections on writing
through recourse to academic writing literature.

CONCLUSIONS

    The neoliberal order of discourse and its educational corollaries have already start-
ed to produce a body of research into writing for employability or writing for the
knowledge economy, in its milder, non-politicized variety (Deborah Brandt, 2005;
University of Bath, 2011-2012; Juliet Thondhlana & Julio Gimenez, 2011) or re-
search into the collusive relations between literacy and neoliberalism, in its more radi-
cal and ideologically resistant form (David Block et al., 2012; Christian Chun, 2008).
This paper aligns itself with the latter strand of research with the hope of recapturing
the role of academic literacies in "creatively transforming human culture" (The Miami
Plan as cited in Jill Swiencicki, 1998, p. 27) with its diverse voices and identities as
those found in the academic writing class. Through some of AcLits' valuable formu-
lations, I have sought to indicate how the academic writing employability modules
delivered by the Centre for Academic Writing at Coventry University minimize and
disrupt the workings of the neoliberal Add+Vantage teaching scheme, thus making
academic writing less instrumental in the reproduction of the neoliberal order of
discourse. In my analysis, I have adopted the combined position of a "long-marcher,"
who voices an ideological Marxist critique, and of a "whistle-blower," who interro-
gates the incorporation of academic writing from within a corporatized framework
of teaching writing (Dyer-Witheford, 2007, p. 49). Ethical dilemmas abound, but so
does the hope that academic writing will eventually build its own spaces of knowl-
edge-making and practice-honing, free of neoliberal dictates.

A CAUTIONARY TALE ABOUT
A WRITING COURSE FOR SCHOOLS

      Kelly Peake and Sally Mitchell

... in which two optimistic writing developers seek to work with
students to develop their writing, and find themselves thwarted by
myriad conundrums, unknowns and disappointments, until finally
they abandon their efforts and rethink their position ...

    On and off over the last four years, we1 have been working on various writing
development projects with sixth form2 students from local schools as part of our
university's outreach and access programme which aims to encourage and enable
students across its neighbouring communities to go on to higher education. Our
remit within this programme was to focus on students' problems with academic
writing. The core of our work with schools began as a "writing course." Since its
first iteration we have changed the course significantly, relocating it from inviting
students from multiple schools to our university campus to going to teach stu-
dents from a single school in their own setting, and also refocusing it in terms of
content. Our initial approach sought to draw students' attention to the features of
writing that are often valued at university level, experimenting with types of texts,
then linking these to writing students brought with them from school. Then as
we became familiar with the students' writing, we began to hone our approach to
draw on Language Awareness (Rod Bolitho et al., 2003; Leo van Lier, 1995) and to
focus largely on the linguistic expression of, and linking between, ideas in written
texts. We felt that it was here that the students often had fewest resources, and that
without these resources they were unable to participate fully in the "types of text"
activities we had first offered them.

    Although the funding context which initiated our work has changed, the univer-
sity where we work remains committed to widening participation. The course too,
in its various forms, remains part of what the university is happy to offer; it is, more-
over, "an offer" that schools are happy to take up. At face value, therefore, we have
been successful in our attempt to work with writing in schools; schools are keen to
invite us in and we have had positive feedback on the materials we have developed.
Nonetheless what we are doing with this course continues, despite the changes we
have made, to strike us as a flawed approach to writing development in schools (and,

indeed, more widely). In this paper--which we think of as a cautionary tale--we
explore our thinking around these flaws. To ground our discussion we first ask you
to consider the course as enacted in two short vignettes drawn from our experiences
this year.

LOCATION 1

    A new sixth form in an urban school. We meet the Head of Sixth, tell her what
we've done previously, show her our materials, get a sense of how they might fit in
to what the students are doing; she is generally enthusiastic, assures us it will be
relevant and useful. We agree to offer a five week course adapting our materials to
take into account the students' needs, and helping them work on the writing they
are doing in their classes. We plan for a meeting with a wider spread of teachers
prior to starting, but it is postponed and not re-scheduled. As a result we start the
course without much sense of what the students may be doing and what teachers
are hoping for from us.

    We arrive and sign in. Students start to appear but are shepherded by the Head
of Sixth, who sets to work directing them to the various tables. We have no register,
and miss an opportunity to establish contact with the students ourselves. We get on
with the lesson but students are tired, distracted, chatty among themselves. We are
struck by how at home they are with one another and as a result, how little atten-
tion we are getting. They grumble that the exercise is similar to one they've done in
English lessons, and when asked to write are fidgety and reluctant: "Can't you just
give me a sentence to start, Miss?"

    The following week very few students appear. Some are evident outside the
window on the street; there is waving. Questioned why there are so few, a boy
explains "They're not here because they got out before they were caught." So, the
end of the school day is a race to escape. "It's like a prison here," he says. We find
out that the workshop was compulsory, when we'd thought of it more loosely as
"recommended" perhaps.

    The next two weeks are better, more focused, although the students are still
reluctant to work on their own writing. The final week numbers are right down
again; we'd planned to start with them looking at their own writing, but the four
students who've turned up haven't brought any: unbeknownst to us they had an
essay deadline the previous week, and now they are not doing writing; they'd rather
start preparing a presentation. Our course now feels like a homework club.

dents who have been identified as likely to go to university; this is a different ap-
proach for us, we feel positive. It's challenging though, as it means delivery to the
whole group--120 students--but we work with this, agree to have tables set up in
the hall, that teachers and college tutors will participate, that we will pass on our
materials for them to use in their teaching. We redesign the course for the larger
numbers and different environment. We meet with a couple of teachers and some
tutors a couple of weeks before we start--they are very positive about our focus
and approach.

    We arrive to find the hall unprepared. When the session is due to start one
(lone) student has arrived, former students employed as "college mentors" are mill-
ing about; they suspect students have gone off to get lunch. We wait, a handful of
students drift in, mentors go off to telephone the rest. After half an hour we decide
to start--we have 28 students, a nice class size. It emerges that no students can stay
for the planned hour and a half so we cut back our plan. Students have brought a
range of writing--personal statements, scholarship applications, a science report,
English essays. It's a good session with focus that leaves us generally feeling ener-
gised. No teachers attend.

    No teachers next week either. We find ourselves in an out of the way classroom,
again starting late--and working now with only seven students out of our possible
120. Lots--we find out circuitously from one of the college tutors--may have gone
off to visit various universities, our own included. Everything about this planned
course seems to have crumbled, except for the fact that we turn up, but the fact of
our turning up has no impact on anything much--the action is all elsewhere. As
this course was promised to be literally much more centre stage, what, we ask, has
shifted between the enthusiastic planning and take-up and the reality?

    The third and final week. We arrive, expecting little, having decided to run a
much shorter class in case no one turns up. Six of last week's students have returned
and two from the first week; they have all brought work, all listen and participate
in the discussion around the activity which gets them looking at tone and formality.
There is concentration, quiet discussion, reviewing and rewriting sections of their
texts. Two girls in particular make significant changes, really finding focus in the
claims they are starting to make. We are all surprised by the end of the hour. It
feels like, for these few students, it is finally coming together, just as we are about
to leave.

THE COURSE AS "AUTONOMOUS"
AND THEREFORE PERIPHERAL

    To unpack a little of what is going on in these vignettes and why our experienc-
es felt so unsatisfactory, we've found it helpful to engage with Street's distinction
between autonomous and ideological models of literacy (Brian Street, 1984; see

                                                                                                    415
Peake and Mitchell

Chrissie Boughey, 2008). We see that problems with the course in both instances
stem from its separation from the locations' practices, purposes and players. By
creating a course on writing that stands outside of mainstream activities, subjects
and the timetabled hours of the school, we inadvertently reinforce a notion of
writing as an autonomous entity that is separable from the actual context in which
writing takes place and has meaning (as, for example, "assignment" or "homework"
or "exam"). In designing materials for such a course, we are in a sense forced to
see them this way too, as autonomous, detached from the teaching and learning
happening in school. It follows that, of necessity, we treat the writing that students
bring to work on in the course largely autonomously; we can be no real judge of
its quality, if quality is in reality determined by assessment frameworks which we
do not employ. As such our teaching and materials, when they work, are, we could
argue, only accidentally successful; their effectiveness intrinsically and inevitably
limited by the conditions of their use. It is the autonomous nature of the course,
we conclude, that makes it peripheral and largely inappropriate or irrelevant as a
vehicle to achieve transformation.

WRITING IN SCHOOLS IS A SOCIAL PRACTICE
AND WE NEED TO RECOGNIZE THIS

    Against this, the experience we capture in the vignettes prompts us to recog-
nize that writing is already a part of "social practice," or what James Gee calls
"Discourse"--"not language, and surely not grammar [which he differentiates as
discourse], but saying(writing)-doing-being-valuing-believing combinations" (1990,
1994, p. 142)--and therefore ideological. Discourse or social practice here is not
a cool, theoretical concept, but something highly complex, instantiated, and de-
pendent on the messy and changeable relationships of participants to each other,
to themselves, to their space, to their texts. It creates insight around the moment,
for instance, when one of "our" students resisted rewriting a short text by a fellow
student because that student was known in the year group as "a really good writer."
"Writing" here clearly emerged as part of social practice, of "having one's being" at
this particular school, in this particular peer group. If we were to have any purchase
in that classroom, we needed to recognize this.

A SOCIAL PRACTICE LENS ALERTS US
TO LIKELY DISJUNCTIONS IN OUR UNDERSTANDINGS

    Outside of a social practice perspective, our course might be expected to have
run relatively smoothly: it was something that was perceived by teaching staff and
by ourselves--both parties experienced in education--as meeting the identified
needs of the students. The teachers and advisors we spoke to in setting up and

416
                                                     A Cautionary Tale about a Writing Course for Schools

developing our approach gave us lists of concerns (structure, formality, argument)
that were familiar to us; they also sometimes seized upon our materials as address-
ing precisely the problems they encounter in reading their students' scripts. We
know little, however, about whether and how these materials might translate into
their regular subject teaching. A social practice lens suggests that the apparent unity
in our goals may well gloss disjunctions in our experiences and understandings that
would show themselves only in local contexts of use. For example, we would not
expect materials used in a classroom that sits outside the social practices of a school
and by teachers--ourselves--who are also outsiders, to carry the same meanings if
employed by subject teachers in subject classes for subject-based assessment ends.

ACTIVITIES AND OUTCOMES ARE LINKED
BUT THIS ISN'T ALWAYS RECOGNIZED

    Such intimate linking of goals and activities is not, though, convenient for ed-
ucational planning, particularly where an apparently clear "issue" such as "student
writing" has been identified. Nicholas Burboles in his paper "Ways of thinking
about educational quality" (2004) observes that models of education that empha-
size outcomes (which most models do, even if only weakly), often omit to rec-
ognize that outcomes are related to practices; they assume, that is, that one can
substitute any kind of practice without affecting the achievement of the outcome.
In fact, as we've noted, neither goals nor practices are autonomous: "Activities do
not simply aim at goals, they partly constitute and reconstitute them" (John Dewey
1899/1980, glossed by Burboles, 2004). There can be different players in these pro-
cesses of constitution and reconstitution too; the agency is not solely that of those
invested with authority. So for example the students in our first location who came
to the final week of the course, successfully resisted our plans for a writing exercise,
and used the time instead to get ahead with their homework, something they'd
earlier complained the course was preventing them from doing. Their expressed
aim was always in any case different than ours--not an abstract "write better," but
a clear "write better in exams."

WRITING IN TRANSITION IS A QUESTIONABLE NOTION

    When we began our work with schools we framed it as being about "writing
in transition"--an invitation to students to come, after school, into our university
context, largely to think about writing in the ways we think about it. Howev-
er the very notion of transition, resting on moving uni-directionally from one
known to another known, came to seem problematic: we didn't really know much
about the writing done in schools; at the same time, we were aware that any
generalized notion of "writing in universities" was flawed. In addition, we noted

                                                                                                    417
Peake and Mitchell

with some unease a tendency in discussions of "transitions work" (e.g., Ursula
Wingate, 2007) to characterize what goes on in universities in terms of highly
valorized activities (criticality, argument, research)--and by implication to suggest
that none of these qualities are present or developed in pre-university education.
We saw such characterisations as potentially contributing to a strongly teleological
model of education in which long-term extrinsic goals (graduate employability for
example) come to dominate the here-and-now experiences of students and their
teachers, creating an instrumentality for writing we would not want to promote
(see Mitchell, 2010). We picked up that others were voicing related concerns:
Carol Atherton (2003), for example, pointed out that A-level English is not just
a preparation for university English: many students don't go on to university or if
they do, study different subjects. And Michael Marland (2003) was asserting that
A-level experiences needed to be recognized as intrinsically valuable, and that the
needs of higher education should not be allowed to obscure them. This thinking
sensitized us to the limitations--and potential harm--of framing our work in
schools as "transitions work."

CONCLUSION: WE NEED TO MOVE TOWARDS "TALKBACK"

    Even practices that apparently achieve their intended goals, Burboles (2004)
cautions, may have other unintended or unarticulated consequences. The more
we have thought about our writing course whether offered at the university or--in
an attempt to get closer to "where students were at"--in schools, the more we are
persuaded that we need to attend to a more complex notion of both practice and
consequence. We conclude that we cannot separate writing from its social prac-
tice; we must work within the contexts in which writing is produced and becomes
meaningful, acknowledging "the values and attitudes towards print, and the social-
ly embedded understanding of the purposes of a text these values and attitudes give
rise to" (Boughey, p. 194). In practical terms this more ideological stance means
working with teachers to understand and enhance their practices, rather than with
handfuls of individual students. Our aim, we feel, should be a recasting of Lillis'
"talkback" dialogue (2003, 2006) where we move away from interaction whereby
we, the "HE experts," dispense the advice which will help "solve" students' easily
defined writing "problems" to one in which the purposes of the school are primary,
the responsibility is the teachers' and our role is to facilitate processes by which they
can select, adapt and incorporate ideas and materials around writing into their ev-
eryday teaching and curriculum. This positions the students' and teachers' A-level
experiences as being intrinsically valuable, and does not allow the needs or exper-
tise of higher education to obscure them (following Marland, 2003). We feel we
should--and do--resist offering even a set of recommendations on how to accom-
plish this type of dialogic relationship, as to do this would yet again detach writing

418
                           A Cautionary Tale about a Writing Course for Schools

from its social practice.

WHY OUR CONCLUSION IS NOT MORE OBVIOUS

    Ironically, what we describe here as an aspiration for our work with schools is
the position we have always taken in our work in writing and curriculum develop-
ment at our university (see e.g., Teresa McConlogue, Sally Mitchell, & Kelly Peake,
2012; Sally Mitchell & Alan Evison, 2006). We are intrigued to recognize that in
our work with schools we adopted a model (the stand-alone course) that in other
contexts we would have argued vociferously against. But the situation is instructive;
it points, we think, to the persistence of a skills-based, decontextualized conception
of writing and "problems with writing," and the instrumental value of this concep-
tion--even to us--as a way to make writing visible. Creating a course enabled us to
begin to participate in the institutional framing and funding of widening participa-
tion work which is measured by the participation of individual students. It enabled
us to respond to the attractiveness both to the university and to schools of an iden-
tifiable product that could be offered and taken up. In contrast to this "something
for nothing" deal, the challenge of getting involved in complex school contexts and
finding time and space to work with staff who are already working at full capacity,
would probably have been beyond us. (This remains a significant challenge, after
all, for many writing developers within their own institutional contexts.) Four years
on, however, we are in a stronger position; in dialogue with teachers and university
colleagues about our cautionary insights, equipped with a flexible/challengeable
body of ideas around writing at A-level, and clearer and more adamant that the way
forward for working on writing in schools is through embedded partnership within
their myriad social practice contexts.

NOTES

1. Based at a large UK HE institution in the East End of London, we are part of Think-
ing Writing, a small team of educational developers who work primarily with academic
staff around the roles that writing can play in learning in the disciplines.

2. The term "sixth form" refers to a non-compulsory two year course that students can
choose to take at the end of secondary education in England and Wales; it often offers
a route into further or higher education. The most common qualification that students
work towards in that time is the "A-level."

"WITH WRITING, YOU ARE NOT
EXPECTED TO COME FROM YOUR
HOME": DILEMMAS OF BELONGING

      Lucia Thesen

        Lucia Thesen has been working in academic writing development at the Uni-
        versity of Cape Town since the mid 1980s. In that time the institution has
        changed profoundly in some ways, providing access to historically excluded
        students, but not in others. The complexities of the shift from apartheid to
        a democractic South Africa underpin Lucia's practical and theoretical work
        and are reflected here in her exploration of the meanings of transformation.

TRANSFORMATION FROM A SOUTHERN PERSPECTIVE

    What does the transformative agenda in Academic Literacies look like from a
cluster of neo-classical buildings that cling to a mountain, facing north, from the
southern-most university on the African continent? My starting point is the quote
in the title: "With writing you are not expected to come from your home." These are
the words of Sipho, a student (quoted in Gideon Nomdo, 2006) who is reflecting
on his university experience.1 As a first generation working class black student in a
historically English speaking, white, elite university,2 a profound political transfor-
mation has created policy space for him that was not possible under apartheid. But
for students granted entry through new policy spaces, formal access does not easily
translate into what Wally Morrow calls epistemological access (2007). After a false
start as a student of economics, he leaves the university, returning later to major in
drama where he finds a disciplinary shelter, if not a home, from which he goes on
to become an accomplished actor and director.

    His words have stayed with me since I first read them in Nomdo's piece. The
modality is strong, conveyed in the present tense as a statement of fact and gener-
alized to "you." Is this true for the universal "you," or is it more of an expression
of a particular moment, for a particular person? What about the expectations of
writing that he refers to? How negotiable are they? Is there something necessarily
estranging about the semiotic act of writing? Or is it only academic writing that he
is speaking about--what Kate Cadman (2003) calls "divine discourse"--a project

                                                                                                    421

of the Enlightenment that claims the capacity to be neutral, to be able to gener-
alize and speak across contexts? Is it possible/necessary that in the act of academic
writing we feel that we belong? What would we belong to, which places, histories,
conversations? Does belonging matter for the academic literacies stance and does a
better understanding of how we (both students and academics) might see ourselves
as belonging contribute to its transformative agenda?

    Academic literacies continues to offer an important academic shelter in my
life as a teacher-researcher as it values situated practice. In the introduction to our
book, Academic Literacy and the Languages of Change (Lucia Thesen & Ermien van
Pletzen, 2006) we reflect on how our work at a South African university has been
caught up in wider circles of context, foregrounding the political transformation
from apartheid to the democratic era. The word transformation is widely used in all
areas of public life in this country and it is always sharply loaded and contested. It
is strongly associated with the historical break with apartheid, following the "elite
pacting" (Linda Chisholm, 2004) of the early 1990s. There is no doubt that we
have undergone a profound political transition from a pariah state to a nervous but
so far resilient democracy where intense processes of negotiation between compet-
ing values and practices are the norm. It is hard to describe just how significant this
shift has been at the symbolic level; at the same time, it is important to acknowledge
how incomplete, uneven and problematic aspects of this transition remain, many
of which are still the subject of on-going contestation. The gap between symboli-
cally impressive policy and practice on the ground is particularly important. There
are no easy answers about the role of education in these processes: all decisions seem
to require a deep engagement with a series of dilemmas where superficial answers
will surely let us down.

ACADEMIC LITERACIES: LAYERS OF MEANING

    I think of academic literacies as theoretically informed activism to change prac-
tice. My understanding has been honed through years of convening a master's level
semester-long course that focuses on academic literacies. Students who register for
this course are typically academics from a range of disciplines, school teachers (the
term academic literacy has recently made its way into schooling) or adult educators
with an interest in language in the educational process. I tell students my value
system regarding student text: I am not interested in hearing whether this piece of
writing is wrong or right: I want to hear you say, "That's interesting. Why does it
look like that? Has it always been like this? What is the writing/drawing/text doing?
Is it fair? How might it be different? What would we need to know and do for it
to be different?"

    Through working with students I have identified three different intersecting,
sometimes competing, angles on academic literacies. First is academic literacies as

422
                                                                                                      Reflections 6

a shorthand for academic literacy practices: this is a descriptive term for the vast and
changing history of how the academy comes to value some forms of communica-
tion above others in different disciplines. These practices were there long before
us, and they will remain long after we have gone, in forms that may be hard to
imagine now. For now, writing is most strongly caught up in assessment and how
the university communicates research. It hasn't always been like this. At times the
oral has held sway over the written (William Clark, 2006). The written form is par-
amount, but digital literacies are escalating changes in both written and oral forms,
shrinking the academic world in some ways but widening rifts in others. There is a
geographical as well as historical dimension to these changes, as the anthropological
tradition in Literacy Studies has shown so clearly. From a southern African perspec-
tive, time and space meet in colonialism and the end of apartheid, and the processes
of postcolonial emergence are what shape us most strongly, as I shall expand on
later. This foregrounds the dilemmas that come with writing and is what makes the
student's comment about writing and home so resonant.

    The second meaning of academic literacies refers to a form of pedagogical work
that has a direction towards some ideal notion of the conventions of "good writ-
ing" in English. While we know from Meaning 1 that there is no settled unitary
version of good writing that can be taught once and for all, there are many as-
pects of convention that can and must be taught if we are to embrace the access
challenges of massification. We can't open the doors of learning and then let new
students fail. Academic literacy/ies as work responds to the institutional refrain
that "students can't read and write." This is the meaning that defines a crisis, that
creates a problem to be solved, that raises state funding and pays my salary to do
the kind of work that we do. In South Africa, this work has been tied to a political
project of the transformation of higher education since the mid-1980s, to admit
historically excluded working class black students to the university, and to make
sure that although the playing field is not level on entry, we do enough to make
sure that they graduate strongly enough to make meaningful choices at the end of
the degree, some joining the university as the next generation of academics. This
meaning is sustained by the myth that writing problems can be fixed (Brian Street's
1984 autonomous model). A distinguishing feature of academic literacy/ies locally
is that it also involves systemic policy work. Our group helps shape policy, create
flexible routes through the degree process, and in a recent language and academic
literacy implementation plan, commits to working in partnership with academics
in the disciplines. Academic literacy/ies is everyone's responsibility.

    The overarching meaning of Academic Literacies (with capital letters) as episte-
mology and a methodology (Theresa Lillis & Mary Scott, 2007) is a cluster of tools
and methods (and people), an emerging sub-discipline that takes a critical stand on
communicative practices (particularly writing) in the changing university. It does
not look only at induction to high status academic literacy practices of the day, but

                                                                                                    423
Thesen

looks at practice and how notions of reading and writing are expressed in particular
time/place arrangements. Crucially, it is also interested in alternative, more socially
just, innovative practices where new forms of hybrid writing can take hold. This
meaning is most effective as a research-in-practice lens that ideally brings the first
and second meanings of the term academic literacies into a productive relationship
with one another.

    And here I want to reflect on the student Sipho's words through the Academic
Literacies lens to argue that a key part of transformative practice is a process of en-
gagement that asks questions about belonging. This belonging refers to both global
and local elements. It doesn't aim to settle these questions of belonging. If we are
to take transformation further, we have to understand how students (and academ-
ics) engaged in knowledge-making weigh up their commitments to what they
bring along, and where they hope to go, and what they want to be. Transforma-
tive practice calls for deep conversations about hopes and fears and attachments.
This conversation needs openness to risk and risk-taking (Lucia Thesen and Lin-
da Cooper, 2013). I begin by situating the quote from Homi Bhabha below in
analysis of writing practices in the post-colonial university. This foregrounds the
dilemma that underlies the comment about writing and belonging. You have to
engage with academic writing, but if you succeed, you may have sold out or lost
out on something valuable and defining that will also have implications for what
counts as knowledge.

"ANGLICISED BUT EMPHATICALLY NOT ENGLISH"
(HOMI BHABHA, 2004, P. 125)

    Homi Bhabha explains the concept of the mimic man, how colonialism makes
subjects who are almost the same, but just different enough for the difference to
matter, to need "civilizing." The phrase "Anglicised but not English" signals the
importance of postcolonial studies in trying to understand what transformative
writing practices could look like. While speech is a universal human capacity, writ-
ing is not. Its materiality as inscription played a key part in colonialism. As Adrien
Delmas writes, "Writing was the medium by which Europe discovered the world"
and in the process it took on a range of "top down" technical, administrative, re-
ligious, scientific, and educational functions (2011, p. xxviii). The state of being
ambivalent, torn between discourses, is what the postcolonial subject has to come
to terms with. This ambivalence has arguably been relevant for a long time, and is
certainly relevant since the inclusion of working class and women students in the
academy. If the postcolonial situation is the condition of the majority of students
now participating in higher education globally, it may be a perspective that has far
more global relevance than either the Academic Literacies or composition studies
traditions have thus far acknowledged.

    The idea that writing pedagogy takes place in multilingual, diverse, contested,
and congested "contact zones" (Mary Louise Pratt, 1999) is beginning to take hold
in many settings. The contact zone is increasingly the norm as universities become
more diverse with massification. Examples are Theresa Lillis and Mary Jane Curry
(2010) in academic publishing and Xiaoye You's (2010) history of English compo-
sition in China, which argues that writing in what is locally called the devil's tongue
(English) is actually writing in our tongue, as nobody "owns" a global language like
English. You's history of composition is one way of making academic literacy work
more "ethically global."

    Bhabha argues that if we want to understand the global, we need to start with
the local. The term "local" resonates in Academic Literacies, with its connections
to the New Literacy Studies. The "second wave" of research (Mike Baynham &
Mastin Prinsloo, 2009) in the literacy studies tradition with which the Academic
Literacies position is associated pushed for studies of local literacy practices. As
a South African writer, I have always struggled with this: on the one hand ev-
erything we do is so strongly situated in the local context. If one backgrounds
context, reviewers and readers often ask for more local setting. But the more
context is given, the more likely one's research is to be read as exotic, tragic, or
lacking. We want to "come from home" but also to be read as contributing to
global conversations. Achille Mbembe helps to explain this ambivalence in his
thought-provoking piece on African "self-writing": discourses on African identity
force people into "contradictory positions that are however concurrently held"
(2002, p. 253). The shadow side of the Enlightenment has ascribed to Africa
a meaning that is inferior--"something unique, and even indelible ... and has
nothing to contribute to the work of the universal" (p. 246). This inferiority
bleeds into territory. African identity is translated in local, territorial, terms, but
always in a racist discourse that creates the dilemma for writers: I am in/from/of
Africa but I am also part of the world.

    So "to come from your home" is not a straightforward matter of belonging. It
points to territory, an earthing that gives one some recognition, but at the same
time it racializes identity. So belonging is for many writers in the postcolonial
university a space full of contradictions and dilemmas. Using Bhabha's concepts
of "unhomed" and "hybridity," Bongi Bangeni and Rochelle Kapp (2005) have
explored the experience of black students in a historically white institution look-
ing at their state of being in-between, and how it changes over time, as they make
their way through the undergraduate degree in the social sciences. The data for
their paper is drawn from the richness of conversations generated by the question
"What was it like to be at home during the vacation?" While the interviews they
report on in this paper do not focus specifically on writing (they focus more on
students' non-academic lives), there are moments where one of the students,
Andrew, talks about how writing reflective pieces in various courses helped to

                                                                                                    425

achieve some kind of integration and sense of a coherent self. Similarly, Sipho in
Nomdo's article also finds a form of writing that he feels more comfortable with.
This form is achieved through a combination of his writing and performance in
Drama:

         I try to create a new form, even to recreate my own self because
         I feel I've been clouded by other things. There's a lot of things I
         need to unlearn. Writing actually gives me that opportunity. The
         pen, I don't use it that much, I use it in point form, this is the
         situation Drama gives me the physical ability to recreate myself,
         for example, playing somebody else that I'm not everyday but
         that I might be inside. (Nomdo, 2006, p. 200)

    This is a different view of writing not as alienating, but as a tool for the project
of the self, an exploratory, reflective and reflexive form of writing that is low stakes,
and may or may not be part of assessment practices. It is also interestingly second-
ary to the primary means of communication, which in the discipline of Drama, is
the body. Most importantly, it is feeling towards new forms, experimenting, imag-
ining. Insights such as this remind us of the importance of hearing what projects of
the self students are busy with, and how they bring their histories to the academy.
The concept of "risk" and "risk taking" can help open up this kind of discussion and
insight (Thesen and Cooper 2013).

    A final reflection on my own theoretical belonging: the three angles I identify
that make up Academic Literacies--changing practices, pedagogy, and emerging
discipline--sometimes work together, and sometimes don't, and I'm comfortable
with the tensions between them. I find them risky, but productive. I suggest that
by belonging to the community of teacher-researchers in the Academic Literacies
field, I am also able to belong to other theoretical conversations, in particular in this
piece, to conversations about postcolonial ambivalence. Given that practices are so
strongly rooted in historical and geographical (including translocal) contexts, it is
important to keep the academic literacies approach alert and responsive, through
deep conversations with others who are interested in the possibilities of the trans-
formative "acts" in practice.

NOTES

1. The dilemmas experienced by the student Sipho (a pseudonym) are described in
Nomdo (2006) who uses Bourdieu to show how issues of class, race and language work
for different students participating in a US-funded scholarship programme for black
senior undergraduates..

2. The terms of racial classification, central to apartheid's project, are still relevant in
public life, 20 years after democracy.

WORKING WITH ACADEMIC LITER ACIES

The editors and contributors to this collection explore what it means to adopt an "aca-
demic literacies" approach in policy and pedagogy. Transformative practice is illustrat-
ed through case studies and critical commentaries from teacher-researchers working
in a range of higher education contexts--from undergraduate to postgraduate levels,
across disciplines, and spanning geopolitical regions including Australia, Brazil, Cana-
da, Cataluña, Finland, France, Ireland, Portugal, South Africa, the United Kingdom,
and the United States. Key questions addressed include: How can a wider range of
semiotic resources and technologies fruitfully serve academic meaning and knowledge
making? What kinds of writing spaces do we need and how can these be facilitated?
How can theory and practice from "Academic Literacies" be used to open up debate
about writing pedagogy at institutional and policy levels?

Theresa Lillis is Professor of English Language and Applied Linguistics at
The Open University, UK. She has authored several books, including The So-
ciolinguistics of Writing (2013). K athy Harrington is Principal Lecturer in
