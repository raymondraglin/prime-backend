Section 1: Howdy!

                                   Introduction

Welcome to composition and rhetoric! While most of you are taking this course because it is required,
we hope that all of you will leave with more confidence in your reading, writing, researching, and
speaking abilities as these are all elements of freshman composition. Many times, these elements are
presented in excellent textbooks written by top scholars. While the collaborators of this particular
textbook respect and value those textbooks available from publishers, we have been concerned with
disenfranchising students who do not have the resources to purchase textbooks. Therefore, we decided
to put together this Open Educational Resource (OER) explicitly for use in freshman composition courses
at Texas A&M University.

Thanks to a generous grant from Dean David Carlson of the Texas A&M University Libraries, this project
became a reality. It is a collaborative endeavor undertaken by faculty in the libraries and English
Department as part of the Provost's Student Success Initiatives at Texas A&M and continues to be a
work in progress. Combined, Dr. Terri Pantuso, Dr. Kathy Anders, and Prof. Sarah LeMire have over 30
years of experience in writing and research instruction. Our goal is for students to leave this course as
critical thinkers, polished writers, and informed citizens who can engage in civil public discourse. Gig
`em, Ags!

Section 2: Getting Started

                                   Introduction

Congratulations! You're now on your way towards a college degree! But first, you must master the art of
writing for a given purpose. How do you start an essay? What matters most, the topic or the sources?
What if you don't understand exactly what you're being asked to write about or you can't find a topic? If
you're feeling stress from questions such as these, relax. You're not alone. Even the most accomplished
writers need some sort of guidance to begin a new project. In this section, we introduce you to the
writing process used most commonly in composition courses and provide strategies for tackling your
assignment(s). Additionally, we discuss genre and prewriting strategies to guide you through the
process.

                        What is The Writing Process?1

Donald M. Murray, a Pulitzer Prize winning journalist and educator, presented his important article,
"Teach Writing as a Process Not Product," in 1972.2 In the article, he criticizes writing instructors'
tendencies to view student writing as "literature" and to focus our attention on the "product" (the
finished essay) while grading. The idea that students are producing finished works ready for close
examination and evaluation by their instructor is fraught with problems because writing is really a
process and arguably one that is never finished.

In the article, Murray explains why writing is an ongoing process:

         What is the process we [writing instructors] should teach? It is the process of discovery through
         language. It is the process of exploration of what we know and what we feel about what we
         know through language. It is the process of using language to learn about our world, to evaluate
         what we learn about our world, to communicate what we learn about our world. Instead of
         teaching finished writing, we should teach unfinished writing, and glory in its unfinishedness. (4)

In your composition courses, you may find that many college writing instructors have answered
Murray's call to "teach writing as a process." Due to shifting our focus on process rather than product,
you will likely find yourself spending a lot of time brainstorming, drafting, revising, and editing.
Embracing writing as a process helps apprehensive writers see that writing is not only about

grammatical accuracy or "being a good writer." It's also about what you have to say as a writer and how
you join the academic discourse community-at-large.

                          Figure: The Writing Process [image created by Sarah M. Lacy]
The most important lesson to understand about the writing process is that it is recursive, meaning that
you need to move back and forth between some or all of the steps. There are many ways to approach
this process. Allowing yourself enough time to begin the assignment before it is due will give you time to
move from one step to the other and back as needed. This recursive, back and forth process, leads to a
more polished final product.

The Writing Process in 6 Steps

The following steps have been adapted from the work of Paul Eschholz and Alfred Rosa, found in their
book Subject & Strategy.3 In the text, the authors focus on discussing writing as a series of steps that can
be adapted to meet any writer's needs. In the following, the steps have been modified to fit the needs
of first-year writers. While reading through the steps below, remember that every writer has a unique
approach to the writing process. The steps are presented in such a way that allow for any writer to
understand the process as a whole so that they can feel prepared when beginning a paper. Take special
note of all the tips and guidance presented with each step, as well as suggested further reading,
3 Eschholz, Paul and Alfred Rosa. Subject & Strategy: A Writer's Reader. 11th ed., Bedford/St. Martin, 2007.

                                                                                                                            2.2
remembering that writing is a skill that needs practice. Make sure to spend time developing your own
connection to each step when writing a paper.

Step 1 - Understand the Assignment
Always read over the entire assignment sheet provided to you by your instructor. Think of this sheet as a
contract; by accepting the sheet, you are agreeing to follow all guidelines and requirements that have
been provided. This sheet is a direct communication from your instructor to you which typically lays out
every expectation and requirement of an assignment. Follow each requirement to ensure you are
conducting and completing the assignment properly.

Step 2 - Gather Ideas and Form a Working Thesis
Once you understand the assignment, you will need to collect information in order to understand your
topic and decide where you would like the paper to lead. This step can be conducted in various ways.
Researching to build content knowledge is always a good place to start this step.

After you have conducted some research, begin brainstorming your topic. You can do this in a variety of
ways such as:

     Free Writing
     Listing ideas
     Generate a list of questions
     Clustering/ Mapping (creating a bubble chart)
     Create a basic outline
Next, you will want to formulate a working thesis. A working thesis is different than the thesis found in a
final draft in that it will not be specific nor as narrowed as the final thesis. Think of a working thesis as
the general focus of the paper, helping to shape your research and brainstorming activities. As you will
later spend ample time working and reworking a draft, allow yourself the freedom to revise this thesis as
you become more familiar with your topic and purpose.

Step 3 - Write a Draft
After completing Steps 1 and 2, you are ready to begin putting all parts and ideas together into a full
length draft. It is important to remember that this is a first/rough draft, and the goal is to get all of your
thoughts into writing, not generating a perfect draft. Do not get hung up with your language at this
point; focus on the larger ideas and content instead.

Organization is a very important part of this step, and if you have not already composed an outline or
plan during Step 2, consider writing one now. The purpose of an outline is to create a logical flow of
claims, evidence, and links before or during the drafting process. Experiment with outlines to learn
when and how they can work for you.

Outlines are great at helping you organize your outside sources if you need to use some within a
particular assignment. Start by generating a list of claims (or main ideas) to support your thesis and

                                                                                                                            2.3
decide which source belongs with each idea, knowing that you may (and should) use your sources more
than once, with more than one claim.

Step 4 - Revise the Draft(s)
The revision process is where your topic begins to grow. This is the step in which you are likely to spend
the majority of your time. This section is different from simply editing or proofreading because you are
looking for larger context issues. For example, the revision step is when you need to check your topic
sentences and transitions, make sure each claim matches the thesis statement, and so on. Return to
Steps 1 and 2 as needed to ensure you are on the right track and that your draft is properly adhering to
the guidelines of the assignment.

The revision portion of the writing process is also where you will need to make sure all of your
paragraphs are fully developed as appropriate for the assignment. If you need to have outside sources
present, this is when you will make sure that all are working properly together. If the assignment is a
summary, this is when you will need to double check all paraphrasing to make sure it correctly
represents the ideas and information of the source text.

Step 5 - Proof-Read/Edit the Draft(s)
Once the larger content issues have been resolved and you are moving towards a final draft, work
through the paper looking for grammar and style issues. This step is when you need to make sure that
your tone is appropriate for the assignment. For example, you will need to make sure you have
remained in a formal tone for all academic papers. Also check to make sure that sources are properly
integrated into your own work if your assignment calls for them.

When entering the final step, go back to the assignment sheet, read it over once more in full, and then
conduct a close reading. Doing this will help you to ensure you have completed all components of the
assignment as per your instructor's guidance.

Step 6 - Turn in the Draft, Receive Feedback, and Revise (if needed)
Once your draft is completed, turned in, and handed back with edits from your instructor, you may have
an opportunity to revise and turn in again to help raise your grade. As the goal of the composition class
is to improve your writing, this is an essential step to consider so that you get the most out of the
course. Ask your instructor for more detail and seek feedback from peer reviewer and your university
writing center before submitting a final draft.

         

                                                                                                                            2.4
       Understanding the Writing Assignment: Quick Reference4

Before you begin working on an essay or a writing assignment, don't forget to spend some quality time
analyzing the assignment sheet. By closely reading and breaking down the assignment sheet, you are
setting yourself up for an easier time of planning and composing the assignment. You might find it
helpful to use the following steps:

     First, determine the genre of the assignment;
     Second, carefully read the assignment sheet and search for the required page length, due dates,

         and other submission-based information;
     Third, identify the core assignment questions that you need to answer;
     Fourth, note what types of secondary sources are required as well as how many;
     Fifth, locate the evaluation and grading criteria;
     Finally, identify the disciplinary conventions with which you are expected to write.
Writing Genre
Loosely speaking, genre refers to a category of work that generally shares similar characteristics. When
determining the genre in which you are being asked to write, if it is not explicitly stated ask yourself
what, in the broadest sense, are you being asked to do?

How to Answer the Assignment Question(s)
Sometimes, a list of prompts or questions may appear with an assignment given to you by your
instructor. It is likely that your instructor will not expect you to answer all of the questions listed. They
are simply offering you some ideas so that you can think of your own questions to ask. When this occurs,
it can be useful to:

     Circle all assignment questions that you see on the assignment sheet
     Put a star next to the question that is either the most important OR that you will pursue in

         creating the assignment
     Underline the topic about which you feel most passionate. If you are interested in the topic, you

         will produce a better paper.
Recognizing Implied Questions
A prompt may not include a clear `how' or `why' question, though one is always implied by the language
of the prompt. For example, "Discuss the effects of the No Child Left Behind Act on special education

                                                                                                                            2.5
programs" is asking you to write how the act has affected special education programs, while "Consider
the recent rise of autism diagnoses" is asking you to write why the diagnoses of autism are on the rise. If
it is not relatively clear what is implied in the question or prompt, check with your instructor or a writing
center tutor.

Identifying Writing Requirements
Some instructors offer indications of what certain parts of the essay/composition should contain. As you
read the assignment sheet, look for an indication of elements to be included. Does the assignment sheet
offer suggestions or requirements for the introductory paragraph? For the thesis statement? For the
structure or content of the body paragraphs or conclusion paragraphs? If not, check with your instructor
or visit your university writing center for suggestions and guidance.

Identifying Source Information Requirements
When you receive an assignment, note what types of information you will need (in order?) to respond to
the questions in the prompt. Your instructor may indicate that you need to use a certain number of
secondary sources in your assignment, and may even tell you what types of sources, e.g. newspaper
stories, magazine articles, interviews, or scholarly journal articles. It may also be the case that apart
from the requirements for the writing assignment, you need to find background information on the
topic so that you can begin to formulate your own ideas or your claim. For example, say you are in a
nutrition class and you receive the following prompt:

"Evaluate the benefits and drawbacks of a ketogenic diet for a population with a health issue of your
choosing, i.e epilepsy, liver disease, kidney disease, obesity, etc. Use at least four scholarly sources in
your paper."

If you are not already familiar with what a ketogenic diet is, you will have to do some background
research about what it is as you begin to address the topic. You might also need to do some research
about the health issue. As you write, you will also need to find and incorporate four more scholarly
sources into your paper likely addressing the specific question about the ketogenic diet and the
population group you chose. You might choose to include even more sources, depending upon how you
want to address the topic.

Identifying Evaluation Criteria
Many assignment sheets contain a grading rubric or some other indication of evaluation criteria for the
assignment. You can use these criteria to both begin the writing process and to guide your revision and
editing process. If you do not see any rubric or evaluation criteria on the assignment sheet -- ask!

Recognizing Disciplinary Expectations
Depending on the discipline in which you are writing, different features and formats of your writing may
be expected. Always look closely at key terms and vocabulary in the writing assignment, and be sure to
note what type of evidence and citations style your instructor expects.

     does the essay need to be in MLA, APA, Chicago or another style?
     does the professor require any specific submission elements or formats?

                                                                                                                            2.6
                   Purpose, Audience, Tone, and Content5

Now that you have determined the assignment parameters, it's time to begin drafting. While doing so, it
is important to remain focused on your topic and thesis in order to guide your reader through the essay.
Imagine reading one long block of text with each idea blurring into the next. Even if you are reading a
thrilling novel or an interesting news article, you will likely lose interest in what the author has to say
very quickly. During the writing process, it is helpful to position yourself as a reader. Ask yourself
whether you can focus easily on each point you make. Keep in mind that three main elements shape the
content of each essay:

     Purpose: The reason the writer composes the essay.
     Audience: The individual or group whom the writer intends to address.
     Tone: The attitude the writer conveys about the essay's subject.

                                             Figure: The Rhetorical Triangle
The assignment's purpose, audience, and tone dictate what each paragraph of the essay covers and how
the paragraph supports the main point or thesis.

Identifying Common Academic Purposes

The purpose for a piece of writing identifies the reason you write it by, basically, answering the question
"Why?" For example, why write a play? To entertain a packed theater. Why write instructions to the

                                                                                                                            2.7
babysitter? To inform him or her of your schedule and rules. Why write a letter to your congressman?
To persuade him to address your community's needs.

In academic settings, the reasons for writing typically fulfill four main purposes:

     to summarize
     to analyze
     to synthesize
     to evaluate
A summary shrinks a large amount of information into only the essentials, using your own words;
although shorter than the original piece of writing, a summary should still communicate all the key
points and key support of the original document without quoting the original text.

An analysis, on the other hand, separates complex materials into their different parts and studies how
the parts relate to one another. In the sciences, for example, the analysis of simple table salt would
require a deconstruction of its parts--the elements sodium (Na) and chloride (Cl). Then, scientists would
study how the two elements interact to create the compound NaCl, or sodium chloride: simple table
salt.

In an academic analysis, instead of deconstructing compounds, the essay takes apart a primary source
(an essay, a book, an article, etc.) point by point. It communicates the main points of the document by
examining individual points and identifying how the points relate to one another.

The third type of writing--synthesis--combines two or more items to create an entirely new item. Take,
for example, the electronic musical instrument aptly named the synthesizer. It looks like a simple
keyboard but displays a dashboard of switches, buttons, and levers. With the flip of a few switches, a
musician may combine the distinct sounds of a piano, a flute, or a guitar--or any other combination of
instruments--to create a new sound. The purpose of an academic synthesis is to blend individual
documents into a new document by considering the main points from one or more pieces of writing and
linking the main points together to create a new point, one not replicated in either document.

Finally, an evaluation judges the value of something and determines its worth. Evaluations in everyday
life are often not only dictated by set standards but also influenced by opinion and prior knowledge such
as a supervisor's evaluation of an employee in a particular job. Academic evaluations, likewise,
communicate your opinion and its justifications about a particular document or a topic of discussion.
They are influenced by your reading of the document as well as your prior knowledge and experience
with the topic or issue. Evaluations typically require more critical thinking and a combination of
summary, analysis, and synthesis skills.

You will encounter these four purposes not only as you read for your classes but also as you read for
work or pleasure and, because reading and writing work together, your writing skills will improve as you
read. Remember that the purpose for writing will guide you through each part of your paper, helping
you make decisions about content and style.

                                                                                                                            2.8
When reviewing directions for assignments, look for the verbs that ask you to summarize, analyze,
synthesize, or evaluate. Instructors often use these words to clearly indicate the assignment's purpose.
These words will cue you on how to complete the assignment because you will know its exact purpose.

Identifying the Audience

Imagine you must give a presentation to a group of executives in an office. Weeks before the big day,
you spend time creating and rehearsing the presentation. You must make important, careful decisions
not only about the content but also about your delivery. Will the presentation require technology to
project figures and charts? Should the presentation define important words, or will the executives
already know the terms? Should you wear your suit and dress shirt? The answers to these questions will
help you develop an appropriate relationship with your audience, making them more receptive to your
message.
Now imagine you must explain the same business concepts from your presentation to a group of high
school students. Those important questions you previously answered may now require different
answers. The figures and charts may be too sophisticated, and the terms will certainly require
definitions. You may even reconsider your outfit and sport a more casual look. Because the audience has
shifted, your presentation and delivery will shift as well to create a new relationship with the new
audience.

In these two situations, the audience--the individuals who will watch and listen to the presentation--
plays a role in the development of presentation. As you prepare the presentation, you visualize the
audience to anticipate their expectations and reactions. What you imagine affects the information you
choose to present and how you will present it. Then, during the presentation, you meet the audience in
person and discover immediately how well you perform.

Although the audience for writing assignments--your readers--may not appear in person, they play an
equally vital role. Even in everyday writing activities, you identify your readers' characteristics, interests,
and expectations before making decisions about what you write. In fact, thinking about audience has
become so common that you may not even detect the audience-driven decisions.
For example, you update your status on a social networking site with the awareness of who will digitally
follow the post. If you want to brag about a good grade, you may write the post to please family
members. If you want to describe a funny moment, you may write with your friends' senses of humor in
mind. Even at work, you send emails with an awareness of an unintended receiver who could intercept
the message.

In other words, being aware of "invisible" readers is a skill you most likely already possess and one you
rely on every day. Consider the following paragraphs. Which one would the author send to her parents?
Which one would she send to her best friend?

         Example A
         Last Saturday, I volunteered at a local hospital. The visit was fun and rewarding. I even learned
         how to do cardiopulmonary resuscitation, or CPR. Unfortunately, I think caught a cold from one

                                                                                                                            2.9
         of the patients. This week, I will rest in bed and drink plenty of clear fluids. I hope I am well by
         next Saturday to volunteer again.

         Example B
         OMG! You won't believe this! My advisor forced me to do my community service hours at this
         hospital all weekend! We learned CPR but we did it on dummies, not even real peeps. And some
         kid sneezed on me and got me sick! I was so bored and sniffling all weekend; I hope I don't have
         to go back next week. I def do NOT want to miss the basketball tournament!

Most likely, you matched each paragraph to its intended audience with little hesitation. Because each
paragraph reveals the author's relationship with the intended readers, you can identify the audience
fairly quickly. When writing your own essays, you must engage with your audience to build an
appropriate relationship given your subject.

Imagining your readers during each stage of the writing process will help you make decisions about your
writing. Ultimately, the people you visualize will affect what and how you write.

While giving a speech, you may articulate an inspiring or critical message, but if you left your hair a mess
and laced up mismatched shoes, your audience would not take you seriously. They may be too
distracted by your appearance to listen to your words.

Similarly, grammar and sentence structure serve as the appearance of a piece of writing. Polishing your
work using correct grammar will impress your readers and allow them to focus on what you have to say.

Because focusing on audience will enhance your writing, your process, and your finished product, you
must consider the specific traits of your audience members. Use your imagination to anticipate the
readers' demographics, education, prior knowledge, and expectations.

Demographics
These measure important data about a group of people such as their age range, their ethnicity, their
religious beliefs, or their gender. Certain topics and assignments will require these kinds of
considerations about your audience. For other topics and assignments, these measurements may not
influence your writing in the end. Regardless, it is important to consider demographics when you begin
to think about your purpose for writing.

Education
Education considers the audience's level of schooling. If audience members have earned a doctorate
degree, for example, you may need to elevate your style and use more formal language. Or, if audience
members are still in college, you could write in a more relaxed style. An audience member's major or
emphasis may also dictate your writing.

Prior knowledge
This refers to what the audience already knows about your topic. If your readers have studied certain
topics, they may already know some terms and concepts related to the topic. You may decide whether
to define terms and explain concepts based on your audience's prior knowledge. Although you cannot

                                                                                                                           2.10
peer inside the brains of your readers to discover their knowledge, you can make reasonable
assumptions. For instance, a nursing major would presumably know more about health-related topics
than a business major would.

Expectations
These indicate what readers will look for while reading your assignment. Readers may expect
consistencies in the assignment's appearance such as correct grammar and traditional formatting like
double-spaced lines and legible font. Readers may also have content-based expectations given the
assignment's purpose and organization. In an essay titled "The Economics of Enlightenment: The Effects
of Rising Tuition," for example, audience members may expect to read about the economic
repercussions of college tuition costs.

Selecting an Appropriate Tone

Tone identifies a speaker's attitude toward a subject or another person. You may pick up a person's tone
of voice fairly easily in conversation. A friend who tells you about her weekend may speak excitedly
about a fun skiing trip. An instructor who means business may speak in a low, slow voice to emphasize
her serious mood. Or, a coworker who needs to let off some steam after a long meeting may crack a
sarcastic joke.

Just as speakers transmit emotion through voice, writers can transmit a range of attitudes and emotions
through prose--from excited and humorous to somber and critical. These emotions create connections
among the audience, the author, and the subject, ultimately building a relationship between the
audience and the text. To stimulate these connections, writers intimate their attitudes and feelings with
useful devices such as sentence structure, word choice, punctuation, and formal or informal language.
Keep in mind that the writer's attitude should always appropriately match the audience and the
purpose.

Read the following paragraph and consider the writer's tone. How would you describe the writer's
attitude toward wildlife conservation?

Many species of plants and animals are disappearing right before our eyes. If we don't act fast, it might
be too late to save them. Human activities, including pollution, deforestation, hunting, and
overpopulation, are devastating the natural environment. Without our help, many species will not
survive long enough for our children to see them in the wild. Take the tiger, for example. Today, tigers
occupy just seven percent of their historical range, and many local populations are already extinct.
Hunted for their beautiful pelts and other body parts, the tiger population has plummeted from one
hundred thousand in 1920 to just a few thousand. Contact your local wildlife conservation society today
to find out how you can stop this terrible destruction.

Choosing Appropriate, Interesting Content

Content refers to all the written substance in a document. After selecting an audience and a purpose,
you must choose what information will make it to the page. Content may consist of examples, statistics,
facts, anecdotes, testimonies, and observations, but no matter the type, the information must be

                                                                                                                           2.11
appropriate and interesting for the audience and purpose. An essay written for third graders that
summarizes the legislative process, for example, would have to contain succinct and simple content.
Content is also shaped by tone. When the tone matches the content, the audience will be more
engaged, and you will build a stronger relationship with your readers. When applied to that audience of
third graders, you would choose simple content that the audience would easily understand, and you
would express that content through an enthusiastic tone.
The same considerations apply to all audiences and purposes.

                                                                                                                           2.12
                                    Prewriting6

Loosely defined, prewriting includes all the writing strategies employed before writing your first draft.
Although many more prewriting strategies exist, the following section covers: using experience and
observations, reading, freewriting, asking questions, listing, and clustering/idea mapping. Using the
strategies in the following section can help you overcome the fear of the blank page and confidently
begin the writing process.

Choosing a Topic

In addition to understanding that writing is a process, writers also understand that choosing a good
general topic for an assignment is an essential first step. Sometimes your instructor will give you an idea
to begin an assignment, and other times your instructor will ask you to come up with a topic on your
own. A good topic not only covers what an assignment will be about, but it also fits the assignment's
purpose and its audience.

In the next few sections, you will follow a writer named Mariah as she explores and develops her essay's
topic and focus. You will also be planning one of your own. The first important step is for you to tell
yourself why you are writing (to inform, to explain, or some other purpose) and for whom you are
writing. Write your purpose and your audience on your own sheet of paper, and keep the paper close by
as you read and write the first draft.

Experience and Observations
When selecting a topic, you may want to consider something that interests you or something based on
your own life and personal experiences. Even everyday observations can lead to interesting topics. After
writers think about their experiences and observations, they often take notes on paper to better
develop their thoughts. These notes help writers discover what they have to say about their topic.

Reading
Reading plays a vital role in all the stages of the writing process, but it first figures in the development of
ideas and topics. Different kinds of documents can help you choose and develop a topic. For example, a
magazine cover advertising the latest research on the threat of global warming may catch your eye in
the supermarket. This subject may interest you, and you may consider global warming as a topic. Or
maybe a novel's courtroom drama sparks your curiosity of a particular lawsuit or legal controversy.

After you choose a topic, critical reading is essential to the development of a topic. While reading almost
any document, you evaluate the author's point of view by thinking about his main idea and his support.
When you judge the author's argument, you discover more about not only the author's opinion but also
your own. If this step already seems daunting, remember that even the best writers need to use
prewriting strategies to generate ideas.

Prewriting strategies depend on your critical reading skills. Reading, prewriting and brainstorming
exercises (and outlines and drafts later in the writing process) will further develop your topic and ideas.
As you continue to follow the writing process, you will see how Mariah uses critical reading skills to
assess her own prewriting exercises.

Brainstorming

Brainstorming refers to writing techniques used to:

     Generate topic ideas
     Transfer your abstract thoughts on a topic into more concrete ideas on paper (or digitally on a

         computer screen)
     Organize the ideas you have generated to discover a focus and develop a working thesis
Although brainstorming techniques can be helpful in all stages of the writing process, you will have to
find the techniques that are most effective for your writing needs. The following general strategies can
be used when initially deciding on a topic, or for narrowing the focus for a topic: freewriting, asking
questions, listing, and clustering/idea mapping.

In the initial stage of the writing process, it is fine if you choose a general topic. Later you can use
brainstorming strategies to narrow the focus of the topic.

Freewriting
Freewriting is an exercise in which you write freely about any topic for a set amount of time (usually five
to seven minutes). During the time limit, you may jot down any thoughts that come to your mind. Try
not to worry about grammar, spelling, or punctuation. Instead, write as quickly as you can without
stopping. If you get stuck, just copy the same word or phrase over and over again until you come up
with a new thought.

Writing often comes easier when you have a personal connection with the topic you have chosen.
Remember, to generate ideas in your freewriting, you may also think about readings that you have
enjoyed or that have challenged your thinking. Doing this may lead your thoughts in interesting
directions.

Quickly recording your thoughts on paper will help you discover what you have to say about a topic.
When writing quickly, try not to doubt or question your ideas. Allow yourself to write freely and
unselfconsciously. Once you start writing with few limitations, you may find you have more to say than
you first realized. Your flow of thoughts can lead you to discover even more ideas about the topic.
Freewriting may even lead you to discover another topic that excites you even more.

Look at Mariah's example below. The instructor allowed the members of the class to choose their own
topics, and Mariah thought about her experiences as a communications major. She used this freewriting
exercise to help her generate more concrete ideas from her own experience.

Freewriting Example

                                                                                                                           2.14
Last semester my favorite class was about mass media. We got to study radio and
television. People say we watch too much television, and even though I try not to, I end up
watching a few reality shows just to relax. Everyone has to relax! It's too hard to relax
when something like the news (my husband watches all the time) is on because it's too
scary now. Too much bad news, not enough good news. News. Newspapers I don't read as
much anymore. I can get the headlines on my homepage when I check my email. Email could
be considered mass media too these days. I used to go to the video store a few times a
week before I started school, but now the only way I know what movies are current is to
listen for the Oscar nominations. We have cable but we can't afford movie channels, so I
sometimes look at older movies late at night. UGH. A few of them get played again and
again until you're sick of them. My husband thinks I'm crazy, but sometimes there are old
black-and-whites on from the 1930s and `40s. I could never live my life in black-and-white.
I like the home decorating shows and love how people use color on their walls. Makes rooms
look so bright. When we buy a home, if we ever can, I'll use lots of color. Some of those
shows even show you how to do major renovations by yourself. Knock down walls and
everything. Not for me--or my husband. I'm handier than he is. I wonder if they could
make a reality show about us?

Asking Questions
Who? What? Where? When? Why? How?

In everyday situations, you pose these kinds of questions to get more information. Who will be my
partner for the project? When is the next meeting? Why is my car making that odd noise? When faced
with a writing assignment, you might ask yourself, "How do I begin?"

You seek the answers to these questions to gain knowledge, to better understand your daily
experiences, and to plan for the future. Asking these types of questions will also help you with the
writing process. As you choose your topic, answering these questions can help you revisit the ideas you
already have and generate new ways to think about your topic. You may also discover aspects of the
topic that are unfamiliar to you and that you would like to learn more about. All these idea-gathering
techniques will help you plan for future work on your assignment.

When Mariah reread her freewriting notes, she found she had rambled and her thoughts were
disjointed. She realized that the topic that interested her most was the one she started with, the media.
She then decided to explore that topic by asking herself questions about it. Her purpose was to refine
media into a topic she felt comfortable writing about. To see how asking questions can help you choose
a topic, take a look at the following chart that Mariah completed to record her questions and answers.
She asked herself the questions that reporters and journalists use to gather information for their stories.
The questions are often called the 5WH questions, after their initial letters.

Example of "Asking Questions"

                                                                                                                           2.15
Who? I use media. Students, teachers, parents, employers and employees-- almost
         everyone uses media.

What? The media can be a lot of things-- television, radio, email (I think), newspapers,
         magazines, books.

Where?The media is almost everywhere now. It's at home, at work, in cars, and even on cell
         phones.

When? The media has been around for a long time, but it seems a lot more important now.

Why?  Hmm. This is a good question. I don't know why there is mass media. Maybe we have
      it because we have the technology now. Or people live far away from their families
      and have to stay in touch.

How? Well, media is possible because of the technology inventions, but I don't know how
         they all work.

Narrowing the focus
After rereading her essay assignment, Mariah realized her general topic, mass media, is too broad for
her class's short paper requirement. Three pages are not enough to cover all the concerns in mass
media today. Mariah also realized that although her readers are other communications majors who are
interested in the topic, they might want to read a paper about a particular issue in mass media.

The prewriting techniques of brainstorming by freewriting and asking questions helped Mariah think
more about her topic, but the following prewriting strategies can help her (and you) narrow the focus of
the topic:

     Listing

     Clustering/Idea Mapping

Narrowing the focus means breaking up the topic into subtopics, or more specific points. Generating lots
of subtopics will help you eventually select the ones that fit the assignment and appeal to you and your
audience.

Listing
Listing is a term often applied to describe any prewriting technique writers use to generate ideas on a
topic, including freewriting and asking questions. You can make a list on your own or in a group with
your classmates. Start with a blank sheet of paper (or a blank computer screen) and write your general
topic across the top. Underneath your topic, make a list of more specific ideas. Think of your general
topic as a broad category and the list items as things that fit in that category. Often you will find that
one item can lead to the next, creating a flow of ideas that can help you narrow your focus to a more
specific paper topic. The following is Mariah's brainstorming list:

                                                                                          2.16
Mass Media

 Magazines               Internet Cell Phones
 Newspapers              Smart Phones
 Broadcasting            Text Messages
 Radio Television        Tiny Cameras
 DVD                     GPS
 Gaming/Video Games

From this list, Mariah could narrow her focus to a particular technology under the broad category of
"mass media."

Idea Mapping
Idea mapping, sometimes called clustering or webbing, allows you to visualize your ideas on paper using
circles, lines, and arrows. This technique is also known as clustering because ideas are broken down and
clustered, or grouped, together. Many writers like this method because the shapes show how the ideas
relate or connect, and writers can find a focused topic from the connections mapped. Using idea
mapping, you might discover interesting connections between topics that you had not thought of
before.

To create an idea map:

    1. Start by writing your general topic in a circle in the center of a blank sheet of paper. Moving out
         from the main circle, write down as many concepts and terms ideas you can think of related to
         your general topic in blank areas of the page. Jot down your ideas quickly--do not overthink your
         responses. Try to fill the page.

    2. Once you've filled the page, circle the concepts and terms that are relevant to your topic. Use
         lines or arrows to categorize and connect closely related ideas. Add and cluster as many ideas as
         you can think of.

To continue brainstorming, Mariah tried idea mapping. Review the following idea map that Mariah
created:

                                                                                                      2.17
                                                Figure: Mariah's Idea Map

Notice Mariah's largest circle contains her general topic, mass media. Then, the general topic branches
into two subtopics written in two smaller circles: television and radio. The subtopic television branches
into even more specific topics: cable and DVDs. From there, Mariah drew more circles and wrote more
specific ideas: high definition and digital recording from cable and Blu-ray from DVDs. The radio topic led
Mariah to draw connections between music, downloads versus CDs, and, finally, piracy. From this idea
map, Mariah saw she could consider narrowing the focus of her mass media topic to the more specific
topic of music piracy.

    Topic Checklist: Developing a Good Topic

     Am I interested in this topic?
     Would my audience be interested?
     Do I have prior knowledge or experience with this topic? If so, would I be comfortable exploring

         this topic and sharing my experience?
     Do I want to learn more about this topic?
     Is this topic specific?
     Does it fit the length of the assignment?
Prewriting strategies are a vital first step in the writing process. First, they help you choose a broad
topic, and then they help you narrow the focus of the topic to a more specific idea. An effective topic

                                                                                                                           2.18
ensures that you are ready for the next step: Developing a working thesis and planning the organization
of your essay by creating an outline.

Outlining

Purpose of an Outline
Once your topic has been chosen, your ideas have been generated through brainstorming techniques,
and you've developed a working thesis, the next step in the prewriting stage is to create an outline.
Sometimes called a "blueprint," or "plan" for your paper, an outline helps writers organize their
thoughts and categorize the main points they wish to make in an order that makes sense.

The purpose of an outline is to help you organize your paper by checking to see if and how your ideas
connect to each other, or whether you need to flesh out a point or two. No matter the length of the
paper, from a three-page weekly assignment to a 50-page senior thesis, outlines can help you see the
overall picture. Having an outline also helps prevent writers from "getting stuck" when writing the first
draft of an essay.

A well-developed outline will show the essential elements of an essay:

     thesis of essay
     main idea of each body paragraph
     evidence/support offered in each paragraph to substantiate the main points
A well-developed outline breaks down the parts of your thesis in a clear, hierarchical manner. Writing an
outline before beginning an essay helps the writer organize ideas generated through brainstorming
and/or research. In short, a well-developed outline makes your paper easier to write.

The formatting of any outline is not arbitrary; the system of formatting and number/letter designations
creates a visual hierarchy of the ideas, or points, being made in the essay. Major points, in other words,
should not be buried in subtopic levels.

Creating an Outline
     Identify your topic. Put the topic in your own words with a single sentence or phrase to help you
         stay on topic.

     Determine your main points. What are the main points you want to make to convince your
         audience? Refer back to the prewriting/brainstorming exercise of answering 5WH questions:
         "why or how is the main topic important?" Using your brainstorming notes, you should be able
         to create a working thesis.

     List your main points/ideas in a logical order. You can always change the order later as you
         evaluate your outline.

     Create sub-points for each major idea. Typically, each time you have a new number or letter,
         there needs to be at least two points (i.e. if you have an A, you need a B; if you have a 1, you
         need a 2; etc.). Though perhaps frustrating at first, it is indeed useful because it forces you to

                                                                                                                           2.19
         think hard about each point. If you can't create two points, then reconsider including the first in
         your paper, as it may be extraneous information that may detract from your argument.
     Evaluate. Review your organizational plan, your blueprint for your paper. Does each paragraph
         have a controlling idea/topic sentence? Is each point adequately supported? Look over what
         you have written. Does it make logical sense? Is each point suitably fleshed out? Is there
         anything included that is unnecessary?
Sample Outline
Thesis: Making the perfect egg omelet requires proper preparation and skillful cooking technique.

             I. Making the perfect egg omelet requires proper preparation.
                   A. The cook must have adequate utensils.
                        1. A heavy, Teflon-coated frying pan gives even heat and prevents burning.
                        2. A plastic spatula prevents the cook from scratching the frying pan.
                   B. The cook must select fresh ingredients.
                        1. Fresh eggs make a fluffier omelet than eggs that have aged.
                        2. Sweet milk blends into the egg batter more evenly than sour milk.
                        3. Fresh vegetable oil is necessary to avoid giving the omelet a greasy flavor and
                             texture.
                        4. Newly cracked pepper and sea salt add extra zest to the egg batter.

            II. Making the perfect egg omelet requires skillful cooking techniques.
                   A. The cook must prepare the egg batter quickly.
                        1. The eggs must be beaten with a whisk until they are fluffy.
                        2. The milk and seasonings must be whisked into the egg batter before the eggs go
                             flat.
                   B. The cook must fry the egg batter with care.
                        1. The egg batter must be poured into the frying pan as soon as the oil is hot.
                        2. The omelet must be turned in the pan only once as soon as the batter sets on
                             top.

                                                                                                                           2.20
                          Writing Thesis Statements7

To be effective, all support in an essay must work together to convey a central point; otherwise, an
essay can fall into the trap of being out of order and confusing. Just as a topic sentence focuses and
unifies a single paragraph, the thesis statement focuses and unifies an entire essay. This statement is
like a signpost that signals the essay's destination; it tells the reader the point you want to make in your
essay, while the essay itself supports that point.

Because writing is not a linear process, you may find that the best thesis statement develops near the
end of your first draft. However, creating a draft or working thesis early in the writing project helps give
the drafting process clear direction. You should form your thesis before you begin to organize an essay,
but you may find that it needs revision as the essay develops.

A thesis is not just a topic, but rather the writer's comment or interpretation of the question or subject.
For whatever topic you select (for example, school uniforms, social networking), you must ask yourself,
"What do I want to say about it?" Asking and then answering this question is vital to forming a thesis
that is precise, forceful, and confident.

In the majority of essays, a thesis is one sentence long and appears toward the end of the introductory
paragraph. It is specific and focuses on one to three points of a single idea--points that are able to be
demonstrated in the body paragraphs. It forecasts the content of the essay and suggests how you will
organize your information. Remember that a thesis statement does not summarize an issue but rather
dissects it.

Working Thesis Statements

A strong thesis statement must have the following qualities:

     It must be arguable: A thesis statement must state a point of view or judgment about a topic. An
         established fact is not considered arguable.

     It must be supportable: The thesis statement must contain a point of view that can be supported
         with evidence (reasons, facts, examples).

     It must be specific: A thesis statement must be precise enough to allow for a coherent argument
         and remain focused on the topic.

Examples of Appropriate Thesis Statements

    1. Closing all American borders for a period of five years is one solution that will tackle illegal
         immigration.

Pitfalls to Avoid

A thesis is weak when it is simply a declaration of your subject or a description of what you will discuss
in your essay.

     Weak thesis statement: My paper will explain why imagination is more important than
         knowledge.

A thesis is weak when it makes an unreasonable or outrageous claim or insults the opposing side.

     Weak thesis statement: Religious radicals across America are trying to legislate their Puritanical
         beliefs by banning required high school books.

A thesis is weak when it contains an obvious fact or something that no one can disagree with or provides
a dead end.

     Weak thesis statement: Advertising companies use sex to sell their products.

A thesis is weak when the statement is too broad.

     Weak thesis statement: The life of Abraham Lincoln was long and challenging.

Ways to Revise Your Thesis

Your thesis statement begins as a working thesis statement, an indefinite statement that you make
about your topic early in the writing process for the purpose of planning and guiding your writing.
Working thesis statements often become stronger as you gather information and form new opinions
and reasons for those opinions. Revision helps you strengthen your thesis so that it matches what you
have expressed in the body of the paper.

You can cut down on irrelevant aspects and revise your thesis by taking the following steps:
     Pinpoint and replace all nonspecific words, such as people, everything, society, or life, with more
         precise words in order to reduce any vagueness.

               Working thesis: Young people have to work hard to succeed in life.

                                                                                                                           2.22
          Revised thesis: Recent college graduates must have discipline and persistence in order
              to find and maintain a stable job in which they can use and be appreciated for their
              talents.

          Explanation: The original includes too broad a range of people and does not define
              exactly what success entails. By replacing those general words like people and work
              hard, the writer can better focus their research and gain more direction in their writing.
              The revised thesis makes a more specific statement about success and what it means to
              work hard.

 Clarify ideas that need explanation by asking yourself questions that narrow your thesis.

          Working thesis: The welfare system is a joke.

          Revised thesis: The welfare system keeps a socioeconomic class from gaining
              employment by alluring members of that class with unearned income, instead of
              programs to improve their education and skill sets.

          Explanation: A joke means many things to many people. Readers bring all sorts of
              backgrounds and perspectives to the reading process and would need clarification for a
              word so vague. This expression may also be too informal for the selected audience. By
              asking questions, the writer can devise a more precise and appropriate explanation for
              joke and more accurately defines their stance, which will better guide the writing of the
              essay.

 Replace any linking verbs with action verbs. Linking verbs are forms of the verb to be, a verb that
    simply states that a situation exists.

          Working thesis: Kansas City school teachers are not paid enough.

          Revised thesis: The Kansas City legislature cannot afford to pay its educators, resulting in
              job cuts and resignations in a district that sorely needs highly qualified and dedicated
              teachers.

          Explanation: The linking verb in this working thesis statement is the word are. Linking
              verbs often make thesis statements weak because they do not express action. Rather,
              they connect words and phrases to the second half of the sentence. Readers might
              wonder, "Why are they not paid enough?" But this statement does not compel them to
              ask many more questions. Asking questions will help you replace the linking verb with
              an action verb, thus forming a stronger thesis statement that takes a more definitive
              stance on the issue:

                    Who is not paying the teachers enough?
                    What is considered "enough"?

                                                                                                                      2.23
                    What is the problem?
                    What are the results?
 Omit any general claims that are hard to support.
          Working thesis: Today's teenage girls are too sexualized.
          Revised thesis: Teenage girls who are captivated by the sexual images on the internet
              and social media are conditioned to believe that a woman's worth depends on her
              sensuality, a feeling that harms their self-esteem and behavior.
          Explanation: It is true that some young women in today's society are more sexualized
              than in the past, but that is not true for all girls. Many girls have strict parents, dress
              appropriately, and do not engage in sexual activity while in middle school and high
              school. The writer of this thesis should ask the following questions:
                    Which teenage girls?
                    What constitutes "too" sexualized?
                    Why are they behaving that way?
                    Where does this behavior show up?
                    What are the repercussions?

                                                                                                                      2.24
Section 3: Rhetorical Situation

                                 Introduction

Oftentimes in a composition course, the focus is on getting students to view themselves as part of a
larger dialogic, or discursive, community. In order to do so, students must understand the rhetorical
strategies employed in argumentation. In the section that follows, we introduce you to the concept of
rhetoric from the classical viewpoint and discuss ways in which to use Aristotelian strategies. The classic
appeals to ethos, pathos, and logos are discussed along with common logical fallacies that weaken an
argument. We end the section by covering different rhetorical modes of writing that typically precede
argumentation.

                             What is Rhetoric?1

The definition of rhetoric commonly used is "the art of persuasion." Rhetoric is everywhere and can
involve any kind of text including speech, written words, images, movies, documentaries, the news, etc.
So it is important to understand how to navigate the murky waters of persuasion and rhetoric.

According to the section titled "Classical Argument: A (Very) Brief History of Rhetoric" from the Purdue
Online Writing Lab (OWL) website:

         In ancient Greece and Rome, rhetoric was most often considered to be the art of persuasion and
         was primarily described as a spoken skill. In these societies, discourse occurred almost
         exclusively in the public sphere, so learning the art of effective, convincing speaking was
         essential for public orators, legal experts, politicians, philosophers, generals, and educators. To
         prepare for the speeches they would need to make in these roles, students engaged in written
         exercises called progymnasmata. Today, rhetorical scholars still use strategies from the classical
         era to conceptualize argument. However, whereas oral discourse was the main focus of the
         classical rhetoricians, modern scholars also study the peculiarities of written argument.2

Why Do I Need to Think Rhetorically?

A rhetorical analysis asks you to examine the interactions between a text, an author, and an audience.
However, before you can begin the analysis you must first understand the historical context of the text
and the rhetorical situation.

To locate a text's historical context, you must determine where in history the text is situated--was it
written in the past five years? Ten? One hundred? You should think about how that might affect the
information being delivered. Once you determine the background of the text, you should determine the
rhetorical situation (i.e. who, what, when, where, why). The following questions may help:

     What is the topic of the text?

     Who is the author? What are the author's credentials, what sort of experiences have they had?
         How do their credentials, or lack of, connect (or not) with the topic of the text?

     Who is the target audience? Who did the author have in mind when they created the text?

     Who is the unintended audience? Are they related in anyway to the target audience?

     What was the occasion, historical context, or setting? What was happening during the time
         period when the text was produced? Where was the text distributed or published?

     How does the topic relate to the author, audience, and occasion?

     What is the author's purpose? Why did they create the text?

     In what medium was the text originally produced?

Meaning can change based on when, where, and why a text was produced and meaning can change
depending on who reads the text. Rhetorical situations affect the meaning of a text because it may have
been written for a specific audience, in a specific place, and during a specific time. An important part of
the rhetorical situation is audience and since many of the articles were not written with you, a college
student in a college writing class, in mind, the meaning you interpret or recognize might be different
from the author's original target audience. For example, if you read an article about higher education
written in 2016, then you, the reader, are connected with and understand the context of the topic.
However, if you were asked to read a text about higher education written in 1876, you would probably
have a hard time understanding and connecting to it because you are not the target audience and the
text's context (or rhetorical situation) has changed.

Further, the occasion for writing might be very different, too. Articles or scholarly works that are at least
five years old or older may include out of date references and may not represent relevant or accurate
information (e.g. think of the change regarding same sex marriage in the past few years). Older works
require that you investigate significant historical moments or changes that have occurred since the
writing of a given text.

Targeted audience and occasion will all affect the way you, the reader, read a text as well as the date,
site, and medium of publication. Therefore, it is your duty as a thoughtful reader to research these
aspects in order to fully understand and conceptualize the text's rhetorical situation. Furthermore, even
though you might not be a member of the targeted audience, or perhaps might not have even been
alive during the production of a text, that does not mean that you cannot recognize rhetorical moves
within it. We will examine the aspects of the rhetorical situation in a later section but first, let's review a
few of the characteristics of classical rhetoric.

                                                                                                                            3.2
                             Classical Rhetoric3

In James Murphy's translation of Quintilian's Institutio Oratoria, he explains that "Education for
Quintilian begins in the cradle, and ends only when life itself ends" (xxi). The result of a life of learning,
for Quintilian, is a perfect speech where "the student is given a statement of a problem and asked to
prepare an appropriate speech giving his solution" (Murphy xxiii). In this version of the world, a good
citizen is always a PUBLIC participant. This forces the good citizen to know the rigors of public
argumentation: "Rhetoric, or the theory of effective communication, is for Quintilian merely the tool of
the broadly educated citizen who is capable of analysis, reflection, and powerful action in public affairs"
(Murphy xxvii). For Quintilian, learning to argue in public is a lifelong affair. He believed that the "perfect
orator. . . cannot exist unless he is above all a good man" (6). Whether we agree with this or not, the
hope for ethical behavior has been a part of public argumentation from the beginning.

The ancient model of rhetoric (or public argumentation) is complex. As a matter of fact, there is no
single model of ancient argumentation. Plato claimed that the Sophists, such as Gorgias, were spin
doctors weaving opinion and untruth for the delight of an audience and to the detriment of their moral
fiber. For Plato, at least in the Phaedrus, public conversation was only useful if one applied it to the
search for truth. In the last decade, the work of the Sophists has been redeemed. Rather than spin
doctors, Sophists like Isocrates, and even Gorgias to some degree, are viewed as arbiters of democracy
because they believed that many people, not just male, property holding, Athenian citizens, could learn
to use rhetoric effectively in public.

Aristotle gives us a slightly more systematic approach. He is very concerned with logic. For this reason,
much of what I discuss below comes from his work. Aristotle explains that most men participate in
public argument in some fashion. It is important to note that by "men," Aristotle means citizens of
Athens: adult males with the right to vote, not including women, foreigners, or slaves. Essentially this is
a homogenous group by race, gender, and religious affiliation. We have to keep this in mind when
adapting these strategies to our current heterogeneous culture. Aristotle explains,

         . . . for to a certain extent all men attempt to discuss statements and to maintain them, to
         defend themselves and to attack others. Ordinary people do this either at random or through
         practice and from acquired habit. Both ways being possible, the subject can plainly be handled
         systematically, for it is possible to inquire the reason why some speakers succeed through
         practice and others spontaneously; and every one will at once agree that such an inquiry is the
         function of an art. (Honeycutt, "Aristotle's Rhetoric" 1354a I i)

For Aristotle, inquiry into this field was artistic in nature. It required both skill and practice (some
needed more of one than the other). Important here is the notion that public argument can be
systematically learned.

Aristotle did not dwell on the ethics of an argument in Rhetoric (he leaves this to other texts). He argued
that "things that are true and things that are just have a natural tendency to prevail over their
opposites" and finally that " . . . things that are true and things that are better are, by their nature,
practically always easier to prove and easier to believe in" (Honeycutt, "Aristotle's Rhetoric" 1355a I i).
As a culture, we are skeptical of this kind of position, though I think that we do often believe it on a
personal level. Aristotle admits in the next line that there are people who will use their skills at rhetoric
for harm. As his job in this section is to defend the use of rhetoric itself, he claims that everything good
can be used for harm, so rhetoric is no different from other fields. If this is true, there is even more need
to educate the citizenry so that they will not be fooled by unethical and untruthful arguments.

For many, logic simply means reasoning. To understand a person's logic, we try to find the structure of
their reasoning. Logic is not synonymous with fact or truth, though facts are part of evidence in logical
argumentation. You can be logical without being truthful. This is why more logic is not the only answer
to better public argument.

Our human brains are compelled to categorize the world as a
survival mechanism. This survival mechanism allows for quicker
thought. Two of the most basic logical strategies include inductive
and deductive reasoning. Deductive reasoning (see figure right)
starts from a premise that is a generalization about a large class
of ideas, people, etc. and moves to a specific conclusion about a
smaller category of ideas or things (All cats hate water; therefore,
my neighbor's cat will not jump in our pool). While the first
premise is the most general, the second premise is a more
particular observation. So the argument is created through
common beliefs/observations that are compared to create an
argument. For example:

                                                                                        Figure: Deductive Reasoning

               Major Premise: People who burn flags are unpatriotic.

               Minor Premise: Sara burned a flag.

               Conclusion: Sara is unpatriotic.

The above is called a syllogism. As we can see in the example, the major premise offers a general belief
held by some groups and the minor premise is a particular observation. The conclusion is drawn by
comparing the premises and developing a conclusion. If you work hard enough, you can often take a
complex argument and boil it down to a syllogism. This can reveal a great deal about the argument that
is not apparent in the longer more complex version.

                                                                                                                            3.4
Stanley Fish, professor and New York Times columnist, offers the following syllogism in his July 22, 2007,
blog entry titled "Democracy and Education": "The syllogism underlying these comments is (1) America
is a democracy (2) Schools and universities are situated within that democracy (3) Therefore schools and
universities should be ordered and administrated according to democratic principles."
Fish offered the syllogism as a way to summarize the responses to his argument that students do not, in
fact, have the right to free speech in a university classroom. The responses to Fish's standpoint were
vehemently opposed to his understanding of free speech rights and democracy. The responses are
varied and complex. However, boiling them down to a single syllogism helps to summarize the primary
rebuttal so that Fish could then offer his extended version of his standpoint.
Inductive reasoning moves in a different direction than deductive reasoning (see figure below). Inductive
reasoning starts with a particular or local statement and moves to a more general conclusion. I think of
inductive reasoning as a stacking of evidence. The more particular examples you give, the more it seems
that your conclusion is correct.
Inductive reasoning is a common method for arguing, especially when the conclusion is an obvious
probability. Inductive reasoning is the most common way that we move around in the world. If we
experience something habitually, we reason that it will happen again. For example, if we walk down a
city street and every person smiles, we might reason that this is a "nice town." This seems logical. We
have taken many similar, particular experiences (smiles) and used them to make a general conclusion
(the people in the town are nice).

                                       Figure: Inductive Reasoning
Most of the time, this reasoning works. However, we know that it can also lead us in the wrong
direction. Perhaps the people were smiling because we were wearing inappropriate clothing (country
togs in a metropolitan city), or perhaps only the people living on that particular street are "nice" and the
rest of the town is unfriendly. Research papers sometimes rely too heavily on this logical method.
Writers assume that finding ten versions of the same argument somehow prove that the point is true.

                                                                                                                            3.5
Here is another example. In Ann Coulter's book, Guilty: Liberal "Victims" and Their Assault on America,
she makes her (in)famous argument that single motherhood is the cause of many of America's ills. She
creates this argument through a piling of evidence. She lists statistics by sociologists, she lists all the
single moms who killed their children, she lists stories of single mothers who say outrageous things
about their life, children, or marriage in general, and she ends with a list of celebrity single moms that
most would agree are not good examples of motherhood. Through this list, she concludes, "Look at
almost any societal problem and you will find it is really a problem of single mothers" (36). While she
could argue, from this evidence, that being a single mother is difficult, the generalization that single
motherhood is the root of social ills in America takes the inductive reasoning too far. Despite this
example, we need inductive reasoning because it is the key to analytical thought. To write an "analysis
paper" is to use inductive reasoning.

Most academic arguments in the humanities are inductive to some degree. When you study humanity,
nothing is certain. When observing or making inductive arguments, it is important to get your evidence
from many different areas, to judge it carefully, and acknowledge the flaws. Inductive arguments must
be judged by the quality of the evidence since the conclusions are drawn directly from a body of
compiled work.

The Appeals

"The appeals" offer a lesson in rhetoric that sticks with you long after the class has ended. Perhaps it is
the rhythmic quality of the words (ethos, logos, pathos) or, simply, the usefulness of the concept.
Aristotle imagined logos, ethos, and pathos as three kinds of artistic proof. Essentially, they highlight
three ways to appeal to or persuade an audience: "(1) to reason logically, (2) to understand human
character and goodness in its various forms, (3) to understand emotions" (Honeycutt, Rhetoric 1356a).

While Aristotle and others did not explicitly dismiss emotional and character appeals, they found the
most value in logic. Contemporary rhetoricians and argumentation scholars, however, recognize the
power of emotions to sway us. Even the most stoic individuals have some emotional threshold over
which no logic can pass. For example, we can seldom be reasonable when faced with a crime against a
loved one, a betrayal, or the face of an adorable baby.

The easiest way to differentiate the appeals is to imagine selling a product based on them. Until
recently, car commercials offered a prolific source of logical, ethical, and emotional appeals.

Logos
Using logic as proof for an argument. For many students this takes the form of numerical evidence. But
as we have discussed above, logical reasoning is a kind of argumentation.

         Car Commercial: (Syllogism) Americans love adventure--Ford Escape allows for off road
         adventure-- Americans should buy a Ford Escape.

         OR

         The Ford Escape offers the best financial deal.

                                                                                                                            3.6
Ethos
Calling on particular shared values (patriotism), respected figures of authority (MLK), or one's own
character as a method for appealing to an audience.

         Car Commercial: Eco-conscious Americans drive a Ford Escape.

         OR

         [Insert favorite movie star] drives a Ford Escape.

Pathos
Using emotionally driven images or language to sway your audience.

         Car Commercial: Images of a pregnant woman being safely rushed to a hospital. Flash to two car
         seats in the back seat. Flash to family hopping out of their Ford Escape and witnessing the
         majesty of the Grand Canyon.

         OR

         After an image of a worried mother watching her sixteen year old daughter drive away: "Ford
         Escape takes the fear out of driving."

The appeals are part of everyday conversation, even if we do not use the Greek terminology.
Understanding the appeals helps us to make better rhetorical choices in designing our arguments. If you
think about the appeals as a choice, their value is clear.4

                   What is the Rhetorical Situation?5

A key component of rhetorical analysis involves thinking carefully about the rhetorical situation of a text.
You can think of the rhetorical situation as the context or set of circumstances out of which a text arises.
Any time anyone is trying to make an argument, one is doing so out of a particular context, one that
influences and shapes the argument that is being made. When we do a rhetorical analysis, we look
carefully at how the rhetorical situation (context) shapes the rhetorical act (the text).

We can understand the concept of a rhetorical situation if we examine it piece by piece, by looking
carefully at the rhetorical concepts from which it is built. The philosopher Aristotle organized these
concepts as author, audience, setting, purpose, and text. Answering the questions about these
rhetorical concepts below will give you a good sense of your text's rhetorical situation - the starting
point for rhetorical analysis.

We will use the example of President Trump's inaugural address (the text) to sift through these
questions about the rhetorical situation (context).

Author
The author of a text is the creator - the person who is communicating in order to try to effect a change
in their audience. An author doesn't have to be a single person or a person at all - an author could be an
organization. To understand the rhetorical situation of a text, one must examine the identity of the
author and their background.

     What kind of experience or authority does the author have in the subject about which they are
         speaking?

     What values does the author have, either in general or with regard to this particular subject?

     How invested is the author in the topic of the text? In other words, what affects the author's
         perspective on the topic?

     Example of author analysis for the rhetorical situation: (President Trump's Inaugural Address)
         President Trump was a first-term president and someone who had not previously held political
         office. He did not yet have experience with running the country. He is, however, a wealthy
         businessman and had a great deal of experience in the business world. His political affiliation is
         with the Republican party - the conservative political party in America.

Audience

In any text, an author is attempting to engage an audience. Before we can analyze how effectively an
author engages an audience, we must spend some time thinking about that audience. An audience is

                                                                                                                            3.8
any person or group who is the intended recipient of the text and also the person/people the author is
trying to influence. To understand the rhetorical situation of a text, one must examine who the intended
audience is by thinking about these things:

     Who is the author addressing?
         Sometimes this is the hardest question of all. We can get this information of who the author is
         addressing by looking at where an article is published. Be sure to pay attention to the
         newspaper, magazine, website, or journal title where the text is published. Often, you can
         research that publication to get a good sense of who reads it.

     What is the audience's demographic information (age, gender, etc.)?

     What is/are the background, values, interests of the intended audience?

     How open is this intended audience to the author?

     What assumptions might the audience make about the author?

     In what context is the audience receiving the text?

     Example of audience analysis for the rhetorical situation: (President Trump's Inaugural Address)
         Inaugural addresses are delivered to "the American people"; one can assume that all Americans
         are the intended audience. However, Americans were divided at the moment of President
         Trump's election with some voters very happy that he was elected and others upset by it. Those
         opinions tended to split along party lines: Republicans tended to support Trump, whereas
         Democrats were critical of him. Republicans may be making the assumption that President
         Trump would be a great leader; Democrats were likely making the assumption that he would be
         a bad leader. As a candidate, President Trump (like all political candidates) spent most of his
         time in speeches trying to rally his base of supporters (his audience - Republican voters). In the
         inaugural address, he knows that his intended audience, his Republican base, is watching and
         listening with support. But there may be others who are watching his speech who are not a part
         of the intended audience and, as president, he likely wishes to engage and to reach out to all
         including the Democrats who rejected him.

Setting

Nothing happens in a vacuum, and that includes the creation of any text. Essays, speeches, photos,
political ads - any text - was written in a specific time and/or place, all of which can affect the way the
text communicates its message. To understand the rhetorical situation of a text, we can identify the
particular occasion or event that prompted the text's creation at the particular time it was created.
When considering the setting in terms of rhetorical analysis, consider the following:

     Was there a debate about the topic that the author of the text addresses? If so, what are (or
         were) the various perspectives within that debate?

     Did something specific occur that motivated the author to speak out?

                                                                                                                            3.9
     Example of setting analysis for the rhetorical situation: (President Trump's Inaugural Address):
         The occasion of President Trump giving this speech is his election to the presidency. All
         presidents are expected to give a speech at their inauguration, therefore, the newly elected
         President Trump was required to give one.

Purpose

The purpose of a text blends the author with the setting and the audience. Looking at a text's purpose
means looking at the author's motivations for creating it. The author has decided to start a conversation
or join one that is already underway. Why have they decided to join in? In any text, the author may be
trying to inform, to convince, to define, to announce, or to activate a debate or discussion. When
determining rhetorical purpose, consider the following in regard to the author:

     What is the author hoping to achieve with this text?
     Why did the author decide to join the conversation about the topic?

     What does the author want from their audience? What does the author want the audience to
         do once the text is communicated?

     Example of purpose analysis for the rhetorical situation: (President Trump's Inaugural Address):
         President Trump's purpose in the inaugural address was to set the tone for his presidency, to
         share his vision with Americans, and to attempt to unite the country and prepare it for moving
         forward with his agenda.

Text

When analyzing the rhetorical situation of a given text, it is important to consider the format, or
medium, in which the text is being made. If you are analyzing an image for rhetorical context, elements
such as shading, color, and placement are part of the argument being presented. Other forms of media
that a text might take include a written essay, speech, song, protest sign, meme, or sculpture. When
examining the rhetorical situation of a text's medium, ask yourself the following:

     What is gained by having a text composed in a particular format/medium?

     What limitations does that format/medium have?
     What opportunities for expression does that format/medium have (that perhaps other formats

         do not have?)

     Example of text analysis for the rhetorical situation: (President Trump's Inaugural Address)
         Inaugural addresses are expected for each president. They are delivered in Washington DC -
         always in the same spot. The tone is formal. Inaugural addresses generally lay out a vision for
         the incoming president's term. Therefore, there are at least two possible ways in which to
         examine the text of an inaugural address: the written text, and the verbal speech.

A Note About Audience

                                                                                                                           3.10
What is the difference between an audience and a reader? Thinking about audience can be a bit tricky.
Your audience is the person or group that you intend to reach with your writing. We sometimes call this
the intended audience - the group of people to whom a text is intentionally directed. But any text likely
also has an unintended audience, a reader (or readers) who read it even without being the intended
recipient. The reader might be the person you have in mind as you write, the audience you're trying to
reach, but they might be some random person you've never thought of a day in your life. You can't
always know much about random readers, but you should have some understanding of who your
audience is. It's the audience that you want to focus on as you shape your message.6

                      What is Rhetorical Analysis?7

Rhetoric: The art of persuasion

Analysis: Breaking down the whole into pieces for the purpose of examination

Unlike summary, a rhetorical analysis does not simply require a restatement of ideas; instead, you must
recognize rhetorical moves that an author is making in an attempt to persuade their audience to do or
to think something. In the 21st century's abundance of information, it can sometimes be difficult to
discern what is a rhetorical strategy and what is simple manipulation. However, an understanding of
rhetoric and rhetorical moves will help you become more savvy with the information surrounding you
on a day-to-day basis. In other words, rhetorical moves can be a form of manipulation, but if you can
recognize those moves, then you can be a more critical consumer of information rather than blindly
accepting whatever you read, see, hear, etc. as indisputable truth.

The goal of a rhetorical analysis is to explain what is happening in the text, why the author might have
chosen to use a particular move or set of rhetorical moves, and how those choices might affect the
audience. The text you analyze might be explanatory, although there will be aspects of argument
because you must negotiate with what the author is trying to do and what you think the author is doing.

One of the elements of doing a rhetorical analysis is looking at a text's rhetorical situation. The
rhetorical situation is the context out of which a text is created. Another element of rhetorical analysis is
simply reading and summarizing the text. You have to be able to describe the basics of the author's
thesis and main points before you can begin to analyze it.

To do rhetorical analysis, first connect the rhetorical situation to the text. Move beyond simply
summarizing and instead look at how the author shapes their text based on its context. In developing
your reading and analytical skills, allow yourself to think about what you're reading, to question the text
and your responses to it as you read. Consider using the following questions to help you to take the text
apart--dissecting it or unpacking to see how it works:

     Does the author successfully support the thesis or claim? Is the point held consistently
         throughout the text or does it wander at any point?

     Is the evidence the author used effective for the intended audience? How might the intended
         audience respond to the types of evidence that the author used to support the thesis/claim?

     What rhetorical moves do you see the author making to help achieve their purpose? Are there
         word choices or content choices that seem to you to be clearly related to the author 's agenda
         for the text?

     Describe the tone in the piece. Is it friendly? Authoritative? Does it lecture? Is it biting or
         sarcastic? Does the author use simple language or is it full of jargon? Does the language feel
         positive or negative? Point to aspects of the text that create the tone; spend some time
         examining these and considering how and why they work.

     Is the author objective, or do they try to convince you to have a certain opinion? Why does the
         author try to persuade you to adopt this viewpoint? If the author is biased, does this interfere
         with the way you read and understand the text?

     Do you feel like the author knows who you are? Does the text seem to be aimed at readers like
         you or at a different audience? What assumptions does the author make about their audience?
         Would most people find these reasonable, acceptable, or accurate?

     Does the flow of the text make sense? Is the line of reasoning logical? Are there any gaps? Are
         there any spots where you feel the reasoning is flawed in some way?

     Does the author try to appeal to your emotions? Does the author use any controversial words in
         the headline or the article? Do these affect your reading or your interest?

     Do you believe the author? Do you accept their thoughts and ideas? Why or why not?
Once you have done this basic, rhetorical, critical reading of your text, you are ready to think about how
the rhetorical situation - the context out of which the text arises - influences certain rhetorical appeals
that appear in it.8

      Rhetorical Appeals: Logos, Pathos, and Ethos Defined9

Rhetoric, as the previous sections have discussed, is the way that authors use and manipulate language
in order to persuade an audience. Once we understand the rhetorical situation out of which a text is
created (why it was written, for whom it was written, by whom it was written, how the medium in which
it was written creates certain constraints, or perhaps freedom of expression), we can look at how all of
those contextual elements shape the author's creation of the text.

We can look first at the classical rhetorical appeals which are the three ways to classify an author's
intellectual, moral, and emotional approaches to getting the audience to react in the manner in which
the author may have intended.

Rhetorical Appeals

In composition studies, the term rhetorical appeals refers to the use of ethos, pathos, and logos. These
are classical Greek terms dating back to Aristotle who is traditionally viewed as the creator of rhetoric.
To be rhetorically effective (and thus persuasive), an author must engage the audience in a variety of
compelling ways which involves carefully choosing how to craft their argument so that the intended
outcome is achieved. Often that outcome occurs when the audience agrees with the argument or point
being presented. Aristotle defined these modes of engagement and gave them the terms that we still
use today: logos, pathos, and ethos.

                                                    Logos: Appeal to Logic

 Logic. Reason. Rationality. Logos is brainy and intellectual, cool, calm, collected, objective.

 When an author relies on logos, it means that they are using logic, careful structure, and objective
 evidence to appeal to the audience. Objective evidence is anything that can be proven with statistics or
 other facts via more than one source. Oftentimes that evidence has been validated by more than one
 authority in the field of study.

 For example, if Dr. Smith was trying to convince her students to complete their homework, she might
 explain that she understands everyone is busy and they have other classes (non-biased), but that
 completing their homework will help them get a better grade on their test (explanation). She could add
 to this explanation by providing statistics showing the number of students who failed and didn't
 complete their homework versus the number of students who passed and did complete their homework

(factual evidence). This is an example of logos employed for the purposes of argument and persuasion.

Logical appeals rest on rational modes of thinking, such as:

     Comparison - a comparison between one thing (with regard to your topic) and another, similar
         thing to help support your claim. It is important that the comparison is fair and valid - the things
         being compared must share significant traits of similarity.

     Cause/effect thinking - you argue that X has caused Y, or that X is likely to cause Y to help
         support your claim. Be careful with the latter - it can be difficult to predict that something "will"
         happen in the future.

     Deductive reasoning - starting with a broad, general claim/example and using it to support a
         more specific point or claim (picture an hourglass where the sands gather in the middle)

     Inductive reasoning - using several specific examples or cases to make a broad generalization
         (consider the old question of "if your friend jumped off of a bridge, would you" to make the
         sweeping claim that all young people are easily persuaded to follow the crowd)

     Analogical reasoning - moves from one particular claim/example to another, seemingly
         sequential (sometimes this line of reasoning is used to make a guilt by association claim)

     Exemplification - use of many examples or a variety of evidence to support a single point
     Elaboration - moving beyond just including a fact, but explaining the significance or relevance of

         that fact
     Coherent thought - maintaining a well organized line of reasoning; not repeating ideas or

         jumping around

                                                 Pathos: Appeal to Emotions

 When an author relies on pathos, it means that they are trying to tap into the audience's emotions to
 get them to agree with the author's claim. An author using pathos appeals wants the audience to feel
 something: anger, pride, joy, rage, or happiness. For example, many of us have seen the ASPCA
 commercials that use photographs of injured puppies, or sad-looking kittens, and slow, depressing music
 to emotionally persuade their audience to donate money. This is a classic example of the use of pathos
 in argument.

 Pathos-based rhetorical strategies are any strategies that get the audience to "open up" to the topic, the
 argument, or to the author through an emotional connection. Emotions can make us vulnerable and an
 author can use this vulnerability to get the audience to believe that their argument is a compelling one.

 Pathetic appeals might include:

                                                                                                                         3.15
     Expressive descriptions of people, places, or events that help the reader to feel or experience
         those events

     Vivid imagery of people, places or events that help the reader to feel like they are seeing those
         events

     Sharing personal stories that make the reader feel a connection to, or empathy for, the person
         being described

     Using emotion-laden vocabulary as a way to put the reader into that specific emotional mindset
         (what is the author trying to make the audience feel? and how are they doing that?)

     Using any information that will evoke an emotional response from the audience. This could
         involve making the audience feel empathy or disgust for the person/group/event being
         discussed, or perhaps connection to or rejection of the person/group/event being discussed.

When reading a text, try to locate where the author is trying to convince the reader by strictly using
emotions because, if used to excess, pathos appeals can indicate a lack of substance or emotional
manipulation of the audience. If the only way in which an author can persuade the reader is by making
him/her sad or angry, does that make for a solid, valid argument?

                                             Ethos: Appeal to Values/Trust

Appeals using ethos are typically two faceted focusing on audience values and authorial
credibility/character.

On the one hand, when an author makes an ethical appeal, they are attempting to tap into the values
or ideologies that the audience holds. Examples include patriotism, tradition, justice, equality, dignity
for all humankind, self preservation, or other specific social, religious or philosophical values (Christian
values, socialism, capitalism, feminism, etc.). These values can sometimes feel very close to emotions,
but they are felt on a social level rather than only on a personal level. When an author evokes the
values that the audience cares about as a way to justify or support their argument, we classify that as
ethos. The audience will feel that the author is making an argument that is "right" (in the sense of
moral "right"-ness, i.e., My argument rests upon the values that matter to you. Therefore, you should
accept my argument). This first part of the definition of ethos, then, is focused on the audience's
values.

On the other hand, this sense of referencing what is "right" in an ethical appeal connects to the other
sense of ethos, the author. Ethos that is centered on the author revolves around two concepts: the
credibility of the author and their character.

Credibility of the speaker/author is determined by their knowledge and expertise in the subject at
hand. For example, if you are learning about Einstein's Theory of Relativity, would you rather learn

                                                                                                                        3.16
   from a professor of physics or a cousin who took two science classes in high school thirty years ago? It
   is fair to say that, in general, the professor of physics would have more credibility to discuss the topic
   of physics than your cousin. To establish their credibility, an author may draw attention to who they
   are or what kinds of experience they have with the topic being discussed as an ethical appeal (i.e.,
   Because I have experience with this topic - and I know my stuff! - you should trust what I am saying
   about this topic). Some authors do not have to establish their credibility because the audience already
   knows who they are and that they are credible.

   Character is another aspect of ethos that is different from credibility because it involves personal
   history and sometimes personality traits. A person can be credible but lack character or vice versa. For
   example, in politics, sometimes the most experienced candidates - those who might be the most
   credible candidates - fail to win elections because voters do not accept their character. Politicians take
   pains to shape their character as leaders who have the interests of the voters at heart. The candidate
   who successfully proves to the voters (the audience) that they have the type of character that they can
   trust is more likely to win.

   Thus, ethos comes down to trust. How can the author get the audience to trust him or her so that they
   will accept their argument? How can the author make himself or herself appear as a credible speaker
   who embodies the character traits that the audience values?

   In building ethical appeals, we may see authors:

         Referring either directly or indirectly to the values that matter to the intended audience (so
             that the audience will trust the speaker)

         Using language, phrasing, imagery, or other writing styles common to people who hold those
             values, thereby "talking the talk" of people with those values (again, so that the audience is
             inclined to trust the speaker)

         Referring to their experience and/or authority with the topic (and therefore demonstrating
             their credibility)

         Referring to their own character, or making an effort to build their character in the text

   When reading, you should always think about the author's credibility regarding the subject as well as
   their character. Here is an example of a rhetorical move that connects with ethos: when reading an
   article about abortion, the author mentions that she has had an abortion. That is an example of an
   ethical move because the author is creating credibility via anecdotal evidence and first person
   narrative. In a rhetorical analysis project, it would be up to you, the analyzer, to point out this move
   and associate it with a rhetorical strategy.

When writers misuse Logos, Pathos, or Ethos, arguments can be weakened
Above, we defined and described what logos, pathos, and ethos are and why authors may use those
strategies. Sometimes, using a combination of appeals leads to a sound, balanced, and persuasive
argument. It is important to understand, though, that using rhetorical appeals does not always lead to a

                                                                                                                           3.17
sound, balanced argument. In fact, any of the appeals could be misused or overused. When that
happens, arguments can be weakened.

                              Logical Fallacies10

As previously noted, using ethos, pathos, and logos in an argument does not mean that the argument
made is necessarily a good one. In academia, especially, we care a lot about making our arguments
logically sound; we care about logos. We seek to create work that is rooted in rational discourse. We
seek to produce our own rational discourse. We value carefully researched, methodically crafted work.
Thus, to be a strong academic writer, one should seek to avoid logical fallacies, which are flaws in
reasoning.

To refer to something as a fallacy means to say that it is false. Think of the concept of a logical fallacy as
something that makes an argument problematic, open to attack, or weak. In academic discourse, logical
fallacies are seen as failures - as things we want to avoid.

Thinking about fallacies can be confusing because we see them all the time: in advertising, in
conversation, in political discourse. Fallacies are everywhere. But as students of rhetoric, part of our job
is to spend time identifying these fallacies in both our own writing and in others' as a way to avoid them.

Logical Fallacies - A Partial List

     Hasty Generalization - A conclusion or judgement made from insufficient evidence. When one
         piece of evidence or information is used to make a broad conclusion or statement.

     Cherry picking - Picking and choosing only some of the available evidence in order to present
         only points most favorable to your point of view. If someone knowingly chooses certain
         (favorable) pieces of information and conveniently ignores less favorable information, then the
         argument is not supported by all of the available research.

     Straw Man - An oversimplification of an opposing perspective so that it becomes easy to attack.
         This is unfair and illogical because when one oversimplifies or inaccurately represents an
         argument and refutes that oversimplified version, one is not actually addressing the argument.

     Red Herring - Changing topics to avoid the point being discussed. This is an argument tactic in
         which one attempts to change the conversation, often by bringing up information that is not
         relevant to the claim or point being debated, in order to try to control the conversation. This can

    be a way to avoid having to address or answer the question at hand, and it harms the quality of
    an argument.

 Ad Hominem - Making a personal attack rather than engaging with someone's ideas."You are an
    idiot! That's why you're wrong!" This type of logical fallacy occurs when an arguer attacks or
    insults the person making opposing arguments instead of attacking the ideas, the logic, or the
    evidence within the opposing argument itself.

 Ad Populum - Making an argument solely based upon the perceived shared beliefs of a group.
    "This is about freedom and righteousness, and if you believe in those things, then you should
    believe my argument." This is an example of misused ethos - when the author is referencing the
    values that the audience cares about so that they think only about the values and not about the
    content of the argument (or, likely, the fact that there is little intellectual substance in what is
    being said).

 False Dilemma, Either/or - This is an argument that attempts to create a situation of absolutes
    with no options in between. "Either we intervene or we are basically no better than the Nazis."
    This thinking is fallacious because it assumes that there are only two options, with nothing in
    between.

 Slippery Slope - This is a fallacy that assumes that one thing is going to have a series of
    consequences or effects-often leading to a worst case scenario. "If we let this happen, then that
    will happen and then the worst possible thing will happen." It is false reasoning because 1) it's
    impossible to predict the future, 2) it is illogical to suggest that one action will always necessarily
    lead to the worst possible outcome, and 3) it assumes a very specific chain of future events. This
    "if we let this happen there will be some horrible end" is misuse of cause/effect reasoning, often
    with some pathos (fear) sprinkled in.

 Bandwagon - This is a fallacy that assumes one will follow the crowd, sort of by peer pressure.
    Consider the old adage "Everybody's doing it!" The problem with this type of fallacy is that it
    assumes the reader/listener will only follow the crowd and not exercise free thought.

 False Authority - This fallacy attempts to use credentials of one to support another claim even
    when those credentials are not valid for the argument at hand. "Because X says it's true, it must
    be true!" For example, someone with a PhD might know a great deal about genetically modified
    foods based upon readings; however, citing that person as an expert in the field would be a
    fallacy.

 Dogmatism - This fallacy relies on the assumption that the truth is self-evident and needs no
    further explanation. "Global warming is real because polar bears are dying." This line of reason
    is often aggressive and invasive. Someone relying upon this tactic refuses to hear the other side.

 Stacking the Deck - This fallacy is used when only one line of reasoning or evidence is used to
    support a claim/argument. When used, this fallacy ignores oppositional reasoning or
    counterevidence.

                                                                                                                      3.19
     Post Hoc, Ergo Propter Hoc - This is a Latin phrase that means "after this, therefore because of
         this." This means that someone makes a claim that one event caused another, when it is instead
         a correlation. An extreme example of this might be someone claiming that the sunrise causes
         people to brush their teeth, just because many people brush their teeth in the morning.

     Begging the Question - This fallacy occurs when the speaker assumes that the conclusion of
         his/her argument is valid without proving the lines of reasoning. Many times, the support used
         for the claim is simply a repetitious restatement of the conclusion. Oftentimes, this type of
         argument feels circular or redundant.

     Equivocation - This fallacy relies on the ambiguous use of a key term within the argument
         thereby misleading the reader/listener. A famous example of this would be the Abbott and
         Costello "Who's on First" routine. Oftentimes, equivocations rely on half truths that give the
         illusion of an honest overall appearance to the argument.

     Non Sequitur (it does not follow) - This fallacy skips or confuses logical steps thereby making an
         argument appear to be hollow. The result is often a conclusion that does not follow from the
         evidence provided.

When reading or listening to an argument, be cognizant of when the reasoning relies upon one of these
fallacies of logic. If it does, question the source and the information presented carefully.
As you draft ideas for your own arguments, test each of your reasons/claims against these definitions. If
you find that you have used any of these fallacies to build your argument, revise for clarity.

                                                                                                                           3.20
                      Rhetorical Modes of Writing11

Rhetorical modes simply mean the ways we can effectively communicate through language. Each day
people interact with others to tell a story about a new pet, describe a transportation problem, explain a
solution to a science experiment, persuade a customer that a brand is the best, or even reveal what has
caused a particular medical issue. We speak in a manner that is purposeful to each situation, and writing
is no different. While rhetorical modes can refer to both speaking and writing, we discuss the ways in
which we shape our writing according to our purpose or intent. Your purpose for writing determines the
mode you choose.

The four major categories of rhetorical modes are narration, description, exposition, and persuasion.
The narrative essay tells a relevant story or relates an event. The descriptive essay uses vivid, sensory
details to draw a picture in words. The writer's purpose in expository writing is to explain or inform.
Exposition is subdivided into five modes: classification, process, definition, comparison/contrast, and
cause/effect. In the persuasive essay, the writer's purpose is to persuade or convince the reader by
presenting one idea against another and clearly taking a stand on one side of the issue. We often use
several of these modes in everyday and professional writing situations, so we will also consider special
examples of these modes such as personal statements and other common academic writing
assignments.

Whether you are asked to write a cause/effect essay in a history class, a comparison/contrast report in
biology, or a narrative email recounting the events in a situation on the job, you will be equipped to
express yourself precisely and communicate your message clearly. Learning these rhetorical modes will
also help you to become a more effective writer.

Narration

Narration means the art of storytelling, and the purpose of narrative writing is to tell stories. Any time
you tell a story to a friend or family member about an event or incident in your day, you engage in a
form of narration. A narrative can be factual or fictional. A factual story is one that is based on, and tries
to be faithful to, actual events as they unfolded in real life. A fictional story is a made-up, or imagined,
story; when writing a fictional story, we can create characters and events to best fit our story.

The big distinction between factual and fictional narratives is determined by a writer's purpose. The
writers of factual stories try to recount events as they actually happened, but writers of fictional stories
can depart from real people and events because their intentions are not to retell a real-life event.
Biographies and memoirs are examples of factual stories, whereas novels and short stories are examples
of fictional stories.

                                                                                                                           3.21
Because the line between fact and fiction can often blur, it is helpful to understand what your purpose is
from the beginning. Is it important that you recount history, either your own or someone else's? Or does
your interest lie in reshaping the world in your own image--either how you would like to see it or how
you imagine it could be? Your answers will go a long way in shaping the stories you tell.

Ultimately, whether the story is fact or fiction, narrative writing tries to relay a series of events in an
emotionally engaging way. You want your audience to be moved by your story, which could mean
through laughter, sympathy, fear, anger, and so on. The more clearly you tell your story, the more
emotionally engaged your audience is likely to be.

The Structure of a Narrative Essay
Major narrative events are most often conveyed in chronological order, the order in which events unfold
from first to last. Stories typically have a beginning, a middle, and an end, and these events are typically
organized by time. However, sometimes it can be effective to begin with an exciting moment from the
climax of the story ("flash-forward") or a pivotal event from the past ("flash-back") before returning to a
chronological narration. Certain transitional words and phrases aid in keeping the reader oriented in the
sequencing of a story.

The following are the other basic components of a narrative:

     Plot: The events as they unfold in sequence.

     Characters: The people who inhabit the story and move it forward. Typically, there are minor
         characters and main characters. The minor characters generally play supporting roles to the
         main character, or the protagonist.

     Conflict: The primary problem or obstacle that unfolds in the plot that the protagonist must
         solve or overcome by the end of the narrative. The way in which the protagonist resolves the
         conflict of the plot results in the theme of the narrative.

     Theme: The ultimate message the narrative is trying to express; it can be either explicit or
         implicit.

Description

Writers use description in writing to make sure that their audience is fully immersed in the words on the
page. This requires a concerted effort by the writer to describe the world through the use of sensory
details.

As mentioned earlier, sensory details are descriptions that appeal to our sense of sight, sound, smell,
taste, and touch. The use of sensory details provides you the greatest possibility of relating to your
audience and thus engaging them in your writing, making descriptive writing important not only during
your education but also during everyday situations. To make your writing vivid and appealing, avoid
empty descriptors if possible. Empty descriptors are adjectives that can mean different things to
different people. Good, beautiful, terrific, and nice are examples. The use of such words in descriptions

                                                                                                                           3.22
can lead to misreads and confusion. A good day, for instance, can mean far different things depending
on one's age, personality, or tastes.

The Structure of a Description Essay
Description essays typically describe a person, a place, or an object using sensory details. The structure
of a descriptive essay is more flexible than in some of the other rhetorical modes. The introduction of a
description essay should set up the tone and focus of the essay. The thesis should convey the writer's
overall impression of the person, place, or object described in the body paragraphs.

The organization of the essay may best follow spatial order, which means an arrangement of ideas
according to physical characteristics or appearance. Depending on what the writer describes, the
organization could move from top to bottom, left to right, near to far, warm to cold, frightening to
inviting, and so on. For example, if the subject were a client's kitchen in the midst of renovation, you
might start at one side of the room and move slowly across to the other end, describing appliances,
cabinetry, and so on. Or you might choose to start with older remnants of the kitchen and progress to
the new installations. Or maybe start with the floor and move up toward the ceiling.

Classification

The purpose of classification is to break down broad subjects into smaller, more manageable, more
specific parts. We classify things in our daily lives all the time, often without even thinking about it. For
example, cars can be classified by type (convertible, sedan, station-wagon, or SUV) or by the fuel they
use (diesel, petrol, electric, or hybrid). Smaller categories, and the way in which these categories are
created, help us make sense of the world. Keep both of these elements in mind when writing a
classification essay. It's best to choose topics that you know well when writing classification essays. The
more you know about a topic, the more you can break it into smaller, more interesting parts. Adding
interest and insight will enhance your classification essays.

The Structure of a Classification Essay
The classification essay opens with a paragraph that introduces the broader topic. The thesis should
then explain how that topic is divided into subgroups and why. Take the following introductory
paragraph, for example:

         When people think of New York, they often think of only New York City. But New York is actually
         a diverse state with a full range of activities to do, sights to see, and cultures to explore. In order
         to better understand the diversity of New York State, it is helpful to break it into these five
         separate regions: Long Island, New York City, Western New York, Central New York, and
         Northern New York.

The underlined thesis explains not only the category and subcategory, but also the rationale for breaking
the topic into those categories. Through this classification essay, the writer hopes to show the readers a
different way of considering the state of New York.

                                                                                                                           3.23
Each body paragraph of a classification essay is dedicated to fully illustrating each of the subcategories.
In the previous example, then, each region of New York would have its own paragraph. To avoid settling
for an overly simplistic classification, make sure you break down any given topic at least three different
ways. This will help you think outside the box and perhaps even learn something entirely new about a
subject.

The conclusion should bring all of the categories and subcategories back together again to show the
reader the big picture. In the previous example, the conclusion might explain how the various sights and
activities of each region of New York add to its diversity and complexity.

Process

The purpose of a process essay is to explain how to do something (directional) or how something works
(informative). In either case, the formula for a process essay remains the same. The process is
articulated into clear, definitive steps.

Almost everything we do involves following a step-by-step process. From learning to ride a bike as a
child to starting a new job as an adult, we initially needed instructions to effectively execute the task.
Likewise, we have likely had to instruct others, so we know how important good directions are--and
how frustrating it is when they are poorly put together.

The Structure of a Process Essay
The process essay opens with a discussion of the process and a thesis statement that states the goal of
the process. The organization of a process essay typically follows chronological order. The steps of the
process are conveyed in the order in which they usually occur, and so your body paragraphs will be
constructed based on these steps. If a particular step is complicated and needs a lot of explaining, then
it will likely take up a paragraph on its own. But if a series of simple steps is easy to understand, then the
steps can be grouped into a single paragraph. Words such as first, second, third, next, and finally are
cues to orient readers and organize the content of the essay.

Finally, it's a good idea to always have someone else read your process analysis to make sure it makes
sense. Once we get too close to a subject, it is difficult to determine how clearly an idea is coming
across. Having a peer read over your analysis will serve as a good way to troubleshoot any confusing
spots.

Definition

The purpose of a definition essay may seem self-explanatory: to write an extended definition of a word
or term. But defining terms in writing is often more complicated than just consulting a dictionary. In fact,
the way we define terms can have far-reaching consequences for individuals as well as collective groups.
Take, for example, a word like alcoholism. The way in which one defines alcoholism depends on its legal,
moral, and medical contexts. Lawyers may define alcoholism in terms of its legality; parents may define
alcoholism in terms of its morality; and doctors will define alcoholism in terms of symptoms and
diagnostic criteria. Think also of terms that people tend to debate in our broader culture. How we define

                                                                                                                           3.24
words, such as marriage and climate change, has enormous impact on policy decisions and even on daily
decisions. Debating the definition of a word or term might have an impact on your relationship or your
job, or it might simply be a way to understand an unfamiliar phrase in popular culture or a technical
term in a new profession.

Defining terms within a relationship, or any other context, can be difficult at first, but once a definition is
established between two people or a group of people, it is easier to have productive dialogues.
Definitions, then, establish the way in which people communicate ideas. They set parameters for a given
discourse, which is why they are so important.

When writing definition essays, avoid terms that are too simple, that lack complexity. Think in terms of
concepts, such as hero, immigration, or loyalty, rather than physical objects. Definitions of concepts,
rather than objects, are often fluid and contentious, making for a more effective definition essay. For
definition essays, try to think of concepts in which you have a personal stake. You are more likely to
write a more engaging definition essay if you are writing about an idea that has value and importance to
you.

The Structure of a Definition Essay
The definition essay opens with a general discussion of the term to be defined. You then state your
definition of the term as your thesis. The rest of the essay should explain the rationale for your
definition. Remember that a dictionary's definition is limiting, so you should not rely strictly on the
dictionary entry. Indeed, unless you are specifically addressing an element of the dictionary definition
(perhaps to dispute or expand it), it is best to avoid quoting the dictionary in your paper. Instead,
consider the context in which you are using the word. Context identifies the circumstances, conditions,
or setting in which something exists or occurs. Often words take on different meanings depending on
the context in which they are used. For example, the ideal leader in a battlefield setting could likely be
very different from a leader in an elementary school setting. If a context is missing from the essay, the
essay may be too short or the main points could be vague and confusing.

The remainder of the essay should explain different aspects of the term's definition. For example, if you
were defining a good leader in an elementary classroom setting, you might define such a leader
according to personality traits: patience, consistency, and flexibility. Each attribute would be explained
in its own paragraph. Be specific and detailed: flesh out each paragraph with examples and connections
to the larger context.

Comparison and Contrast

Comparison in writing discusses elements that are similar, while contrast in writing discusses elements
that are different. A compare-and-contrast essay, then, analyzes two subjects by examining them closely
and comparing them, contrasting them, or both. The key to a good compare-and-contrast essay is to
choose two or more subjects that connect in a meaningful way. The purpose of conducting the
comparison or contrast is not to state the obvious but rather to illuminate subtle differences or
unexpected similarities. For example, if you wanted to focus on contrasting two subjects you would not
pick apples and oranges; rather, you might choose to compare and contrast two types of oranges or two

                                                                                                                           3.25
types of apples to highlight subtle differences. For example, Red Delicious apples are sweet, while
Granny Smiths are tart and acidic. Drawing distinctions between elements in a similar category will
increase the audience's understanding of that category, which is the purpose of the compare-and-
contrast essay.

Similarly, to focus on comparison, choose two subjects that seem at first to be unrelated. For a
comparison essay, you likely would not choose two apples or two oranges because they share so many
of the same properties already. Rather, you might try to compare how apples and oranges are quite
similar. The more divergent the two subjects initially seem, the more interesting a comparison essay will
be.

The Structure of a Comparison-and-Contrast Essay
The compare-and-contrast essay starts with a thesis that clearly states the two subjects that are to be
compared, contrasted, or both, and the reason for doing so. The thesis could lean more toward
comparing, contrasting, or both. Remember, the point of comparing and contrasting is to provide useful
knowledge to the reader. Take the following thesis as an example that leans more toward contrasting.

Thesis statement: Organic vegetables may cost more than those that are conventionally grown, but
when put to the test, they are definitely worth every extra penny.

Here the thesis sets up the two subjects to be compared and contrasted (organic versus conventional
vegetables), and it makes a claim about the results that might prove useful to the reader. You may
organize compare-and-contrast essays in one of the following two ways:

              1. According to the subjects themselves, discussing one and then the other

              2. According to individual points, discussing each subject in relation to each point

The organizational structure you choose depends on the nature of the topic, your purpose, and your
audience.

Cause and Effect

It is often considered human nature to ask, "why?" and "how?" We want to know how our child got sick
so we can better prevent it from happening in the future, or why our colleague received a pay raise
because we want one as well. We want to know how much money we will save over the long term if we
buy a hybrid car. These examples identify only a few of the relationships we think about in our lives, but
each shows the importance of understanding cause and effect.

A cause is something that produces an event or condition; an effect is what results from an event or
condition. The purpose of the cause-and-effect essay is to determine how various phenomena relate in
terms of origins and results. Sometimes the connection between cause and effect is clear, but often
determining the exact relationship between the two is very difficult. For example, the following effects
of a cold may be easily identifiable: a sore throat, runny nose, and a cough. But determining the cause of
the sickness can be far more difficult. A number of causes are possible, and to complicate matters, these
possible causes could have combined to lead to the sickness. That is, more than one cause may be

                                                                                                                           3.26
responsible for any given effect. Therefore, cause-and effect discussions are often complicated and
frequently lead to debates and arguments.

Indeed, you can use the complex nature of cause and effect to your advantage. Often it is not necessary,
or even possible, to find the exact cause of an event or to name the exact effect. So, when formulating a
thesis, you can claim one of a number of causes or effects to be the primary, or main, cause or effect. As
soon as you claim that one cause or one effect is more crucial than the others, you have developed a
thesis.

The Structure of a Cause-and-Effect Essay
The cause-and-effect essay opens with a general introduction to the topic, which then leads to a thesis
that states the main cause, main effect, or various causes and effects of a condition or event. The cause-
and-effect essay can be organized in one of the following two primary ways:

    1. Start with the cause and then talk about the effects.

    2. Start with the effect and then talk about the causes.

For example, if your essay were on childhood obesity, you could start by talking about the effect of
childhood obesity and then discuss the cause, or you could start the same essay by talking about the
cause of childhood obesity and then move to the effect.

Regardless of which structure you choose, be sure to explain each element of the essay fully and
completely. Explaining complex relationships requires the full use of evidence, such as scientific studies,
expert testimony, statistics, and anecdotes. Be careful of resorting to empty speculation. In writing,
speculation amounts to unsubstantiated guessing. Writers are particularly prone to such trappings in
cause-and-effect arguments due to the complex nature of finding links between phenomena. Be sure to
have clear evidence to support the claims that you make. Because cause-and-effect essays determine
how phenomena are linked, they make frequent use of certain words and phrases that denote such
linkage.

Persuasion

The purpose of persuasion in writing is to convince, motivate, or move readers toward a certain point of
view, or opinion. The act of trying to persuade automatically implies that more than one opinion on the
subject can be argued. The idea of an argument often conjures up images of two people yelling and
screaming in anger. In writing, however, an argument is very different. An argument is a reasoned
opinion supported and explained by evidence. To argue in writing is to advance knowledge and ideas in
a positive way. Written arguments often fail when they employ ranting rather than reasoning.

Most of us feel inclined to try to win the arguments we enter. On some level, we all want to be right,
and we want others to see the error of their ways. More times than not, however, arguments in which
both sides try to win end up producing losers all around. The more productive approach is to persuade
your audience to consider your opinion as a valid one, not simply the right one.

The Structure of a Persuasive Essay

                                                                                                                           3.27
The following five features make up the structure of a persuasive essay:
     Introduction and thesis

     Opposing and qualifying ideas

     Strong evidence in support of claim

     Style and tone of language

     A compelling conclusion

Creating an Introduction and Thesis
The persuasive essay begins with an engaging introduction that presents the general topic. The thesis
typically appears somewhere in the introduction and clearly states the writer's point of view.

Acknowledging Opposing Ideas and Limits to Your Argument
Because an argument implies differing points of view on the subject, you must be sure to acknowledge
those opposing ideas. Avoiding ideas that conflict with your own gives the reader the impression that
you may be uncertain, fearful, or unaware of opposing ideas. Thus it is essential that you not only
address counterarguments but also do so respectfully.

Try to address opposing arguments earlier rather than later in your essay. Rhetorically speaking,
ordering your positive arguments last allows you to better address ideas that conflict with your own
because it allows you to focus on countering those arguments. This way, you leave your reader thinking
about your argument rather than someone else's. You have the last word.

Acknowledging points of view different from your own also has the effect of fostering more credibility
between you and the audience. Readers will know from the outset that you are aware of opposing ideas
and that you are not afraid to give them space. It is also helpful to establish the limits of your argument
and what you are trying to accomplish. In effect, you are conceding early on that your argument is not
the ultimate authority on a given topic. Such humility can go a long way toward earning credibility and
trust with an audience ("ethos"). Audience members will know from the beginning that you are a
reasonable writer, and they will trust your argument as a result. For example, in the following
concessionary statement, the writer advocates for stricter gun control laws, but she admits it will not
solve all of our problems with crime:

         Although tougher gun control laws are a powerful first step in decreasing violence in our streets,
         such legislation alone cannot end these problems since guns are not the only problem we face.

Such a concession will be welcome by those who might disagree with this writer's argument in the first
place. To effectively persuade their readers, writers need to be realistic in their goals and humble in
their approach to get readers to listen to their ideas.

Bias in Writing
Everyone has various biases on any number of topics. For example, you might have a bias toward
listening to music radio stations rather than talk radio or news programs. You might have a bias toward
working at night rather than in the morning, or working by deadlines rather than getting tasks done in

                                                                                                                           3.28
advance. These examples identify minor biases, of course, but they still indicate preferences and
opinions.

Handling bias in writing and in daily life can be a useful skill. It will allow you to articulate your own
points of view while also defending yourself against unreasonable points of view. The ideal in persuasive
writing is to let your reader know your bias, but do not let that bias blind you to the primary
components of good argumentation: sound, thoughtful evidence and a respectful and reasonable
address of opposing sides.

The strength of a personal bias is that it can motivate you to construct a strong argument. If you are
invested in the topic, you are more likely to care about the piece of writing. Similarly, the more you care,
the more time and effort you will put forth and the better the final product will be. The weakness of bias
is when the bias begins to take over the essay--when, for example, you neglect opposing ideas,
exaggerate your points, or repeatedly insert yourself ahead of the subject by using I too often. Being
aware of all three of these pitfalls will help you avoid them.

The Use of "I" in Writing
The use of "I "in writing is a topic of debate, and the acceptance of its usage varies from instructor to
instructor. It is difficult to predict the preferences for all your present and future instructors, but
consider the effects it can potentially have on your writing. Be mindful of the use of I in your writing
because it can make your argument sound overly biased. There are two primary reasons:

    1. Excessive repetition of any word will eventually catch the reader's attention--and usually not in
         a good way. The use of "I" is no different.

    2. The insertion of "I" into a sentence alters not only the way a sentence might sound but also the
         composition of the sentence itself. "I" is often the subject of a sentence. If the subject of the
         essay is supposed to be, say, smoking, then by inserting yourself into the sentence, you are
         effectively displacing the subject of the essay into a secondary position. In the following
         example, the subject of the sentence is underlined:

                   Smoking is bad.
                   I think smoking is bad.

In the first sentence, the rightful subject, smoking, is in the subject position in the sentence. In the
second sentence, the insertion of I and think replaces smoking as the subject, which draws attention to I
and away from the topic that is supposed to be discussed. Remember to keep the message (the subject)
and the messenger (the writer) separate. Indeed, your argument will be stronger if you remove the I
think and simply assert "Smoking is bad."

Facts and Opinions
Facts are statements that can be definitely proven using objective data. The statement that is a fact is
absolutely valid. In other words, the statement can be pronounced as true or false. For example, 2 + 2 =
4. This expression identifies a true statement, or a fact, because it can be proved with objective data.

                                                                                                                           3.29
Opinions are personal views, or judgments. An opinion is what an individual believes about a particular
subject. However, an opinion in argumentation must have legitimate backing; adequate evidence and
credibility should support the opinion. Consider the credibility of expert opinions. Experts in a given field
have the knowledge and credentials to make their opinion meaningful to a larger audience; this
credibility is sometimes called "ethos" and is one way that we make our arguments persuasive. For
example, you seek the opinion of your dentist when it comes to the health of your gums, and you seek
the opinion of your mechanic when it comes to the maintenance of your car. Both have knowledge and
credentials in those respective fields, which is why their opinions matter to you. But the authority of
your dentist may be greatly diminished should they offer an opinion about your car, and vice versa. In
writing, you want to strike a balance between credible facts and authoritative opinions. Relying on one
or the other will likely lose more of your audience than it gains.

Using Visual Elements to Strengthen Arguments
Adding visual elements to a persuasive argument can often strengthen its persuasive effect. There are
two main types of visual elements: quantitative visuals and qualitative visuals.

Quantitative visuals present data graphically. They allow the audience to see statistics spatially. The
purpose of using quantitative visuals is to make logical appeals to the audience. An appeal based on
logic is called "logos," and it persuades the reader using reasoning. Often we can provide information in
data form to persuade the reader through logic. Quantitative visuals help display the information
clearly. For example, sometimes it is easier to understand the disparity in certain statistics if you can see
how the disparity looks graphically. Bar graphs, pie charts, Venn diagrams, histograms, and line graphs
are all ways of presenting quantitative data in spatial dimensions.

Qualitative visuals present images that appeal to the audience's emotions. Persuading your reader
based on an emotional appeal is called "pathos." Photographs and pictorial images are examples of
qualitative visuals that can create an emotional appeal. Such images often try to convey a story, and
seeing an actual example can carry more power than hearing or reading about the example. For
example, one image of a child suffering from malnutrition will likely have more of an emotional impact
than pages dedicated to describing that same condition in writing.

Writing a Persuasive Essay
Choose a topic that you feel passionate about. If your instructor requires you to write about a specific
topic, approach the subject from an angle that interests you. Begin your essay with an engaging
introduction. Your thesis should typically appear somewhere in your introduction. Be sure to have a
clear thesis that states your position and previews the main points your essay will address.

Start by acknowledging and explaining points of view that may conflict with your own to build credibility
and trust with your audience. Also state the limits of your argument. This too helps you sound more
reasonable and honest to those who may naturally be inclined to disagree with your view. By
respectfully acknowledging opposing arguments and conceding limitations to your own view, you set a
measured and responsible tone for the essay.

                                                                                                                           3.30
Make your appeals in support of your thesis by using sound, credible evidence. Use a balance of facts
and opinions from a wide range of sources, such as scientific studies, expert testimony, statistics, and
personal anecdotes. Each piece of evidence should be fully explained and clearly stated.
Make sure that your style and tone are appropriate for your subject and audience. Tailor your language
and word choice to these two factors, while still being true to your own voice. Finally, write a conclusion
that effectively summarizes the main argument and reinforces your thesis.

                                                                                                                           3.31
                        Writing a Visual Analysis12

While visuals such as graphs and charts can enhance an argument when used to present evidence,
visuals themselves can also present an argument. Every time you encounter an ad for a certain product,
stop and consider what exactly the creators of that visual want you to believe. Who is the target
audience? Does the message resonate more with one group of people than another? While most
advertisements or political cartoons seem to be nebulous conveyors of commerce, if you look closely
you will uncover an argument presented to you, the audience.
So how do you write a visual rhetorical analysis essay? First, you'll want to begin by examining the
rhetorical strengths and weaknesses of your chosen visual. If your purpose is to write an argument
about the visual, such as what artworks are considered "fine art," then your focus will be on
demonstrating how the visual meets the criteria you establish in your thesis. To do this, try a method
adapted from one on working with primary sources where you Observe, Reflect and Question.13

Arguments About a Visual

Take for example Vincent Van Gogh's "The Starry Night." If you want to argue that the painting is a
classic example of fine art, you'll first have to define the criteria for your terms "classic" and "fine art."
Next, you'll want to look for elements within the painting to support your claim. As you study the
painting, try the following strategy for analysis: Describe/Observe; Respond/Reflect; Analyze/Question.
Describe/Observe
First, describe what you see in the visual quite literally. Begin by focusing on colors, shading, shapes, and
font if you're analyzing an advertisement. In the case of "The Starry Night," you might begin by
describing the various shades of blue, the black figures that resemble buildings, shades of yellow that
cast light. As you describe them, observe the texture, shape, contour, etc, about each element. For this
initial stage, you are simply describing what you observe. Do not look deeper at this point.
Respond/Reflect
Next, respond to the ways in which the things you described have impacted you as a viewer. What
emotions are evoked from the various shadings and colors used in the ad or painting? If there are words
present, what does the artist's font selection do for the image? This is where you'll want to look for
appeals to ethos and pathos. In the case of "The Starry Night," how does the use of black create depth
and for what reason? Reflect on how the intermittent use of shades of blue impacts the overall
impression of the painting. At this stage, you are questioning the elements used so that you may move
to the final stage of analysis.
Analyze/Question
After you've described and reflected upon the various elements of the visual, question what you have
noted and decide if there is an argument presented by the visual. This assessment should be made
based upon what you've observed and reflected upon in terms of the content of the image alone. Ask
yourself if the arrangement of each item in the visual impacts the message? Could there be something
more the artist wants you to gather from this visual besides the obvious? Question the criteria you
established in your thesis and introduction to see if it holds up throughout your analysis. Now you are
ready to begin writing a visual rhetorical analysis of your selected image.

                                                                                                                           3.33
Section 4: Types of Argumentation

                                   Introduction

Where can you find the best tacos in Texas? Who wrote the best version of the song Wagon Wheel?
Which cause is most deserving of a federal grant? While all of these topics seem like fodder for a happy
hour conversation, each one can be proven with specifically defined criteria and evidence. And while the
word argument conjures up negative memories for some, in rhetoric we use the term to refer to a
persuasive essay. In this section, we introduce you to the concepts surrounding argumentation and
discuss two of the more prominent methodologies used today.

                           Features of an Argument1

Argument is not the loud, assertive, unwavering statement of your opinion in the hopes of conquering
the opposition. Argument is the careful consideration of numerous positions and the careful
development of logically sound, carefully constructed assertions that, when combined, offer a
worthwhile perspective in an ongoing debate. Certainly you want to imagine yourself arguing with
others--and certainly you want to believe your opinion has superior qualities to theirs--but the purpose
of argument in the college setting is not to solve a practical problem or shut down a conversation.
Rather, it's to illuminate, expand, and further inform a debate happening on a worthwhile subject
between reasonable, intelligent people. In other words, calling the opposition stupid is not good
argument, it's an ad hominem attack. For a review of other logical fallacies, refer to section 3 of this
text.

Some of the key tools of argument are the strategies that students are asked to consider when doing a
Rhetorical Analysis. Before beginning an argument of your own, review the basic concepts of rhetorical
appeals below. As you plan and draft your own argument, carefully use the following elements of
rhetoric to your own advantage.

Rhetorical Appeals

Logos
The use of logic, data, statistical evidence, and sufficient support to establish the practicality and
rationality of your claims should be the strongest element of your argument. To have a logically sound
argument, you should include:

     A debatable and supportable claim
     Logical reasoning to support your claim

     Sound evidence and examples to justify the reasoning

     Reasonable projections

     Concessions & rebuttals

     Avoid logical fallacies

Ethos
The ethical and well-balanced use of all of the strategies above will help you to present yourself as
trustworthy and intelligent in your consideration of the topic and in the development of your argument.
Another aspect of your credibility as a writer of argument, particularly in the college setting, is your
attention to the needs of the audience with regard to presentation and style. In college, this means that
you have used the style manual (MLA, APA, Chicago, etc) required for the assignment and appropriate to
the audience. In so doing, make certain to cite the sources you have used according to the style manual
you are using.

Pathos
The use of examples and language that evoke an appropriate emotional response in your reader--that
gets them to care about your topic--can be helpful in argument. For academic essays, pathos may be
useful in introductory sections, concluding sections, or as ways to link various parts of the paper
together. However, if your argument is based solely or primarily upon emotional appeals, it will be
viewed as weak in an academic setting, especially when data or ethical sources can disprove your claims.
Therefore, college writing often puts more emphasis on logos and ethos.

Approaches to Argument

A well structured argument is one that is carefully and optimally planned. It is organized so that the
argument has a continuous building of ideas, one upon the other or in concert with the other, in order
to produce the most persuasive impact or effect on the reader. For clarity, avoid repeating ideas,
reasons, or evidence. Instead, consider how each idea in your argument connects to the others. Should
some ideas come before others? Should you build your reasons from simple to complex or from
complex to simple? Should you present the counterargument before your reasons? Or, would it make
more sense for you to present your reasons and then the concessions and rebuttals? How can you use
clear transitional phrases to facilitate reader comprehension of your argument? Consider these
questions while constructing and revising your argument.

Simple to Complex/Complex to Simple
Whether structuring a paragraph or a research paper, the simple to complex (or reverse) method can be
an effective way to build cohesion throughout your writing. Just as the phrase implies, simple to
complex is when a writer introduces a simple concept then builds upon it to heighten interest.
Sometimes, the opposite structure works to move the reader through your position. For example, if you
choose to write on the topic of pollution as it impacts the world, you might begin with the concept of
straws and sea turtles. Your simple topic of sea turtles swallowing straws thrown away might then move
to the complex issues of consumption, consumerism and disposal. Conversely, if you begin with the

                                                                                                                            4.2
broad, complex topic of consumerism, you could then move to the story of the sea turtles as a way of
building pathos in the reader. Whichever method you choose, make sure that the relationship between
the topics is logical and clear so that readers find validity in your position.

Cause/Effect
The cause/effect method is a way of establishing a reason, or reasons, why something has occurred. For
example, if you live in south Texas, then you understand the problem that mosquitoes cause in the hot,
humid summer months. While there is no way to eliminate all mosquitoes, there are ways to minimize
their growth in your backyard. If you research the ways in which mosquitoes are born, you would
understand the importance of things such as emptying containers of all stagnant water so that they
cannot incubate or keeping your grass mowed to eliminate areas for them to populate. The process by
which you go through to determine the cause of mosquito infestations is the cause and effect method.
In argumentation, you might use this method to support a claim for community efforts to prevent
mosquitoes from growing in your neighborhood. Demonstrating that process is effective for a logos
based argument.

Chronological
Sometimes an argument is presented best when a sequential pattern is used. Oftentimes, that pattern
will be based on the pattern of time in which the sequence occurs. For example, if you are writing an
argumentative essay in which you are calling for a new stop light to be installed at a busy intersection,
you might utilize a chronological structure to demonstrate the rate of increased accidents over a given
period of time at that intersection. If your pattern demonstrates a marked increase in accidents, then
your data would show a logical reason for supporting your position. Oftentimes, a chronological pattern
involves steps indicated by signal words such as first, next, and finally. Utilizing this pattern will walk
readers through your line of reasoning and guide them towards reaching your proposed conclusion.

Emphatic
Another method for organizing your writing is by order of importance. This method is often referred to
as emphatic because organization is done based upon emphasis. The direction you choose to go is yours
whether you begin with the strongest, most important point of your argument, or the weakest. In either
case, the hierarchy of ideas should be clear to readers. The emphatic method is often subjective based
upon the writer's beliefs. If, for example, you want to build an argument for a new rail system to be used
in your city, you will have to decide which reason is most important and which is simply support
material. For one writer, the decrease in the number of cars on the road might be the most important
aspect as it would result in a reduction of toxic emissions. For another writer, the time saved for
commuters might be the most important aspect. The decision to start with your strongest or weakest
point is one of style.

Style/ Eloquence

When we discuss style in academic writing, we generally mean the use of formal language appropriate
for the given academic audience and occasion. Academics generally favor Standard American English
and the use of precise language that avoids idioms, clichés, or dull, simple word choices. This is not to

                                                                                                                            4.3
imply that these tropes are not useful; however, strong academic writing is typically objective and
frequently avoids the use of first-person pronouns unless the disciplinary style and conventions suggest
otherwise.
Some writing assignments allow you to choose your audience. In that case, the style in which you write
may not be the formal, precise Standard American English that the academy prefers. For some writing
assignments, you may even be asked to use, where appropriate, poetic or figurative language or
language that evokes the senses.
In all cases, it is important to understand what style of writing your audience expects, as delivering your
argument in that style could make it more persuasive.

                                                                                                                            4.4
                 Basic Structure and Content of Argument2

When you are tasked with crafting an argumentative essay, it is likely that you will be expected to craft
your argument based upon a given number of sources-all of which should support your topic in some
way. Your instructor might provide these sources for you, ask you to locate these sources, or provide
you with some sources and ask you to find others. Whether or not you are asked to do additional
research, an argumentative essay should be comprised of the following basic components.

Claim: What do you want the reader to believe?

In an argument paper, the thesis is often called a claim. This claim is a statement in which you take a
stand on a debatable issue. A strong, debatable claim has at least one valid counterargument, an
opposite or alternative point of view, that is as sensible as the position that you take in your claim. In
your thesis statement, you should clearly and specifically state the position you will convince your
audience to adopt. You can accomplish this via either a closed or open thesis statement.

A closed thesis statement includes sub-claims or reasons why you choose to support your claim. For
example:

     The city of Houston has displayed a commitment to attracting new residents by making
         improvements to its walkability, city centers, and green spaces.

In this instance, walkability, city centers, and green spaces are the sub-claims, or reasons, why you
would make the claim that Houston is attracting new residents.

An open thesis statement does not include sub-claims and might be more appropriate when your
argument is less easy to prove with two or three easily-defined sub-claims. For example:

     The city of Houston is a vibrant metropolis due to its walkability, city centers, and green spaces.

The choice between an open or a closed thesis statement often depends upon the complexity of your
argument. When in doubt about how to structure your thesis statement, seek the advice of your
instructor or a writing center consultant.

A note on context: What background information about the topic does your audience need?
Before you get into defending your claim, you will need to place your topic (and argument) into context
by including relevant background material. Remember, your audience is relying on you for vital
information such as definitions, historical placement, and controversial positions. This background
material might appear in either your introductory paragraph(s) or your body paragraphs. How and

where to incorporate background material depends a lot upon your topic, assignment, evidence, and
audience.

Evidence or Grounds: What makes your reasoning valid?

To validate the thinking that you put forward in your claim and subclaims, you need to demonstrate that
your reasoning is based on more than just your personal opinion. Evidence, sometimes referred to as
grounds, can take the form of research studies or scholarship, expert opinions, personal examples,
observations made by yourself or others, or specific instances that make your reasoning seem sound
and believable. Evidence only works if it directly supports your reasoning -- and sometimes you must
explain how the evidence supports your reasoning (do not assume that a reader can see the connection
between evidence and reason that you see).

Warrants: Why should a reader accept your claim?

A warrant is the rationale the writer provides to show that the evidence properly supports the claim,
with each element working towards a similar goal. Think of warrants as the glue that holds an argument
together and ensures that all pieces work together coherently.

An important way to ensure you are properly supplying warrants within your argument is to use topic
sentences for each paragraph and linking sentences within that connect the particular claim directly
back to the thesis. Ensuring that there are linking sentences in each paragraph will help to create
consistency within your essay. Remember, the thesis statement is the driving force of organization in
your essay, so each paragraph needs to have a specific purpose (topic sentence) in proving or explaining
your thesis. Linking sentences complete this task within the body of each paragraph and create
cohesion. These linking sentences will often appear after your textual evidence in a paragraph.

Counterargument: But what about other perspectives?

Later in this section, we have included an essay by Steven Krause who offers a thorough explanation of
what counterargument is (and how to respond to it). In summary, a strong arguer should not be afraid
to consider perspectives that either challenge or completely oppose his or her own claim. When you
respectfully and thoroughly discuss perspectives or research that counters your own claim or even
weaknesses in your own argument, you are showing yourself to be an ethical arguer. The following are
some things of which counterarguments may consist:

     summarizing opposing views

     explaining how and where you actually agree with some opposing views

     acknowledging weaknesses or holes in your own argument

You have to be careful and clear that you are not conveying to a reader that you are rejecting your own
claim; it is important to indicate that you are merely open to considering alternative viewpoints. Being
open in this way shows that you are an ethical arguer - you are considering many viewpoints.

                                                                                                                            4.6
Response to Counterargument: I see that, but...

Just as it is important to include counterargument to show that you are fair-minded and balanced, you
must respond to the counterargument so that a reader clearly sees that you are not agreeing with the
counterargument and thus abandoning or somehow undermining your own claim. Failure to include the
response to counterargument can confuse the reader. There are several ways to respond to a
counterargument such as:

     concede to a specific point or idea from the counterargument by explaining why that point or
         idea has validity. However, you must then be sure to return to your own claim, and explain why
         even that concession does not lead you to completely accept or support the counterargument

     reject the counterargument if you find it to be incorrect, fallacious, or otherwise invalid
     explain why the counterargument perspective does not invalidate your own claim
A note about where to put the counterargument:
It is certainly possible to begin the argument section (after the background section) with your
counterargument + response instead of placing it at the end of your essay. Some people prefer to have
their counterargument first where they can address it and then spend the rest of their essay building
their own case and supporting their own claim. However, it is just as valid to have the counterargument
+ response appear at the end of the paper after you have discussed all of your reasons.
What is important to remember is that wherever you place your counterargument, you should:
     Address the counterargument(s) fully:

               Explain what the counter perspectives are.
               Describe them thoroughly.
               Cite authors who have these counter perspectives.
               Quote them and summarize their thinking.
     Then, respond to these counterarguments:
               Make it clear to the reader of your argument why you concede to certain points of the

                   counterargument or why you reject them.
               Make it clear that you do not accept the counterargument, even though you understand

                   it.
               Be sure to use transition phrases that make this clear to your reader.

                                                                                                                            4.7
In the section that follows, the Toulmin method of argumentation is described and further clarifies the
terms discussed in this section.3

               Toulmin: Dissecting the Everyday Argument4

Philosopher Stephen Toulmin studies the arguments we make in our everyday lives. He developed his
method out of frustration with logicians (philosophers of argumentation) that studied argument in a
vacuum or through mathematical formulations:

         All A are B. All B are C.
         Therefore, all A are C. (Eemeren, et al. 131)

Instead, Toulmin views argument as it appears in a conversation, in a letter, or some other context
because real arguments are much more complex than the syllogisms that make up the bulk of Aristotle's
logical program (for a review of syllogisms see section 6 Rhetorical Situation). Toulmin offers the
contemporary writer/reader a way to map an argument. The result is a visualization of the argument
process. This map comes complete with vocabulary for describing the parts of an argument. The
vocabulary allows us to see the contours of the landscape--the winding rivers and gaping caverns. One
way to think about a "good" argument is that it is a discussion that hangs together, a landscape that is
cohesive (we can't have glaciers in our desert valley). Sometimes we miss the faults of an argument
because it sounds good or appears to have clear connections between the statement and the evidence,
when in truth the only thing holding the argument together is a lovely sentence or an artistic flourish.

For Toulmin, argumentation is an attempt to justify a statement or a set of statements. The better the
demand is met, the higher the audience's appreciation. Toulmin's vocabulary for the study of argument
offers labels for the parts of the argument to help us create our map.

         Claim: The basic standpoint presented by a writer/ speaker.

         Data: The evidence which supports the claim.

         Warrant: The justification for connecting particular data to a particular claim. The warrant also
         makes clear the assumptions underlying the argument.

         Backing: Additional information required if the warrant is not clearly supported.

         Rebuttal: Conditions or standpoints that point out flaws in the claim or alternative positions.

         Qualifiers: Terminology that limits a standpoint. Examples include applying the following terms
         to any part of an argument: sometimes, seems, occasionally, none, always, never, etc.
The following paragraphs come from an article reprinted in UTNE magazine by Pamela Paxton and
Jeremy Adam Smith titled: "Not Everyone Is Out to Get You." Charting this excerpt helps us to
understand some of the underlying assumptions found in the article.

                                                      "Trust No One"
         That was the slogan of The X-Files, the TV drama that followed two FBI agents on a quest to
         uncover a vast government conspiracy. A defining cultural phenomenon during its run from
         1993-2002, the show captured a mood of growing distrust in America.
         Since then, our trust in one another has declined even further. In fact, it seems that "Trust no
         one" could easily have been America's motto for the past 40 years--thanks to, among other
         things, Vietnam, Watergate, junk bonds, Monica Lewinsky, Enron, sex scandals in the Catholic
         Church, and the Iraq war.
         The General Social Survey, a periodic assessment of Americans' moods and values, shows an 11-
         point decline from 1976-2008 in the number of Americans who believe other people can
         generally be trusted. Institutions haven't fared any better. Over the same period, trust has
         declined in the press (from 29 to 9 percent), education (38-29 percent), banks (41 percent to 20
         percent), corporations (23-16 percent), and organized religion (33-20 percent). Gallup's 2008
         governance survey showed that trust in the government was as low as it was during the
         Watergate era.
         The news isn't all doom and gloom, however. A growing body of research hints that humans are
         hardwired to trust, which is why institutions, through reform and high performance, can still
         stoke feelings of loyalty, just as disasters and mismanagement can inhibit it. The catch is that
         while humans want, even need, to trust, they won't trust blindly and foolishly.
The figure following this section demonstrates one way to chart the argument that Paxton and Smith
make in "Trust No One." The remainder of the article offers additional claims and data, including the
final claim that there is hope for overcoming our collective trust issues. The chart helps us to see that
some of the warrants, in a longer research project, might require additional support. For example, the
warrant that TV mirrors real life is an argument and not a fact that would require evidence.

                                                                                                                            4.9
                                            Figure: Visualizing an Argument

Charting your own arguments and the arguments of others helps you to visualize the meat of your
discussion. All the flourishes are gone and the bones revealed. Even if you cannot fit an argument neatly
into the boxes, the attempt forces you to ask important questions about your claim, your warrant, and
possible rebuttals. By charting your argument you are forced to write your claim in a succinct manner
and admit, for example, what you are using for evidence. Charted, you can see if your evidence is scanty,
if it relies too much on one kind of evidence over another, and if it needs additional support. This
charting might also reveal a disconnect between your claim and your warrant or cause you to reevaluate
your claim altogether.

The Toulmin method is a useful way of determining the validity of an argument and is oftentimes the
model used in legal proceedings. But the Toulmin method can leave you feeling as if you're stuck in an
either/or situation as it focuses on justifying the arguer's reasons only. For a method that incorporates a
humanistic approach, consider using the Rogerian method.5

                              Rogerian Argument6

As discussed in the previous section, for Toulmin, argumentation is an attempt to justify a statement or
a set of statements and focuses solely upon proving those statements. But what happens when you can
concede that your opponent has a valid point? Because we are complex creatures, humans oftentimes
find themselves strongly opposed to something that later changes for them once they are presented
with different evidence. While many arguments can seemingly be based upon emotions alone, when
presented with logical evidence to refute our position we may experience a crisis of conscience. Is it
possible to hold firmly to one belief yet concede that the opposing side has merit? There is a way if you
utilize the Rogerian method for argumentation.

Carl Rogers (1902-1987) was an American Psychologist and Clinical Therapist who utilized a humanistic
(client-centered) approach to psychology. When applied to argumentation, the Rogerian method makes
use of examining counterarguments as enhancements, or concessions, rather than viewing them as
completely oppositional. According to Lunsford et al., "Rogers argued that people involved in disputes
should not respond to each other until they [can] fully, fairly, and even sympathetically state the other
person's position" (139).7 Rogers' nonconfrontational methods, when applied to argumentation in
rhetoric, suggests that the most personal feelings are also the most common and, therefore, are the
most likely to be understood.

One benefit to utilizing a Rogerian approach in composition studies is that it encourages the
writer/arguer to build a bridge towards oppositional positions. This does not mean that you abandon
your own position, and it does not mean that your position is weak. Rather, a Rogerian approach
provides alternative perspectives for considering a given position as well as methods for responding to
counterarguments that might seem to refute your major premise.

Much like the Toulmin method, the Rogerian method relies upon claims that can be supported with
evidence (data). How the Rogerian method differs is in the concession where, if there is a strong, valid
argument that refutes your claim, you concede that argument might be a valid point in a different
context. Or, perhaps you concede that a portion of your opponent's argument is valid for your position,
yet point out how the circumstances differ, therefore making your position the most logical, strongest
one for your given topic. While the goal remains to persuade your reader/audience to view your

                      Counterargument and Response8

Almost anything you can argue or claim in a persuasive paper can be refuted - and that is a good thing
when you are writing an argument. Opposing points of view exist in every good debate, and it's
important to anticipate possible objections to your arguments and to discuss them in your paper. Below
is a brief overview of what counterarguments are and how you might respond to them in your
arguments.

Types of counterarguments

     Could someone disagree with your claim? If so, why? Explain this opposing perspective in your
         own argument, and then respond to it.

     Could someone draw a different conclusion from any of the facts or examples you present? If so,
         what is that different conclusion? Explain this different conclusion and then respond to it.

     Could a reader question any of your assumptions or claims? If so, which ones would they
         question? Explain and then respond.

     Could a reader offer a different explanation of an issue? If so, what might their explanation be?
         Describe this different explanation, and then respond to it.

     Is there any evidence out there that could weaken your position? If so, what is it? Cite and
         discuss this evidence and then respond to it.

If the answer to any of these questions is yes, that does not necessarily mean that you have a weak
argument. It means ideally, and as long as your argument is logical and valid, that you have a
counterargument. Good arguments can and do have counterarguments; it is important to discuss them.
But you must also discuss and then respond to those counterarguments.

Responding to counterarguments

You do not need to attempt to do all of these things as a way to respond; instead, choose the response
strategy that makes the most sense to you for the counterargument that you find:

     If you agree with some of the counterargument perspectives, you can concede some of their
         points. ("I do agree that ....", "Some of the points made by X are valid.....") You could then
         challenge the importance/usefulness of those points.

               "However, this information does not apply to our topic because..."

     If the counterargument perspective is one that contains different evidence than you have in
         your own argument, you can explain why a reader should not accept the evidence that the
         counterarguer presents

     If the counterargument perspective is one that contains a different interpretation of evidence
         than you have in your own argument, you can explain why a reader should not accept the
         interpretation of the evidence that your opponent (counterarguer) presents

     If the counterargument is an acknowledgement of evidence that threatens to weaken your
         argument, you must explain why and how that evidence does not, in fact, invalidate your claim.

It is important to use transitional phrases in your paper to alert readers when you're about to present a
counterargument. It's usually best to put this phrase at the beginning of a paragraph such as:

     Researchers have challenged these claims with...
     Critics argue that this view...
     Some readers may point to...
     A perspective that challenges the idea that . . .
Transitional phrases will again be useful to highlight your shift from counterargument to response:
     Indeed, some of those points are valid. However, . . .
     While I agree that . . . , it is more important to consider . . .
     These are all compelling points. Still, other information suggests that . .
     While I understand . . . , I cannot accept the evidence because . . .9

  On the Other Hand: The Role of Antithetical Writing in First Year
                             Composition Courses10

By Steven D. Krause

Besides my own experiences as a student many years ago in courses similar to the ones you and your
classmates are in now, I think the most important influence on how I have approached research and
argumentative writing came from academic debate. Debate taught me at least two ways to approach an
argument that were not part of my formal schooling. First, academic policy debate11 taught me that
argumentation is a contest--a sport, not at all different from tennis or basketball or figure skating or
gymnastics, an activity where you have to work with a team, you have to practice, and the goal is to
"win." And winning in academic debate happens: while it is a sport that is judged, it is an activity, like
gymnastics or figure skating, where the rules for judging are surprisingly well codified. I will admit that
seeing a debate or argument as something "to be won" has not always served me well in life, for there
are any number of situations in which the framework for an argument is perhaps better perceived as an
opportunity to listen and to compromise than to score points.

Second, because of the way that academic debate is structured, I learned quickly the importance of
being able to perceive and argue multiple and opposing views on the same issue. Not unlike other sports
where players play both offense and defense--baseball and basketball immediately come to mind--
debaters have to argue both for and against the year's resolution, which was the broad proposition that
framed all of the particular cases debate teams put forward for the entire season. In fact, it was not at
all uncommon for a team to strenuously advocate for a controversial position one round--"the U.S.
should engage in one-on-one talks with North Korea"--only to strenuously argue the opposite
position--"the U.S. should not engage in one-on-one talks with North Korea"--the very next round.
Seeing "multiple positions" was not simply a good idea; it was one of the rules of the game.

I've brought these past experiences into my current teaching in a number of ways, including one of the
exercises I am discussing here, what my students and I call antithesis writing. These exercises will help
you gain a better understanding of how to shape an argument, how to more fully explore a topic, and
how to think more carefully about your different audiences.12

11 Explaining "academic policy debate" is not my goal in this essay. But I will say that academic debate bears almost
no resemblance to "debates" between political candidates or to the stereotypical way debate tends to be depicted
on television shows or in movies. Certainly debate involves a certain intellectual prowess; but I think it's fair to say
that debate is a lot closer to a competitive sport than a classroom exercise. Two excellent introductions to the
world of academic debate are the Wikipedia entry for "Policy Debate"
(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Policy_debate) and the 2007 documentary movie Resolved.

Thesis Is Not Doesn't Have to Be a Bad Thing (Or Why Write Antithesis Essays
in the First Place)

Somewhere along the way, "thesis" became a dirty word in a lot of writing courses, inherently bound up
and attached to all that is wrong with what composition historians and the writing scholars call the
"Current-Traditional" paradigm of writing instruction. Essentially, this approach emphasizes the product
and forms of writing (in most nineteenth century American rhetoric textbooks, these forms were
Exposition, Description, Narration, and Argument), issues of syntax and grammar, correctness, and so
forth. It didn't matter so much what position a writer took; what mattered most was that the writer got
the form correct.

"Thesis" is often caught in/lumped into this current-traditional paradigm, I think mainly because of the
rigid role and placement of a thesis in the classic form of the five-paragraph essay. Most of you and your
classmates already know about this: in the five-paragraph formula, the thesis is the last sentence of the
introduction, is divided into three parts, and it rigidly controls the structure of the following four
paragraphs. Certainly this overly prescriptive and narrow definition of thesis is not useful. Jasper Neel
describes this sort of formula in his book Plato, Derrida, and Writing as "anti-writing," and I think that
Sharon Crowley is correct in arguing that the kind of teaching exemplified by the five-paragraph essay is
more akin to filling out a form than it is to actual "writing."

But when I discuss "thesis" here, I mean something much more broad and organic. I mean an initial
direction that every research writing project must take. A thesis advocates a specific and debatable
position, is not a statement of fact nor a summary of events, and it answers the questions "what's your
point?" and "why should I care?" You should begin with a working thesis that attempts to answer these
questions simply as a way of getting your research process started. True, these initial working theses are
usually broad and unwieldy, but the emphasis here is on working, because as you research and think
more carefully, you will inevitably change your thesis. And this is good--change is the by-product of
learning, and seeing a working thesis differently is both the purpose and the opportunity of the
antithesis exercise.

So, I think the first and probably most important reason to consider antithesis writing is to test and
strengthen the validity of the working thesis. After all, there isn't much "debatable" about a working
thesis like "crime is bad" or "cleaning up the environment is good," which suggests that there probably
isn't a viable answer to the questions "what's your point?" and "why should I care?" Considering
opposing and differing views can help you find the path to make a vague generalization like "crime is
bad" into a more pointed, researchable, and interesting observation.

The second general value for antithesis exercises is to raise more awareness of your audience--the
potential readers who would disagree with your working thesis, along with readers who are more

favorable to your point. Sometimes, readers won't be convinced no matter what evidence or logic a
writer presents; but it seems to me that writers have an obligation to at least try.

Generating Antithetical Points in Five Easy Steps

Step 1: Have a Working Thesis and Make Sure You Have Begun the Research Process.
Developing a good antithetical argument is not something you can do as a "first step" in the research
process. Generally, you need to have already developed a basic point and need some evidence and
research to develop that point. In other words, the process of developing an antithetical position has to
come after you develop an initial position in the first place.

Step 2: Consider the Direct Opposite of Your Working Thesis.
This is an especially easy step if your working thesis is about a controversial topic:

         Working thesis:
         To prevent violence on campus, students, staff, and faculty should not be allowed to carry
         concealed weapons.

         Antithesis:
         To prevent violence on campus, students, staff, and faculty should be allowed to carry
         concealed weapons.

         Working thesis:
         Drug companies should be allowed to advertise prescription drugs on television.

         Antithesis:
         Drug companies should not be allowed to advertise prescription drugs on television.

This sort of simple change of qualifiers also exposes weak theses, because, generally speaking, the
opposite position of a proposition that everyone accepts as true is one that everyone easily accepts as
false. For example, if you begin with a working thesis like "Drunk driving is bad" or "Teen violence is
bad" to their logical opposites, you end up with an opposite that is ridiculous--"Drunk driving is good"
or "Teen violence is good." What that signals is that it is probably time to revisit your original working
thesis.

Usually though, considering the opposite of a working thesis is a little more complicated. For example:

         Working Thesis:
         Many computer hackers commit serious crimes and represent a major expense for internet-
         based businesses.

         Antitheses:
         Computer hackers do not commit serious crimes.

         Computer hacking is not a major expense for internet-based businesses.

                                                                                                                           4.17
Both of the antithetical examples are the opposite of the original working theses, but each focuses on
different aspects of the working thesis.

Step 3: Ask "Why" about Possible Antithetical Arguments.
Creating antitheses by simply changing the working thesis to its opposite typically demands more
explanation. The best place to develop more details with your antithesis is to ask "why." For example:

         Why should drug companies not be allowed to advertise prescription drugs? Because . . .

               The high cost of television advertising needlessly drives up the costs of prescriptions.
               Advertisements too often confuse patients and offer advice that contradicts the advice

                   of doctors.
         Why are the crimes committed by computer hackers not serious? Because . . .

               They are usually pranks or acts of mischief.
               Computer hackers often expose problems for Internet businesses before serious crimes

                   result.
The point here is to dig a little further into your antithetical argument. Asking "why" is a good place to
begin that process.

Step 4: Examine Alternatives to Your Working Thesis.
Often, the best antithetical arguments aren't about "the opposite" so much as they are about
alternatives. For example, the working thesis "To prevent violence on campus, students, staff, and
faculty should not be allowed to carry concealed weapons" presumes that a serious potential cause for
violence on campuses is the presence of guns. However, someone could logically argue that the more
important cause of violence on college campuses is alcohol and drug abuse. Certainly the number of
incidents involving underage drinking and substance abuse outnumber those involving firearms on
college campuses, and it is also probably true that many incidents of violence on college campuses
involve drinking or drugs.

Now, unlike the direct opposite of your working thesis, the alternatives do not necessarily negate your
working thesis. There is no reason why a reader couldn't believe that both concealed weapons and
alcohol and substance abuse contribute to violence on campuses. But in considering alternatives to your
working thesis, the goal is to "weigh" the positions against each other. I'll return to this matter of
"weighing your position" later.

Step 5: Imagine Hostile Audiences.
Whenever you are trying to develop a clearer understanding of the antithesis of your working thesis,
you need to think about the kinds of audiences who would disagree with you. By thinking about the
opposites and alternatives to your working thesis, you are already starting to do this because the
opposites and the alternatives are what a hostile audience might think.

                                                                                                                           4.18
Sometimes, potential readers are hostile to a particular working thesis because of ideals, values, or
affiliations they hold that are at odds with the point being advocated by the working thesis. For
example, people who identify themselves as being "pro-choice" on the issue of abortion would certainly
be hostile to an argument for laws that restrict access to abortion; people who identify themselves as
being "prolife" on the issue of abortion would certainly be hostile to an argument for laws that provide
access to abortion.

At other times, audiences are hostile to the arguments of a working thesis because of more crass and
transparent reasons. For example, the pharmaceutical industry disagrees with the premise of the
working thesis "Drug companies should not be allowed to advertise prescription drugs on TV" because
they stand to lose billions of dollars in lost sales. Advertising companies and television broadcasters
would also be against this working thesis because they too would lose money. You can probably easily
imagine some potential hostile audience members who have similarly selfish reasons to oppose your
point of view.

Of course, some audiences will oppose your working thesis based on a different interpretation of the
evidence and research. This sort of difference of opinion is probably most common with research
projects that are focused on more abstract and less definitive subjects. But there are also different
opinions about evidence for topics that you might think would have potentially more concrete "right"
and "wrong" interpretations. Different researchers and scholars can look at the same evidence about a
subject like gun control and arrive at very different conclusions.

Regardless of the reasons why your audience might be hostile to the argument you are making with
your working thesis, it is helpful to try to imagine your audience as clearly as you can. What sort of
people are they? What other interests or biases might they have? Are there other political or social
factors that you think are influencing their point of view? If you want to persuade at least some
members of this hostile audience that your point of view and your interpretation of the research is
correct, you need to know as much about your hostile audience as you possibly can.

Strategies for Answering Antithetical/Oppositional Arguments

It might not seem logical, but directly acknowledging and addressing positions that are different from
the one you are holding in your research can actually make your position stronger. When you take on
the antithesis in your research project, it shows you have thought carefully about the issue at hand and
you acknowledge that there is no clear and easy "right" answer. There are many different ways you
might incorporate the antithesis into your research to make your own thesis stronger and to address the
concerns of those readers who might oppose your point of view. For now, focus on three basic
strategies: directly refuting your opposition, weighing your position against the opposition, and making
concessions.

Directly Refuting Your Opposition
Perhaps the most obvious approach, one way to address those potential readers who might raise
objections to your arguments, is to simply refute their objections with better evidence and reasoning. Of
course,this is an example of yet another reason why it is so important to have good research that

                                                                                                                           4.19
supports your position: when the body of evidence and research is on your side, it is usually a lot easier
to make a strong point.

Answering antithetical arguments with research that supports your point of view is also an example of
where you as a researcher might need to provide a more detailed evaluation of your evidence. The sort
of questions you should answer about your own research--who wrote it, where was it published, when
was it published, etc.--are important to raise in countering antithetical arguments that you think come
from suspicious sources.

Weighing Your Position Against the Opposition
Readers who oppose the argument you are trying to support with your research might do so because
they value or "weigh" the implications of your working thesis differently than you do. For example,
those opposed to a working thesis like "Drug companies should not be allowed to advertise prescription
drugs on TV" might think this because they think the advantages of advertising drugs on television--
increased sales for pharmaceutical companies, revenue for advertising agencies and television stations,
and so forth--are more significant than the disadvantages of advertising drugs on television.

Besides recognizing and acknowledging the different ways of comparing the advantages and
disadvantages suggested by your working thesis, the best way of answering these antithetical
arguments in your own writing is to clearly explain how you weigh and compare the evidence. This can
be a challenging writing experience because it requires a subtle hand and a broad understanding of
multiple sides of your topic. But if in acknowledging to your readers that you have carefully considered
the reasons against your working thesis and you can demonstrate your position to be more persuasive,
then this process of weighing positions can be very effective.

Making Concessions
In the course of researching and thinking about the antithesis to your working thesis and its potentially
hostile audiences, it may become clear to you that these opposing views have a point. When this is the
case, you may want to consider revising your working thesis or your approach to your research to make
some concessions to these antithetical arguments.

Sometimes, my students working on this exercise "make concessions" to the point of changing sides on
their working thesis--that is, in the process of researching, writing, and thinking about their topic, a
researcher moves from arguing for their working thesis to arguing for their antithesis. This might seem
surprising, but it makes perfect sense when you remember the purpose of research in the first place.
When we study the evidence on a particular issue, we often realize that our initial and uninformed
impression or feelings on an issue were simply wrong. That's why we research: we put more trust in
opinions based on research than in things based on gut instinct or feelings.

But usually, most concessions to antithetical perspectives are less dramatic and can be accomplished in
a variety of ways. You might want to employ some qualifying terms to hedge a bit. For example, the
working thesis "Drug companies should not be allowed to advertise prescription drugs on TV" might be
qualified to "Drug companies should be closely regulated about what they are allowed to advertise in

                                                                                                                           4.20
TV." I think this is still a strong working thesis, but the revised working thesis acknowledges the
objections some might have to the original working thesis.

Of course, you should use these sorts of concessions carefully. An over-qualified working thesis can be
just as bad as a working thesis about something that everyone accepts as true: it can become so
watered-down as to not have any real significance anymore. A working thesis like "Drug company
television advertising is sometimes bad and sometimes good for patients" is over-qualified to the point
of taking no real position at all.

But You Still Can't Convince Everyone . . .

I'd like to close by turning away a bit from where I started this essay, the influence of competitive
debate on my early education about argument. In debate, an argument is part of the game, the catalyst
for the beginning of a competition. The same is often true within college classrooms. Academic
arguments are defined in terms of their hypothetical nature; they aren't actually real but rather merely
an intellectual exercise.

But people in the real world do hold more than hypothetical positions, and you can't always convince
everyone that you're right, no matter what evidence or logic you might have on your side. You probably
already know this. We have all been in conversations with friends or family members where, as certain
as we were that we were right about something and as hard as we tried to prove we were right, our
friends or family were simply unwilling to budge from their positions. When we find ourselves in these
sorts of deadlocks, we often try to smooth over the dispute with phrases like "You're entitled to your
opinion" or "We will have to agree to disagree," and then we change the subject. In polite conversation,
this is a good strategy to avoid a fight. But in academic contexts, these deadlocks can be frustrating and
difficult to negotiate.

A couple of thousand years ago, the Greek philosopher and rhetorician Aristotle said that all of us
respond to arguments based on three basic characteristics or appeals: logos or logic, pathos or
emotional character, and ethos, the writer's or speaker's perceived character. Academic writing tends to
rely most heavily on logos and ethos because academics tend to highly value arguments based on logical
research and arguments that come from writers with strong character-building qualifications--things
like education, experience, previous publications, and the like. But it's important to remember that
pathos is always there, and particularly strong emotions or feelings on a subject can obscure the best
research.

Most academic readers have respect for writers when they successfully argue for positions that they
might not necessarily agree with. Along these lines, most college writing instructors can certainly
respect and give a positive evaluation to a piece of writing they don't completely agree with as long as it
uses sound logic and evidence to support its points. However, all readers--students, instructors, and
everyone else--come to your research project with various preconceptions about the point you are
trying to make. Some of them will already agree with you and won't need much convincing. Some of
them will never completely agree with you, but will be open to your argument to a point. And some of
your readers, because of the nature of the point you are trying to make and their own feelings and

                                                                                                                           4.21
thoughts on the matter, will never agree with you, no matter what research evidence you present or
what arguments you make. So, while you need to consider the antithetical arguments to your thesis in
your research project to convince as many members of your audience as possible that the point you are
trying to make is correct, you should remember that you will likely not convince all of your readers all of
the time.13

  Failures in Evidence: When "Lots of Quotes" Can't Save a Paper14

In a strong essay, the author or writer's own thesis and reasoning drive the argument, and then credible,
valid evidence is used to support that reasoning. Arguments, in particular, are interactions between
writer and audience. The author wants to persuade the audience to accept his or her claim, so he or she
tries to provide sufficient compelling evidence that will sway the audience to his or her perspective.

Research questions might be easy to come up with. Claims or thesis statements can be easy to come up
with. Even reasons or ideas to support the thesis or claim may be fairly easy to come up with. But for
your ideas in a paper to be valid, for them to be accepted by a reader, they must be supported and
developed with solid, credible, sufficient, accurate, relevant and compelling evidence.

Evidence is not simply "a bunch of quotes". Nor is evidence a bunch of facts or statistics from an article,
no matter how credible that article may be. For evidence to truly work in the sense of supporting an
thesis/claim, it has to be accurate, sufficient to prove your point, directly related to the reason, ethically
chosen, current, and credible. That is a lot to think about. It is certainly more than "a quote that looks
good".

Here are some things to think about avoiding when attempting to develop a strong source-based essay.
Just as understanding what logical fallacies are so you can avoid them in your own writing, understand
what weak evidence is can help you to avoid falling into the trap of using it in your own work.

Failures in evidence occur when a reader says, "I do not accept your evidence". Here is why that might
happen:

     The evidence that you have provided is inaccurate: You've misread information or misquoted;
         you are not interpreting the quoted material in an accurate manner

     The evidence that you have provided is insufficient: You are using just a small piece of evidence
         to support your reasoning. You need more. You probably have a "generalization" fallacy.

     The evidence that you have provided is unrelated to the reason: Your evidence does not clearly
         or directly relate to the point that you are trying to make.

     The evidence that you have provided is incomplete or too narrowly chosen: You
         have "cherry picked" certain examples or pieces of information to the exclusion of
         others, so while you do have evidence to support your point, you are also neglecting
         a lot of other information

     The evidence that you have provided is old: The information that you are citing is
         not relevant anymore. It is outdated!

     The evidence that you have provided does not come from an authoritative source:
         The source of your evidence is not credible; the person being cited is not an
         authority on the topic

One of the bigger issues with evidence is not so much with the evidence itself, but with the way that you
integrate it into the paper. A reader needs to understand clearly how and why the evidence you chose
relates to the point that you are making. Evidence must always be explained. Whenever you integrate
evidence into your papers, it is important to answer the question "How does this evidence support the
point that I am making?". Never assume that the reader sees what you see in evidence. Always make it
as clear as possible how the evidence supports the reason.

                                                                                                                           4.24
Section 5: Process and Organization

                                   Introduction

Once you've selected a topic and began planning your essay, you'll want to focus on the organization of
your final product as one that guides your reader through the topic in a coherent, cohesive manner.
You'll want to decide on an organizational method that works best for your purpose. Next, you'll want to
make sure each draft builds upon the previous one so that you end with a strong, focused essay, In this
section, we provide guidance on ways to structure your rough draft as well as how to revise and edit for
the final draft.

                    Methods of Organizing Your Writing1

Now that you've outlined your topic, it's time to focus on how to best organize the information. Keep in
mind that the method of organization for essays and paragraphs is just as important as content. When
you begin to draft an essay or paragraph, your ideas may seem to flow from your mind in a seemingly
random manner. However, your readers, who bring to the table different backgrounds, viewpoints, and
ideas, need you to clearly organize these ideas to help them draw connections between the body and
the thesis. A solid organizational pattern not only helps readers to process and accept your ideas, but
also gives your ideas a path that you can follow as you develop your essay (or paragraph). Knowing how
you will organize your paragraphs allows you to better express and analyze your thoughts. In addition,
planning the structure of your essay before you choose supporting evidence helps you conduct more
effective and targeted research. This section covers three ways to organize both essays and paragraphs:
chronological order, order of importance, and spatial order.

Chronological Order

Chronological arrangement has the following purposes:

     To explain the history of an event or a topic
     To tell a story or relate an experience

     To explain how to do or to make something
     To explain the steps in a process
Chronological order is used mostly in expository writing which is a form of writing that narrates,
describes, informs, or explains a process. When using chronological order, arrange the events in the
order that they actually happened, or will happen if you are giving instructions. This method requires
you to use words such as first, second, then, after that, later, and finally. These transition words guide
you and your reader through the paper as you expand your thesis. For example, if you are writing an

essay about the history of the airline industry, you would begin with its conception and detail the
essential timeline events up until present day. You would follow the chain of events using words such as
first, then, next, and so on.

Keep in mind that chronological order is most appropriate for the following purposes:

     Writing essays containing heavy research
     Writing essays with the aim of listing, explaining, or narrating
     Writing essays that analyze literary works such as poems, plays, or books
When using chronological order, your introduction should indicate the information you will cover and
should also establish the relevance of the information. Your body paragraphs should then provide clear
divisions or steps in chronology. You can divide your paragraphs by time (such as decades, wars, or other
historical events) or by the same structure of the work you are examining (such as a line-by-line
explication of a poem).

Order of Importance

Order of importance is best used for the following purposes:

     Persuading and convincing
     Ranking items by their importance, benefit, or significance
     Illustrating a situation, problem, or solution
Most essays move from the least to the most important point, and the paragraphs are arranged in an
effort to build the essay's strength. Sometimes, however, it is necessary to begin with the most
important supporting point, such as in an essay that contains a thesis that is highly debatable. When
writing a persuasive essay, it is best to begin with the most important point because it immediately
captivates your readers and compels them to continue reading.

For example, if you were supporting your thesis that homework is detrimental to the education of high
school students, you would want to present your most convincing argument first, and then move on to
the less important points for your case. During your career, you may be required to work on a team that
devises a strategy for a specific goal of your company, such as increasing profits. When planning your
strategy you should organize your steps in order of importance. This demonstrates the ability to
prioritize and plan. Using the order of importance technique also shows that you can create a resolution
with logical steps for accomplishing a common goal.

Spatial Order

Spatial order is best used for the following purposes:

     Helping readers visualize something as you want them to see it
     Evoking a scene using the senses (sight, touch, taste, smell, and sound)

                                                                                                                            5.2
     Writing a descriptive essay
Spatial order means that you explain or describe objects as they are arranged around you in your space,
for example in a bedroom. As the writer, you create a picture for your readers, and their perspective is
the viewpoint from which you describe what is around you. The view must move in an orderly, logical
progression, giving the reader clear directional signals to follow from place to place. The key to using
this method is to choose a specific starting point and then to guide the reader to follow your eye as it
moves in an orderly trajectory from your starting point. Pay attention to the following student's
description of her bedroom and how she guides the reader through the viewing process, foot by foot.

         Attached to my back bedroom wall is a small wooden rack dangling with red and
         turquoise necklaces that shimmer as I enter. Just to the right of the rack, billowy
         white curtains frame a large window with a sill that ends just six inches from the
         floor. The peace of such an image is a stark contrast to my desk, sitting to the
         right of the window, layered in textbooks, crumpled papers, coffee cups, and an
         overflowing ashtray. Turning my head to the right, I see a set of two bare windows
         that frame the trees outside the glass like a three-dimensional painting. Below the
         windows is an oak chest from which blankets and scarves are protruding. Against
         the wall opposite the billowy curtains is an antique dresser, on top of which sits a
         jewelry box and a few picture frames. A tall mirror attached to the dresser takes
         up much of the lavender wall.

The paragraph incorporates two objectives: using an implied topic sentence and applying spatial order.
Often in a descriptive essay, the two objectives work together.

The following are possible transition words to include when using spatial order:

     Just to the left or just to the right
     Behind
     Between
     On the left or on the right
     Across from
     A little further down
     To the south, to the east, and so on
     A few yards away
     Turning left or turning right

                                                                                                                            5.3
                              Writing Paragraphs2

Imagine reading one long block of text, with each idea blurring into the next. You are likely to lose
interest in a piece of writing that is disorganized and spans many pages without breaks. Paragraphs
separate ideas into logical, manageable chunks, each paragraph focusing on only one main idea and
presenting coherent sentences to support that one point. Because all the sentences in one paragraph
support the same point, a paragraph may stand on its own. For most types of informative or persuasive
academic writing, writers find it helpful to think of the paragraph analogous to an essay, as each is
controlled by a main idea or point, and that idea is developed by an organized group of more specific
ideas. Thus, the thesis of the essay is analogous to the topic sentence of a paragraph, just as the
supporting sentences in a paragraph are analogous to the supporting paragraphs in an essay.

In essays, each supporting paragraph adds another related main idea to support the writer's thesis, or
controlling idea. Each related supporting idea is developed with facts, examples, and other details that
explain it. By exploring and refining one idea at a time, writers build a strong case for their thesis.
Effective paragraphing makes the difference between a satisfying essay that readers can easily process
and one that requires readers to mentally organize the piece themselves. Thoughtful organization and
development of each body paragraph leads to an effectively focused, developed, and coherent essay.

An effective paragraph contains three main parts:

     a topic sentence

     body, supporting sentences

     a concluding sentence

In informative and persuasive writing, the topic sentence is usually the first or second sentence of a
paragraph and expresses its main idea, followed by supporting sentences that help explain, prove, or
enhance the topic sentence. In narrative and descriptive paragraphs, however, topic sentences may be
implied rather than explicitly stated, with all supporting sentences working to create the main idea. If
the paragraph contains a concluding sentence, it is the last sentence in the paragraph and reminds the
reader of the main point by restating it in different words.

Creating Focused Paragraphs with Topic Sentences

The foundation of a paragraph is the topic sentence which expresses the main idea or point of the
paragraph. The topic sentence functions two ways: it clearly refers to and supports the essay's thesis,
and it indicates what will follow in the rest of the paragraph. As the unifying sentence for the paragraph,
it is the most general sentence, whereas all supporting sentences provide different types of more
specific information such as facts, details, or examples.

                                                                                                                            5.4
An effective topic sentence has the following characteristics:

     A topic sentence provides an accurate indication of what will follow in the rest of the paragraph.

               Weak example: First, we need a better way to educate students.

                         Explanation: The claim is vague because it does not provide enough information
                             about what will follow and it is too broad to be covered effectively in one
                             paragraph.

               Stronger example: Creating a national set of standards for math and English education
                   will improve student learning in many states.

                         Explanation: The sentence replaces the vague phrase "a better way" and leads
                             readers to expect supporting facts and examples as to why standardizing
                             education in these subjects might improve student learning in many states.

     A good topic sentence is the most general sentence in the paragraph and thus does not include
         supporting details.

               Weak example: Salaries should be capped in baseball for many reasons, most
                   importantly so we don't allow the same team to win year after year.

                         Explanation: This topic sentence includes a supporting detail that should be
                             included later in the paragraph to back up the main point.

               Stronger example: Introducing a salary cap would improve the game of baseball for
                   many reasons.

                         Explanation: This topic sentence omits the additional supporting detail so that it
                             can be expanded upon later in the paragraph, yet the sentence still makes a
                             claim about salary caps - improvement of the game.

     A good topic sentence is clear and easy to follow.

               Weak example: In general, writing an essay, thesis, or other academic or nonacademic
                   document is considerably easier and of much higher quality if you first construct an
                   outline, of which there are many different types.

                         Explanation: The confusing sentence structure and unnecessary vocabulary bury
                             the main idea, making it difficult for the reader to follow the topic sentence.

               Stronger example: Most forms of writing can be improved by first creating an outline.

                         Explanation: This topic sentence cuts out unnecessary verbiage and simplifies
                             the previous statement, making it easier for the reader to follow. The writer can

                                                                                                                            5.5
                             include examples of what kinds of writing can benefit from outlining in the
                             supporting sentences.

Location of Topic Sentences

As previously discussed, a topic sentence can appear anywhere within a paragraph depending upon the
mode of writing, or it can be implied such as in narrative or descriptive writing. In college-level
expository or persuasive writing, placing an explicit topic sentence at the beginning of each paragraph
(the first or second sentence) makes it easier for readers to follow the essay and for writers to stay on
topic, but writers should be aware of variations and maintain the flexibility to adapt to different writing
projects. The following examples illustrate varying locations for the topic sentence. In each example, the
topic sentence is underlined.

Topic Sentence Begins the Paragraph (General to Specific)
         After reading the new TV guide this week I wondered why we are still being
         bombarded with reality shows, a plague that continues to darken our airwaves.
         Along with the return of viewer favorites, we are to be cursed with yet another
         mindless creation. Prisoner follows the daily lives of eight suburban housewives who
         have chosen to be put in jail for the purposes of this fake psychological experiment.
         A preview for the first episode shows the usual tears and tantrums associated with
         reality television. I dread to think what producers will come up with next season
         and hope that other viewers will express their criticism. These producers must stop
         the constant stream of meaningless shows without plotlines. We've had enough
         reality television to last us a lifetime!

The first sentence tells readers that the paragraph will be about reality television shows, and it
expresses the writer's distaste for these shows through the use of the word bombarded. Each of the
following sentences in the paragraph supports the topic sentence by providing further information
about a specific reality television show and why the writer finds it unappealing. The final sentence is the
concluding sentence. It reiterates the main point that viewers are bored with reality television shows by
using different words from the topic sentence.

Paragraphs that begin with the topic sentence move from the general to the specific. They open with a
general statement about a subject (reality shows) and then discuss specific examples (the reality show
Prisoner). Most academic essays contain the topic sentence at the beginning of the first paragraph.
However, when utilizing a specific to general method, the topic sentence may be located later in the
paragraph.

Topic Sentence Ends the Paragraph (Specific to General)
         Last year, a cat traveled 130 miles to reach its family, who had moved to another
         state and had left their pet behind. Even though it had never been to their new
         home, the cat was able to track down its former owners. A dog in my neighborhood

                                                                                                                            5.6
         can predict when its master is about to have a seizure. It makes sure that he does
         not hurt himself during an epileptic fit. Compared to many animals, our own senses
         are almost dull.

The last sentence of this paragraph is the topic sentence. It draws on specific examples (a cat that
tracked down its owners and a dog that can predict seizures) and then makes a general statement that
draws a conclusion from these examples (animals' senses are better than humans'). In this case, the
supporting sentences are placed before the topic sentence, and the concluding sentence is the same as
the topic sentence. This technique is frequently used in persuasive writing. The writer produces detailed
examples as evidence to back up his or her point, preparing the reader to accept the concluding topic
sentence as the truth.

When the Topic Sentence Appears in the Middle of the Paragraph
         For many years, I suffered from severe anxiety every time I took an exam. Hours
         before the exam, my heart would begin pounding, my legs would shake, and
         sometimes I would become physically unable to move. Last year, I was referred to a
         specialist and finally found a way to control my anxiety--breathing exercises. It
         seems so simple, but by doing just a few breathing exercises a couple of hours
         before an exam, I gradually got my anxiety under control. The exercises help slow
         my heart rate and make me feel less anxious. Better yet, they require no pills, no
         equipment, and very little time. It's amazing how just breathing correctly has
         helped me learn to manage my anxiety symptoms.

In this paragraph, the underlined sentence is the topic sentence. It expresses the main idea--that
breathing exercises can help control anxiety. The preceding sentences enable the writer to build up to
his main point (breathing exercises can help control anxiety) by using a personal anecdote (how he used
to suffer from anxiety). The supporting sentences then expand on how breathing exercises help the
writer by providing additional information. The last sentence is the concluding sentence and restates
how breathing can help manage anxiety. Placing a topic sentence in the middle of a paragraph is often
used in creative writing. If you notice that you have used a topic sentence in the middle of a paragraph
in an academic essay, read through the paragraph carefully to make sure that it contains only one major
topic.

Implied Topic Sentences
Some well-organized paragraphs do not contain a topic sentence at all, a technique often used in
descriptive and narrative writing. Instead of being directly stated, the main idea is implied in the content
of the paragraph, as in the following narrative paragraph:

         Heaving herself up the stairs, Luella had to pause for breath several times. She let
         out a wheeze as she sat down heavily in the wooden rocking chair. Tao approached
         her cautiously, as if she might crumble at the slightest touch. He studied her face,

                                                                                                                            5.7
         like parchment, stretched across the bones so finely he could almost see right
         through the skin to the decaying muscle underneath. Luella smiled a toothless grin.

Although no single sentence in this paragraph states the main idea, the entire paragraph focuses on one
concept--that Luella is extremely old. The topic sentence is thus implied rather than stated so that all
the details in the paragraph can work together to convey the dominant impression of Luella's age. In a
paragraph such as this one, an explicit topic sentence would seem awkward and heavy-handed. Implied
topic sentences work well if the writer has a firm idea of what he or she intends to say in the paragraph
and sticks to it. However, a paragraph loses its effectiveness if an implied topic sentence is too subtle or
the writer loses focus.

Developing Paragraphs

If you think of a paragraph as a sandwich, the supporting sentences are the filling between the bread.
They make up the body of the paragraph by explaining, proving, or enhancing the controlling idea in the
topic sentence. The overall method of development for paragraphs depends upon the essay as a whole
and the purpose of each paragraph; thus paragraphs may be developed by using examples, description,
narration, comparison and contrast, definition, cause and effect, classification and division. A writer may
use one method or combine several methods.

Writers often want to know how many words a paragraph should contain, and the answer is that a
paragraph should develop the idea, point, or impression completely enough to satisfy the writer and
readers. Depending on their function, paragraphs can vary in length from one or two sentences, to over
a page; however, in most college assignments, successfully developed paragraphs usually contain
approximately one hundred to two hundred and fifty words and span one-fourth to two-thirds of a
typed page. A series of short paragraphs in an academic essay can seem choppy and unfocused, whereas
paragraphs that are one page or longer can tire readers. Giving readers a paragraph break on each page
helps them maintain focus.

This advice does not mean, of course, that composing a paragraph of a particular number of words or
sentences guarantees an effective paragraph. Writers must provide enough supporting sentences within
paragraphs to develop the topic sentence and simultaneously carry forward the essay's main idea.

For example: In a descriptive paragraph about a room in the writer's childhood home, a length of two or
three sentences is unlikely to contain enough details to create a picture of the room in the reader's
mind, and it will not contribute in conveying the meaning of the place. In contrast, a half page
paragraph, full of carefully selected vivid, specific details and comparisons, provides a fuller impression
and engages the reader's interest and imagination. In descriptive or narrative paragraphs, supporting
sentences present details and actions in vivid, specific language in objective or subjective ways,
appealing to the readers' senses to make them see and experience the subject. In addition, some
sentences writers use make comparisons that bring together or substitute the familiar with the
unfamiliar, thus enhancing and adding depth to the description of the incident, place, person, or idea.

                                                                                                                            5.8
In a persuasive essay about raising the wage for certified nursing assistants, a paragraph might focus on
the expectations and duties of the job, comparing them to that of a registered nurse. Needless to say, a
few sentences that simply list the certified nurse's duties will not give readers a complete enough idea
of what these healthcare professionals do. If readers do not have plenty of information about the duties
and the writer's experience in performing them for what she considers inadequate pay, the paragraph
fails to do its part in convincing readers that the pay is inadequate and should be increased.

In informative or persuasive writing, a supporting sentence usually offers one of the following:

     Reason: The refusal of the baby boom generation to retire is contributing to the current lack of
         available jobs.

     Fact: Many families now rely on older relatives to support them financially.

     Statistic: Nearly 10 percent of adults are currently unemployed in the United States.

     Quotation: "We will not allow this situation to continue," stated Senator Johns.

     Example: Last year, Bill was asked to retire at the age of fifty-five.

The type of supporting sentence you choose will depend on what you are writing and why you are
writing. For example, if you are attempting to persuade your audience to take a particular position, you
should rely on facts, statistics, and concrete examples, rather than personal opinions. Personal
testimony in the form of an extended example can be used in conjunction with the other types of
support.

Consider the elements in the following paragraph:

Topic sentence: There are numerous advantages to owning a hybrid car.

Sentence 1 (statistic): First, they get 20 percent to 35 percent more miles to the gallon than
a fuel- efficient gas-powered vehicle.

Sentence 2 (fact): Second, they produce very few emissions during low speed city driving.

Sentence 3 (reason): Because they do not require gas, hybrid cars reduce dependency on
fossil fuels, which helps lower prices at the pump.

Sentence 4 (example): Alex bought a hybrid car two years ago and has been extremely
impressed with its performance.

Sentence 5 (quotation): "It's the cheapest car I've ever had," she said. "The running costs are
far lower than previous gas powered vehicles I've owned."

                                                                                                                            5.9
Concluding sentence: Given the low running costs and environmental benefits of owning a
hybrid car, it is likely that many more people will follow Alex's example in the near future.

Sometimes the writing situation does not allow for research to add specific facts or other supporting
information, but paragraphs can be developed easily with examples from the writer's own experience.

Farheya, a student in a freshman English Composition class, quickly drafted an essay during a timed
writing assignment in class. To practice improving paragraph development, she selected the body
paragraph below to add support:

Topic: Would you be better off if you didn't own a television? Discuss.

Original paragraph: Lack of ownership of a television set is also a way to preserve innocence,
and keep the exposure towards anything inappropriate at bay. From simply watching a
movie, I have seen things I shouldn't have, no matter how fast I switch the channel.
Television shows not only display physical indecency, but also verbal. Many times movies do
voice-overs of profane words, but they also leave a few words uncensored. Seeing how all
ages can flip through and see or hear such things make t.v. toxic for the mind, and without
it I wouldn't have to worry about what I may accidentally see or hear.

The original paragraph identifies two categories of indecent material, and there is mention of profanity
to provide a clue as to what the student thinks is indecent. However, the paragraph could use some
examples to make the idea of inappropriate material clearer. Farheya considered some of the television
shows she had seen and made a few changes.

Revised paragraph: Not owning a television set would also be a way to preserve innocence and
keep my exposure to anything inappropriate at bay. While searching for a program to view,
I have seen things I shouldn't have, no matter how fast I switched the channel. The
synopsis of Euro Trip, which describes high school friends traveling across Europe, leads
viewers to think that the film is an innocent adventure; however; it is filled with indecency,
especially when the students reach Amsterdam. The movie Fast and Furious has the same
problem since the women are all half-naked in half tops and mini-skirts or short- shorts.
Television shows not only display physical indecency, but also verbal. Many television shows
have no filters, and the characters say profane words freely. On Empire, one of the most
viewed dramas today, the main characters Cookie and Lucious Lyon use profane words
during their fights throughout entire episodes. Because The Big Bang Theory is a show
about a group of science geeks and their cute neighbor, viewers might think that these
science geniuses' conversations would be about their current research or other science
topics. Instead, their characters regularly engage in conversations about their personal
lives that should be kept private. The ease of flipping through channels and seeing or

                                                                                                                           5.10
hearing such things makes t.v. toxic for the mind, and without a television I wouldn't have
to worry about what I may accidentally see or hear.

Farheya's addition of a few examples helps to convey why she thinks she would be better off without a
television.

Concluding Sentences
An effective concluding sentence draws together all the ideas raised in your paragraph. It reminds
readers of the main point--the topic sentence--without restating it in exactly the same words. Using
the hamburger example, the top bun (the topic sentence) and the bottom bun (the concluding
sentence) are very similar. They frame the "meat" or body of the paragraph.

Compare the topic sentence and concluding sentence from the first example on hybrid cars:

Topic Sentence: There are many advantages to owning a hybrid car.

Concluding Sentence: Given the low running costs and environmental benefits of owning a hybrid car, it
is likely that many more people will follow Alex's example in the near future.

Notice the use of the synonyms advantages and benefits. The concluding sentence reiterates the idea
that owning a hybrid is advantageous without using the exact same words. It also summarizes two
examples of the advantages covered in the supporting sentences: low running costs and environmental
benefits.

Writers should avoid introducing any new ideas into a concluding sentence because a conclusion is
intended to provide the reader with a sense of completion. Introducing a subject that is not covered in
the paragraph will confuse readers and weaken the writing.

A concluding sentence may do any of the following:

     Restate the main idea.

         Example: Childhood obesity is a growing problem in the United States.

     Summarize the key points in the paragraph.

         Example: A lack of healthy choices, poor parenting, and an addiction to video games are among
         the many factors contributing to childhood obesity.

     Draw a conclusion based on the information in the paragraph.

         Example: These statistics indicate that unless we take action, childhood obesity rates will
         continue to rise.

     Make a prediction, suggestion, or recommendation about the information in the paragraph.

                                                                                                                           5.11
         Example: Based on this research, more than 60 percent of children in the United States will be
         morbidly obese by the year 2030 unless we take evasive action.

     Offer an additional observation about the controlling idea.

         Example: Childhood obesity is an entirely preventable tragedy.

Paragraph Length
Although paragraph length is discussed in the section on developing paragraphs with supporting
sentences, some additional reminders about when to start a new paragraph may prove helpful to
writers:

     If a paragraph is over a page long, consider providing a paragraph break for readers. Look for a
         logical place to divide the paragraph; then revise the opening sentence of the second paragraph
         to maintain coherence.

     A series of short paragraphs can be confusing and choppy. Examine the content of the
         paragraphs and combine ones with related ideas or develop each one further.

     When dialogue is used, begin a new paragraph each time the speaker changes.

     Begin a new paragraph to indicate a shift in subject, tone, or time and place.

Improving Paragraph Coherence

A strong paragraph holds together well, flowing seamlessly from the topic sentence into the supporting
sentences and on to the concluding sentence. To help organize a paragraph and ensure that ideas
logically connect to one another, writers use a combination of elements:

     A clear organizational pattern: chronological (for narrative writing and describing processes),
         spatial (for descriptions of people or places), order of importance, general to specific
         (deductive), specific to general (inductive)

     Transitional words and phrases: These connecting words describe a relationship between ideas.

     Repetition of ideas: This element helps keep the parts of the paragraph together by maintaining
         focus on the main idea, so this element reinforces both paragraph coherence and unity.

In the following example, notice the use of transitions (bolded) and key words (underlined):

         Owning a hybrid car benefits both the owner and the environment. First, these cars
         get 20 percent to 35 percent more miles to the gallon than a fuel-efficient gas-
         powered vehicle. Second, they produce very few emissions during low speed city
         driving. Because they do not require gas, hybrid cars reduce dependency on fossil
         fuels, which helps lower prices at the pump. Alex bought a hybrid car two years ago
         and has been extremely impressed with its performance. "It's the cheapest car I've

                                                                                                                           5.12
         ever had," she said. "The running costs are far lower than previous gas-powered
         vehicles I've owned." Given the low running costs and environmental benefits of
         owning a hybrid car, it is likely that many more people will follow Alex's example in
         the near future.

Words such as first and second are transition words that show sequence or clarify order. They help
organize the writer's ideas by showing that he or she has another point to make in support of the topic
sentence. The transition word because is a transition word of consequence that continues a line of
thought. It indicates that the writer will provide an explanation of a result. In this sentence, the writer
explains why hybrid cars will reduce dependency on fossil fuels (because they do not require gas).

In addition to transition words, the writer repeats the word hybrid (and other references such as these
cars, and they), and ideas related to benefits to keep the paragraph focused on the topic and hold it
together.

To include a summarizing transition for the concluding sentence, the writer could rewrite the final
sentence as follows:

         In conclusion, given the low running costs and environmental benefits of owning a
         hybrid car, it is likely that many more people will follow Alex's example in the near
         future.

Although the phrase "in conclusion" certainly reinforces the idea of summary and closure, it is not
necessary in this case and seems redundant, as the sentence without the phrase already repeats and
summarizes the benefits presented in the topic sentence and flows smoothly from the preceding
quotation. The second half of the sentence, in making a prediction about the future, signals a
conclusion, also making the phrase "in conclusion" unnecessary. The original version of the concluding
sentence also illustrates how varying sentences openings can improve paragraph coherence. As writers
continue to practice and develop their style, they more easily make these decisions between using
standard transitional phrases and combining the repetition of key ideas with varied sentence openings.

The following table provides some useful transition words and phrases to connect sentences within
paragraphs as well as to connect:

                                      Drafting3

Drafting is the stage of the writing process in which you develop a complete first version of a piece of
writing. Even professional writers admit that an empty page scares them because they feel they need to
come up with something fresh and original every time they open a blank document on their computers.
Because you have completed the first two steps in the writing process, you have already recovered from
empty page syndrome. You have prewriting and planning already done, so you know what will go on
that blank page: what you wrote in your outline.

Goals and Strategies for Drafting

Your objective at this stage of the writing process is to draft an essay with at least three body
paragraphs, which means that the essay will contain a minimum of five paragraphs, including an
introduction and a conclusion. While the five paragraph format works well for beginning writers, you'll
want to move beyond this mold and think of your work in a more organic manner as you move further
along through the process.

Keep in mind that a draft is a complete version of a piece of writing, but it is not the final version. The
step in the writing process after drafting, as you may remember, is revising. During revising, you will
have the opportunity to make changes to your first draft before you put the finishing touches on it
during the editing and proofreading stage. A first draft gives you a working version that you can later
improve.

If you are more comfortable starting on paper than on the computer, you can start on paper and then
type it before you revise. You can also use a voice recorder to get yourself started, dictating a paragraph
or two to get you thinking.

Making the Writing Process Work for You

The following approaches, done alone or in combination with others, may improve your writing and help
you move forward in the writing process:

     Begin writing with the part you know the most about: You can start with the third paragraph in
         your outline if ideas come easily to mind. You can start with the second paragraph or the first
         paragraph, too. Although paragraphs may vary in length, keep in mind that short paragraphs
         may contain insufficient support. Readers may also think the writing is abrupt. Long paragraphs
         may be wordy and may lose your reader's interest. As a guideline, try to write paragraphs longer
         than one sentence but shorter than the length of an entire double-spaced page.

     Write one paragraph at a time and then stop: As long as you complete the assignment on time,
         you may choose how many paragraphs you complete in one sitting. Pace yourself. On the other
         hand, try not to procrastinate. Writers should always meet their deadlines.

     Take short breaks to refresh your mind: This tip might be most useful if you are writing a multi-
         page report or essay. Still, if you are antsy or cannot concentrate, take a break to let your mind
         rest. But do not let breaks extend too long. If you spend too much time away from your essay,
         you may have trouble starting again. You may forget key points or lose momentum. Try setting
         an alarm to limit your break, and when the time is up, return to your desk to write.

     Be reasonable with your goals: If you decide to take ten-minute breaks, try to stick to that goal.
         If you told yourself that you need more facts, then commit to finding them. Holding yourself to
         your own goals will create successful writing assignments.

     Keep your audience and purpose in mind as you write: These aspects of writing are just as
         important when you are writing a single paragraph for your essay as when you are considering
         the direction of the entire essay.

Of all of these considerations, keeping your purpose and your audience at the front of your mind is the
most important key to writing success. If your purpose is to persuade, for example, you will present your
facts and details in the most logical and convincing way you can. Your purpose will guide your mind as
you compose your sentences. Your audience will guide word choice. Are you writing for experts, for a
general audience, for other college students, or for people who know very little about your topic? Keep
asking yourself what your readers, with their background and experience, need to be told in order to
understand your ideas. How can you best express your ideas so they are totally clear and your
communication is effective?

You may want to identify your purpose and audience on an index card that you clip to your paper (or
keep next to your computer). On that card, you may want to write notes to yourself--perhaps about
what that audience might not know or what it needs to know--so that you will be sure to address those
issues when you write. It may be a good idea to also state exactly what you want to explain to that
audience, or to inform them of, or to persuade them about.

The Basic Elements of a First Draft

If you have been using the information in the previous sections step by step to help you develop an
assignment, you already have both a formal topic outline and a formal sentence outline to direct your
writing. Knowing what a first draft looks like will help you make the creative leap from the outline to the
first draft.

A first draft should include the following elements:

     An introduction that piques the audience's interest, tells what the essay is about, and motivates
         readers to keep reading.

                                                                                                                           5.18
     A thesis statement that presents the main point, or controlling idea, of the entire piece of
         writing.

     A topic sentence in each paragraph that states the main idea of the paragraph and implies how
         that main idea connects to the thesis statement.

     Supporting sentences in each paragraph that develop or explain the topic sentence. These can
         be specific facts, examples, anecdotes, or other details that elaborate on the topic sentence.

     A conclusion that reinforces the thesis statement and leaves the audience with a feeling of
         completion.

The Bowtie Method
There are many ways to think about the writing process as a whole. One way to imagine your essay is to
see it like a bowtie. In the figure below, you will find a visual representation of this metaphor. The left
side of the bow is the introduction, which begins with a hook and ends with the thesis statement. In the
center, you will find the body paragraphs, which grow with strength as the paper progresses, and each
paragraph contains a supported topic sentence. On the right side, you will find the conclusion. Your
conclusion should reword your thesis and then wrap up the paper with a summation, clinch, or
challenge. In the end, your paper should present itself as a neat package, like a bowtie.

                                                Figure: "Bowtie Method"

                                                                                                                           5.19
If you think of this method on its side, you might envision an hour-glass figure. In either visual, the
concepts remain the same: start broad, narrow the focus, then extend back out to repeat the main idea.

Sample First Draft
Let's follow Mariah as she begins to write her essay about digital technology and the confusing choices
that consumers face. The following is Mariah's thesis statement:

         E-book readers are changing the way people read.

Here are the notes that Mariah wrote to herself to characterize her purpose and audience:

         Everyone wants the newest and the best digital technology, but the choices are
         many, and the specifications are often confusing.

         Purpose: My purpose is to inform readers about the wide variety of consumer
         digital technology available in stores and to explain why the specifications for these
         products, expressed in numbers that average consumer don't understand, often
         cause bad or misinformed buying decisions.

         Audience: My audience is my instructor and members of this class. Most of them
         are not heavy into technology except for the usual laptops, cell phones, and MP3
         players, which are not topics I'm writing about. I'll have to be as exact and precise
         as I can be when I explain possibly unfamiliar product specifications. At the same
         time, they're more with it electronically than my grandparents' VCR-flummoxed
         generation, so I won't have to explain every last detail.

Mariah chose to begin by writing a quick introduction based on her thesis statement. She knew that she
would want to improve her introduction significantly when she revised. Right now, she just wanted to
give herself a starting point. Remember that she could have started directly with any of the body
paragraphs.

With her thesis statement and her purpose and audience notes in front of her, Mariah then looked at
her sentence outline. She chose to use that outline because it includes the topic sentences. The
following is the portion of her outline for the first body paragraph. The Roman numeral I identifies the
topic sentence for the paragraph, capital letters indicate supporting details, and Arabic numerals label
sub-points.

       I. Ebook readers are changing the way people read.

              A. Ebook readers make books easy to access and to carry.

                        1. Books can be downloaded electronically.

                        2. Devices can store hundreds of books in memory.

                                                                                                                           5.20
              B. The market expands as a variety of companies enter it.

                        1. Booksellers sell their own ebook readers.

                        2. Electronics and computer companies also sell ebook readers.

              C. Current ebook readers have significant limitations.

                        1. The devices are owned by different brands and may not be
                             compatible.

                        2. Few programs have been made to duplicate the way Americans borrow
                             and read printed books.

Mariah then began to expand the ideas in her outline into a paragraph. Notice how the outline helped
her guarantee that all her sentences in the body of the paragraph develop the topic sentence.

         Ebook readers are changing the way people read, or so ebook developers hope. The
         main selling point for these handheld devices, which are sort of the size of a
         paperback book, is that they make books easy to access and carry. Electronic
         versions of printed books can be downloaded online for a few bucks or directly from
         your cell phone. These devices can store hundreds of books in memory and, with
         text-to-speech features, can even read the texts. The market for ebooks and
         ebook readers keeps expanding as a lot of companies enter it. Online and traditional
         booksellers have been the first to market ebook readers to the public, but
         computer companies, especially the ones already involved in cell phone, online music,
         and notepad computer technology, will also enter the market. The problem for
         consumers, however, is which device to choose. Incompatibility is the norm.

         Ebooks can be read only on the devices they were intended for. Furthermore, use is
         restricted by the same kind of DRM systems that restrict the copying of music and
         videos. So, book buyers are often unable to lend books to other readers, as they
         can with a read book. Few accommodations have been made to fit the other way
         Americans read: by borrowing books from libraries. What is a buyer to do?

If you write your first draft on the computer, consider creating a new file folder for each course with a
set of subfolders inside the course folders for each assignment you are given. Label the folders clearly
with the course names, and label each assignment folder and word processing document with a title
that you will easily recognize. The assignment name is a good choice for the document. Then use that
subfolder to store all the drafts you create. When you start each new draft, do not just write over the
last one. Instead, save the draft with a new tag after the title--draft 1, draft 2, and so on--so that you

                                                                                                                           5.21
will have a complete history of drafts in case your instructor wishes you to submit them. In your
documents, observe any formatting requirements--for margins, headers, placement of page numbers,
and other layout matters--that your instructor requires.

Drafting Body Paragraphs

If your thesis gives the reader a roadmap to your essay, then body paragraphs should closely follow that
map. The reader should be able to predict what follows your introductory paragraph by simply reading
the thesis statement. The body paragraphs present the evidence you have gathered to confirm your
thesis. Before you begin to support your thesis in the body, you must find information from a variety of
sources that support and give credit to what you are trying to prove.

Select Primary Support for Your Thesis
Without primary support, your argument is not likely to be convincing. Primary support can be described
as the major points you choose to expand on your thesis. It is the most important information you select
to argue for your point of view. Each point you choose will be incorporated into the topic sentence for
each body paragraph you write. Your primary supporting points are further supported by supporting
details within the paragraphs.

Remember that a worthy argument is backed by examples. In order to construct a valid argument, good
writers conduct lots of background research and take careful notes. They also talk to people
knowledgeable about a topic in order to understand its implications before writing about it.

Identify the Characteristics of Good Primary Support
In order to fulfill the requirements of good primary support, the information you choose must meet the
following standards:

     Be relevant to the thesis: Primary support is considered strong when it relates directly to the
         thesis. Primary support should show, explain, or prove your main argument without delving into
         irrelevant details. When faced with lots of information that could be used to prove your thesis,
         you may think you need to include it all in your body paragraphs. But effective writers resist the
         temptation to lose focus. Choose your supporting points wisely by making sure they directly
         connect to your thesis.

     Be specific: The main points you make about your thesis and the examples you use to expand on
         those points need to be more specific than the thesis. Use specific examples to provide the
         evidence and to build upon your general ideas. These types of examples give your reader
         something narrow to focus on, and if used properly, they leave little doubt about your claim.
         General examples, while they convey the necessary information, are not nearly as compelling or
         useful in writing because they are too obvious and typical.

     Be detailed: Remember that your thesis, while specific, should not be very detailed. The body
         paragraphs are where you develop the discussion that a thorough essay requires. Using detailed

                                                                                                                           5.22
         support shows readers that you have considered all the facts and chosen only the most precise
         details to enhance your point of view.

Pre-write to Identify Primary Supporting Points for a Thesis Statement
Recall that when you pre-write you essentially make a list of examples or reasons why you support your
stance. Stemming from each point, you further provide details to support those reasons. After
prewriting, you are then able to look back at the information and choose the most compelling pieces
you will use in your body paragraphs.

Select the Most Effective Primary Supporting Points for a Thesis Statement
As you developed a working thesis through prewriting techniques, you may have generated a lot of
information, which may be edited out later. Remember that your primary support must be relevant to
your thesis. Remind yourself of your main argument, and delete any ideas that do not directly relate to
it. Omitting unrelated ideas ensures that you will use only the most convincing information in your body
paragraphs. Choose at least three very compelling points. These will serve as the topic sentences for
your body paragraphs.

When you support your thesis, you are revealing evidence. Evidence includes anything that can help
support your stance. The following are the kinds of evidence you will encounter as you conduct your
research:

    1. Facts: Facts are the best kind of evidence to use because they often cannot be disputed. They
         can support your stance by providing background information on or a solid foundation for your
         point of view. However, some facts may still need explanation. For example, the sentence "The
         most populated state in the United States is California" is a pure fact, but it may require some
         explanation to make it relevant to your specific argument.

    2. Judgments: Judgments are conclusions drawn from the given facts. Judgments are more credible
         than opinions because they are founded upon careful reasoning and examination of a topic.

    3. Testimony: Testimony consists of direct quotations from either an eyewitness or an expert
         witness. An eyewitness is someone who has direct experience with a subject; he adds
         authenticity to an argument based on facts. An expert witness is a person who has extensive
         experience with a topic. This person studies the facts and provides commentary based on either
         facts or judgments, or both. An expert witness adds authority and credibility to an argument.

    4. Personal observation: Personal observation is similar to testimony, but personal observation
         consists of your testimony. It reflects what you know to be true because you have experiences
         and have formed either opinions or judgments about them. For instance, if you are one of five
         children and your thesis states that being part of a large family is beneficial to a child's social
         development, you could use your own experience to support your thesis.

You can consult a vast pool of resources to gather support for your stance. Citing relevant information
from reliable sources ensures that your reader will take you seriously and consider your assertions.
There are many types of sources that you can use for your essays, such as newspapers or news

                                                                                                                           5.23
organization websites, magazines, encyclopedias, and scholarly journals, which are periodicals that
address topics in a specialized field. The best source to use for your essay will depend on its topic and
context; formal research papers will tend to rely more heavily on scholarly journal articles and books,
while a movie review may be likely to cite a website such as Rotten Tomatoes. Regardless of your topic,
it is important to use the best quality sources available - which may take some digging and even a visit or
two to the library. When using sources, you are responsible for properly documenting the borrowed
information properly. More information on source attribution and citation formatting is available in the
Ethics section.

Choose Supporting Topic Sentences
Each body paragraph contains a topic sentence that states one aspect of your thesis and then expands
upon it. Like the thesis statement, each topic sentence should be specific and supported by concrete
details, facts, or explanations. Each body paragraph should comprise the following elements: topic
sentence + supporting details (examples, reasons, or arguments)

As you read previously, topic sentences indicate the location and main points of the basic arguments of
your essay. These sentences are vital to writing your body paragraphs because they always refer back to
and support your thesis statement. Topic sentences are linked to the ideas you have introduced in your
thesis, thus reminding readers what your essay is about. A paragraph without a clearly identified topic
sentence may be unclear and scattered, just like an essay without a thesis statement.

Unless your professor instructs otherwise, you should include at least three body paragraphs in your
essay. A five-paragraph essay, including the introduction and conclusion, is commonly the standard for
exams and basic essay assignments because it is meant to help students create fully developed essays;
however, writers should maintain flexibility and not expect all essays to conform to that model. The
emphasis is on creating an essay that provides enough support to tell a story, create an image or idea, or
inform or persuade the audience.

Draft Supporting Detail Sentences for Each Primary Support Sentence
After deciding which primary support points you will use as your topic sentences, you must add details
to clarify and demonstrate each of those points. These supporting details provide examples, facts, or
evidence that support the topic sentence. The writer drafts possible supporting detail sentences for
each primary support sentence based on the thesis statement:

Thesis: Unleashed dogs on city streets are a dangerous nuisance.

   I. Dogs can scare cyclists.

              A. Cyclists are forced to zigzag on the roads.

              B. School children panic and turn wildly on their bikes.

              C. People walking at night freeze in fear.

  II. Loose dogs are traffic hazards.

                                                                                                                           5.24
              A. Dogs in the street make people swerve their cars.

              B. To avoid dogs, drivers run into other cars or pedestrians.

              C. Children coaxing dogs across city streets create danger.

 III. Unleashed dogs damage gardens.

              A. They step on flowers and vegetables.

              B. They destroy hedges by urinating on them.

              C. They mess up lawns by digging holes.

As previously discussed, you have the option of writing your topic sentences in one of three ways. You
can state it at the beginning of the body paragraph, or at the end of the paragraph, or you do not have
to write it at all. This is called an implied topic sentence. An implied topic sentence lets readers form the
main idea for themselves. For beginning writers, it is best to not use implied topic sentences because it
makes it harder to focus your writing. Your instructor may also want to clearly identify the sentences
that support your thesis.

Drafting Introductory and Concluding Paragraphs

Picture your introduction as a storefront window: You have a certain amount of space to attract your
customers (readers) to your goods (subject) and bring them inside your store (discussion). Once you
have enticed them with something intriguing, you then point them in a specific direction and try to
make the sale (convince them to accept your thesis). Your introduction is an invitation to your readers to
consider what you have to say and then to follow your train of thought as you expand upon your thesis
statement.

Writing an Introduction
An introduction serves the following purposes:

     Establishes your voice and tone, or your attitude, toward the subject
     Introduces the general topic of the essay
     States the thesis that will be supported in the body paragraphs
First impressions are crucial and can leave lasting effects in your reader's mind, which is why the
introduction is so important to your essay. If your introductory paragraph is dull or disjointed, your
reader probably will not have much interest in continuing with the essay.

Attracting Interest in Your Introductory Paragraph
Your introduction should begin with an engaging statement devised to provoke your readers' interest. In
the next few sentences, introduce them to your topic by stating general facts or ideas about the subject.
As you move deeper into your introduction, you gradually narrow the focus, moving closer to your

                                                                                                                           5.25
thesis. Moving smoothly and logically from your introductory remarks to your thesis statement can be
achieved using a funnel technique, as illustrated in the diagram "Funnel Technique."

                                                Figure: Funnel Technique
Immediately capturing your readers' interest increases the chances of having them read what you are
about to discuss. You can garner curiosity for your essay in a number of ways. Try to get your readers
personally involved by doing any of the following:

     Appealing to their emotions
     Using logic
     Beginning with a provocative question or opinion
     Opening with a startling statistic or surprising fact
     Raising a question or series of questions
     Presenting an explanation or rationalization for your essay
     Opening with a relevant quotation or incident
     Opening with a striking image
     Including a personal anecdote
Remember that your diction, or word choice, while always important, is most crucial in your
introductory paragraph. Boring diction could extinguish any desire a person might have to read through
your discussion. Choose words that create images or express action.
Earlier in this section we followed Mariah as she moved through the writing process. In this section,
Mariah writes her introduction and conclusion for the same essay on media. Mariah incorporates some

                                                                                                                           5.26
of the introductory elements into her introductory paragraph, which she previously outlined. Her thesis
statement is underlined.

         Play Atari on a General Electric brand television set? Maybe watch Dynasty? Or
         read old newspaper articles on microfiche at the library? Thirty-five years ago, the
         average college student did not have many options when it came to entertainment in
         the form of technology. Fast forward to the twenty-first century, and the digital
         age has revolutionized the way people entertain themselves. In today's rapidly
         evolving world of digital technology, consumers are bombarded with endless options
         for how they do most everything, from buying and reading books to taking and
         developing photographs. In a society that is obsessed with digital means of
         entertainment, it is easy for the average person to become baffled. Everyone wants
         the newest and best digital technology, but the choices are many and the
         specifications are often confusing.

Writing a Conclusion
It is not unusual to want to rush when you approach your conclusion, and even experienced writers may
fade. But what good writers remember is that it is vital to put just as much attention into the conclusion
as in the rest of the essay. After all, a hasty ending can undermine an otherwise strong essay.

A conclusion that does not correspond to the rest of your essay, has loose ends, or is unorganized can
unsettle your readers and raise doubts about the entire essay. However, if you have worked hard to
write the introduction and body, your conclusion can often be the most logical part to compose.

The Anatomy of a Strong Conclusion
Keep in mind that the ideas in your conclusion must conform to the rest of your essay. In order to tie
these components together, restate your thesis at the beginning of your conclusion. This helps you
assemble, in an orderly fashion, all the information you have explained in the body. Repeating your
thesis reminds your readers of the major arguments you have been trying to prove and also indicates
that your essay is drawing to a close. A strong conclusion also reviews your main points and emphasizes
the importance of the topic.

The construction of the conclusion is similar to the introduction, in which you make general introductory
statements and then present your thesis. The difference is that in the conclusion you first paraphrase, or
state in different words, your thesis and then follow up with general concluding remarks. These
sentences should progressively broaden the focus of your thesis and maneuver your readers out of the
essay.

Many writers like to end their essays with a final emphatic statement. This strong closing statement will
cause your readers to continue thinking about the implications of your essay; it will make your
conclusion, and thus your essay, more memorable.

                                                                                                                           5.27
Another powerful technique is to challenge your readers to make a change in either their thoughts or
their actions. Challenging your readers to see the subject through new eyes is a powerful way to ease
yourself and your readers out of the essay.

When closing your essay, do not expressly state that you are drawing to a close. Relying on statements
such as in conclusion, it is clear that, as you can see, or in summation is unnecessary and can be
considered trite.

It is wise to avoid doing any of the following in your conclusion:

     Introducing new material: Introducing new material in your conclusion has an unsettling effect
         on your reader. When you raise new points, you make your reader want more information,
         which you could not possibly provide in the limited space of your final paragraph.

     Contradicting your thesis: Contradicting or changing your thesis statement causes your readers
         to think that you do not actually have a conviction about your topic. After all, you have spent
         several paragraphs adhering to a specific point of view.

     Changing your thesis: When you change sides or open up your point of view in the conclusion,
         your reader becomes less inclined to believe your original argument.

     Using apologies or disclaimers: By apologizing for your opinion or stating that you know it is
         tough to digest, you are in fact admitting that even you know what you have discussed is
         irrelevant or unconvincing. You do not want your readers to feel this way. Effective writers stand
         by their thesis statement and do not stray from it.

Mariah incorporates some of these pointers into her conclusion. She has paraphrased her thesis
statement in the first sentence, which is underlined.

         In a society fixated on the latest and smartest digital technology, a consumer can
         easily become confused by the countless options and specifications. The ever-
         changing state of digital technology challenges consumer with its updates and add-
         ons and expanding markets and incompatible formats and restrictions - a fact that
         is complicated by salesmen who want to sell them anything. In a world that is
         increasingly driven by instant gratification, it's easy for people to buy the first
         thing they see. The solution for many people should be to avoid buying on impulse.
         Consumers should think about what they really need, not what is advertised.

Make sure your essay is balanced by not having an excessively long or short introduction or conclusion.
Check that they match each other in length as closely as possible, and try to mirror the formula you used
in each. Parallelism strengthens the message of your essay.

                                                                                                                           5.28
Writing a Title
A writer's best choice for a title is one that alludes to the main point of the entire essay. Like the
headline in a newspaper or the big, bold title in a magazine, an essay's title gives the audience a first
peek at the content. If readers like the title, they are likely to keep reading.
Following her outline carefully, Mariah crafted each paragraph of her essay. Moving step by step in the
writing process, Mariah finished the draft and even included a brief concluding paragraph which you will
read later. She then decided, as the final touch for her writing session, to add an engaging title.
Thesis Statement:

         Everyone wants the newest and the best digital technology, but the choices are
         many, and the specifications are often confusing.
Working Title:
         Digital Technology: The Newest and the Best at What Price?

                                                                                                                           5.29
                              Revising and Editing4

Revising and editing are the two tasks you undertake to significantly improve your essay. Both are very
important elements of the writing process. You may think that a completed first draft means little
improvement is needed. However, even experienced writers need to improve their drafts and rely on
peers during revising and editing. You may know that athletes miss catches, fumble balls, or overshoot
goals. Dancers forget steps, turn too slowly, or miss beats. For both athletes and dancers, the more they
practice, the stronger their performance will become. Web designers seek better images, a more clever
design, or a more appealing background for their web pages. Writing has the same capacity to profit
from improvement and revision.

Understanding the Purpose of Revising and Editing

Revising and editing allow you to examine two important aspects of your writing separately, so that you
can give each task your undivided attention.

     When you revise, you take a second look at your ideas. You might add, cut, move, or change
         information in order to make your ideas clearer, more accurate, more interesting, or more
         convincing.

     When you edit, you take a second look at how you expressed your ideas. You add or change
         words. You fix any problems in grammar, punctuation, and sentence structure. You improve
         your writing style. You make your essay into a polished, mature piece of writing, the end
         product of your best efforts.

Here are some strategies that writers have developed to look at their first drafts from a fresh
perspective. Try them over the course of this semester; then keep using the ones that bring results.

     Take a break. You are proud of what you wrote, but you might be too close to it to make
         changes. Set aside your writing for a few hours or even a day until you can look at it objectively.

     Ask someone you trust for feedback and constructive criticism.

     Use the resources that your college provides. Find out where your school's writing lab is located
         and ask about the assistance they provide online and in person.

     Pretend you are one of your readers. Are you satisfied or dissatisfied? Why? Many people hear
         the words critic, critical, and criticism and pick up only negative vibes that provoke feelings that
         make them blush, grumble, or shout. However, as a writer and a thinker, you need to learn to be
         critical of yourself in a positive way and have high expectations for your work. You also need to

         train your eye and trust your ability to fix what needs fixing. For this, you need to teach yourself
         where to look.

When you reread your writing to find revisions to make, look for each type of problem in a separate
sweep. Read it straight through once to locate any problems with unity.

Read it straight through a second time to find problems with coherence. You may follow this same
practice during many stages of the writing process.

Creating Unity and Coherence
Following your outline closely offers you a reasonable guarantee that your writing will stay on purpose
and not drift away from the controlling idea. However, when writers are rushed, are tired, or cannot find
the right words, their writing may become less than they want it to be. Their writing may no longer be
clear and concise, and they may be adding information that is not needed to develop the main idea.

When a piece of writing has unity, all the ideas in each paragraph and in the entire essay clearly belong
and are arranged in an order that makes logical sense. When the writing has coherence, the ideas flow
smoothly. The wording clearly indicates how one idea leads to another within a paragraph and from
paragraph to paragraph.

Reading your writing aloud will often help you find problems with unity and coherence. Listen for the
clarity and flow of your ideas. Identify places where you find yourself confused, and write a note to
yourself about possible fixes.

Creating Unity
Sometimes writers get caught up in the moment and cannot resist a good digression. Even though you
might enjoy such detours when you chat with friends, unplanned digressions usually harm a piece of
writing.

Mariah stayed close to her outline when she drafted the three body paragraphs of her essay she
tentatively titled "Digital Technology: The Newest and the Best at What Price?" But a recent shopping
trip for an HDTV upset her enough that she digressed from the main topic of her third paragraph and
included comments about the sales staff at the electronics store she visited. When she revised her
essay, she deleted the off- topic sentences that affected the unity of the paragraph. Read the following
paragraph twice, the first time without Mariah's changes, and the second time with them.

         Nothing is more confusing to me than choosing among televisions. It confuses lots
         of people who want a new high-definition digital television (HDTV) with a large
         screen to watch sports and DVDs on. You could listen to the guys in the electronics
         store, but word has it they know little more than you do. They want to sell you what
         they have in stock, not what best fits your needs. You face decisions you never had
         to make with the old, bulky picture-tube televisions. Screen resolution means the
         number of horizontal scan lines the screen can show. This resolution is often 1080p,
         or full HD, or 768p. The trouble is that if you have a smaller screen, 32 inches or

                                                                                                                           5.31
         37 inches, you won't be able to tell the difference with the naked eye. The 1080p
         televisions cost more, though, so those are what the salespeople want you to buy.
         They get bigger commissions. The other important decision you face as you walk
         around the sales floor is whether to get a plasma screen or an LCD screen. Now
         here the salespeople may finally give you decent info. Plasma flat-panel television
         screens can be much larger in diameter than their LCD rivals. Plasma screens show
         decent lacks and can be viewed at a wider angle than current LCD screens. But be
         careful and tell the salesperson you have budget constraints. Large flat-panel
         plasma screens are much more expensive than flat-screen LCD models. Don't let
         someone make you buy more television than you need!

Creating Coherence
Careful writers use transitions to clarify how the ideas in their sentences and paragraphs are related.
These words and phrases help the writing flow smoothly. Adding transitions is not the only way to
improve coherence, but they are often useful and give a mature feel to your essays. The Table of
Common Transitional Words and Phrases groups many common transitions according to their purpose.

Being Clear and Concise
Some writers are very methodical and painstaking when they write a first draft. Other writers unleash a
lot of words in order to get out all that they feel they need to say. Do either of these composing styles
match your style? Or is your composing style somewhere in between? No matter which description best
fits you, the first draft of almost every piece of writing, no matter its author, can be made clearer and
more concise. If you have a tendency to write too much, you will need to look for unnecessary words. If
you have a tendency to be vague or imprecise in your wording, you will need to find specific words to
replace any overly general language.

Identifying Wordiness
Sometimes writers use too many words when fewer words will appeal more to their audience and
better fit their purpose. Here are some common examples of wordiness to look for in your draft.
Eliminating wordiness helps all readers, because it makes your ideas clear, direct, and straightforward.

     Sentences that begin with There is or There are.

                   Wordy: There are two major experiments that the Biology Department sponsors.

                   Revised: The Biology Department sponsors two major experiments.

     Sentences with unnecessary modifiers.

                   Wordy: Two extremely famous and well-known consumer advocates spoke eloquently
                   in favor of the proposed important legislation.

                   Revised: Two well-known consumer advocates spoke in favor of the proposed
                   legislation.

                                                                                                                           5.32
     Sentences with deadwood phrases that add little to the meaning. Be judicious when you use
         phrases such as in terms of, with a mind to, on the subject of, as to whether or not, more or less,
         as far as...is concerned, and similar expressions. You can usually find a more straightforward way
         to state your point.

                   Wordy: As a world leader in the field of green technology, the company plans to focus
                   its efforts in the area of geothermal energy. A report as to whether or not to use geysers
                   as an energy source is in the process of preparation.

                   Revised: As a world leader in green technology, the company plans to focus on
                   geothermal energy. A report about using geysers as an energy source is in preparation.

     Sentences in the passive voice or with forms of the verb to be. Sentences with passive-voice
         verbs often create confusion, because the subject of the sentence does not perform an action.
         Sentences are clearer when the subject of the sentence performs the action and is followed by a
         strong verb. Use strong, active-voice verbs in place of forms of to be, which can lead to
         wordiness. Avoid passive voice when you can.

                   Wordy: It might perhaps be said that using a GPS device is something that is a benefit to
                   drivers who have a poor sense of direction.

                   Revised: Using a GPS device benefits drivers who have a poor sense of direction.

     Sentences with constructions that can be shortened.

                   Wordy: The ebook reader, which is a recent invention, may become as commonplace as
                   the cell phone. My over-sixty uncle bought an ebook reader, and his wife bought an
                   ebook reader, too.

                   Revised: The ebook reader, a recent invention, may become as commonplace as the cell
                   phone. My over-sixty uncle and his wife both bought ebook readers.

Choosing Specific, Appropriate Words
Most college essays should be written in formal English, suitable for an academic situation. Follow these
principles to be sure that your word choice is appropriate.

     Avoid slang: Find alternatives to bummer, kewl, and rad.

     Avoid language that is overly casual: Write about "men and women" rather than "girls and
         guys" unless you are trying to create a specific effect. A formal tone calls for formal language.

     Avoid contractions: Use do not in place of don't, I am in place of I'm, have not in place of
         haven't, and so on. Contractions are considered casual speech.

     Avoid clichés: Overused expressions such as green with envy, face the music, better late than
         never, and similar expressions are empty of meaning and may not appeal to your audience.

                                                                                                                           5.33
     Be careful when you use words that sound alike but have different meanings: Some examples
         are allusion/illusion, complement/compliment, council/counsel, concurrent/consecutive,
         founder/flounder, and historic/historical. When in doubt, check a dictionary.

     Choose words with the connotations you want: Choosing a word for its connotations is as
         important in formal essay writing as it is in all kinds of writing. Compare the positive
         connotations of the word proud and the negative connotations of arrogant and conceited.

     Use specific words rather than overly general words: Find synonyms for thing, people, nice,
         good, bad, interesting, and other vague words. Or use specific details to make your exact
         meaning clear.

         Finally, nothing ^ confuses buyers more than purchasing is more confusing to me

Completing a Peer Review

After working so closely with a piece of writing, writers often need to step back and ask for a more
objective reader. What writers most need is feedback from readers who can respond only to the words
on the page. When they are ready, writers show their drafts to someone they respect and who can give
an honest response about its strengths and weaknesses.

You, too, can ask a peer to read your draft when it is ready. After evaluating the feedback and assessing
what is most helpful, the reader's feedback will help you when you revise your draft. This process is

                                                                                                                           5.34
called peer review. You can work with a partner in your class and identify specific ways to strengthen
each other's essays. Although you may be uncomfortable sharing your writing at first, remember that
each writer is working toward the same goal: a final draft that fits the audience and the purpose.
Maintaining a positive attitude when providing feedback will put you and your partner at ease.

Using Feedback

Using Feedback Objectively
The purpose of peer feedback is to receive constructive criticism of your essay. Your peer reviewer is
your first real audience, and you have the opportunity to learn what confuses and delights a reader so
that you can improve your work before sharing the final draft with a wider audience (or your intended
audience). It may not be necessary to incorporate every recommendation your peer reviewer makes.
However, if you start to observe a pattern in the responses you receive from peer reviewers, you might
want to take that feedback into consideration in future assignments. For example, if you read consistent
comments about a need for more research, then you may want to consider including more research in
future assignments.

Using Feedback from Multiple Sources
You might get feedback from more than one reader as you share different stages of your revised draft.
In this situation, you may receive feedback from readers who do not understand the assignment or who
lack your involvement with and enthusiasm for it. You need to evaluate the responses you receive
according to two important criteria:

     Determine if the feedback supports the purpose of the assignment.

     Determine if the suggested revisions are appropriate to the audience. Then, using these
         standards, accept or reject revision feedback.

Editing Your Draft

If you have been incorporating each set of revisions as Mariah has, you have produced multiple drafts of
your writing. So far, all your changes have been content changes. Perhaps with the help of peer
feedback, you have made sure that you sufficiently supported your ideas. You have checked for
problems with unity and coherence. You have examined your essay for word choice, revising to cut
unnecessary words and to replace weak wording with specific and appropriate wording.

The next step after revising the content is editing. When you edit, you examine the surface features of
your text. You examine your spelling, grammar, usage, and punctuation. You also make sure you use the
proper format when creating your finished assignment.

Editing often takes time. Budgeting time into the writing process allows you to complete additional edits
after revising. Editing and proofreading your writing helps you create a finished work that represents
your best efforts. Here are a few more tips to remember about your readers:

     Readers do not notice correct spelling, but they do notice misspellings.

                                                                                                                           5.35
     Readers look past your sentences to get to your ideas--unless the sentences are awkward,
         poorly constructed, and frustrating to read.

     Readers notice when every sentence has the same rhythm as every other sentence, with no
         variety.

     Readers do not cheer when you use there, their, and they're correctly; but they notice when you
         do not.

     Readers will notice the care with which you handled your assignment and your attention to
         detail in the delivery of an error-free document.

Checklists for Editing Your Writing Grammar
     Are some sentences actually sentence fragments?
     Are some sentences run-on sentences? How can I correct them?
     Do some sentences need conjunctions between independent clauses?
     Does every verb agree with its subject?
     Is every verb in the correct tense?
     Are tense forms, especially for irregular verbs, written correctly?
     Have I used subject, object, and possessive personal pronouns correctly?
     Have I used who and whom correctly?
     Is the antecedent of every pronoun clear?
     Do all personal pronouns agree with their antecedents?
     Have I used the correct comparative and superlative forms of adjectives and adverbs?
     Is it clear which word a participial phrase modifies, or is it a dangling modifier?

Sentence Structure
     Are all my sentences simple sentences, or do I vary my sentence structure?
     Have I chosen the best coordinating or subordinating conjunctions to join clauses?
     Have I created long, overpacked sentences that should be shortened for clarity?
     Do I see any mistakes in parallel structure?

Punctuation
     Does every sentence end with the correct end punctuation?
     Can I justify the use of every exclamation point?

                                                                                                                           5.36
     Have I used apostrophes correctly to write all singular and plural possessive forms?
     Have I used quotation marks correctly?
Mechanics and Usage
     Can I find any spelling errors? How can I correct them?
     Have I used capital letters where they are needed?
     Have I written abbreviations, when allowed, correctly?
     Can I find any errors in the use of commonly confused words, such as to/too/two?
Be careful about relying too much on spelling checkers and grammar checkers. A spelling checker cannot
recognize that you meant to write principle but wrote principal instead. A grammar checker often
queries constructions that are perfectly correct. The program does not understand your meaning; it
makes its check against a general set of formulas that might not apply in each instance. If you use a
grammar checker, accept the suggestions that make sense, but consider why the suggestions came up.
Proofreading requires patience; it is very easy to read past a mistake. Set your paper aside for at least a
few hours, if not a day or more, so your mind will rest. Some professional proofreaders read a text
backward so they can concentrate on spelling and punctuation. Another helpful technique is to slowly
read a paper aloud, paying attention to every word, letter, and punctuation mark. If you need additional
proofreading help, ask a reliable friend, a classmate, or a peer tutor to make a final pass on your paper
to look for anything you missed.
Formatting
Remember to use proper format when creating your finished assignment. Sometimes an instructor, a
department, or a college will require students to follow specific instructions on titles, margins, page
numbers, or the location of the writer's name.
These requirements may be more detailed and rigid for research projects and term papers, which often
observe the American Psychological Association (APA) or Modern Language Association (MLA) style
guides, especially when citations of sources are included. To ensure the format is correct and follows
any specific instructions, make a final check before you submit an assignment.

                                                                                                                           5.37
Section 6: Joining the Academic Conversation

                                   Introduction

When a student writes a research essay, that essay is not written for the student alone. As was
discussed in the section on the rhetorical situation, all written works have an audience and a context.
Not only is there an audience and a context for a given text, but oftentimes a text is joining an ongoing
conversation about that topic as well. If, for example, someone writes about climate change, the author
is stepping into a conversation about climate change that has been happening for the past fifty years
and longer. Part of joining that conversation means being able to find and evaluate which voices matter
for the topic and thesis of the paper, and then building upon and responding to those people.

The twentieth century rhetorician Kenneth Burke posits that there is an "unending conversation"
occurring throughout history, and his illustration of this conversation is helpful in understanding how
one joins a conversation of ideas:

         Imagine that you enter a parlor. You come late. When you arrive, others have long
         preceded you, and they are engaged in a heated discussion, a discussion too heated for
         them to pause and tell you exactly what it is about. In fact, the discussion has already
         begun long before any of them got there, so that no one present is qualified to retrace
         for you all the steps that had gone before. You listen for a while, until you decide that
         you have caught the tenor of the argument; then you put in your oar. Someone
         answers; you answer him; another comes to your defense; another aligns himself
         against you, to either the embarrassment or gratification of your opponent, depending
         upon the quality of your ally's assistance. However, the discussion is interminable. The
         hour grows late, you must depart. And you do depart, with the discussion still vigorously
         in progress.1

In this analogy, the other party-goers are the authors of primary and secondary texts that an author
engages in a paper, and the person writing the research paper is the one joining the conversation.
However, the student in this case has many more sources to choose from than just a few in a single
conversation. Rather there are many voices in hundreds of conversations, and it is up to you to choose
which ones are most important and worth including in your argument.

                      Evaluating the Important Voices2

In 2010, a textbook being used in fourth grade classrooms in Virginia became big news for all the wrong
reasons. According to an article in The Washington Post, the book Our Virginia, by Joy Masoff, had

caught the attention of a parent who was helping her child do her homework. Carol Sheriff was a
historian for the College of William and Mary and as she worked with her daughter using Our Virginia,
she began to notice some glaring historical errors, not the least of which was a passage which described
how thousands of African Americans fought for the South during the Civil War.

Further investigation into the book revealed that although the author had written textbooks on a variety
of subjects, she was not a trained historian. The research she had done to write Our Virginia, and in
particular the information she included about Black Confederate soldiers, was done through the internet
and included sources created by groups like the Sons of Confederate Veterans, an organization which
promotes views of history that de-emphasize the role of slavery in the Civil War.

How did a book with errors like these come to be used as part of the curriculum and who was at fault?
Was it Masoff for using untrustworthy sources for her research? Was it the editors who allowed the
book to be published with these errors intact? Was it the school board for approving the book without
more closely reviewing its accuracy?

There are a number of issues at play in the case of Our Virginia, but there's no question that evaluating
sources is an important part of the research process and doesn't just apply to internet sources. Using
inaccurate, irrelevant, or poorly researched sources can affect the quality of your own work. Being able
to understand and apply the concepts that follow is crucial to becoming a more savvy user and creator
of information.

People who are adept at evaluating information are able to review the research process and compare
and judge information and data. Individuals who evaluate information well:

Understand:

     The information and data landscape of their learning/research context;
     Issues of quality, accuracy, relevance, bias, reputation and credibility relating to information and

         data sources;
     How information is evaluated and published, to help inform their personal evaluation process;
     The importance of consistency in data collection;
     The importance of citation in their learning/research context.
Are able to:

     Distinguish between different information resources and the information they provide;
     Choose suitable material on their search topic using appropriate criteria;
     Assess the quality, accuracy, relevance, bias, reputation and credibility of the information

         resources found;

                                                                                                                            6.2
     Assess the credibility of the data gathered;

     Read critically, identifying key points and arguments;

     Relate the information found to the original search strategy;

     Critically appraise and evaluate their own findings and those of others;

     Know when to stop.

Distinguishing Between Information Resources

Information is published in a variety of formats, each with its own special considerations when it comes
to evaluation. When conducting your research, consider the following formats and the different ways in
which each format is developed and presented:

Social Media
Social media is a quickly rising star in the landscape of information gathering. Facebook updates, tweets,
wikis, and blogs have made information creators of us all and have a strong influence not just on how
we communicate with each other but also on how we learn about current events or discover items of
interest. Anyone can create or contribute to social media and nothing that's said is checked for accuracy
before it's posted for the world to see. So do people really use social media for research? Currently, the
main use for social media, like tweets and Facebook posts, is as primary sources that are treated as the
objects under study rather than sources of information on a topic. But now that the Modern Language
Association (MLA) has a recommended way to cite a tweet, social media may, in fact, be gaining
credibility as a resource.

News Articles
These days, social media will generally be among the first to cover a big news story, with news media
writing an article or report after more information has been gathered. News articles are written by
journalists who either report on an event they have witnessed firsthand, or after making contact with
those more directly involved. The focus is on information that is of immediate interest to the public and
these articles are written in a way that a general audience will be able to understand. These articles go
through a fact-checking process, but when a story is big and the goal is to inform readers of urgent or
timely information, inaccuracies may occur. In research, news articles are often best treated as primary
sources, especially if they were published immediately after a current event.

Magazine Articles
While news articles and social media tend to concentrate on what happened, how it happened, who it
happened to, and where it happened, magazine articles are more about understanding why something
happened, usually with the benefit of at least a little hindsight. Writers of magazine articles also fall into
the journalist category and rely heavily on investigation and interviews for research. Fact-checking in
magazine articles tends to be more accurate because magazines publish less frequently than news
outlets and have more time to get the facts right. Depending on the focus of the magazine, articles may
cover current events or just items of general interest to the intended audience. The language may be

                                                                                                                            6.3
more emotional or dramatic than the factual tone of news articles, but the articles are written at a
similar reading level so as to appeal to the widest audience possible. A magazine article is considered a
popular source rather than a scholarly one which gives it less weight in a research context but doesn't
take away the value completely.

Scholarly Articles
Scholarly articles are written by, and for, experts in a field and generally describe formal research
studies or experiments conducted to provide new insight on a topic rather than reporting current events
or items of general interest. You may have heard the term "peer review" in relation to scholarly articles.
This means that before an article is published, it undergoes a review process in order to confirm that the
information is accurate and the research it discusses is valid. This process adds a level of credibility to
the article that you would not find in a magazine or news article. Scholarly articles tend to be long and
feature specialized language that is not easily understood by someone who does not already have some
level of expertise on the topic. Though they may not be as easy to use, they carry a lot of weight in a
research context, especially if you are working in a field related to science or technology. These sources
will give you information to build on in your own original research.

Books
Books have been a staple of the research process since Gutenberg invented the printing press because a
topic can be covered in more depth in a book than in most other types of sources. Also, the
conventional wisdom for books is that anyone can write one, but only the best ones get published. This
is becoming less true as books are published in a wider variety of formats and via a wider variety of
venues than in previous eras, which is something to be aware of when using a book for research
purposes. For now, the editing process for formally published books is still in place and research in the
humanities, which includes topics such as literature and history, continues to be published primarily in
this format.

Choosing Materials

When choosing a source for your research, what criteria do you usually use? Gauging whether the
source relates to your topic at all is probably one. How high up it appears on the results list when you
search may be another. Beyond that, you may base your decision at least partly on how easy it is to
access.

These are all important criteria, to varying degrees, but there are other criteria you may want to keep in
mind when deciding if a source will be useful to your research.

Quality
Scholarly journals and books are traditionally considered to be higher quality information sources
because they have gone through a more thorough editing process that ensures the quality of their
content. Generally, you also pay more to access these sources or may have to rely on a library or
university to pay for access for you. Information on the Internet can also be of a high quality but there is
less of a quality assurance process in place for much of that information. In the current climate, the

                                                                                                                            6.4
highest quality information, even on the Internet, often requires a subscription or other form of
payment for access.

Clues to a source's level of quality are closely related to thinking about how the source was produced,
including what format it was published in and whether it is likely to have gone through a formal editing
process prior to publication.

Accuracy
A source is accurate if the information it contains is correct. Sometimes it's easy to tell when a piece of
information is simply wrong, especially if you have some prior knowledge of the subject. But if you're
less familiar with the subject, inaccuracies can be harder to detect, especially when they come in subtler
forms such as exaggerations or inconsistencies.

To determine whether a source is accurate, you need to look more deeply at the content of the source,
including where the information in the source comes from and what evidence the author uses to
support their views and conclusions. It also helps to compare your source against another source. A
reader of Our Virginia may not have reason to believe the information the author cites from the Sons of
Confederate Veterans website is inaccurate, but if they compared the book against another source, the
inconsistencies might become more apparent.

Relevance
Relevance has to do with deciding whether the source actually relates to your topic and, if it does, how
closely it relates. Some sources may be an exact match; for others, you may need to consider a
particular angle or context before you can tell whether the source applies to your topic. When searching
for relevant sources, you should keep an open mind--but not too open. Don't pick something that's not
really related just because it's on the first page or two of results or because it sounds good.

You can assess the relevance of a source by comparing it against your research topic or research
question. Keep in mind that the source may not need to match on all points, but it should match on
enough points to be usable for your research beyond simply satisfying a requirement for an assignment.

Bias
An example of bias is when someone expresses a view that is one-sided without much consideration for
information that might negate what they believe. Bias is most prevalent in sources that cover
controversial issues where the author may attempt to persuade their readers to one side of the issue
without giving fair consideration to the other side of things. If the research topic you are using has ever
been the cause of heated debate, you will need to be especially watchful for any bias in the sources you
find.

Bias can be difficult to detect, particularly when we are looking at persuasive sources with which we
want to agree. If you want to believe something is true, chances are you'll side with your own internal
bias without consideration for whether a source exhibits bias. When deciding whether there is bias in a
source, look for dramatic language and images, poorly supported evidence against an opposing

                                                                                                                            6.5
viewpoint, or a strong leaning in one direction.

Reputation
Is the author of the source you have found a professor at a university or a self-published blogger? If the
author is a professor, are they respected in their field or is their work heavily challenged? What about
the publication itself ? Is it held in high regard or relatively unknown? Digging a little deeper to find out
what you can about the reputation of both the author and the publication can go a long way toward
deciding whether a source is valuable.

You can investigate the reputation of an author by looking at any biographical information that is
available as part of the source. Looking to see what else the author has published and whether this
information has positive reviews is also important in establishing whether the author has a good
reputation. The reputation of a publication can also be investigated through reviews, word-of-mouth by
professionals in the field, or online databases that keep track of statistics related to a journal's
credibility.

Credibility
Credibility has to do with the believability or trustworthiness of a source based on evidence such as
information about the author, the reputation of the publication, and how well the source is formatted.
How likely would you be to use a source that was written by someone with no expertise on a topic or a
source that appeared in a publication that was known for featuring low quality information? What if the
source was riddled with spelling and formatting errors? Looking at sources like these should inspire
more caution.

Objectively, credibility can be determined by taking into account all of the other criteria discussed for
evaluating a source. Knowing that some types of sources, such as scholarly journals, are generally
considered more credible than others, such as self-published websites, may also help. Subjectively,
deciding whether a source is credible may come down to a gut feeling. If something about a source
doesn't sit well with you, you may decide to pass it over.

Identifying Key Points and Arguments

Evaluating information about the source from its title, author, and summary information is only the first
step. The evaluation process continues when you begin to read the source in more detail and make
decisions about how (or whether) you will ultimately use it for your own research.

When you begin to look more deeply at your source, pay close attention to the following features of a
document.

Introduction
The purpose of the introduction to any piece that has one is to give information about what the reader
can expect from the source as a whole. There are different types of introductions, including forewords
and prefaces that may be written by the author of the book or by someone else with knowledge of the
subject. Introductory sections can include background information on why the topic was chosen,

                                                                                                                            6.6
background on the author's interest in the topic, context pertaining to why the topic is important, or the
lens through which the topic will be explored. Knowing this information before diving into the body of
the work will help you understand the author's approach to the topic and how it might relate to the
approach you are taking in your own research.

Most of the time, if your source is a book or an entire website, it will be divided into sections that each
cover a particular aspect of the overall topic. It may be necessary to read through all of these sections in
order to get a "big picture" understanding of the information being discussed, or it may be better to
concentrate only on the areas that relate most closely to your own research. Looking over the table of
contents or menu will help you decide whether you need the whole source or only pieces of it.

List of References
If the source you're using is research-based, it should have a list of references that usually appear at the
end of the document. Reviewing these references will give you a better idea of the kind of work the
author put into their own research. Did they put as much work into evaluating their sources as you are?
Can you tell from the citations if the sources used were credible? When were they published? Do they
represent a fair balance of perspectives or do they all support a limited point of view? What information
does the author use from these sources and in what way does he or she use that information? Use your
own research skills to spy on the research habits of others to help you evaluate the source.

Evaluating Your Findings

In the case of Our Virginia, the author used a biased source as part of her research and the inaccurate
information she got from that source affected the quality of her own work. Likewise, if anyone had used
her book as part of their research, it would have set off a chain reaction, since whatever information
they cited from Our Virginia would naturally have to be called into question, possibly diminishing the
value of their own conclusions.

Evaluating the sources you use for quality, accuracy, relevance, bias, and credibility is a good first step in
making sure this doesn't happen, but have you ever thought about evaluating the sources used by your
own sources? This takes extra time, but looking at the reference list, bibliography, or notes section of
any source you use to gauge the quality of the research done by the author of that source can be an
important extra step.

Knowing When to Stop
For some researchers, the process of searching for and evaluating sources is a highly enjoyable,
rewarding part of doing research. For others, it's a necessary evil on the way to constructing their own
ideas and sharing their own conclusions. Whichever end of the spectrum you most closely identify with,
here are a few ideas about the ever-important skill of knowing when to stop.

    1. You've satisfied the requirements for the assignment and/or your curiosity on the topic.
         If you're doing research as part of a course assignment, chances are you've been given a

                                                                                                                            6.7
         required number of sources. Novice researchers may find this number useful to understand how
         much research is considered appropriate for a particular topic. However, a common mistake is
         to focus more on the number of sources than on the quality of those sources. Meeting that
         magic number is great, but not if the sources used are low quality or otherwise inappropriate for
         the level of research being done.

    2. You have a deadline looming
         Nothing better inspires forward motion in a research project than having to meet a deadline,
         whether it's set by a professor, an advisor, a publisher, or yourself. Time management skills are
         especially useful, but since research is a cyclical process that sometimes circles back on itself
         when you discover new knowledge or change direction, planning things out in minute detail may
         not work. Leaving yourself enough time to follow the twists and turns of the research and
         writing process goes a long way toward getting your work in when it's expected.

    3. You need to change your topic
         You've been searching for information on your topic for a while now. Every search seems to
         come up empty or full of irrelevant information. You've brought your case to a research expert,
         like a librarian, who has given advice on how to adjust your search or how to find potential
         sources you may have previously dismissed. Still nothing. It could be that your topic is too
         specific or that it covers something that's too new, like a current event that hasn't made it far
         enough in the information cycle yet. Whatever the reason, if you've exhausted every available
         avenue and there truly is no information on your topic of interest, this may be a sign that you
         need to stop what you're doing and change your topic.

    4. You're getting overwhelmed
         The opposite of not finding enough information on your topic is finding too much. You want to
         collect it all, read through it all, and evaluate it all to make sure you have exactly what you need.
         But now you're running out of room on your flash drive, your Dropbox account is getting full,
         and you don't know how you're going to sort through it all and look for more. The solution: stop
         looking. Go through what you have. If you find what you need in what you already have, great! If
         not, you can always keep looking. You don't need to find everything in the first pass. There is
         plenty of opportunity to do more if more is needed!

From Theory to Practice
Looking back, the Our Virginia case is more complicated than it may have first appeared. It wasn't just
that the author based her writing on research done through the Internet. It was complicated by the
nature of the sources she used as well as the effect using those sources ultimately had on the quality of
her own work. These mistakes happened despite a formal editing process that should have ensured
better accuracy and an approval process by the school board that should have evaluated the material
more closely. With both of these processes having failed, it was up to one of the book's readers, the
parent of a student who compared the information against her own specialized knowledge, to figure it
all out.

                                                                                                                            6.8
Now that you know more about the theory behind evaluating sources, it's time to apply the theory. The
following section will help you put source evaluation into perspective using something called the CRAAP
test. You'll also have the opportunity to try out your new skills with several hands-on activities.

The CRAAP Test

When you begin evaluating sources, what should you consider? The CRAAP test is a series of common
evaluative elements you can use. The CRAAP test was developed by librarians at California State
University at Chico and it gives you a good overall set of elements to look for when evaluating a
resource. Let's consider what each of these evaluative elements means.

Currency
One of the most important and interesting steps to take as you begin researching a subject is selecting
the resources that will help you build your thesis and support your assertions. Certain topics require you
to pay special attention to how current your resource is--because they are time sensitive, because they
have evolved so much over the years, or because new research comes out on the topic so frequently.
When evaluating the currency of an article, consider the following:

     When was the item written and how frequently does the publication it is in come out?
     Is there evidence of newly added or updated information in the item?
     If the information is dated, is it still suitable for your topic?
     How frequently does information change about your topic?
Relevance
Understanding what resources are most applicable to your subject and why they are applicable can help
you focus and refine your thesis. Many topics are broad and searching for information on them
produces a wide range of resources. Narrowing your topic and focusing on resources specific to your
needs can help reduce the piles of information and help you focus in on what is truly important to read
and reference. When determining relevance consider the following:

     Does the item contain information relevant to your argument or thesis?
     Read the article's introduction, thesis and conclusion.
     Scan main headings and identify article keywords.
     For book resources, start with the index or table of contents--how wide a scope does the item

         have? Will you use part or all of this resource?
     Does the information presented support or refute your ideas?
     If the information refutes your ideas, how will this change your argument?
     Does the material provide you with current information?
     What is the material's intended audience?

                                                                                                                            6.9
Authority
Understanding more about your information's source helps you determine when, how, and where to
use that information. Is your author an expert on the subject? Do they have some personal stake in the
argument they are making? What is the author or information producer's background? When
determining the authority of your source, consider the following:

     What are the author's credentials?
     What is the author's level of education, experience, and/or occupation?
     What qualifies the author to write about this topic?
     What affiliations does the author have? Could these affiliations affect their position?
     What organization or body published the information? Is it authoritative? Does it have an

         explicit position or bias?
Accuracy
Determining where information comes from, if the evidence supports the information, and if the
information has been reviewed or refereed can help you decide how and whether to use a source.
When determining the accuracy of a source, consider the following:

     Is the source well-documented? Does it include footnotes, citations or a bibliography?
     Is information in the source presented as fact, opinion or propaganda? Are biases clear?
     Can you verify information from referenced information in the source?
     Is the information written clearly and free of typographical and grammatical mistakes? Does the

         source look to be edited before publication? A clean, well-presented paper does not always
         indicate accuracy, but usually at least means more eyes have been on the information.
Purpose
Knowing why information was created is a key to evaluation. Understanding the reason or purpose of
the information, if the information has clear intentions, or if the information is fact, opinion or
propaganda will help you decide how and why to use information. When determining the purpose of a
source, consider the following:

     Is the author's purpose to inform, sell, persuade, or entertain?
     Does the source have an obvious bias or prejudice?
     Is the article presented from multiple points of view?
     Does the author omit important facts or data that might disprove their argument?
     Is the author's language informal, joking, emotional, or impassioned?
     Is the information clearly supported by evidence?

                                                                                                                           6.10
Conclusion

When you feel overwhelmed by the information you are finding, the CRAAP test can help you determine
which information is the most useful to your research topic. How you respond to what you find out
using the CRAAP test will depend on your topic. Maybe you want to use two overtly biased resources to
inform an overview of typical arguments in a particular field. Perhaps your topic is historical and
currency means the past hundred years rather than the past one or two years. Use the CRAAP test, be
knowledgeable about your topic, and you will be on your way to evaluating information efficiently and
well!

                         Using Sources in Your Paper3

Academic writing requires the use of signal phrases to properly embed quoted material and document
information. While basic signal phrases require the use of the author's name and a strong verb,
attribution tags emphasize different types of information related to the source in order to set up the
quoted material and can help shape your reader's response to the information presented. In
grammatical terms, an attribution tag can be viewed as an appositive, an adjectival clause following a
noun that modifies the noun and provides contextual information. In the following examples, the signal
phrases (appositives) are italicized:

         As Benjamin Franklin, one of the Founding Fathers, states, "Well done is better than well said."

         The campaign slogan, "Yes we can," was highly successful for Barack Obama, the 44th President
         of the United States.

What you have to say is more important than the passage you are citing, so you want the information
leading into your evidence/ support to work to your advantage. A basic signal phrase is a device used to
smoothly integrate quotations and paraphrases into your essay and consists of an author's name and an
active verb indicating how the author is presenting the material. It is important for beginning academic
writers to use signal phrases to clearly attribute textual evidence to an author and to avoid interrupting
the flow of an essay.

Referring to the Author within a Signal Phrase

In most instances, a signal phrase should contain only the last name of the author or authors of the
source text (as opposed to the author's first and last name). APA style guidelines require no reference to
a first name at any point in an essay and few if any gender specific pronouns. But in MLA papers, if you
are referring to an author for the first time in your essay, you should include that author's first name.
Any future signal phrase should refer to the author by last name only or with a pronoun when it's
perfectly clear to whom the pronoun refers. For example:4

     Ellen J. Langer observes, "For us to pay attention to something for any amount of time, the
         image must be varied" (39).

     Langer continues, "Thus, for students who have trouble paying attention the problem may be
         that they are following the wrong instructions" (39).

                                                                                                                           6.12
     She then states, "To pay constant, fixed attention to a thought or an image may be a kind of
         oxymoron" (39).

Notice how each signal phrase verb is followed by a comma, which is then followed by one space before
the opening quotation mark.

Varying Your Verbs

While it's important to use signal phrase verbs, you'll want to make sure that you vary them to avoid
repetition (rather than simply using "states" throughout your entire essay for example) in order to
maintain your readers' interest and to indicate the author's intended use of the excerpted material. See
below for examples of strong signal phrase verbs.

Acknowledges        Counters     Notes

Admits              Declares     Observes

Agrees              Denies       Points out

Argues              Disputes     Reasons

Asserts             Emphasizes   Refutes

Believes            Finds        Rejects

Claims              Illustrates  Reports

Compares            Implies      Responds

Confirms            Insists      Suggests

Comments            Maintains    Thinks

Contends            Mentions     Writes

Why Use Signal Phrases and Attributive Tags?

While many students may see attributive tags as filler, they can provide the audience with valuable
insight into how you, the writer, intend the quoted material to be read/viewed. In addition to setting up
the source evidence, attribution tags can also be used as meaningful transitions moving your readers
between your ideas and those of your support.

In most instances, the first time the author is mentioned in an MLA style essay, it is a good idea to
provide an attributive tag as well as the author's first and last name. When using APA style, list the
author's first initial and last name. Style will vary with studies including multiple authors.

While providing the author's credentials and title of the source are the most common attributions used,
there are others we should be aware of:

                                              6.13
Types of Attributive Tags (attributive tag is underlined in each example)

Type: Author's credentials are indicated.
Example: Grace Chapmen, Curator of Human Health & Evolutionary Medicine at the Springfield Natural
History Museum, explains...
Purpose: Presenting an author's credentials should help build credibility for the passage you are about
to present. Including the author's credentials gives your readers a reason to consider your sources.

Type: Author's lack of credentials is indicated.
Example: Matthew Spencer, whose background is in marriage counseling, not foreign policy, claims...
Purpose: Identifying an author's lack of credentials in a given area can help illustrate a lack of authority
on the subject matter and persuade the audience not to adopt the author's ideas. Pointing to an
author's lack of credentials can be beneficial when developing your response to counterarguments.

Type: Author's social or political stance, if necessary to the content, is explained.
Example: Employing nonviolent civil disobedience, Roland Hayes, prominent civil rights activist,
preaches... Ralph Spencer, who has ties to the White Nationalist movement, denies...
Purpose: Explaining the author's social or political stance can help a reader to understand why that
author expresses a particular view. This understanding can positively or negatively influence an
audience. Be careful to avoid engaging in logical fallacies such as loaded language,

Type: Publisher of the source is identified.
Example: According to a recent CNN poll...
Purpose: Identifying the publisher of the passage can help reinforce the credibility of the information
presented and you can capitalize on the reputation/ credibility of the publisher of the source material.

Type: Title of the Source is included.
Example: In "Understanding Human Behavior," Riley argues ...
Purpose: Informs the reader where the cited passage is being pulled from.

Type: Information that establishes context is presented.
Example: In a speech presented during a Free Speech rally, Elaine Wallace encourages ...
Purpose: Presenting the context that the original information was presented can help the audience
understand the author's purpose more clearly

Quoting5

What are Direct Quotes?

summarizing-to-avoid-plagiarism/.

                                                                                                                           6.14
Direct quotes are portions of a text taken word for word and placed inside of a work. Readers know
when an author is using a direct quote because it is denoted by the use of quotation marks and an in-
text citation.6

Example:

In his seminal work, David Bartholomae argues that "Every time a student sits down to
write for us, he has to invent the university for the occasion-invent the university "(4).

Direct quotes might also be formatted as a "block quote" which occurs if the borrowed language is
longer than four (4) lines of text. In MLA, A block quote requires the author to indent the borrowed
language by 1/2 an inch, place the citation at the end of the block, and remove quotation marks.

Example:

In his seminal work, David Bartholomae argues that

         Every time a student sits down to write for us, he has to invent the university for
         the occasion-invent the university, that is, or a branch of it, like History or
         Anthropology or Economics or English. He has to learn to speak our language, to
         speak as we do, to try on the peculiar ways of knowing, selecting, evaluating,
         reporting, concluding, and arguing that define the discourse of our community. (4).

Be sure to be careful when using direct quotes because failing to write the text exactly as it appears in
the original is not an ethical use of direct quotes. Also, failing to bracket the quote with quotation marks
and/or citing it inside the text is also unethical and both mistakes are a form of plagiarism.

When Should I Use Direct Quotes?
Generally speaking, direct quotes should be used sparingly because you want to rely on your own
understanding of material and avoid over-relying on another's words - you want your voice to be the
dominant one in an argument. Over quoting does not reinforce your credibility as an author; however,
according to the Purdue Online Writing Lab (OWL) you should use direct quotes when "the author you
are quoting has coined a term unique to her or his research and relevant within your own paper."

The Basics of Directly Quoting

    1. All quoted material should be enclosed in quotation marks to set it off from the rest of the text.
         The exception to this is block quotes, which require different formatting.

6 The following examples come from: Bartholomae, David. "Inventing the University." Journal of Basic Writing, vol.
5, no. 3, 1986, pp. 4-23.

                                                                                                                           6.15
    2. Quoted material should be an accurate word-for-word reproduction from the author's original
         text. You cannot alter any wording or any spelling. If you must do so, you must use a bracket or
         an ellipsis (see number 2 in the section below).

    3. A clear signal phrase/attribution tag should precede each quotation.

    4. A parenthetical citation should follow each quotation.

The Hard Part of Directly Quoting: Integrating Quotes into Your Writing
As the author of your essay, you should explain the significance of each quotation to your reader. This
goes far beyond simply including a signal phrase. Explaining the significance means indicating how the
quoted material supports the point you are making in that paragraph. Remember, just because you add
a quote does not mean that you have made your point. Quotes never speak for themselves. When
quoting material, ask yourself how and why does that quoted material make the point you think it does?
Below are some helpful phrases for explaining quoted materials where "X" represents the author's last
name:

    1. (quoted material). What X's point demonstrates is that . . .
    2. (quoted material). Here, X is not simply stating _________, she is also demonstrating

         _________.
    3. (quoted material). This is an example of _________because ______________.
    4. (quoted material). This statement clearly shows _________because __________.

Sometimes, in order to smoothly integrate quoted material into your paper, you may need to remove a
word or add a word to make the quote make sense. If you make any change to quoted material, it must
be formatted correctly using an ellipsis or brackets. In the following, a portion of Hamlet's "To Be, or Not
To Be" soliloquy is used as the exemplar:

                   Original quote: "To be, or not to be, that is the question"

              a. Use brackets [these are brackets] to change a word
                       i. As Hamlet states, "To be, or not to be, that is the [essential] question."

              b. Use an ellipsis (this is an ellipsis...) to indicate omissions in the middle of a quote
                       i. As Hamlet states, "To be, or not to be ... is the question."

When in doubt, strive to allow your voice - not a quote from a source - to begin each paragraph,
precede each quote, follow each quote, and end each paragraph. Quotes that are integrated well into a
paper allow you to control the paper. That is what a reader wants to see: your ideas and the way that
you engage sources to shape and discuss your ideas.7

Paraphrasing and Summarizing8

While quoting may be the first thing that many people think of when they think about integrating
sources, paraphrasing, summarizing, and citing data are also ways to incorporate information from
outside materials into your essays or projects.

Paraphrasing
    1. Paraphrases allow you to describe specific information from a source (ideas from a paragraph or
         several consecutive paragraphs) in your own words.
    2. Paraphrases are like translations of an author' original idea. You retain the detail of the original
         thought, but you express it in your own way.
    3. Paraphrases of the text should be expressed in your own words, with your own sentence
         structure, in your own way. You should not simply "word swap"; that is, replace a few words
         from the original with synonyms .
    4. If you must use a few of the author's words within your paraphrase, they must have quotation
         marks around them.
    5. Paraphrases often include attributive tags (or signal phrases) to let your readers know where the
         paraphrased material begins.
    6. Paraphrased material should be followed by a parenthetical citation.
    7. As with a quote, you need to explain to your reader why the paraphrased material is significant
         to the point you are making in your paper.

Summarizing
    1. Summaries allow you to describe general ideas from a source. You do not express detailed
         information as you would with a paraphrase.
    2. Summaries are shorter than the original text.
    3. Any summaries of the text should not include direct wording from the original source. All text
         should be in your words, though the ideas are those of the original author.
    4. A signal phrase should let your readers know where the summarized material begins.
    5. If you are offering a general summary of an entire article, there is no need to cite a specific page
         number.

The Terror of Voice
I like order. I love the comfort of a beautiful and functional Excel spreadsheet. I organize my CDs by
genre and then alphabetically by artist. I eat three meals a day.

But my love of order sometimes butts heads with my love of writing. That's because no matter how
much attention I pay to following the rules of writing, I know that to produce writing that astounds
readers--moving them, making them gasp, enticing them--I'll have to include more than just correct
writing. I'll need to find a way to make my voice present.

And sometimes, that terrifies me with the uncertainty of it all. I sometimes wish writing excellently were
like working in Excel. I know I can make a spreadsheet absolutely perfect if my formulas are coded
properly and my data is lined up correctly. Writing excellently is messier than that: it means admitting
the difficult truth that even when everything in my essay follows all the grammatical and mechanical
rules, my writing can still lack qualities that will make my readers' eyes pop out of their heads with
delightful surprise.

I often tell my students that the difference between A-level and B-level writing is voice. In other words,
essays often deserve B's even when they have perfect punctuation and grammar, an intriguing concept,
brilliant ideas, excellent and well-integrated sources, and a Works Cited page that would earn a standing
ovation at the annual MLA convention. An essay can have all of those things but still feel dry and
voiceless, reading like a dying man trudging through the desert, sandal-slap after sandal-slap, lifeless
sentence after lifeless sentence.

So What is Voice in Writing?
"Voice" is a weird term, right? We usually say your voice is the quality of how you sound when you talk
out loud--but aren't we talking about writing?

First, let's think about everything that makes your speaking voice distinctive. It has its own aural quality,
formed by the size of your mouth, throat, and tongue, along with your distinctive habits of how you use
your body to manipulate the sound of the air exhaling from your lungs.

But beyond the sounds your body naturally produces through your mouth, you also have your own way
of choosing words, and that's part of your voice, too. You have words you use more often than others,
phrases you rely on, and ways you make the musical tone of your voice go up and down in distinct ways.
All of those choices are partly based on how you learned to speak in your family and culture, and they're
partly based on what you bring to the table as an individual. Sometimes you just let out whatever you're

thinking, and sometimes you pause to consider how you want to sound.

Don't miss that: qualities of spoken voice are, to some extent, chosen. Depending on where and when
and with whom we're speaking, our voice can change.

Now let's turn to writing. I would define voice in writing as the quality of writing that gives readers the
impression that they are hearing a real person, not a machine. Voice in writing is therefore multifaceted:
it's partly an unconscious, natural ring that dwells in the words you write, but it's also related to the
words you choose (stuffy and overused or fresh and appealing?), the phrases you rely on (dictionary-like
or lively?), and how you affect your readers' emotions (bored or engaged?). And it's not something that
is magically there for some writers and not there for others. Voice is something that can be cultivated,
practiced, watered, even designed.

I'm reminded of a quote from poet D.A. Powell, which I heard on the trailer for a documentary called
Bad Writing. He says, "Bad art is that which does not succeed in cleansing the language of its dead--
stinking dead--usages of the past" (MorrisHillPictures). Voice in writing is like that: it gives readers the
sense that they're hearing a fresh, cleansed voice unlike any they've heard before.

The writing in this documentary is called "bad" because of its lack of an authentic voice.

We Need Voice in Academic Writing, Too
A common misconception among writers is that writing for college, especially in a fancy-looking,
citation-filled essay, should have the complexity and difficulty of Pride and Prejudice: "She is all affability
and condescension, and I doubt not but you will be honoured with some portion of her notice when
service is over" (Austen). That is, we sometimes assume that academic writing is where we say things
with big words and in roundabout ways that seem sort of something like what we imagine talk is like
around a gilded dinner table in a palace, somewhere.

I think this assumption is wrong. Even when reading essays that were written for college classes, readers
don't want to be bored or confused. They want liveliness; they want voice. Listen to veteran writing
teacher Donald Graves use all of his cute-old-man powers to beg you to use your personal voice in even
your standardized writing tests:

Donald Graves on the importance of putting voice in your writing

I recently taught a class that focused entirely on blogging for the first thirteen weeks of the course,
followed by a final academic essay at the end of the semester. Students regularly asked me what style
they should adopt in their final essay, how formal to be, what kind of voice to adopt. To most of the
students, my reply was, "Write it how you wrote your blog!" To which almost all of them said, "Huh?
That was informal. This is formal." To which I said, "You're partly right. You paid less attention to details
when you were blogging, sure, but your voices were there. You used sentences that sounded like you!
They were resonant! I was moved! Do you hear the italics in my voice? That's how good your writing
was! So don't lose that by putting on a new coat of formality when it doesn't fit well!" As the one who

                                                                                                                           6.19
was going to read their academic essays, I was afraid that I was going to get a bunch of essays that
sounded like Pride and Prejudice, with big words and roundabout sentence constructions. I wanted big,
complex ideas in these final essays, but I also wanted stylistic liveliness, sentences that made me sit up
straight and open my eyes wide. I admit that after the students had written first drafts of their essays, I
backed off a little, and we talked about the ways that formal writing situations do indeed demand a
different kind of voice than a blog post--but I was always insistent that no writing situation called for
bored readers.

You should know this: teachers talk about their students. And I've heard the following story, or some
variant of it, something like twenty times: "My student wrote this awful draft that confused me to no
end. So I emailed the student and told him to come in to my office to talk about it. And he gets there to
my office and I say, `What are you trying to say on page 2?' and he explains it, and--get this!--he
explains it in this beautifully clear language, and it becomes clear that he knew all along what he wanted
to talk about and how to defend it and even how his ideas relate to his sources. So I asked him, `Why
didn't you write it that way? Why don't you write the way you talk?' and you know what he says? He
says, `Because I thought I was supposed to write formally.' I swear, sometimes I think students get into
more trouble trying to write formally than it's worth."

I'm serious. Every semester, I hear that story.

Of course, I see the other side: there's a place for formality in a lot of writing. Depending on the
circumstance, sometimes our most formal coat is indeed what we need to wear. In your future college
classes, you might not get much of an idea from your professor about what kind of coat she expects you
to wear, so you'll probably have to do some asking. ("Dear Professor X, I'm baffled about what kind of
voice to use in my essay. For example, may I write the word baffled? Please send examples. Sincerely,
Judy Jetson.")

My favorite trick here is one I learned from a small writing textbook called They Say, I Say: purposefully
mixing the formal and informal in a single sentence or two. If you want to talk about something using a
formal term, which is often a good idea in formal writing, use the formal term but then turn around and
say it again informally. Like this: "Spoken voice is affected by our use of the epithelium, the vocal
ligament, and the vocalis muscle. We've got a lot of ways to make sound." The authors of They Say, I Say
remind us that "translating the one type of language into the other, the specialized into the everyday,
can help drive home a point" (Graff, Birkenstein, and Durst 118).

That leads me to the stuff you're probably here for: actual ideas about how to get this elusive thing
called voice into your writing.

Suggestions

1. Trust the gush--but then come back to the gush with a critical eye.

In one of my favorite articles about voice in writing, writing scholar Tom Romano tells the story of a

                                                                                                                           6.20
student who turned in a piece of paper with the words "TRUST THE GUSH" messily scribbled on it.
Romano expounds on what the phrase means to him:

            Trusting the gush means moving on the heat quickening in you.

            Trusting the gush means being fearless with language.

            Trusting the gush means writing about what you are emotionally moved by and perhaps don't
            even know why.

            Trusting the gush means putting onto the page those thoughts, connections, and perceptions
            that stand ready to be uttered. (51)

It's beautiful advice that feels true to me. I've had times where I turn off the screen of my computer and
write with no visual reference, letting words gush out of me in their most natural, voice-filled way.

But remember how I said that voice isn't just natural, it's also constructed for specific occasions? My
gush is usually full of some good, usable words, phrases, and sentences, but it's also a big, gushy mess.
So that's when I back away for a bit of time (more than a day, if possible), returning later to my gush in
search of the lines that seem most lively, most full of voice, the ones that fit best into my current writing
context.

2. Don't be afraid to use some of speech's informalities, but always punctuate them in formal ways.

Sometimes students ask if they can use contractions in their academic essays, and I always say yes--but
then I regret it when I get "theyre not understanding" and "he said your not smart enough" in submitted
work. But on the flip side, I find I'm more willing to be lenient with student writing that is slightly too
informal for my taste when the writer shows that she knows what she's doing with her punctuation. Life
is like that, you know? If you take one step of goodwill (knowing your punctuation), people want to give
you lenience in other areas (accepting informality, even if it seems to step over the line).

This advice extends to colons (never mistaking them for semicolons and never using a hyphen as a
colon), em-dashes (using them wisely and punctuating them perfectly, as two hyphens between two
words and no spaces at all), and commas (especially when someone is being addressed, as in "I agree,
Mr. President" and when introducing a quotation immediately after a verb, such as when I write,
"Yessiree").

3. Read your work aloud--and don't be afraid to have fun with it.

I tell students to read their stuff aloud all the time, and usually I get a scared, silent look in return. (I
think this look might mean, "Do you have any idea how stupid I would look if someone walked in while I
was talking to myself?") Well, fine--play around with it:

     Read your own stuff aloud to yourself. I like to do this after printing it out. Listen for places
         where you stumble, where you seem to be saying the same word over and over, where you

                                                                                                                           6.21
         think you might be boring. Peter Elbow justifies this well:

            I find that when students have the repeated experience of reading their writing aloud, they
            are more likely to write sentences that are inviting and comfortable to recite--which in turn
            makes the sentences better for readers who get them in silence. Putting this differently, the
            sound of written words when spoken is a crucial benefit for silent readers, yet too few
            students hear the words they write. When they have to read their writing aloud frequently
            and thus hear it, they tend to listen more as they write--and readers hear more meaning as
            they read. (5)

     Have someone else read your stuff aloud to you, with another copy in front of yourself to follow
         along with and mark spots that feel voiceless. Ask your friend what sounded best, what s/he
         remembers most on the sentence level, and/or where it sounded like you.

     Play The Boring Game: have three people sit down, each with a piece of paper with a line drawn
         through the middle; this is The Boring Line. Make one person the timekeeper. Start reading your
         essay out loud to them, and ask the timekeeper to raise his hand every thirty seconds. At those
         moments, the readers all make a dot on the paper to show how bored they are; a dot way
         above the boring line means they're absolutely engaged, as if beautiful aliens had just
         transported into the room, while a dot way below the boring line means they're wondering why
         they agreed to play the stupid boring game with you. After the essay is done, ask them to
         connect the dots, showing you a line of where they were relatively more or less bored. Talk to
         them to help identify what parts of the essay bored them; you probably didn't have much voice
         in those spots.

4. Surprise Your Readers

I'm serious: make sure that throughout your piece, every once in a while you throw in a word or phrase
that makes you think, "I bet they never saw that one coming!" (In this piece that you're reading now,
one of my attempts at that is my first heading, "The Terror of Voice." I'm counting on readers thinking,
"Wait, the terror of voice? . . . I'm confused! I'd better read on to figure out what he means!")

My guess is that with a little practice, this won't be too hard to achieve. You could read through a draft
of something and highlight (either on paper or the computer) every place where you think you're
breaking the expectation of your reader in a surprising way, whether because of the topic you chose to
dive into or because of a phrase or sentence they might not have seen coming. Then you skim back
through and find places without any highlights around, and try to work something in there.

As with most of my suggestions, this can backfire if you take it too far, which is why I think playing The
Boring Game (above) is so important, so you can feel out your choices with real people. Obviously, your
readers will be surprised if you start slamming sexually explicit words onto the screen, but that's clearly
not the kind of voice I'm talking about. Less dramatically, I've been in situations where I go for a strong,
surprising personal voice and later discover (on my own, or with the help of someone else) that it's just

                                                                                                                           6.22
not working for that audience.

This happened to me recently when I was writing a piece about integrating sources into essays. I worked
up this detailed analogy involving Jane Austen, gardens, statues, and helicopters (seriously), and I even
kept the analogy through a few drafts. But a friend, whom I had asked to read my draft, told me she was
a little confused by the whole thing. At first I ignored her--I was being surprising! There were
helicopters--helicopters! But eventually, I realized she was right; I had to back down and rework my
surprising analogy into something that just plain made more sense. The revised version was still
surprising (involving Spider-Man), but it was surprising and it worked. There's a difference.

5. Use Rhetorical Figures to Help Shape Your Sentences

Sometimes we hear or read something and say, "Wow, there was so much power in those words!" And
sometimes, we fall for a common lie: we think that powerful speakers and writers are just plain born
that way, that their skill comes from some indefinable something that they have and we don't.

I like rhetorical figures because they expose that thinking as a lie.

Since the days of classical Greece and Rome, instructors in rhetoric have realized that this lie existed, so
they formulated organized ways of figuring out what exactly makes some speaking and writing feel so
powerful. They labeled these terms and encouraged their students to try using these sentence forms in
their own sentences. Here are some examples, all of which are direct quotes from Silva Rhetoricae: The
Forest of Rhetoric, an awesome site at https://rhetoric.byu.edu/ (Burton):

     anaphora: Repetition of the same word or group of words at the beginning of successive
         clauses, sentences, or lines. Example: This blessed plot, this earth, this realm, this England, / This
         nurse, this teeming womb of royal kings.

     asyndeton: The omission of conjunctions between clauses, often resulting in a hurried rhythm or
         vehement effect. Example: Veni, vidi, vici (Caesar: "I came; I saw; I conquered")

     epitasis: The addition of a concluding sentence that merely emphasizes what has already been
         stated. Example: Clean your bedroom. All of it.

These and dozens of others are available at Silva Rhetoricae and at the (somewhat more manageable)
American Rhetoric site, especially the page on "Rhetorical Figures in Sound" (Eidenmuller).

The idea is to force yourself to try setting up a sentence or two following the guidelines of one of the
rhetorical figures, and then to sit back and gauge the result for yourself. Often, I think you'll be
impressed with how excellent you sound, with a very present and powerful tone of voice.

The Terror of Practice
In the end, there's one more terrifying thing about writing with voice: it's unlikely that you'll see a huge
change without lots of practice. And that means lots of writing. And that means time. Which you might
not have.

                                                                                                                           6.23
So I'm closing with a word of moderation. To see a change in your writing voice in just a short semester,
you'll need to think about voice in every piece of writing you do. Shooting off a quick Blackboard forum
response? Try using a rhetorical figure. Confirming a meeting time with a friend over text message? Try
to surprise her with an unexpected phrase. Writing an in-class essay? Read it over slowly in your head,
paying careful attention to how it would sound if you read it out loud. (Or, if your teacher lets you, just
read it out loud there in the classroom. This is unlikely.) Writing an essay draft that feels like busy-work?
Play around with how you might perfectly punctuate some informal language (and don't be afraid to ask
your teacher if you did it correctly).
Even though a YouTube search for "voice in writing" will give you lots of good advice--including one
devastatingly cute video of young kids baking brownies while the "Word Chef" talks about what makes
for a strong voice in a book about a cockroach (teachertubewriting)--there really is no substitute for
practice. Thinking about writing is never, ever the same as practicing writing.
And most of all, breathe. Our voice comes from our breath, the life that flows from our bodies into the
minds of our listeners. Shape it, practice it, use it for good. (That's asyndeton--did you catch it?)10

Section 7: Researched Writing

                                   Introduction

While in high school, chances are you were assigned a research paper at some point. You may have had
to find your own resources for supporting a chosen topic or your teacher may have provided resources
to you for analysis. These methodologies are excellent ways to introduce you to the concept of research.
However, now that you are in college, you will be expected to do more of the preliminary work
(eventually all) on your own; so how do you start? What makes a good research topic? How do you find
the right sources when there are literally millions of hits on a given Google search?

In this section, we help you find answers to this process as well as model ways to locate sources. Keep in
mind that you can always consult your librarians for help - that's what they want to do. But the elements
in this section will provide a foundation for research strategies and ways to support your chosen topic.

                      Developing a Research Question1

I write out of ignorance. I write about the things I don't have any resolutions for, and when I'm finished, I
think I know a little bit more about it. I don't write out of what I know. It's what I don't know that
stimulates me. I merely know enough to get started. --Toni Morrison2

Think of a research paper as an opportunity to deepen (or create!) knowledge about a topic that matters
to you. Just as Toni Morrison states that she is stimulated by what she doesn't yet know, a research
paper assignment can be interesting and meaningful if it allows you to explore what you don't know.

Research, at its best, is an act of knowledge creation, not just an extended book report. This knowledge
creation is the essence of any great educational experience. Instead of just listening to lectures, you get
to design the learning project that will ultimately result in you experiencing, and then expressing, your
own intellectual growth. You get to read what you choose, thereby becoming an expert on your topic.

That sounds, perhaps, like a lofty goal. But by spending some quality time brainstorming, reading,
thinking or otherwise tuning into what matters to you, you can end up with a workable research topic
that will lead you on an enjoyable research journey.

The best research topics are meaningful to you

Brainstorming Ideas for a Research Topic

There are many ways to come up with a good topic. The best thing to do is to give yourself time to think
about what you really want to commit days and weeks to reading, thinking, researching, more reading,
writing, more researching, reading and writing on.

It can be difficult to come up with a topic from scratch, so consider looking at some information sources
can give you some ideas. Check out your favorite news sources, or take a look at a library database like
CQ Researcher or Point of Review Reference Center.

Which question(s) below interest you? Which question(s) below spark a desire to respond? A good topic
is one that moves you to think, to do, to want to know more, to want to say more.

As you browse, ask yourself some of the following questions:

    1. What news stories do you often see, but want to know more about?
    2. What (socio-political) argument do you often have with others that you would love to work on

         strengthening?
    3. What are the key controversies or current debates in the field of work that you want to go into?
    4. What is a problem that you see at work that needs to be better publicized or understood?
    5. What is the biggest issue facing [specific group of people: by age, by race, by gender, by

         ethnicity, by nationality, by geography, by economic standing? choose a group]
    6. What area/landmark/piece of history in your home community are you interested in?
    7. What local problem do you want to better understand?
    8. Is there some element of the career that you would like to have one day that you want to better

         understand?
    9. What would you love to become an expert on?
    10. What are you passionate about?

                                                                                                                            7.2
From Topic to Research Question

Once you have decided on a research topic, an area for academic exploration that matters to you, it is
time to start thinking about what you want to learn about that topic.
The goal of college-level research assignments is never going to be to simply "go find sources" on your
topic. Instead, think of sources as helping you to answer a research question or a series of research
questions about your topic. These should not be simple questions with simple answers, but rather
complex questions about which there is no easy or obvious answer.
A compelling research question is one that may involve controversy, or may have a variety of answers,
or may not have any single, clear answer. All of that is okay and even desirable. If the answer is an easy
and obvious one, then there is little need for argument or research.
Make sure that your research question is clear, specific, researchable and limited (but not too limited).
Most of all, make sure that you are curious about your own research question. If it does not matter to
you, researching it will feel incredibly boring and tedious.

                                                                                                                            7.3
                          Researched Position Paper3

Now that you have found a topic to research, it is time to begin the research process. Though you may
have an idea of what you think your argument will be at this point, it's important to start your research
with an open mind. It's often helpful to formulate your topic as a research question. Research questions
are open-ended questions that you explore as you figure out the direction your topic will go and inform
or shape your thesis statement. For example, if your topic is on first-generation students and financial
aid, you might have a research question such as "What is the long-term impact of student loans on first-
generation college students?" Using such a question as you begin your research leaves you a lot of
flexibility to adjust your position, and therefore your thesis, as you uncover new information.

Using that research question as the foundation for your research, you can begin your proposal. This is
oftentimes the first step in the process of writing a researched position paper. Basically, a researched
position paper is one where you take a stance on a chosen topic and defend your position with
qualitative and quantitative research found in scholarly or academic sources. While you might also
include popular sources, you'll want to make certain you incorporate evidence from a body of scholars
whose work can be used to support the position you are taking. The difference between a descriptive or
narrative research paper and a position paper is the argument - you are doing more than simply
reporting facts. In a researched position paper, you are placing yourself in dialogue with a scholarly
community and taking a stance on a topic about which you feel strongly. The first formal step is the
proposal.

A proposal is quite simply a method for thinking out loud on paper. While all instructors have their own
specifications, typically a proposal is less formal than the rough draft and can range in length from ½-1
full page in length. In the proposal, you state the topic about which you are researching and why you are
interested in it. Since this is the preliminary stage, it's okay to say that you do not know if you can
defend your chosen position. The proposal is the place to begin exploration. It's a good place to talk
about your research question and, based on the information that you've found so far, where your thesis
begins to grow. Some instructors may ask that you also state what you know about the topic, what
potential sources you might use, and what you think you need to learn before fully developing your
selected topic. In my courses, the proposal serves as a written dialogue between my students and
myself and provides some foundational plans for the research process.

The next step is the annotated bibliography. Later in this section, we detail for you how to write an
annotated bibliography which is basically the step where you locate sources to defend your position and
then summarize those sources for their strengths and weaknesses as applied to your topic.

After the annotated bibliography, the formal writing process begins with a first rough draft. Typically,
you will be given a page length or word count specification within the assignment parameters so that
you'll have an idea of how much is expected of you at this stage. In the first rough draft, your focus
should be on developing your thesis and supporting it throughout the body of your paper. While many

students get stuck on the introduction, this isn't really the place to start your research. For this stage of
the paper, you want to make sure the content surrounding your topic is strong with topic sentences
connecting back to the thesis in every paragraph.
Sometimes, your instructor may ask for a second rough draft before final submission. If so, this is the
place for you take feedback from a peer review or writing center tutor and fine tune your essay. Use the
feedback you receive to check that your position is consistently supported throughout the essay and
that you are using evidence correctly to support your position. Reading the draft out loud can also help
you find missing elements or spaces for enrichment before the final draft submission.
The final draft will be your best polished effort at defending your chosen topic and position after going
through the rhetorical strategies defined by your instructor. Depending upon style format, you may or
may not need an abstract in the final draft. An abstract is a brief summary of the topic you are discussing
in the paper but it does not give your conclusion. At the end of your final draft you'll need to include
your Works Cited/References page. This will be easily compiled from your annotated bibliography but
remember - the annotations do NOT go into the final Works Cited/References page. Only the citations
are included in the final draft. Keep in mind that nothing is ever perfect, but you want to strive to
present a solid essay that utilizes scholarly sources to defend and support the position you are taking on
your chosen topic. For the rest of this section, we will provide information on how to find the best
sources for your paper as well as how to develop the annotated bibliography.

                       Developing a Research Strategy4

Sarah's art history professor just assigned the course project and Sarah is delighted that it isn't the
typical research paper. Rather, it involves putting together a website to help readers understand a topic.
It will certainly help Sarah get a grasp on the topic herself! Learning by attempting to teach others, she
agrees, might be a good idea. The professor wants the web site to be written for people who are
interested in the topic and with backgrounds similar to the students in the course. Sarah likes that a
target audience is defined, and since she has a good idea of what her friends might understand and
what they would need more help with, she thinks it will be easier to know what to include in her site.
Well, at least easier than writing a paper for an expert like her professor.

An interesting feature of this course is that the professor has formed the students into teams. Sarah
wasn't sure she liked this idea at the beginning, but it seems to be working out okay. Sarah's team has
decided that their topic for this website will be 19th century women painters. But her teammate Chris
seems concerned, "Isn't that an awfully big topic?" The team checks with the professor, who agrees they
would be taking on far more than they could successfully explain on their website. He suggests they
develop a draft thesis statement to help them focus, and after several false starts, they come up with:

The involvement of women painters in the Impressionist movement had an effect upon the subjects
portrayed.

They decide this sounds more manageable. Because Sarah doesn't feel comfortable on the technical
aspects of setting up the website, she offers to start locating resources that will help them to develop
the site's content.

The next time the class meets, Sarah tells her teammates what she has done so far:

"I thought I'd start with some scholarly sources, since they should be helpful, right? I put a search into
the online catalog for the library, but nothing came up! The library should have books on this topic,
shouldn't it? I typed the search in exactly as we have it in our thesis statement. That was so frustrating.
Since that didn't work, I tried Google, and put in the search. I got over 8 million results, but when I
looked over the ones on the first page, they didn't seem very useful. One was about the feminist art
movement in the 1960s, not during the Impressionist period. The results all seemed to have the words I
typed highlighted, but most really weren't useful. I am sorry I don't have much to show you. Do you
think we should change our topic?"

Alisha suggests that Sarah talk with a reference librarian. She mentions that a librarian came to talk to

one of her other classes about doing research, and it was really helpful. Alisha thinks that maybe Sarah
shouldn't have entered the entire thesis statement as the search, and maybe she should have tried
databases to find articles. The team decides to brainstorm all the search tools and resources they can
think of.

Here's what they came up with:

            Search Tools and Resources

            Wikipedia

            Professor

            Google search

            JSTOR database

Based on your experience, do you see anything you would add?

Sarah and her team think that their list is pretty good. They decide to take it further and list the
advantages and limitations of each search tool, at least as far as they can determine.

                Search Tools and Resources

Search Tool     Advantages                       Limitations
Wikipedia       Easy access, list of references
Professor       The expert!                      Professors don't seem to like

                                                 We need a better search term

JSTOR database  Authoritative, scholarly articles None that we know of

Alisha suggests that Sarah should show the worksheet to a librarian and volunteers to go with her. The
librarian, Mr. Harrison, says they have made a really good start, but he can fill them in on some other
search strategies that will help them to focus on their topic. Would Sarah and Alisha like to learn more?

Let's step back from this case study again, and think about the elements that someone doing research

                                                                                                                            7.7
should plan before starting to enter search terms in Google, Wikipedia, or even a scholarly database.
There is some preparation you can do to make things go much more smoothly than they have for Sarah.

Self-Reflection

As you work through your own research quests, it is very important to be self-reflective. Consider:

     What do you really need to find?

     Do you need to learn more about the general subject before you can identify the focus of your
         search?

     How thoroughly did you develop your search strategy?

     Did you spend enough time finding the best tools to search?

     What is going really well, so well that you'll want to remember to do it in the future?

Another term for what you are doing is metacognition, or thinking about your thinking. Reflect on what
Sarah is going through. Does some of it sound familiar based on your own experiences? You may already
know some of the strategies presented here. Do you do them the same way? How does it work? What
pieces are new to you? When might you follow this advice? Don't just let the words flow over you,
rather think carefully about the explanation of the process. You may disagree with some of what you
read. If you do, follow through and test both methods to see which provides better results.

Selecting Search Tools

After you have thought the planning process through more thoroughly, think about the best place to
find information for your topic and for the type of paper. Part of planning to do research is determining
which search tools will be the best ones to use. This applies whether you are doing scholarly research or
trying to answer a question in your everyday life, such as what would be the best place to go on
vacation. "Search tools" might be a bit misleading, since a person might be the source of the information
you need. Or it might be a web search engine, a specialized database, an association--the possibilities
are endless. Often people automatically search Google first, regardless of what they are looking for.
Choosing the wrong search tool may just waste your time and provide only mediocre information,
whereas other sources might provide really spot-on information and quickly, too. In some cases, a
carefully constructed search on Google, particularly using the advanced search option, will provide the
necessary information, but other times it won't. This is true of all sources: make an informed choice
about which ones to use for a specific need.

So, how do you identify search tools? Let's begin with a first-rate method. For academic research,
talking with a librarian or your professor is a great start. They will direct you to those specialized tools
that will provide access to what you need. If you ask a librarian for help, they may also show you some
tips about searching in the resources. This section will cover some of the generic strategies that will
work in many search tools, but a librarian can show you very specific ways to focus your search and
retrieve the most useful items.

                                                                                                                            7.8
If neither your professor nor a librarian is available when you need help, take a look at the TAMU
LIbraries website. There is a Help button in the top right corner of the website that will direct you to
assistance via phone, chat, text, and email. Under the Guides button, you'll find class- and subject-
related guides that list useful databases and other resources for particular classes and majors to assist
researchers. There is also a directory of the databases the library subscribes to and the subjects they
cover. Take advantage of the expertise of librarians by using such guides. Novice researchers usually
don't think of looking for this type of help, and, as a consequence, often waste time.

When you are looking for non-academic material, consider who cares about this type of information.
Who works with it? Who produces it or help guides for it? Some sources are really obvious, and you are
already using them--for example, if you need information about the weather in London three days from
now, you might check Weather.com for London's forecast. You don't go to a library (in person or
online), and you don't do a research database search. For other information you need, think the same
way. Are you looking for anecdotal information on old railroads? Find out if there is an organization of
railroad buffs. You can search on the web for this kind of information, or, if you know about and have
access to it, you could check the Encyclopedia of Associations. This source provides entries for all U.S.
membership organizations, which can quickly lead you to a potentially wonderful source of information.
Librarians can point you to tools like these.

Consider Asking an Expert

Have you thought about using people, not just inanimate sources, as a way to obtain information? This
might be particularly appropriate if you are working on an emerging topic or a topic with local
connections. There are a variety of reasons that talking with someone will add to your research.

For personal interactions, there are other specific things you can do to obtain better results. Do some
background work on the topic before contacting the person you hope to interview. The more familiarity
you have with your topic and its terminology, the easier it will be to ask focused questions. Focused
questions are important if you want to get into the meat of what you need. Asking general questions
because you think the specifics might be too detailed rarely leads to the best information. Acknowledge
the time and effort someone is taking to answer your questions, but also realize that people who are
passionate about subjects enjoy sharing what they know. Take the opportunity to ask experts about
sources they would recommend.

Determining Search Concepts and Keywords

Once you've selected some good resources for your topic, and possibly talked with an expert, it is time
to move on to identify words you will used to search for information on your topic in various databases
and search engines. This is sometimes referred to as building a search query. When deciding what terms
to use in a search, break down your topic into its main concepts. Don't enter an entire sentence, or a full
question. Different databases and search engines process such queries in different ways, but many look
for the entire phrase you enter as a complete unit, rather than the component words. While some will
focus on just the important words, such as Sarah's Google search that you read about earlier in this
chapter, the results are often still unsatisfactory. The best thing to do is to use the key concepts involved

                                                                                                                            7.9
with your topic. In addition, think of synonyms or related terms for each concept. If you do this, you will
have more flexibility when searching in case your first search term doesn't produce any or enough
results. This may sound strange, since if you are looking for information using a Web search engine, you
almost always get too many results. Databases, however, contain fewer items, and having alternative
search terms may lead you to useful sources. Even in a search engine like Google, having terms you can
combine thoughtfully will yield better results.
The following worksheet is an example of a process you can use to come up with search terms. It
illustrates how you might think about the topic of violence in high schools. Notice that this exact phrase
is not what will be used for the search. Rather, it is a starting point for identifying the terms that will
eventually be used.

                                             Figure: Concept Brainstorming
Now, use a clean copy of the same worksheet to think about the topic Sarah's team is working on. How
might you divide their topic into concepts and then search terms? Keep in mind that the number of
concepts will depend on what you are searching for. And that the search terms may be synonyms or
narrower terms. Occasionally, you may be searching for something very specific, and in those cases, you
may need to use broader terms as well. Jot down your ideas then compare what you have written to the
information on the second, completed worksheet and identify 3 differences.

                                                                                                                           7.10

Boolean Operators

Once you have the concepts you want to search, you need to think about how you will enter them into
the search box. Often, but not always, Boolean operators will help you. You may be familiar with
Boolean operators as they provide a way to link terms. There are three Boolean operators: AND, OR, and
NOT.

We will start by capturing the ideas of the women creating the art. We will use women painters and
women artists as the first step in our sample search. You could do to two separate searches by typing
one or the other of the terms into the search box of whatever tool you are using:

                                                                                                                           7.12
                                             women painters women artists

You would end up with two separate result lists and have the added headache of trying to identify
unique items from the lists. You could also search on the phrase

                                          women painters AND women artists

But once you understand Boolean operators, that last strategy won't make as much sense as it seems to.
The first Boolean operator is AND. AND is used to get the intersection of all the terms you wish to
include in your search. With this example

                                          women painters AND women artists

you are asking that the items you retrieve have both of those terms. If an item only has one term, it
won't show up in the results. This is not what the searcher had in mind--she is interested in both artists
and painters, because she doesn't know which term might be used. She doesn't intend that both terms
have to be used. Let's go on to the next Boolean operator, which will help us out with this problem.

OR is used when you want at least one of the terms to show up in the search results. If both do, that's
fine, but it isn't a condition of the search. So OR makes a lot more sense for this search:

                                          women painters OR women artists

Now, if you want to get fancy with this search, you could use both AND as well as OR:

                                           women AND (painters OR artists)

The parentheses mean that these two concepts, painters and artists, should be searched as a unit, and
the search results should include all items that use one word or the other. The results will then be
limited to those items that contain the word women. If you decide to use parentheses for appropriate
searches, make sure that the items contained within them are related in some way. With OR, as in our
example, it means either of the terms will work. With AND, it means that both terms will appear in the
document.

Type both of these searches in Google Scholar (scholar.google.com) and compare the results. Were they
the same? If not, can you determine what happened? Which result list looked better?

Here is another example of a search string, using both parentheses and two Boolean operators:

                                   entrepreneurship AND (adolescents OR teens)

In this search, you are looking for entrepreneurial initiatives connected with people in their teens.
Because there are so many ways to categorize this age group, it makes sense to indicate that either of
these terms should appear in the results, along with entrepreneurship.

However, this search string isn't perfect. Can you pick out two problems with the search terms?

                                                                                                                           7.13
The third Boolean operator, NOT, can be problematic. NOT is used to exclude items from your search. If
you have decided, based on the scope of the results you are getting, to focus only on a specific aspect of
a topic, use NOT, but be aware that items are being lost in this search.

For example, if you entered

                            entrepreneurship AND (adolescents OR teens) NOT adults

you might lose some good results. Why?

Other Helpful Search Techniques

Using Boolean operators isn't the only way you can create more useful searches. In this section, we will
review several others.

Truncation

In this search:

                      entrepreneurs AND (adolescents OR teens)

you might think that the items that are retrieved from the search can refer to entrepreneurs and to
terms from the same root, like entrepreneurship. But because computers are very literal, they usually
look for the exact terms you enter. While some search engines, like Google, are moving beyond this
model, library databases tend to require more precision. Truncation, or searching on the root of a word
and whatever follows, is how you can tell the database to do this type of search.

So, if you search on

                      entrepreneur* AND (adolescents OR teens)

You will get items that refer to entrepreneur, but also entrepreneurship.

Look at these examples:

                                                   adolescen* educat*

Think of two or three words you might retrieve when searching on these roots. It is important to
consider the results you might get and alter the root if need be. An example of this is polic*. Would it be
a good idea to use this root if you wanted to search on policy or policies? Why or why not?

In some cases, a symbol other than an asterisk is used. To determine what symbol to use, check the help
section in whatever resource you are using. The topic should show up under the truncation or stemming
headings.

Phrase Searches

                                                                           7.14
Phrase searches are particularly useful when searching the web. If you put the exact phrase you want to
search in quotation marks, you will only get items with those words as a phrase and not items where the
words appear separately in a document, website, or other resource. Your results will usually be fewer,
although surprisingly, this is not always the case. Try these two searches in the search engine of your
choice:

                                                "essay exam" essay exam

Was there a difference in the quality and quantity of results? If you would like to find out if the database
or search engine you are using allows phrase searching and the conventions for doing so, search the
help section. These help tools can be very, well, helpful!

Advanced Searches
Advanced searching allows you to refine your search query and prompts you for ways to do this.
Consider the basic Google search box. It is very minimalistic, but that minimalism is deceptive. It gives
the impression that searching is easy and encourages you to just enter your topic, without much
thought, to get results. You certainly do get many results. But are they really good results? Simple search
boxes do many searchers a disfavor. There is a better way to enter searches.

Advanced search screens show you many of the options available to you to refine your search, and,
therefore, get more manageable numbers of better items. Many web search engines include advanced
search screens, as do databases for searching research materials. Advanced search screens will vary
from resource to resource and from web search engine to research database, but they often let you
search using

     Implied Boolean operators (for example, the "all the words" option is the same as using the
         Boolean and)

     Limiters for date, domain (.edu, for example), type of resource (articles, book reviews, patents)

     Field (a field is a standard element, such as title of publication or author's name)

     Phrase (rather than entering quote marks) Let's see how this works in practice.

Practical Application: Google Searches
Go to the advanced search option in Google. You can find it at http://www.google.
com/advanced_search

Take a look at the options Google provides to refine your search. Compare this to the basic Google
search box. One of the best ways you can become a better searcher for information is to use the power
of advanced searches, either by using these more complex search screens or by remembering to use
Boolean operators, phrase searches, truncation, and other options available to you in most search
engines and databases.

While many of the text boxes at the top of the Google Advanced Search page mirror concepts already
covered in this section (for example, "this exact word or phrase" allows you to omit the quotes in a

                                                                                                                           7.15
phrase search), the options for narrowing your results can be powerful. You can limit your search to a
particular domain (such as .edu for items from educational institutions) or you can search for items you
can reuse legally (with attribution, of course!) by making use of the "usage rights" option. However, be
careful with some of the options, as they may excessively limit your results. If you aren't certain about a
particular option, try your search with and without using it and compare the results. If you use a search
engine other than Google, check to see if it offers an advanced search option: many do.

Subject Headings
In the section on advanced searches, you read about field searching. To explain further, if you know that
the last name of the author whose work you are seeking is Wood, and that he worked on forestry-
related topics, you can do a far better search using the author field. Just think what you would get in the
way of results if you entered a basic search such as forestry and wood. It is great to use the appropriate
Boolean operator, but oh, the results you will get! But what if you specified that wood had to show up as
part of the author's name? This would limit your results quite a bit.

So what about forestry? Is there a way to handle that using a field search? The answer is yes (why else
bring it up?). Subject headings are terms that are assigned to items to group them. An example is cars--
you could also call them autos, automobiles, or even more specific labels like SUVs or vans. You might
use the Boolean operator or and string these all together. But if you found out that the sources you are
searching use automobiles as the subject heading, you wouldn't have to worry about all these related
terms, and could confidently use their subject heading and get all the results, even if the author of the
piece uses cars and not automobiles.

How does this work? In many databases, a person called an indexer or cataloger scrutinizes and enters
each item. This person performs helpful, behind-the-scenes tasks such as assigning subject headings,
age levels, or other indicators that make it easier to search very precisely. An analogy is tagging,
although indexing is more structured than tagging. If you have tagged items online, you know that you
can use any terms you like and that they may be very different from someone else's tags. With indexing,
the indexer chooses from a set group of terms. Obviously, this precise indexing isn't available for web
search engines--it would be impossible to index everything on the web. But if you are searching in a
database, make sure you use these features to make your searches more precise and your results lists
more relevant. You also will definitely save time.

You may be thinking that this sounds good. Saving time when doing research is a great idea. But how
will you know what subject headings exist, so you can use them? Here is a trick that librarians use. Even
librarians don't know what terms are used in all the databases or online catalogs that they use. So a
librarian's starting point isn't very far from yours. But they do know to use whatever features a database
provides to do an effective search. They find out about them by acting like a detective.

You've already thought about the possible search terms for your information need. Enter the best
search strategy you developed, which might use Boolean operators or truncation. Scan the results to see
if they seem to be on topic. If they aren't, figure out what results you are getting that just aren't right,
and revise your search. Terms you have searched on often show up in bold face type, so they are easy to

                                                                                                                           7.16
pick out. Besides checking the titles of the results, read the abstracts (or summaries), if there are any.
You may get some ideas for other terms to use. But if your results are fairly good, scan them with the
intent to find one or two items that seem to be precisely what you need. Get to the full record (or
entry), where you can see all the details entered by the indexers. Here is an example from the Texas
A&M University Libraries' Quick Search, but keep in mind that the catalog or database you are using may
have entries that look very different.

Once you have the "full" record (which does not refer to the full text of the item, but rather the full
descriptive details about the book, including author, subjects, date, and place of publication, and so on),
look at the subject headings (they may be called descriptors or some other term, but they should be
recognizable as subjects) and see what words are used. They may be identical to the terms you entered,
but if not, revise your search using the subject heading words. The result list should now contain items
that are relevant for your need.

It is tempting to think that once you have gone through all the processes around the circle, as seen in
this diagram, your information search is done and you can start writing. However, research is a recursive
process. You don't start at the beginning and continue straight through until you end at the end. Once
you have followed this planning model, you will often find that you need to alter or refine your topic and
start the process again, as seen here:

                                                  Figure: Planning Model

This revision process may happen at any time, before or during the preparation of your paper or other
final product. The researchers who are most successful do this, so don't ignore opportunities to revise.

So let's return to Sarah and her search for information to help her team's project. Sarah realized she
needed to make a number of changes in the search strategy she was using. She had several insights that
definitely led her to some good sources of information for this particular research topic. Can you identify
the good ideas she implemented?

                      Finding Supporting Information5

Harry and Sally Dennis have lived in Texas for 25 years. They work as teachers in the Fort Worth
Independent School District. Lately, they have been closely following the debate about hydraulic
fracturing or fracking in Texas and are concerned about their ability to influence the course of fracking in
the future. Although they don't own much land, they are worried about the possible adverse effect on
drinking water, disruption to their environment, and the influx of people that fracking-related jobs will
bring into their city. Sally Dennis is considering running for public office in her town to have a more
powerful voice in the fracking debate. To receive the backing of her local political party, Sally needs to
present some persuasive arguments against hydraulic fracking that are well thought out and
scientifically sound. She needs to engage in substantial research on this issue so that she can present
herself as an expert.

At this point, all that Sally really knows about fracking is what she has heard from neighbors and news
shows. How will she proceed with her research? Sally's intentions are laudable and she knows she will
have to fill in the information gaps in her fracking issue knowledge before she can be taken seriously as
a candidate for city office. Knowing that you don't have sufficient information to solve an information
need is one important aspect of information literacy. It enables you to obtain that missing information.

Different Information Formats and Their Characteristics

In addition to knowing that you are missing essential information, another component of information
literacy is understanding that the information you seek may be available in different formats such as
books, journal articles, government documents, blog postings, and news items. Each format has a
unique value. The graphic below represents a common process of information dissemination. When an
event happens, we usually hear about it from news sources--broadcast, web, and print. More in-depth
exploration and analysis of the event often comes from government studies and scholarly journal
articles. Deeper exploration, as well as an overview of much of the information available about the
event, is often published in book format.

                        Figure: Information sources from less in-depth to more in-depth

Sally realizes that she needs to obtain an overview of the whole fracking debate. She needs to
determine how severe the consequences of fracking could be and what is actually involved in the
fracking process. Where can she find such an overview and how can she trust that the overview is
accurate and complete?

Sally believes that she can find this information online and uses Google to search the World Wide Web.
She quickly finds that there is an overwhelming amount of online information about fracking. Her search
has resulted in more than 11,000,000 sites. Sally knows that she doesn't have time to peruse all of these
resources, and those that she does examine do not provide a comprehensive overview of the issues. She
also notices that many of the sites are obviously advocating their own point of view.

A better first step for Sally to take is to identify a library that contains academic resources so that she
will have access to more scholarly treatments of the subject. Sally can use the Texas A&M University
Libraries' Quick Search or Worldcat.org (that will allow her to search numerous academic libraries at
once).

Library Catalogs
A library catalog is a database that contains all of the items located in a library as well as all of the items
to which the library has access. It allows you to search for items by title, author, subject, and keyword. A
keyword is a word that is found anywhere within the record of an item in the catalog. A catalog record
displays information that is pertinent to one item, which could be a book, a journal, a government

                                                                                                                           7.20
document, or a video or audio recording.

If you search by subject in an academic library catalog you can take advantage of the controlled
vocabulary created by the Library of Congress. Controlled vocabulary consists of terms or phrases that
have been selected to describe a concept. For example, the Library of Congress has selected the phrase
"Motion Picture" to represent films and movies. So, if you are looking for books about movies, you
would enter the phrase "Motion Picture" into the search box. Controlled vocabulary is important
because it helps pull together all of the items about one topic. In this example, you would not have to
conduct individual searches for movies, then motion pictures, then film; you could just search once for
motion pictures and retrieve all the items on movies and film. You can discover subject terms in item
catalog records.

Many libraries provide catalog discovery interfaces that provide cues to help refine a search. This makes
it easier to find items on specific topics. For example, if Sally enters the search terms "Hydraulic
Fracturing" into a catalog with a discovery interface, the results page will include suggestions for
refinements including several different aspects of the topic. Sally can click on any of these suggested
refinements to focus her search.

Using this method, Sally finds several good resources on her topic. Now, she needs to locate them. The
Texas A&M University Libraries' Quick Search will show where the book is located and whether the book
is checked out.

Why should Sally choose books instead of another format? Books can provide an overview of a broad
topic. Often, the author has gathered the information from multiple sources and created an easy to
understand overview. Sally can later look for corroborating evidence in government documents and
journal articles. Books are a good information resource for this stage of her research.

Once Sally starts to locate useful information resources, she realizes that there are further gaps in her
knowledge. How does she decide which books to use? She needs the most current information, because
she certainly doesn't want to get caught spouting outdated information.

Looking at publication date will help her to choose the most recent items. How can she get these books?
She is not a Texas A&M University student or faculty member.

Interlibrary loan services at her public library will allow her to access books from an academic library or
the college in her area may allow community members to borrow materials. There is a wealth of
knowledge contained in the resources of academic and public libraries throughout the United States.
Single libraries can't hope to collect all of the resources available on a topic. Fortunately, libraries are
happy to share their resources and they do this through interlibrary loan. Interlibrary loan allows you to
borrow books and other information resources regardless of where they are located. If you know that a
book exists, ask your library to request it through their interlibrary loan program. This service is available
at both academic and most public libraries.

                                                                                                                           7.21
Checking for Further Knowledge Gaps

Sally has had a chance to review the books that she chose and although her understanding of the issues
associated with fracking has improved, she still needs more specific information from the point of view
of the energy industry, the government, and the scientific community. Sally knows that if she doesn't
investigate all points of view, she will not be able to speak intelligently about the issues involved in the
fracking debate. Where will she get this information? Because this information should be as current as
possible, much of it will not be available in book format. Sally will need to look for scholarly journal
articles and government documents. It is not likely that the public library will have the depth and scope
of information that Sally now needs. Fortunately, Sally has just enrolled in a class at Texas A&M
University and is able to use the resources at this academic library. However, when Sally visits the
library, she finds that the amount of information available is overwhelming. There are many databases
that will help Sally find journal articles on almost any topic. There are also many kinds of government
information, some in article format, some as documents, and some as published rules and regulations.
Sally suddenly feels out of her element and doesn't have any idea of where to start her research.

Databases
Sally should start her search for journal articles with research databases. Research databases contain
records of journal articles, documents, book chapters, and other resources. Online library catalogs differ
from other research databases in that they contain only the items available through a particular library
or library system. Research databases are often either broad or comprehensive collections and are not
tied to the physical items available at any one library. Many databases provide the full-text of articles
and can be searched by subject, author, or title. Another type of database provides just the information
about articles and may provide tools for you to find the full text in another database. The databases that
contain resources for a vast array of subjects are referred to as general or multidisciplinary databases.
Other databases are devoted to a single subject, and are known as subject-specific databases. Databases
are made up of:

     Records: A record contains descriptive information that is pertinent to one item which may be a
         book, a chapter, an article, a document, or other information unit.

     Fields: These are part of the record and they contain information that pertains to one aspect of
         an item such as the title, author, publication date, and subject.

     The subject field can sometimes be labeled subject heading or descriptor. This is the field that
         contains controlled vocabulary. Controlled vocabulary in a database is similar to controlled
         vocabulary in a Library Catalog, but each database usually has a unique controlled vocabulary
         unrelated to Library of Congress classifications. Many databases will make their controlled
         vocabulary available in a thesaurus. If the database you are searching does not have a
         thesaurus, use the subject field in a record to find relevant subject terms.

Below is the first screen of a subject specific database called GEORef. This database covers technical
literature on geology and geophysics. The thesaurus is circled. Clicking on the thesaurus allows you to
find controlled vocabulary that will focus your search. In this search, Sally has typed the word "fracking"

                                                                                                                           7.22
in the search box and only retrieved 23 records. When Sally uses the controlled vocabulary phrase
"hydraulic fracturing," she is able to increase her search results. In fact, she has retrieved too many
records. Now she wants to limit her search, but she still wants to obtain the most relevant articles
available.

                       Figure: Controlled Vocabulary Database Functions
Boolean Operators
One way to limit a database search is to use the Boolean operators discussed earlier. Remember that
Boolean Operators are the words and, or, and not and you can use them in a database search to narrow
or broaden your search results. You can usually find these words in the advanced search query area of a
database. And will narrow your search. For example, if you are interested in fresh water fishing you
would enter the terms "fish and freshwater." Your results would then include records that only
contained both of these words.

                                                                                                                           7.23
                                               Figure: AND Venn Diagram
The green overlapping area in the diagram above represents the results from the "fish and freshwater"
search.
Or will broaden your search and is usually used with synonyms. If you are interested in finding
information on mammals found in the Atlantic Ocean, you could enter the terms "whales or dolphins."

                                                Figure: OR Venn Diagram
The circles above represent the or search. All of the records that contain one or another, or both of your
search terms will be in your results list.

                                                                                                                           7.24
Not will eliminate a term from your results. If you were looking for information on all Atlantic Ocean fish
except Bluefish, you would enter "fish not bluefish."

                                               Figure: NOT Venn Diagram
The larger green circle represents the results that you would retrieve with this search.
Let's go back to Sally's search of the GEORef database. If you remember, she searched the controlled
vocabulary term, "hydraulic fracturing." She can use and with the phrase "Bartnett Shale" to focus and
limit her results. Sally's search query is now "hydraulic fracturing and Bartnett Shale." You can see this
represented below. The overlapping area represents the records this search will retrieve.

                                        Figure: Venn Diagram of Sally's Search
                                                                                                                           7.25
Database searching can seem confusing at first, but the more you use databases, the easier it gets and
most of the time, the results you are able to retrieve are superior to the results that you will get from a
simple internet search.
Other Information Sources
After taking some time to think about her goal, which is to present a persuasive argument on why she
would be a good candidate for public office, Sally decides to concentrate on obtaining relevant
government information. After all, she hopes to become part of the government, so she should have
some knowledge of the government's role in the fracking issue.
Government information consists of any information produced by local, state, national, or international
governments and is usually available at no cost. However, sometimes it is reproduced by a commercial
entity with added value. Look for websites that are created by official government entities, such as the
U.S. Department of the Interior at http://www. doi.gov/index.cfm and Thomas, the congressional
website at Thomas.loc.gov. Texas' website can be found at https://texas.gov/. It contains information
from all Texas government branches. As Sally will discover, you can usually find a wealth of reliable
information in government sources.
Even though she has narrowed the scope of her search for information resources, Sally is still confronted
with a myriad of information formats. With help from a reference librarian, Sally discovers a research
guide on government information available in the library. She notices that there is a section for Texas
that she can explore.
She breathes a sigh of relief when she finds a link to the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality's
website, which has many documents and regulations on the topic of Hydraulic Fracturing. The reference
librarian continues to assist Sally to find the most useful information as she navigates through the site.
Since this information is freely available to the public, Sally is able to access the site from home and
spends many hours reading the documents.

                                                                                                                           7.26
                  Using the Right Sources for Your Project

Selecting the right type of source for your information need is an important aspect of researched
writing. The right source can provide evidence and add credibility to your position, but the wrong source
can undermine your position. The context of your project is key to choosing the right source; even a
completely specious source can be the right source if it's evidence in support of a paper about specious
sources. For most of your projects, though, you'll likely be looking for high-quality sources, especially
scholarly sources.

Types of Evidence in Academic Arguments6

All academic writers use evidence to support their claims. However, as writing tasks vary across
disciplinary fields, different types of evidence are required. Often a combination of different types of
evidence is required in order to adequately support and develop a point.

To clarify, evidence is what a writer uses to support or defend his or her argument, and only valid and
credible evidence is enough to make an argument strong.

                          Evidence is not simply "facts." Evidence is not simply "quotes."

As you develop your research-supported essay, consider not only what types of evidence might support
your ideas but also what types of evidence will be considered valid or credible according to the
academic discipline or academic audience for which you are writing. The following are some examples of
credible evidence by academic discipline.

Evidence in the Humanities: Literature, Art, Film, Music, Philosophy
     Scholarly essays that analyze original works
     Details from an image, a film, or other work of art
     Passages from a musical composition
     Passages of text, including poetry

Evidence in the Humanities: History

     Primary Sources (photos, letters, maps, official documents, etc.)
     Other books or articles that interpret primary sources or other evidence.

Evidence in the Social Sciences: Psychology, Sociology, Political Science, Anthropology
     Books or articles that interpret data and results from other people's original experiments or
         studies.
     Results from one's own field research (including interviews, surveys, observations, etc.)
     Data from one's own experiments
     Statistics derived from large studies

Evidence in the Sciences: Biology, Chemistry, Physics
     Data from the author of the paper's own experiments
     Books or articles that interpret data and results from other people's original experiments or
         studies.

 What remains consistent no matter the discipline in which you are writing, however, is that evidence
 NEVER speaks for itself. Quality evidence must be integrated it into your own argument or claim in
 order to demonstrate that the evidence supports your thesis. In addition, be alert to evidence that
 seems to contradict your claims or offers a counterargument to it. Rebutting that counterargument can
 be powerful evidence for your claim. You can also make evidence that isn't there an integral part of
 your argument, too. If you can't find the evidence you think you need, ask yourself why it seems to be
 lacking, or if its absence adds a new dimension to your thinking about the topic. Remember, evidence is
 not the piling up of facts or quotes. Evidence is only one component of a strong, well supported, well
 argued, and well written composition.7

Scholarly Sources8

While reading academic articles (scholarly journal articles) can be one of the more intimidating aspects
of college- level research projects, there are several aspects to the purpose, format, and style of
scholarly/academic journal articles that are rather straightforward and patterned. Knowing the template
that scholarly articles follow can enhance your reading and comprehension experience and make these
intimidating reading materials much less daunting. Moreover, understanding the purpose of scholarly
publication can help you to understand what matters most in these articles.

Basic Format

Information in academic journal articles is presented in a formal, highly prescribed format, meaning that
scholarly articles tend to follow a similar layout, pattern, and style. The pages often look stark, with little
decoration or imagery. We see few photos in scholarly articles. The article title is often fairly prominent
on the first page, as are the author(s)' name(s). Sometimes there is a bit of information about each
author, such as the name of his or her current academic institution or academic credentials. At either
the top or bottom of the first few pages, you can find the name of the scholarly journal in which the
article is published.

Abstract
On the first page of the article, you will often find an abstract, which is a summary of the author's
research question, methodologies and results. While this abstract is useful to you as a reader because it
gives you some background about the article before you begin reading, you should not cite this abstract
in your paper. Please read these abstracts as you are initially seeking sources so that you can determine
whether or not reading the article will be useful to you, but do not quote or paraphrase from the
abstract.

Works Cited
At the end of academic articles, you will find a list of Works Cited (sometimes called a List of
References). This is generally quite long, and it details all of the work that the author considered or cited
in designing his or her own research project or in writing the article. Helpful hint: reading the Works
Cited in an article that you find to be particularly illuminating or useful can be a great way to locate
other sources that may be useful for your own research project! If you see a title that looks interesting,
see if you can access it via your university's library.

Literature Review

deeper-look-at-scholarly-sources/.

                                                                                                                           7.29
Scholarly sources often contain Literature Reviews in the beginning section of the article. They are
generally several paragraphs or pages long. Some articles are only Literature Reviews. These Literature
Reviews generally do not constitute an author's own work. Instead, they are summaries and syntheses
of other scholars' work that has previously been published on the topic that the author is addressing in
his or her paper. Including this review of previous research helps the author to communicate his or her
understanding of the context out of which his or her research comes.

Like the abstract, the Literature Review is another part of a scholarly article from which you should
generally not quote. Often, students will mistakenly try to cite information that they find in this
Literature Review section of scholarly articles. But that is sort of like citing a SparkNotes version of an
essay that you have not read. The Literature Review is where your author, in his or her own words,
describes previous research. He or she is outlining what others have said in their own articles, not
offering his or her own new insight (and what we are interested in in scholarly articles is the new
information that a researcher brings to the topic). If you find that there is interesting information from
the sources that your author discusses in the Literature Review, then you should locate the article(s)
that the author is summarizing and read them for yourself. That, in fact, is a great strategy for finding
more sources!

The "Research Gap"
Somewhere near the end of the Literature Review, authors may indicate what has not been said or not
been examined by previous scholars. This has been called a "research gap" - a space out of which a
scholar's own research develops. The "research gap" opens the opportunity for the author to assert his
or her own research question or claim. Academic authors who want to publish in scholarly research
journals need to define a research gap and then attempt to fill that gap because scholarly journals want
to publish new, innovative and interesting work that will push knowledge and scholarship in that field
forward. Scholars must communicate what new ideas they have worked on: what their new hypothesis,
or experiment, or interpretation or analysis is.

The Scholar(s) Add Their New Perspective
Then, and sometimes for the bulk of an academic article, the author discusses their original work and
analysis. This is the part of the article where the author(s) add to the conversation, where they try to fill
in the research gap that they identified. This is also the part of the article that is the primary research.
The author(s) may include a discussion of their research methodology and results, or an elaboration and
defense of their reasoning, interpretation or analysis. Scholarly articles in the sciences or social sciences
may include headings such as "Methods", "Results", and "Discussion" or synonyms of those words in
this part of the article. In arts or humanities journal articles, these headings may not appear because
scholars in the arts and humanities do not necessarily perform lab-based research in the same way as
scientists or social scientists do. Authors may reference others' research even in this section of original
work and analysis, but only to support or enhance the discussion of the scholar's own discussion. This is
the part of the scholarly article that you should cite from, as it indicates the work your author or authors
have done.

Conclusion

                                                                                                                           7.30
To conclude a scholarly journal article, authors may reference their original research question or
hypothesis once more. They may summarize some of the points made in the article. We often see
scholars concluding by indicating how, why, or to whom their research matters. Sometimes, authors will
conclude by looking forward, offering ideas for other scholars to engage in future research. Sometimes,
they may reflect on why an experiment failed (if it did) and how to approach that experiment differently
next time. What we do not tend to see is scholars merely summarizing everything they discussed in the
essay, point by point. Instead, they want to leave readers with a sense of why the work that they have
discussed in their article matters.

As you read scholarly sources, remember

     to look for the author's research question or hypothesis
     to seek out the "research gap": why did the author have this research question or hypothesis?
     to identify the Literature Review
     to identify the point at which the author stops discussing previous research and begins to

         discuss his or her own
     Most importantly: remember to always try to understand what new information this article

         brings to the scholarly "conversation" about this topic?

Types of Sources: Primary, Secondary, Tertiary9

The determination of a text as "popular" or "scholarly/academic" is one way to classify it and to
understand what type of information you are engaging with. Another way to classify sources is by
considering whether they are primary, secondary or tertiary. Popular sources can be primary, secondary,
or tertiary. Scholarly sources, also, can be primary, secondary, or tertiary.

                                                What is a Primary Source?

 Primary sources are texts that arise directly from a particular event or time period. They may be
 letters, speeches, works of art, works of literature, diaries, direct personal observations, newspaper
 articles that offer direct observations of current events, survey responses, tweets, other social media
 posts, original scholarly research (meaning research that the author or authors conduct themselves)
 or any other content that comes out of direct involvement with an event or a research study.

 Primary research is information that has not yet been critiqued, interpreted or analyzed by a second

                                                                                                                           7.31
(or third, etc) party.
Primary sources can be popular (if published in newspapers, magazines or websites for the general
public) or academic (if written by scholars and published in scholarly journals).
Examples of primary sources:

     journals, diaries
     blog posts
     a speech
     data from surveys or polls
     scholarly journal articles in which the author(s) discuss the methods and results from their

         own original research/experiments
     photos, videos, sound recordings
     interviews or transcripts
     poems, paintings, sculptures, songs or other works of art
     government documents (such as reports of legislative sessions, laws or court decisions,

         financial or economic reports, and more)

                                             What is a Secondary Source?

Secondary sources summarize, interpret, critique, analyze, or offer commentary on primary sources.
In a secondary source, an author's subject is not necessarily something that he or she directly
experienced. The author of a secondary source may be summarizing, interpreting or analyzing data or
information from someone else's research or offering an interpretation or opinion on current events.
Thus, the secondary source is one step away from that original, primary topic/subject/research study.
Secondary sources can be popular (if published in newspapers, magazines or websites for the general
public) or academic (if written by scholars and published in scholarly journals).
Examples of secondary sources:

     book, movie or art reviews
     summaries of the findings from other people's research
     interpretations or analyses of primary source materials or other people's research
     histories or biographies

                                                                                                                         7.32
       political commentary

                                                What is a Tertiary Source?
 Tertiary sources are syntheses of primary and secondary sources. The person/people who compose a
 tertiary text are summarizing, compiling, and/or paraphrasing others' work. These sources sometimes
 do not list an author.
 Tertiary sources can be popular or academic.
 Examples of tertiary sources include:

       encyclopedias
       fact books
       dictionaries
       guides
       handbooks
       Wikipedia

Thinking about Primary, Secondary and Tertiary Sources and your Research Strategy
     What kinds of primary sources would be useful for your research project? Why? Where will you
         find them? Are you more interested in popular primary sources or scholarly primary sources --
         and why?
     What kinds of secondary sources could be useful for your project - and why? Are you more
         interested in popular secondary sources or scholarly secondary sources - and why?
     What kinds of tertiary sources might you try to access? In what ways would this tertiary source
         help you in your research?

                                                                                                                           7.33
                    Writing an Annotated Bibliography10

As you are gathering sources in your research, you will want to keep track of which information comes
from what source. While other strategies have been discussed such as note taking, some researchers
use an annotated bibliography for long term reference purposes. As the name implies, an annotated
bibliography is the bibliographical reference of a given source along with key information from that
source that you may use for future reference. As assignment parameters will vary by instructor,
generally speaking the annotations are 150-200 words in length per source and do not include quoted
material. The purpose of the annotations is to summarize the material within the context of your thesis
statement.

Annotated Bibliographies follow a common structure and format. Below is an explanation of the
elements and format of an Annotated Bibliography.

Components of an Annotated Bibliography

An annotation often offers a summary of a source that you intend to use for a research project as well
as some assessment of the source's relevance to your project or quality and credibility. There are two
key components for each source: the citation and the annotation.

The Annotated Bibliography Samples page on the Purdue OWL offers examples of general formatting
guidelines for both an MLA and an APA Annotated Bibliography.

Citation
You will provide the full bibliographic reference for the source: author, title, source title, and other
required information depending on the type of source. This will be formatted just as it would be in a
typical Works Cited for an MLA paper or a References page for an APA paper.

Annotation
Tone and Style

     Use signal phrases to refer to the author(s)

     Always maintain a neutral tone and use the third-person point of view and present tense (i.e.
         Tompkins asserts...).

     Keep the focus of the summary on the text, not on what you think of it, and try to put as most of
         the summary as you can in your own words. If you must use exact phrases from the source that
         you are summarizing, you must quote and cite them.

     Annotations should not be a replication of the abstract provided by the source.
What to Include in Annotations

    1. After the bibliographical information, begin to discuss the source. Begin with a general summary
         of the source. Describe the key sections of the text and their corresponding main points. Try to
         avoid focusing on details; a summary covers the essential points and typically does not include
         quoted material.

    2. Evaluate the source's credibility or relevance. Is the author an expert on the topic? How do you
         know? Is the source peer-reviewed or otherwise credible in nature? How do you do know? What
         makes this source a good one to use?

    3. Discuss how you plan to integrate the source in your paper. Do you need to point out similarities
         or differences with other sources in the annotated bibliography? How does it support (or refute)
         your intended thesis?

Check the Annotated Bibliography assignment sheet for additional content requirements. Instructors
often require more than a simple summary of each source, and specific requirements may vary. Any (or
all) of these aspects may be required in an annotated bibliography, depending on how or if your
instructor has designed this assignment as part of a larger research project.11

From Annotated Bibliography to Rough Draft: How to Develop your
                                     Position12

Now that you've completed your annotated bibliography, you may find yourself struggling with how to
begin the rough draft of the researched position paper assignment. A researched position paper is
simply an argumentative essay in which you take a position on a chosen topic and defend it with
secondary sources. While it may be easy for you to state your position and reasons for your argument,
you may find it difficult to incorporate your secondary sources into your own draft and still maintain
your own voice. Now is the time to break out the scissors.
In this exercise, you are becoming part of the academic discussion, or discourse community, on your
chosen topic. Now that you have located sources that either agree or disagree with your position, it's
time to see how those sources inform your thesis. If your annotated bibliography is printed on
continuous pages, cut the annotations apart making certain to leave the bibliographical information
with each annotation. Once you have done this, arrange the annotations on a table in front of you and
imagine that each source is a person standing before you speaking. The topic about which they are
speaking is the information contained in your annotation.
Now imagine that your best friend just walked up behind you and asked, "Hey, what are you all
discussing?" Your one or two sentence answer is your thesis. That response sums up the gist of the
argument being discussed and makes clear your position on the topic. Even if you had a working thesis
beforehand, it's okay to revise it at this point to more clearly match the debate being presented by your
sources. It's still your position - after all, you chose the sources.
Next, in selecting how to arrange the sources to create a rough draft, imagine the conversation again.
Which one of the sources provides the strongest support for your position? Which one offers a
counterargument? Which one(s) provide evidence which gives the argument logos credibility? As you
hear the conversation in your head, arrange your annotations to begin to visualize the outline for your
rough draft.

Section 8: Ethics

                                   Introduction1

When we talk about writing, it is important to understand how to write ethically, that is, with an eye to
what is morally acceptable. To develop an intuitive understanding of the nature of ethical concerns in
writing, it helps to start with the proposition that "information has value".2 This means that your writing
and any texts you create have value, and so do the works of others. Some common examples of valuable
texts could include the Harry Potter novels, which have earned enormous profits for the author,
publishing house, editors, printers, film studios, actors, etc. associated with the many written and
audiovisual texts that have been developed from those novels. Academic texts have value in a number
of ways, from being research that other companies will pay for to earning authors jobs and promotions.
For students, the value of a paper is often tied to what type of grade the student will earn for it.

Once we understand that information has value, it's a bit easier to understand what it is morally
acceptable to do with it. If we accept that a term paper has value for a student because of the grade it
will earn that student in a given class, then it is clear that someone else should not change the paper
without the author's knowledge, nor should someone steal the paper and turn it in as their own work.

Linked to ethical concerns about information are legal ones. Much of the work done at universities is
governed not only by the ethics of academia, but by the law as well, particularly as a form of intellectual
property. The World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO), describes intellectual property thusly:

         Intellectual property (IP) refers to creations of the mind, such as inventions; literary and artistic
         works; designs; and symbols, names and images used in commerce.

         IP is protected in law by, for example, patents, copyright and trademarks, which enable people
         to earn recognition or financial benefit from what they invent or create. By striking the right
         balance between the interests of innovators and the wider public interest, the IP system aims to
         foster an environment in which creativity and innovation can flourish.3

For writing courses, copyright is generally the most significant of these types of intellectual property.

Again breaking apart the idea of intellectual property helps create a more intuitive understanding about
how to fairly use and create information. Note here the term "property," and think about some of
society's laws and concepts concerning property. Property belongs to someone; it has an owner. It can
be bought and sold, and it can be stolen. These things are all true of intellectual property, as well.

Apart from the legal protections afforded to intellectual property, there are contextual ethics that apply
to different writing situations. What is acceptable in one situation might not be in another. For example,

let's say your roommate has a standard grocery list every week. One week, you are doing the grocery
shopping and you copy the list, but you do not say that your roommate was the original author or cite
her shopping list. Is this unethical, given the context? No, given the standard ethical principles of our
society, and, presumably, the ethics of your relationship with your roommate. However, say your
roommate took the same class that you are now taking and you use parts of her term paper in your own
without giving her credit or indicating which parts of the text you are quoting. Is this unethical? Yes,
because this action violates the ethics of the academic community.

In this chapter we are going to focus mostly upon the ethical principles of the academic community,
particularly those concerning plagiarism. Then we will also look at how to properly give credit to others
through citation.

                             Managing Information4

In the modern world, it is wonderful to have access to information. It empowers us to have data and
knowledge that leads us throughout our busy days and helps us organize our leisure time more
efficiently. GPS devices and mobile phones help us locate unfamiliar destinations where we can find
places to eat, to stay, and to get entertainment. All of this information is at our fingertips due to modern
technology. To some degree, we all take advantage of this technology and use this information to our
advantage.

But there are other types of information that we need, not just the kind that provides directions. We
seek such information when we are ill and need to look up medical advice. We seek out information
when looking for jobs or places to live. We even seek information when in school as very few subjects
require only the use of a textbook. In our intellectual work, we need to search for information and then
use it because every paper or project produced in college is a product of someone's creativity.

So how should we handle this product of creativity (a.k.a information)? Let's think about a simple
example: apple picking in the fall. It is a popular thing to do. People go to a farm, get bags or baskets,
gather apples, and then line up to weigh and to pay for them. The farmers' hard work of growing the
crops is being rewarded with the monetary payment from the customers.

Now imagine a different situation. You worked hard and wrote a very good paper and your roommate
just copied a couple of paragraphs and inserted them into her own paper because the topics were
related. Was this fair? How were you rewarded for your hard work? Nobody is saying that your
roommate should have paid you as you would pay the farmer for apples, but she should not use your
intellectual capital without attribution to you! What she did was an act of plagiarism--intellectual theft.

Imagine that you publish an article in your college newsletter. This article is your intellectual personal

property and you hold the copyright, which means that no one has the right to reproduce all or any part
of it (i.e. copy it) without your permission. If your roommate decides to use some information from your
article in her paper, she should provide a citation (the information that will help the reader identify and
find your article should they decide to do so). If she is using direct quotes from your article, again, she
would need to put double quotes around your words and provide information about the author (you, in
this instance) to avoid plagiarism. This avoids intellectual theft and gives credit where credit is due.

However, copyright and plagiarism are just two aspects of intellectual property with which you need to
concern yourself. All writers must respect copyright, i.e. the rights of the author, and avoid plagiarism.
However, there are more aspects to it. Have you heard of patents? If you are planning a career in
science and technology-related fields then you also have to learn more about patents. Patents deal with
creators' rights to their invention of new machinery or processes. But machinery and processes are not
the only things subject to patent laws. Plants and designs can also be patented. For more information on
patent law, consult the United States Patent and Trademarks Office (USPTO)
http://www.uspto.gov/patents/law/. Additionally, trademarks and trade secrets are other aspects of
intellectual property with which you may have to deal.

In addition to being aware of plagiarism, patents, trademarks, and trade secrets, you need to be mindful
of open access issues which relate to valuable research data and academic publications posted online
for everybody to read. This textbook is an example of an open access resource. While it is available
widely on the web, you cannot always use the data from open access sources. You often need to ask the
author for permission. Many open access publications use Creative Commons licensing, which gives
advance permission for certain types of usage but may prohibit some other uses.

There is a lot to learn about using information legally and ethically, but this knowledge will empower
you in your academic work and ultimately allow you to succeed. The following examples and tips will get
you off to a good start.

Unintentional Plagiarism

Have you ever thought about why teachers and professors seem to spend way too much time urging
everyone to be sure to cite all of their sources properly? You've heard it all before: footnote this,
endnote that, put this in the bibliography, capitalize this word, where are the italics, the commas,
periods, hanging indents, yada yada yada! It's enough to make you give up and just wing it. But hold on
a second while you gather your thoughts. Why do your professors always spend so much time urging
you to do something that seems to have little practical purpose?

Scenario
Jackie was working on her 10-page research paper at the last minute. It was 3:30 am and her paper was
due in class at 9:00 am. She finished the last sentence at 5:15 am, did a spellcheck and voila! Done!
Groggy yet awake she went to class, turned in the paper and waited for her grade. She received an email
from her professor that read, "There are some major issues with your research paper that I need to
discuss with you. Please see me." Uh oh. What could it be?

                                                                                                                            8.3
When she nervously went to see him, Professor Muntz told Jackie that she hadn't cited any of her
sources, and because she included a lot of direct quotes in her paper, she was guilty of plagiarism. She
received an F on her paper and may be referred to the school administration for academic dishonesty.

Was she really guilty of something that bad? In fact, yes she was. In this chapter we will discuss the
importance of managing your information sources and some tips on how to easily and effectively avoid
Jackie's pitfall.

Real World Cases
Students often feel that they are being singled out in regard to plagiarism and academic dishonesty. But
that is far from the case. There are numerous examples of scholars and other professionals who have
been caught plagiarizing. One such person is Doris Kearns Goodwin, a famous historian who wrote the
noted Team of Rivals: the Political Genius of Abraham Lincoln (2006). She included material in an earlier
book, The Fitzgeralds and the Kennedys (1987), from three other sources without citing it, according to
an article written by Michael Nelson.5

Although she has since published other works, her reputation has been tarnished, and people may not
take her work as seriously because of this. Unfortunately, as Nelson points out in his article, she is not
the only well-known historian caught plagiarizing.

Another example, with a dramatic outcome, is that of Eugene Tobin. He was the president of Hamilton
College in New York State, when it was discovered that he had included plagiarized material in speeches
he had given over the course of almost a decade. He resigned from his position as the head of this
prestigious institution, admitting his guilt.6 Other college presidents and administrators have also been
caught violating academic trust: if you try a search using the terms plagiarism and college president, you
may be dismayed at the number of results.

Like some of the historians Nelson cites in his article, many students fall into a trap when they do
research because they fail to mention where they found all of their information. Thousands of students
in schools, colleges, and universities are guilty of committing plagiarism, but often they don't know they
are plagiarizing.

Let's look at plagiarism and how to avoid it, and then continue on to some other intellectual property
issues you may need to deal with.

What is Plagiarism?

In short, plagiarism is when you use words, thoughts, or ideas that belong to someone else without
giving them credit. In the classroom (and in the world of publishing), documenting your information
sources is the only way others can tell how thorough and careful you've been in researching your topic.

Quarterly Review, 78, no. 3 (2002): 377-394.

6 Isserman, Maurice. "Plagiarism: A lie of the mind," The Chronicle of Higher Education, 49, no. 34 (2003): B12.

                                                                                                                            8.4
If you don't tell readers where your information came from, they may think (and many do) that you
either made up the information or "stole" it. Failing to cite your sources is plagiarism.

By managing the sources in your papers, you encourage others to do the same and you can be a go-to
expert for your friends and classmates when they need help with how to find out how to cite sources
properly. The information and advice you impart may help them avoid serious difficulties. Some
students truly don't know that they are doing something wrong when they paraphrase information
without citing the information source. They might feel that paraphrasing the words of someone who is
clearly an expert on the topic is the best way to write an accurate paper. And because they aren't
quoting it directly, it doesn't need quote marks or attribution, does it? While the penalties they receive
might (and this is a big "might") be less severe than someone who buys a paper online or copies and
pastes big sections of material into their work, the penalties could still be substantial. Raising your
friends' awareness so they won't face this situation would be a kind thing to do.

When to Cite

Now that you have gathered all of your information resources, you need to be mindful about how you
used them in your research project. There are some very firm rules about what constitutes plagiarism:

     If you copy a sentence or paragraph verbatim (exactly) from a book, article, website, blog
         posting, or anywhere online or in print, you must provide information on the author and the
         publication in which the sentence or paragraph appears. This is known as "citing a source."

     If you use some of the exact phrases in a sentence or paragraph, even if you are not copying the
         whole sentence or paragraph, you must cite your source.

     If you use original information that you have obtained from an interview or conversation with
         someone, you must cite your source.

     If you do not use the exact sentence or phrase but paraphrase it, or use the ideas inherent in the
         exact sentence or phrase, you must cite your source.

     If you reprint images, maps, diagrams, charts, or tables, you must cite your source.
     If you embed video files or audio files into your work, you must cite your source.7

When are citations not needed?8

     You do not need to provide citations for commonly known dates and facts. One guideline is that
         if a fact appears in more than five sources it is commonly known. However, if it was not
         common knowledge to you, and you use a source, then go ahead and cite it.

     You do not need to provide citations for common turns of phrase or idioms, such as "One in the
         hand is worth two in the bush."

Five Tips for Avoiding Plagiarism9

1. Consider your need for information. If you are contemplating intentionally plagiarizing something, ask
yourself what information you need to finish your assignment and consider alternate means for finding
it. Your professor, the Writing Center, and the TAMU Libraries are great places to go to get more
information.

2. Give yourself time. Make sure that you leave enough time to complete your assignment. If you give
yourself enough time to complete your assignment you will be able to ask for help when necessary and
will not feel the pressure to "cut and paste" in sections of writing.

3. Take notes. When you are researching, always drop in the last name of the author, or even just a note
saying "CITE," in your writing. Take down as much bibliographic data as you can at the moment. This
way you can keep track of your ideas and where they came from. You can format your citations later in
the revision process.

4. Ask for help. If you are unsure about what you need to cite and what you don't, ask your professor, a
librarian, or a Writing Center consultant. Here is the address for the TAMU Libraries contact information:
library.tamu.edu. Links for contacting librarians by phone, chat, text, or email are at the bottom of the
page. The Writing Center's website is writingcenter.tamu.edu. You can make an appointment to speak
with a consultant.

5. Ask questions about texts and talk to people. You may feel like you don't understand the assignment
or the text and think that the only way to complete your work is to plagiarize. If this is the case, contact
the professor (through email or by going to his/her office hours) to talk about the assignment and/or the
text. Your professor is there to help you, and one-on-one meetings are available if you feel like you don't
want to ask questions in class. If you don't want to talk to your professor, bounce ideas off of a friend,
family member, or classmate. Talking about your readings is a great way to start coming up with ideas.

                  Ethical Issues and Intellectual Property10

Ethical treatment of information assumes that you are treating an author's rights appropriately and
avoiding an act of academic dishonesty such as plagiarism. As a creator of information yourself, you
should understand the importance of respecting other authors' rights and following the general rules set
forth in legal documents.

There are many examples of intellectual property issues that you can find in the media. For example, in
June 2013 as the authors were working on this textbook, the Supreme Court of the United States
overturned the law that had previously allowed gene patenting. It might sound strange, but up until now
if you were a scientist who studied the human genome and happened to discover a new gene, under the
earlier law, you could patent it, thus assuring that whenever a person needed to have a medical test
involving the gene they would have to pay you as a patent holder. These types of tests usually weren't
covered by insurance companies and were very expensive.

As an information creator, you want to be respectfully treated by others. That is why you should
constantly strive to improve your ability to practice fair treatment of other authors' works, including
being cognizant of copyright, patents, and other issues associated with intellectual property.

Academic Integrity

You have already learned about plagiarism, often enemy number one when it comes to academic
success involving research and writing. But there are other issues under the larger umbrella of academic
dishonesty. First of all, every academic institution has a set of academic regulations that explain what is
expected of students. Students are required to make themselves familiar with these rules.

Other examples of dishonesty that are mentioned in academic regulations are multiple submissions (one
may not submit one project for two different classes), cheating on examinations, and forgery. Professors
are dismayed when they have to talk to the students about these issues because, inherently, every
teacher wants to believe that her students are honest. Unfortunately, plagiarism is so common that
educators have begun using plagiarism detection software, such as Turnitin. You obviously don't want to
be identified as committing plagiarism by this software.

It is imperative to understand that everybody has to be accountable for their own work and respectful
of the work of others. Future scholarship depends on the accuracy and integrity of prior scholarship.
That is why, when doing research one must use the information produced by other people responsibly,
i.e. provide citations within the text and a list of references at the end of the paper with full citation
information that will allow retrieval of the document. Remember what you have learned in this chapter
about managing your sources and citation style. If you are diligent about applying this knowledge and

careful about giving credit where credit is due, you should have no worries.

Other Considerations for Using Sources Ethically11

Students are often concerned with the details of correct citation--when to include an author's name in
parentheses, how to format an MLA bibliography, how to indicate a quotation within a quotation--and
while these are all important and helpful to know, what is more important is understanding the larger
ethical principles that guide choosing and using sources. Here are a few of these larger ideas to keep in
mind as you select and synthesize your sources:

     You must represent the topic or discipline you are writing about fairly. If nine out of ten sources
         agree that evidence shows the middle class in the United States is shrinking, it is unethical to use
         the tenth source that argues it is growing without acknowledging the minority status of the
         source.

     You must represent the individual source fairly. If a source acknowledges that a small segment
         of the middle class in the United States is growing but most of the middle class is shrinking, it is
         unethical to suggest that the former is the writer's main point.

     You must acknowledge bias in your sources. It is unethical to represent sources that, while they
         may be credible, offer extreme political views as if these views are mainstream.

     Just because your source is an informal one, or from Wikipedia or the dictionary doesn't mean
         that you don't have to acknowledge it. Quoting a dictionary definition is still quoting: you need
         quotation marks. Wikipedia is not "common knowledge": cite it.

     You must summarize and paraphrase in your own words. Changing a few words around in the
         original and calling it your summary or paraphrase is unethical. How would you feel if you
         recognized what you worked so hard to write in someone else's paper? "I changed some
         words," they'd say. But you would still recognize your style. Don't steal someone else's.

                       Keeping Track of Your Sources12

Try this the next time you do research. If you find some great articles on your topic, collect the following
information about each as soon as you realize they will be helpful resources:

     Title of the article
     Name of the journal
     The volume number
     The issue number
     The date of the issue
     The name of the database where you found the article

Or, if you found a book, note the following once you think it might contain useful information:

     Author name(s)
     Title of book
     Place of publication
     Publisher's name
     Year of publication

Or, if you found a website you want to use, collect the following details before you leave the site:

     Author name(s)
     Title of article or webpage
     Title of overall website
     The date of the webpage (if any)
     The URL (or web address)
You might be able to get some of this information with a simple screenshot, but be sure to fill in any
missing elements.

This information is often referred to as bibliographic information or metadata. It consists of essential
information that identifies the information resource used to inform a research project.

You may not use every single item that you found when you gathered your sources, but having a list of
all of the sources you considered will help you keep track of everything you use for your paper.

As you read each source, write down any of the authors' ideas, quotes, or thoughts you want to use and
be sure to write down page numbers, if the source provides them. When you put your paper together,
you will then have all the information you need to properly cite any quote, idea, or thought that came
from each source.

Reference Management Software

Many researchers take the time to gather all of this information before they start writing. However,

                                                                                                                            8.9
when they are ready to compile their footnotes or bibliography they can't find their preliminary notes. It
may be the case that some notes are in one notebook, other notes are in a file in their computer and
still others are missing entirely. Fortunately, software has been developed that helps researchers
manage their source material. You may have heard of some of these reference management products.
Endnote, Refworks, Mendeley, and Zotero, among others, all help manage the information gathering
and retrieval process.

In addition to providing one central location for all of your references, these reference managers can:

     import bibliographic information directly from a library catalog database,
     provide additional space for personal notations,
     create a bibliography or list of references in a variety of citation styles such as APA, MLA,

         Chicago, and more.

Some academic libraries, including Texas A&M University Libraries, provide access to Endnote or
Refworks. Zotero is available free for use without a library subscription.

Citation Styles

Citing sources and avoiding plagiarism should always be an author's intent, but it is easy to get confused
about how to cite. The three styles that are used most often are APA (American Psychology Association),
MLA (Modern Language Association), and Chicago. There are no hard and fast rules about when to use
each style. Professors often have a preference for one style over another, so make sure that you check
with your instructor about which style they prefer.

Creating properly formatted citations has become easier in recent years with the introduction of
reference management software and citation generators. A citation generator is software that will help
to correctly format your citations. Some popular citation generators are Noodlebib and Easybib, both
are available for a fee. There are also free citation generators available online. You can search the web
to retrieve them. These generators are handy to use but they often contain errors so it is important to
check the results for accuracy. The following resources are useful tools for all writers.

     Publication Manual of the American Psychological Association

     MLA Handbook for Writers of Research Papers

     The Chicago Manual of Style

You can find these three manuals, as well as several others, at the AskUs desk at Evans Library.

Where to Go For Help

Even if you are a very organized person and have diligently collected bibliographic information on all of
the information resources that you consulted during the research process, you may misplace essential
information on a resource. You may think that since you can't find this information, you will be unable

                                                                                                                           8.10
to use it. But there is another option--consult a librarian. Librarians have comprehensive knowledge
about how information is organized and retrieved. They also have a wealth of information resources at
their fingertips. Even if you can't retrace your steps to find the missing data, it is likely that a librarian
will be able to help you find the bibliographic information you need. Librarians can also help you
determine when and how to cite your work. They may even be able to help you navigate citation
generators and reference managers. Librarians at the Texas A&M University Libraries are available to
help you in person, by telephone, and via email and chat. Consult the library website, library.tamu.edu,
for contact information.

                                                                                                                           8.11
                              Citation Formatting13

Most students are familiar with at least one or two citation styles - perhaps you have used MLA format
in the past, or have some experience using Chicago style. There are actually thousands of citation styles.
They typically contain most of the same information, but they each present citation information a little
bit differently. Some citation formats include the author's full name, while others use only initials. Some
citation formats use title case, meaning they capitalize the first letter of every word; other citation
formats use sentence case, in which they only capitalize the first letter of the sentence and any proper
nouns. There are many subtle formatting differences between citation styles, and it takes careful
attention to detail to ensure that you have each of your citations formatted correctly.

In this section, you'll find a set of examples to get you started using two common citation styles:
American Psychological Association, or APA, format, and Modern Languages Association, or MLA,
format. This section is not intended to be a citation manual for either citation style. For in-depth
questions, consult the Publication Manual of the American Psychological Association or the MLA
Handbook.

APA Format

Properly formatted APA citations include two main elements: the reference list entry and the in-text
citation. Below you will find sample citations for a variety of commonly-used reference types. For
additional questions, consult the Publication Manual of the American Psychological Association (6th ed.)

Reference List
The reference list is found at the end of your paper or project, and it includes all of the sources used
when developing your paper or project. References are listed in alphabetical order by the author's last
name, and each reference will have a hanging indent to make it easier to visually distinguish between
each reference.

No Author

If there is no author, the title moves into the place of the author. The reference should then be
alphabetized by the first word in the title within the reference list.

Example:

Down the Line. (1895). In The Olio: An Annual (pp. 54-58). College Station: The Corps of Cadets of the
         Agricultural and Mechanical College of Texas.

Single Author

In APA style, when there is a single author, you should list them with the last name first, followed by the

Two Authors

When there are two authors, list both and connect them with an ampersand (&). Be sure to keep the
authors in the order in which they appear on the source.

Example:

Rutledge, L., & LeMire, S. (2016). Beyond disciplines: Providing outreach to underserved groups by
        demographic. Public Services Quarterly, 12(2), 113-124.
        https://doi.org/10.1080/15228959.2016.1157565

Three to Seven Authors

When there are between three and seven authors, list each one and use an ampersand (&) before the
final author. Be sure to keep the authors in the order in which they appear on the source.

Example:

LeMire, S., Graves, S. J., Hawkins, M., & Kailani, S. (2018). Libr-AR-y Tours: Increasing engagement and
         scalability of library tours using augmented reality. College & Undergraduate Libraries, 25(3),
         261-279. https://doi.org/10.1080/10691316.2018.1480445

More than Seven Authors

When there are more than seven authors, list the first six authors, then add an ellipsis (...) and an
ampersand (&) and list the last author's name. The ellipsis (...) will take the place of author names
between author number 6 and the final author. Be sure to keep the authors in the order in which they
appear on the source.

Example:

Tribble, R. E., Azhari, A., Gagliardi, C. A., Hardy, J. C., Mukhamedzhanov, A., Tang, X., ... & Yennello, S. J.
         (2002). Radioactive beams at Texas A&M University. Nuclear Physics A, 701(1-4), 278-281.

Institutional Author

Sometimes the author isn't a person - instead, it's authored by an organization. In this case, you'll list
the organization as the author.

Example:

                                                                                                                           8.13

Book
Books list the author, followed by the year and the title in italics. APA also includes the place of
publication and the publisher name. If the book is accessed electronically, also include the doi or url.
Example:
Dromgoole, G. (2005). Aggie savvy: practical wisdom from Texas A&M. Abilene, Tex.: State House Press.
Article from Database
Articles from online databases like Google Scholar or EBSCO databases include the author names, year
of publication, and article title in sentence case. The journal title is put in italics, as is the journal volume
number. The issue is in parentheses, followed by the page range. If found electronically, use the direct
object identifier (DOI) if available; if not, use the URL of the journal home page.

Interview

                                                                                                                           8.14
In APA format, an unpublished interview is not included in the reference list. This is because the
interview is not available for the reader to view. Instead, interviews are cited only in-text.

Lecture
In APA format, if you are citing your professor's lecture slides or content, you have two options. If the
slides/content are available online, then you would cite them like other website content (see Website
above). If they are not available online, then you would cite them like other personal communications
(see Interview above).
In-Text Citations
APA in-text citations use the last name(s) of the author, followed by a comma and the year of
publication. If a direct quotation, also include the page number where that quotation can be found. In
APA format, you can also embed the in-text quotation directly into your sentence (e.g. Smith (2001)
found that...) which then obviates the need for a parenthetical at the end of the sentence, except in the
case of a direct quotation.
No Author
As with the reference list, the in-text citation will use the title if there is no author available. Use the first
few words of the title if it is long, and place it in quotation marks.
Example:
("Down the Line," 1895).
Single Author
Example 1 (no direct quotation):
(Clark, 2009)
Example 2 (direct quotation):
(Clark, 2009, p. 42)
Two Authors
When there are two authors, list the last names of both connected by an ampersand. Be sure to keep
the authors in the order in which they appear on the source.
Example:
(Rutledge & LeMire, 2016).
Three to Five Authors

                                                                                                                           8.15
When there are between three and five authors, list each one and use an ampersand (&) before the final
author. Be sure to keep the authors in the order in which they appear on the source.

Example:

         (LeMire, Graves, Hawkins, & Kailani, 2018).

More than Six Authors

When there are more than six authors, list the first author's last name, followed by et al. This is a Latin
phrase meaning "and others" and is used in some citation formats as a way to abbreviate a list of
names.

Example:

(Tribble et al., 2002).

Institutional Author

As with the reference list, you'll list the organization as the author in the in-text citation.

Example:

(Texas A&M University, 2019).

MLA Format

Just like APA format, properly formatted MLA citations include two main elements: the works cited
entry and the in-text citation. Below you will find sample citations for a variety of commonly-used
reference types. For additional questions, consult the MLA Handbook (8th ed).

Works Cited
The Works Cited page operates just like the Reference list in APA format. It is found at the end of your
paper or project, and it includes all of the sources used when developing your paper or project.
References are listed in alphabetical order by the author's last name, and each reference will have a
hanging indent to make it easier to visually distinguish between each reference.

No Author

If there is no author, the title moves into the place of the author. The reference should then be
alphabetized by the first word in the title within the reference list.

Example:

         "Down the Line." The Olio: An Annual, The Corps of Cadets of the Agricultural and Mechanical
         College of Texas, 1895, pp. 54-58.

Single Author

                                                                                                                           8.16
In MLA style, when there is a single author, you should list them with the last name first, followed by the
full first and (if available) middle name or initial.

Example:

Clark, Dennis T. "Lending Kindle e-Book Readers: First Results from the Texas A&M University Project."
         Collection Building, vol. 28, no. 4, 2009, pp. 146-149. Google Scholar,
         doi:10.1108/01604950910999774.

Two Authors

When there are two authors, the first author with their last name first, followed by their first name and
(if available) middle name or initial. The name order is reversed with the second author, and the word
and connects the two. Be sure to keep the authors in the order in which they appear on the source.

Example:

Rutledge, Lorelei, and Sarah LeMire. "Beyond Disciplines: Providing Outreach to Underserved Groups by
        Demographic." Public Services Quarterly, vol. 12, no. 2, 2016, pp. 113-124. Library and
        Information Science Source, doi:10.1080/15228959.2016.1157565.

Three or More Authors

When there are more than three authors, list the first author's last name, followed by et al. This is a
Latin phrase meaning "and others" and is used in some citation formats as a way to abbreviate a list of
names.

Example:

         LeMire, Sarah, et al. "Libr-AR-y Tours: Increasing engagement and scalability of library tours
         using augmented reality." College & Undergraduate Libraries, vol. 25, no. 3, 2018, pp. 261-279.
         Google Scholar, doi:10.1080/10691316.2018.1480445.

Institutional Author

Sometimes the author isn't a person - instead, it's authored by an organization. In this case, you'll list
the organization as the author. If the organization and the publisher are the same, only list the
organization as the publisher and use the title as the author.

Example:

Stats in Brief: What High Schoolers and Their Parents Know about Public 4-year Tuition. U.S. Department
         of Education, Institute of Education Sciences, National Center for Education Statistics, Nov.
         2018.

                                                                                                                           8.17
In MLA format, books list the author, followed by the title in italics. MLA, unlike APA, does not typically
include the place of publication. If the book is accessed electronically, note that it is an e-book (usually
after the title).
Example:
Dromgoole, Glenn. Aggie Savvy: Practical Wisdom from Texas A&M, State House Press, 2005.
Article from Database
You will commonly access articles from online databases like Google Scholar or EBSCO databases, as
opposed to finding them directly via a journal or in print. In this case, MLA format requires that you
include the name of the article, name of the journal, and the name of the database in your citation.
Example:
Rutledge, Lorelei, and Sarah LeMire. "Beyond Disciplines: Providing Outreach to Underserved Groups by

        Demographic." Public Services Quarterly, vol. 12, no. 2, 2016, pp. 113-124. Library and
        Information Science Source, doi:10.1080/15228959.2016.1157565.

    NOTE: It can be tricky to figure out which database your source came from. If you're searching in
    the library's Quick Search, the database will show up right in your results list.

Interview
Unlike APA style, MLA does include unpublished interviews in the Works Cited. Key details to include are
the name of the person interviewed and the date of the interview.
Example:
Anders, Kathy. Personal interview. 14 Jul. 2019.
Lecture
MLA format also includes lectures and lecture slides in the Works Cited.
Example:
Pantuso, Terri. "Visual Rhetoric." English 104, 10 Sept. 2019, Texas A&M University. Lecture.
In-Text Citations
MLA in-text citations use the last name(s) of the author followed by a space and the page number for
the source material, when available. Only use the page number if the source is paginated (e.g. a book
chapter or article that has a page number in the corner). Do not include a page number for web sources
that are not paginated.
In MLA format, you can also embed the author name directly into your sentence (e.g. Smith found
that...), in which case the parenthetical at the end of the sentence should include only the page number.
No Author
As with the Works Cited entry, the in-text citation will use the title if there is no author available. Use
the first few words of the title if it is long, and place it in quotation marks.
Example:
("Down the Line" 56).
Single Author
Example:
(Clark 146)

                                                                                                                           8.19
Two Authors
When there are two authors, list the last names of both connected by an ampersand. Be sure to keep
the authors in the order in which they appear on the source.
Example:
(Rutledge and LeMire 113).
Three or More Authors
When there are more than three authors, list the first author's last name, followed by et al. This is a
Latin phrase meaning "and others" and is used in some citation formats as a way to abbreviate a list of
names
Example:

         (LeMire et al. 261).
Institutional Author
As with the reference list, you'll list the organization as the author in the in-text citation.
Example 1 (document is paginated):
(Texas A&M University 14).
Example 2 (document is not paginated):
(Texas A&M University).

                                                                                                                           8.20
