Introduction to Strategies for
Conducting Literary Research

BARRY MAUER AND JOHN VENECEK

We discuss the following topics on this page:
  · Introduction
  · Meet Jada
  · Scaffolding and Transference
  · The Complexity of Literary Study
  · Course Learning Objectives

Introduction

Welcome to Strategies for Conducting Literary Research! This book walks you through
the process of conducting literary research while helping to refine your library skills. Along
the way, we draw from the Association of College and Research Libraries (ACRL) Informa­
tion Literacy Framework. According to the ACRL, "Research is iterative and depends upon
asking increasingly complex or new questions whose answers lead to additional questions
or lines of inquiry in any field." Here, the word "iterative" means we repeat the process,
refining and improving our work. We discuss the research process in-depth throughout the
book. The book also focuses on a research project created by Jada, an English major who
conducted a literary study of James Baldwin's classic short story, "Sonny's Blues."

                                                                                             Introduction to Strategies for Conducting Literary Research | 1
Though we describe research into "Sonny's Blues" throughout this book, we also discuss
ways you can transfer these lessons to your own research about literature. Start by reading
"Sonny's Blues" in its original context: the Summer 1957 issues of Partisan Review. The story
begins on page 327 and ends on page 358.

Meet Jada

Jada Reyes graduated from UCF with a bachelor's degree in English/Creative Writing. She
is currently in the Elementary Education MA program at UCF. When she's not teaching
she can be found reading, writing, drawing, or catching up on sleep. We will follow her
through the research process to see how her project about Baldwin's "Sonny's Blues"
evolved as she conducted an in-depth literature review while mastering the use of library
resources. As you read these chapters, you should extrapolate from Jada's example and
apply it to your own research.

Scaffolding and Transference

Before we begin this course, let's review two important and interconnected concepts that
we'll reinforce throughout these chapters: Scaffolding and Transference.

Scaffolding: This refers to the way in which researchers build increasingly complex and
sophisticated skills atop a solid foundation or framework of basic principles and work up
from there. In other words, each idea or skill presented in this course should not be viewed
as an isolated or standalone concept. We've designed this course to begin with basic or
core principles, such as understanding an assignment, before moving into more complex
concepts, such as writing and evaluating a research question.

Think of each chapter as one step in a scaffold designed to elevate your research skills. Also
note this process won't be strictly linear. It will be gradual and will require you to pause at
various steps to reflect on what you've learned, how all the pieces fit together, and where
you're going next. Ideally, you will build confidence and become more self-directed and
intentional as you move through the course and higher up the scaffold.

Once you have a solid foundation in place, you can apply your foundational knowledge to
new concepts, which leads us to our next point.

Transference: We've noticed in previous classes that students often understand the con-
cepts presented here, and even the scaffolding approach, but not the all-important next
step: to apply their skills to the assignment, which is what educators call transference.

Much like scaffolding, transference is a form of structural learning that promotes cognitive
growth by teaching students to apply, or transfer, knowledge and skills from one context to
another. In "Transference of Learning," Paul Main states that this is a form of active learning
that requires "careful orchestration." He likens it to "the art of connecting dots that seem
unrelated but form a beautiful pattern when aligned."

He further adds that transference is "transference of learning is not just a concept but a
symphony of cognitive skills, understanding, and adaptability." So, what does this mean for
us?

                                                                                             Introduction to Strategies for Conducting Literary Research | 3
While you work through this course, and you focus on building and scaffolding your skills,
keep in mind that the next step will be the application of those skills to an actual research
project... and that research project may serve as the foundation for future research projects.
Remember that the skills we present throughout this course do not exist in silos, they are
part of a holistic learning environment in which we are always building new and increas-
ingly complex skills that can be transferred from one context to another.

The Complexity of Literary Studies Research

In a research-based course, your instructor might require you to write a research paper of
5-6 or 10-12 pages, but the knowledge you need to perform this task can fill up hundreds
of pages. Writing about literature is a complicated, often messy process; it needs to meet
high standards while incorporating knowledge from other fields such as psychology, his-
tory, science, and other arts. It entails knowledge about language, genre, structures, styles,
and more. To produce good research about literature, we need to know a lot of things about
a lot of things!
Although we discuss the research process in a linear fashion throughout these chapters,
you'll find that in practice literary research is a highly recursive process. We're constantly
circling back through the process as we write. Because writing instructors - even those who
wrote this book - are locked into presenting the writing process in a linear way, we tend
to discuss it in terms of stages such as preliminary research, drafting, revising, and so on.
But writing a research paper requires us to rethink and redo our work at any stage. It's not
uncommon for researchers to be in the middle of proofreading - one of the final stages -
and realize they need to go back and gather more materials. Though this book focuses on
research about literature, the skills and knowledge in these chapters apply to many other
areas and topics, especially in the humanities.

Chapter 1 Objectives

BARRY MAUER AND JOHN VENECEK

This chapter introduces key aspects of the research process: understanding the assign-
ment, types of research projects, and conducting preliminary research. While understand-
ing the assignment may seem simple, it is frequently overlooked by students who often
jump into research without a full understanding of the parameters of the project. This
chapter will help you understand assignment prompts, guidelines, and expectations as well
as types of literary research papers, intended audience, and the purpose of the project.
In Conducting Preliminary Research, we discuss all that goes into this early inventive stage
of the research process. Topics include how to conduct "pre-research" to investigate pos-
sible topics, why it's a good idea to talk with experts, how to understand what types of
resources you will need and where to find them, time management, setting benchmarks,
and more. Preliminary research sets the foundation for more in-depth research.

Our research projects start with a series of tasks. Each chapter will introduce a new task or
set of tasks that - when completed - will provide you with most of the materials for your
final research project. In this chapter, we have two sets of tasks: project tasks and organiza-
tion tasks. The flow chart below provides you with pre-research project steps. Keep track of

12 | Chapter 1 Objectives
what you have done for each step and look back at the whole thing to see how the tasks
relate to one another.

In addition to project tasks, you also should complete the following organization tasks;
these tasks help you to organize yourself and your work and will set you up for success!

                                                                                                                                                       Chapter 1 Objectives | 13
14 | Chapter 1 Objectives
        Learning Objectives

Focus on the most basic aspects of the research process. By reading this chapter
and responding to the related discussion prompts, you will learn to

     · understand the assignment before you start researching.
     · focus on problems and relevance rather than on general topics.
     · talk with experts in your field and with your subject librarian.
     · set benchmarks and take lots of notes.
Being diligent about this early stage will save you time later and decrease your
stress throughout the rest of your research project.

                                                                                                                                               Chapter 1 Objectives | 15

Introduction

Be sure you fully understand your instructor's assignment before you begin your research.
If there are terms in the assignment you don't understand or methods you don't yet know
how to do, you will need to obtain this knowledge as soon as possible. The best source for
information about your assignment is the person who gave the assignment (usually your
instructor). For additional help understanding the assignment, visit the UCF Writing Center
and/or the Student Academic Resource Center (SARC).
Jada's assignment was to write a 10-12 page paper that analyzed a work of literature (she

16 | Understanding the Assignment
chose James Baldwin's "Sonny's Blues") while employing two schools of criticism and cit-
ing five scholarly sources using the MLA format. This is a fairly common but deceptively
complex literary studies research assignment. Instructors might also stipulate that your
research includes biographical or historical information about your chosen subject. Other
kinds of research can include textual analysis, comparative readings, genre studies, or the-
ory-based approaches. We discuss various theories and methods in future chapters. For
now, we will discuss four major types of research projects: interpretive, critical, historical,
and creative.

Intended Audience for the Project

Audience awareness is an important aspect of good writing (and one we will discuss many
times throughout this course). If your instructor does not stipulate an intended audience,
assume you are writing for a journal of literary studies and that your classmates, or other
students and literary scholars, are your imagined audience. It can be tempting to think of
your instructor as your audience since they will be reading and grading your paper. How-
ever, you should avoid doing so, unless told otherwise. Rather, think of your instructor as
an editor who gives an assignment and evaluates your work for publication. The true "audi-
ence" in this case would be the readers of your real or imagined journal.
Different journals and conferences favor certain kinds of research over others and you
should explore a few journals to see what kinds of research they publish. It is useful to
review the submission guidelines for various literary journals and conferences to find out
what kinds of research they prefer. Many journals publish articles with very specific for-
matting and methodology requirements, and learning about them can provide insight to
beginning researchers. By studying the field, you can also be more prepared if, or when,
you're considering graduate school or thinking about writing beyond class assignments.
Publishing and presenting on a more professional level awaits!

Purpose of the Project

Most literary research projects aim to persuade an audience to accept the conclusion
you've reached. Thus, you want to make a well-supported argument to convince your
reader to adopt your understanding, and not some other understanding. The research
methods you choose (and your effectiveness in using them) will determine whether you
succeed. We discuss research goals and methods further in Chapter 4. For now, reread the
assignment you've been given for your research project. Sometimes your instructor will be
explicit about your research purpose and other times they will leave it up to you. Be sure
you understand what your parameters are, and ask for clarification if you're not sure.

Understanding the Assignment Prompts, Guidelines, and
Expectations

It's common to begin a research project with a broad topic that you refine and focus
throughout your research. Jada's journey started with a general interest in James Baldwin's
short story, "Sonny's Blues," but became a more clear, complex, and focused question that
drove her research.
First, Jada needed to know the parameters of the assignment. Instructors may provide a
specific prompt focused on a particular literary work, an author, a literary form, a historical
period, a theme, a theory, a method, or some other aspect of literary studies. Or, the instruc-
tor may offer a choice of prompts. The instructor may require that your project argue for or
against a certain proposition. Alternatively, the instructor may leave the assignment open-
ended, requiring students to identify their own topic and produce their own prompt (oth-
erwise known as a research question).

18 | Understanding the Assignment
  In addition, the instructor may list other requirements for your research project such as
  page length, number and type of sources, citation format, style guidelines, etc. Be sure to
  familiarize yourself with all these requirements before you begin your project; you don't
  want to get to the deadline only to realize you needed five more citations, your paper is five
  pages too short, and you don't know the difference between MLA and APA formats. The
  best source for information about the research project guidelines is your instructor. If you
  have questions about the assignment or just want to go over the requirements before you
  begin your work, please ask your instructor for help. They are there to help you!

               · Beware of straying. Especially in the draft stage, "discussion" and "analy-
                  sis" can lead you from one intrinsically interesting problem to another,
                  then another, and then ... You may wind up following a garden of forking
                  paths and lose your way. To prevent this, stop periodically while drafting
                  your essay and reread the assignment. Its purposes are likely to become
                  clearer.
               · Consider the assignment in relation to previous and upcoming assign­
                  ments. Ask yourself what is new about the task you're setting out to do.
                  Instructors often design assignments to build in complexity. Knowing
                  where an assignment falls in this progression can help you concentrate on
                  the specific, fresh challenges at hand.

The Role of Analysis in Research Projects

Research projects should make an argument, which should not be confused with an
analysis. An analysis does not necessarily pose any arguments. Any research project must
include some analysis, but this analysis must be used to support an interpretive, critical, or
historical claim/argument (or to give a creative work some rhetorical function).
Analytical work will help you better understand a literary text. The goal of analysis is to
describe what type a text is, how it functions, what its parts or elements are, and how it
achieves its effects. You must do an analysis, but you should not stop there; an analysis is a
necessary part of creating an argument. Later in this course, we will discuss how you use
analysis to build your arguments.

  · Exercises [Discussion]

Your instructor may ask you to produce only one specific type, or allow you to choose
among several. Please consult with your instructor if you are unsure what kind of project is
acceptable.

Introduction

Researchers begin each project by considering the following questions:

  · What is the purpose of my research?
  · What are the specific hypotheses (claims) or research questions that my work

      explores?
  · What pertinence does my research have for others? Another way of posing the ques-

      tion is to ask: what contributions does my proposed study make to the field? This
      question is often answered by providing a review of existing scholarly literature and
      then demonstrating how your work fills a gap or in other ways clarifies or extends the
      work of others.

Research projects also include the following elements:

  1. A specific description of the problem or topic being studied, and a summary of the
      argument and its supporting elements, including any necessary definitions.

 2. A statement of the significance of the problem or topic.
 3. A review of the scholarly literature on the topic.
 4. An explanation of the methodology and theoretical approach of the study, describing

      what information is used, how it is applied to the topic of study, and why the method-
      ology and theoretical approach were chosen.
 5. A list of works cited and annotated (annotated bibliography) that provides complete
      information for each reference mentioned in the literature review.

Research projects are interrogative, meaning that they develop out of questions. The
researcher engages with the materials (the literary text, primary and secondary sources,
etc.) and asks questions about them such as whether X is true, what X means, whether X

24 | Types of Research Projects
is good or relevant, etc. The answers lead to another set of questions and so on and on.
Research projects are also imaginative, meaning that the researcher wishes to make a cer-
tain kind of project and labors to develop it. Imaginative thinking requires "what if" ques-
tions. What if we perceive a literary text from another perspective? What if we focus on a
secondary character? What if we use a new research method?

Interpretive Research Projects

An interpretive research project declares:
  · what a text means,
  · what its major themes are, and
  · what morals or lessons the reader should draw from it.

            Example [Interpretive]

     An example of an interpretive claim is found in Frank Kermode's interpretation of
     Jesus' parable about the Sower of Seeds:

            "For to him who has will more be given; and from him who has not, even
            what he has will be taken away." To divine the true, the latent sense, you
            need to be of the elect, of the institution. Outsiders must content them­
            selves with the manifest, and pay a supreme penalty for doing so. Only

                                                                                                                                             Types of Research Projects | 25
               those who already know the mysteries--what the stories really mean--can
               discover what the stories really mean. (2-3)

  Note that Kermode's interpretation of Jesus' parable is in conflict with other potential inter-
  pretations such as the claim that Jesus meant for his message to be heard and understood

                                1

  by everyone.
  For more information about interpretive research projects, read "Interpreting Literary
  Works" in Chapter 5.

  Critical Research Projects

  A critical research project:
     · evaluates a text by applying standards of quality to the work, and
     · judges it against those standards.

  sity Press, 1979.
  26 | Types of Research Projects
              Example [Critical]

       An example of a critical research project is found in Edward Said's Culture and
       Imperialism. In Said's reading of the novel Heart of Darkness, by Joseph Conrad, he
       sees Conrad as criticizing imperialism, but failing to call for its end. Said writes:

               But Marlow and Kurtz are also creatures of their time and cannot take the
               next step, which would be to recognise that what they saw, disablingly and
               disparagingly, as a non-European `darkness' was in fact a non-European
               world resisting imperialism so as one day to regain sovereignty and inde­
               pendence, and not, as Conrad reductively says, to reestablish the darkness.
               Conrad's tragic limitation is that even though he could see clearly that on
               one level imperialism was essentially pure dominance and land-grabbing,
               he could not then conclude that imperialism had to end so that `natives'
               could lead lives free from European domination. As a creature of his time,
               Conrad could not grant the natives their freedom, despite his severe critique

                                                                                                                           2

               of the imperialism that enslaved them. (30)

  Though Said recognizes that Conrad was a product of his time (the novel was published
  in 1899), he praises Conrad for his insights while criticizing him for his limitations. Said's
  criticism depends on a series of propositions about what counts as "good" literature about
  imperialism. We might summarize Said's propositions this way:

    1. Literature about imperialism should identify imperialism as domination, violence, and
        slavery.

    2. Literature about imperialism should recognize that native efforts to preserve their
        identities is resistance.

2. Said, Edward W., and Said, Edward William. Culture and imperialism. United Kingdom, Vintage Books, 1994.

                                                                                                                                                Types of Research Projects | 27
 3. Literature about imperialism should call for an end to imperialism.
Heart of Darkness meets the first criteria but not the last two. We might disagree with
Said's criteria, but if so, we should be prepared to say what other criteria should be used.
Note that Said is not criticizing the quality of the prose (he praises it). His primary concern
is whether the literature supports or opposes imperialism.

Chapter 5.

Historical Research Projects

A historical research project presents an argument about:
  · historical factors impacting the production, distribution, and reception of a literary
      work, and
  · defining an object of study and a purpose, then collecting, reading, and analyzing
      your source materials.

The reading should be both wide-ranging and intensive, and your critical judgment is
required in the process. The way to maintain focus is to keep in mind the purpose of your
study and the questions that you seek to answer. Your bibliography should include all the
works referenced in your thesis.

28 | Types of Research Projects
              Example [Historical]

       An example of a historical research project can be found below in a paper by Mad­
       dison McGann, who argues that serialization -- the publication of novels in install­
       ments in periodicals -- changed the relationship among authors, readers, and
       critics.

               The fact that critics like Poe were writing and publishing `alternative end­
               ings' at the same time as they were reading the novel suggests that reading
               a serial novel in the mid-nineteenth century was neither a predetermined
               nor a passive experience; rather, it was a "choose your own adventure" game
               that allowed for unspoken collaboration to take place between authors and
               readers. The serial novel (and its subsequent shift in reviewing) enabled
               readers to become creators as well as consumers, thus changing the way

                                                                                                                                                                                                   3

               that novels were read and received in mid-nineteenth-century Britain. (79)

  McGann's research explores the real historical events upon which Dickens based his novel,
  Dickens' production of the novel in serial form, and its reception by literary critics of his time
  such as the scathing reviews of Dickens' work penned by Edgar Allen Poe.

   Dickens' Barnaby Rudge." Iowa Journal of Cultural Studies 20 (2020): 72-79.

Creative Research Projects

The idea for a creative research project, such as a short story, play, poem, or other creative
text based on scholarly research about a literary work, must be determined in consultation
with the professor. However, for acceptance, a creative project must include at least the fol­
lowing elements:

  · An explanation of why the specific form and genre were selected.
  · A bibliography of all references used in the development of the creative thesis.
  · A clear description of the nature, scope, and substance of the final creative product.

      For example, a dramatic adaptation that takes an alternate view of events.
  · A discussion of the major elements of the craft used and how they will achieve certain

      aims or effects.
A creative research project has interrogatory components, which means that the
researcher still asks critical questions and pursues answers to them, but creative research
projects privilege invention over critique. In other words, the researcher must craft a
response that goes beyond the traditional essay and does more "showing" than "telling."

            Example [Creative]

     An example of a creative research project is Connie Porter's "Rapunzel across Time
     and Space."

            Maybe, once upon a time, the moon did show her other face, proudly, boldly,

30 | Types of Research Projects
               for just one night. It shone down on Earth below just as the other side does,
               bathed in silver light, brilliant in its fullness. But this face was dismissed for
               being what it was not--just like the other side. Since that night the moon
               turned that face forevermore into the darkness of space refusing to let any­
               one on Earth see it and was called fickle. She was hurt by being made fun of,
               for being called fickle and sang out her sorrow from the dark side of her
               face. People hear her voice on windless nights. Part of a chorus people used
               to call the music of the spheres. Its beauty haunts us, draws us to look up
               into the sky at night.
               We want to hear her voice more clearly, but the moon will never turn its
               other face to us again. We will have to cross time and space to pull ourselves
               into her life, make a ladder of our own hair. Nappy. Curly. Straight. Braided.
               Dreaded. We will have to shave our own heads, all of us become baldheaded
               and beautiful, weaving a ladder that stretches to her to hear the full beauty
               of her voice, to see the beauty of the face cloaked in darkness. We will feel
               the power of her tears as they fall into our eyes. Though not blind, we will see
               that she was never the one who was fickle. We were. Then we will all live

                                                                                                           4

               happily ever after. End of story. (282)

  In her work, Porter -- a black female author -- writes about an event in which she heard
  one of her readers use the word "baldheaded" to insult one of Porter's fictional characters,
  a young black girl with short hair. The insult inspired Porter to rethink the familiar Rapunzel
  tale to see what it teaches us about hair, beauty, gender, and race. In re-reading "Rapunzel,"
  Porter discovered that the prince is attracted not to Rapunzel's hair but to her voice. Her
  hair is merely a means to an end: a rope for him to climb. Porter's work is a creative hybrid;
  she reworks the "Rapunzel" story into something that is part personal essay, part literary
  research, and part polemic. She argues that we should encourage black girls to speak and
  that we should listen to them and appreciate their voices. By retelling the story, Porter does
  more than just tell us an argument about "Rapunzel"; she shows us what she learned about
  it and what it means to her.

Suggested guidelines when doing a creative research project:
  1. The introduction should discuss the literary theory or theories you are using, how you
      used them to read the literary work, and what your creative project is in relation to
      your research question.
 2. The creative project is part of your research method in that it helps you answer your
      research question. For instance, let's say we were wondering what impact gender has
      in the "Sleeping Beauty" stories by the Brothers Grimm. One way to find out might be
      to switch the genders of the main characters and see what results.
 3. The conclusion explains what you discovered or what resulted from the creative work.

Introduction

Sometimes called "pre-research," preliminary research is an inventive stage in which you
investigate possible topics of interest. For example, once you fully understand your assign-
ment, the next step might be to conduct some background research online, or talk to
friends and classmates. However, while it's a good idea to try out your ideas with non-
experts, the real test is to try them out with experts. If your ideas are not fully formed yet,
you can ask experts to help guide you in the right direction. Undergraduate students often
overlook this strategy, but it can be incredibly effective and it can lead to good research top-
ics and resources. Let's take a closer look at some more preliminary research strategies.

34 | Conducting Preliminary Research
Preliminary Research Strategies

Consider using some of the ideas below:

            · Explore Literary Studies Journals: Scholars share their work through
                many venues, but the most important is peer-reviewed scholarly journals
                in their field. Princeton keeps a list of some of the most important literary
                studies journals. Imagine yourself as a future contributor to one of these
                journals!

            · Work with a Mentor: A mentor is someone who can help and guide you as
                a scholar during the research process. Mentorship can take many forms;
                UCF offers many mentorship programs such as the Research And Mentor-
                ing Program (RAMP), McNair Scholars Program, Honors Undergraduate
                Thesis (HUT), and the Office of Undergraduate Research (OUR). Many of
                these offer financial and logistical support to students.

            · Delve into the Invention Stage: This can be a messy process, so keep a
                notebook to jot down ideas and questions as they occur to you. You'll need
                to develop a research question, so those notes may come in handy later.
                Also, think about what types of sources you'll need to complete your pro-
                ject. The assignment may specify certain types, such as scholarly mono­
                graphs and journal articles, but what else might you need? What about
                media and other primary sources? Where would you find them? Should
                you explore digital archives or make an appointment with an archivist?

            · Manage your Time: Think about time-management and set milestones.
                Even though pulling all-nighters is a rite of passage for college students,
                your stress will be greatly reduced (and the quality of your research
                enhanced) if you're not racing to finish everything at the last minute. Be
                sure to keep those milestones simple and achievable so you don't get
                overwhelmed by unrealistic goals. We encourage you to use a planner!

                                                                                                                                  Conducting Preliminary Research | 35
            · Investigate Professional Organizations: Many famous authors have orga-
                nizations dedicated to their legacy. One of these is The William Faulkner
                Society, which assembles lists of scholarly journals, conferences and con-
                ventions, research centers and information sources, and interdisciplinary
                university institutes. Many such organizations also provide scholarships for
                students. Look through the contents of author societies' websites, as well
                as recent journals and conference proceedings, to help you generate ideas
                for your own research.

            · Talk to Experts: Finally, ask for help! You're attending a large university
                where you're surrounded by highly educated people. Don't be afraid to
                schedule appointments and conduct interviews with them. Also, consider
                meeting with the subject librarian in your major to get an overview of key
                resources and tools available at the library.

Taking time to work through the preliminary research process will set the foundation for
everything that comes after, and it will make your job easier.

A word about mentorship: having a mentor (whether faculty or peer) will vastly improve
your experience as a researcher. Even many experienced researchers have their own men-
tors because they understand the value that comes with being a mentee. If you plan to
work with a mentor, keep in mind a few points:

  · If you are having difficulty with the research, put in some work on your own to address
      the problem before going to your mentor, The mentor's job is to help you, not to do
      the work for you.

  · Ask your mentor about their own research process so you can better understand the
      tasks and skills involved.

  · Keep a positive attitude; even if you feel like you do not yet have the necessary knowl-
      edge or skills, tell yourself that you are in the learning stage and that you are doing
      your best.

  · Recognize that a mentor is there to help but may not be able to meet all your needs.
      Take ownership of your own learning and research.

  · It is okay to seek mentorship from more than one person.

          The goal of Preliminary Research is not necessarily to become an authority on a
          specific topic so much as to identify conversation chatter: across disciplines,
          what are experts talking about? And, ultimately, if given a choice, what interests
          you the most? Preliminary Research could involve

               · discussions with friends about ideas.
               · interviews with experts, bosses, clients, and teachers.
               · scanning a wikipedia page or Google search
               · skimming over documents to learn about the genres and research meth-

                  ods of particular discourse communities/community of practice.

38 | Conducting Preliminary Research
       Finding Scholars

Throughout these chapters we have been emphasizing the idea of scholarship as conver-
sation. This notion extends beyond the written paper to the entire research process, and
nowhere is it more important than during your literature review! Just to reiterate this point,
here are a few ideas to consider:

  · Talk To Your Instructor: Don't be afraid to talk to your instructor at different stages of
      your research. This is a good way to stay on track, make sure the scope and purpose of
      your project are on target, and to make sure you're finding the right types of sources.
      Your instructor may also know about important books or articles you haven't discov-
      ered yet as well as key researchers or theorists who work in your area:

  · Meet with a Librarian: University and college libraries usually offer a research consul-
      tation service. It is recommended to schedule an appointment as early in the process
      as possible. Consultations generally focus on the same search strategies discussed
      throughout this course, but they will be tailored to your individual needs/project.

  · Interview an Expert: Whether at your university or someone you've discovered during
      your literature review, consider setting up an informational interview. To get started,
      introduce yourself, briefly describe your research project, explain why you're contact-
      ing them, and request an interview or assistance with a specific research problem. You
      might not get a response from everyone, but you'll be surprised how willing estab-
      lished researchers are to talk to student scholars who show initiative.

The best way to find scholars to talk to about your work is to look through the scholarly liter-
ature and identify the authors of the work you like. You can also look through the citations
in their works to identify other authors. Then you can look up those people online. Most
researchers are affiliated with institutions like universities and they have email addresses
you can find on their faculty webpage. You can write to them at their institution, share your
interest in their work, and ask for a consultation. Another approach is to contact experts
through commercial websites like Academia.edu and Researchgate.com. You can search
for experts by topic and contact them through the site. Not all scholars check their mes-

                                                                                                                                                                                      | 39
sages through the site, however, so sometimes you have to search for an alternate email
address or keep looking for other scholars.

Exercises

1. List three things you have researched (they don't have to be related to school projects).
    Discuss your experiences with any of the research you listed. Which parts did you
    enjoy the most? Where did you have the most difficulty? Did you find what you were
    looking for? How valuable was the information and the experience?

2. Capture some basic facts and considerations about three literary works (an academic
    literary anthology is a good place to look). The purpose of this assignment is to choose
    a literary work (or works) that you might wish to research for your final research pro-
    ject. The three works don't have to have any relation to one another, and you are not
    committing to any of them for your final project. You can decide to choose something
    else or change your mind later.

Title of   Author  Publication  Literary  Nation or  Brief  Initial
literary           date         genre /   region of
work                            theme     author     description thoughts

Feel free to use a grid format, as above, or just make a list of these items under each
entry.

   Sometimes the publication date is tricky - a work might have remained unpub-
      lished for a long period of time. If so, note when it was written (approximately) and
      then published. Sometimes a work may have been revised and republished. If so,
      indicate the publication date of the version you read (its original publication date,
      and not the publication date of the anthology).

   Literary genre refers to whether a work is a novel, short story, drama, poem, para-
      ble, allegory, non-fiction, essay, folk or fairy tale, sacred text, children's literature, or
      memoir. Additionally, literary themes can be part of genres as in comedy, tragedy,
      lyric, epic, detective or crime stories, science fiction, supernatural, historical, etc.
      These are not strict categories and a work may combine more than one.

   Nation or region of author can be tricky as well. For instance, an author may write
      in a country far from where they were born and/or raised. Or they may be born in a
      country that is divided by region. Note anything significant about the author's
      place(s).

   The brief description is just a sentences or a few sentences to indicate what the
      literature is about. It does not need to include a plot summary or a complete list of
      characters and themes. For example, we could say that Homer's Odyssey is the

                                                                                                                                                                               | 41
   story of a hero and the obstacles he faces on his journey home from war.
 Initial thoughts are just that: thoughts upon a first reading. These could be about

   things you notice, things you like or dislike, things that intrigue you, things that
   are confusing, things that are mysteries, things that are easy or difficult, elements
   of the texts such as style, voice, meter, diction, etc. The idea is to identify some
   things you might want to research.

3. Capture some basic facts and considerations about two works of literary theory or crit-
    icism. Select two works of literary criticism or theory (from any anthologies or stand
    alone works). The purpose of this assignment is to get a sense of how and why such
    works are written.

Title  Author(s) Publication Major theory or date type of criticism  Nation or  Brief  Initial
of                                                                   region of
work                                                                 author(s)  description thoughts

      Feel free to use a grid format, as above, or just make a list of these items under each
      entry.

         Sometimes the publication date is tricky - a work might have remained unpub-
            lished for a long period of time. If so, note when it was written (approximately) and
            then published. Sometimes a work may have been revised and republished. If so,
            indicate the publication date of the version you read (its original publication date,
            and not the publication date of the anthology).

         Major theory or type of criticism refers to the major literary theories (Marxist, fem-
            inist, post-colonial, formal, historical, linguistic, audience studies, structuralist,
            post-structuralist, etc.) or the themes or issues being addressed. These are not
            strict categories and a work may combine more than one.

         Nation or region of author can be tricky as well. For instance, an author may write
            in a country far from where they were born and/or raised. Or they may be born in a
            country that is divided by region. Note anything significant about the author's
            place(s).

         The brief description is just a sentences or a few sentences to indicate what the
            literary criticism or theory is about. It does not need to include a summary of the
            whole argument, but should include the major claim(s).

         Initial thoughts are just that: thoughts upon a first reading. These could be about

Calls for Papers

BARRY MAUER AND JOHN VENECEK

We discuss the following topics on this page:
  · Calls for Papers
  · Sample Call for Papers (CFP)

We also provide the following activity:
  · Calls for Papers Refresher

Calls for Papers

A "call for papers" (or CFP) is a request from a professional journal, conference, or other
forum asking scholars to submit research, usually about a particular theme or subject. The
CFP from a particular journal or other entity may pose a research question or series of ques-
tions that scholars should address in their work. Along with the theme and research ques-
tion, the CFP usually stipulates the length of the project (typically in word count or length
of presentation), and other guidelines such as style (MLA, APA, Chicago, etc.).
As a scholar in literary studies, you can respond to a CFP, meaning you aim to get your
research published in a literary studies journal. Addressing your paper to a CFP goes a long
way to helping you solve the problems of audience (you are writing to the audience that
reads the literary studies journal), of purpose (you are addressing the purpose put forth by
the CFP), and form (the CFP will specify things like length, style, etc.).

44 | Calls for Papers
Most CFPs in literary studies ask for proposals or abstract submissions before consideration
of complete papers. An abstract is a brief overview of the work. A typical request is for an
abstract of 300-500 words. If the abstract is approved, you will receive an invitation request-
ing a completed work by a particular deadline.
Beginning and intermediate scholars who wish to continue in the field should familiarize
themselves with a variety of CFPs. Doing so allows you to see what topics are currently
being discussed, what kinds of guidelines researchers must follow for their work to be pub-
lished, and what journals and professional platforms are available.
Below are some sites that host CFPs.

       Web Resources
            · UPenn [https://call-for-papers.sas.upenn.edu/]
            · HNet [https://networks.h-net.org]
            · WikiCFP [http://www.wikicfp.com/cfp/call?conference=humanities]
            · CFPList [https://www.cfplist.com/]
            · Commlist [http://commlist.org/]

The people creating CFPs want to host a discussion, either in a live forum or in media such
as print. They are inviting scholars - like you - to join that discussion. Note that conferences
commonly charge registration fees for presenters (some costing hundreds of dollars), and
some scholarly journals - particularly Open Access ones (open Access means they do not
charge their readers) - require steep fees to publish. Such fees cover costs associated with
hosting and publishing. Discounts are often available for students, and many educational
institutions will subsidize student authors and presenters. If you want to present or publish
your research but costs seem prohibitive, ask your institution if financial help is available.
Many institutions are proud to support the work of their students researchers and they get
to bask in the glow of your reflected glory.

                                                                                                                                                             Calls for Papers | 45
Let's look at a sample CFP.

      Special Issue of Steinbeck Review: Steinbeck, Race, and Ethnicity

               This CFP is for a special issue and asks for research that addresses
               themes of race and ethnicity in relation to Steinbeck. Not all CFPs are
               for special issues and some do not specify themes, which means they
               are open to a greater variety of proposals. If you were to submit a
               proposal in response to this CFP, you would need to highlight the
               ways in which your research addresses the themes.

         Categories: American, Interdisciplinary, Popular Culture, African-American, Colonial, Revolution
         & Early National, Transcendentalists, 1865-1914, 20th & 21st Century, Aesthetics, Anthropology/
         Sociology, Classical Studies, Cultural Studies, Environmental Studies, Film, TV, & Media, Food
         Studies, History, Philosophy

               "Categories" refers to the places on a CFP webpage in which the CFP
               is being listed. Not all the categories listed above, such as Classical
               Studies, fit the theme since Steinbeck was a 20th century American
               author.

46 | Calls for Papers
Event Date: 2024-09-01 Abstract Due: 2024-04-01

       Here "event date" means complete drafts are due by September 1,
       2024. "Abstract due" means you first submit an abstract (a brief
       description of the proposed study) by April 1, 2024. You must get
       approval for your abstract before submitting a complete draft.

Call for Papers: Steinbeck, Race, and Ethnicity
A Special Issue of Steinbeck Review
Like many American authors who rose to prominence in the first half of the
twentieth century, John Steinbeck came from an economically privileged
Protestant family of European descent and grew up in a socially and religiously
conservative environment. Like many of his contemporaries, he distanced him-
self from his upbringing in his fiction, rejecting the authority of government, of
institutions, and of received cultural wisdom. He sided with the poor and dis-
possessed, he stood with the underdog, and he tried to give the downtrodden a
voice through his fiction. His writing indicates that he aligned himself with the
ideology of mid-century liberalism and considered himself liberal, progressive,
and open minded.
Much of his work, however, now appears problematic to contemporary scholars,
particularly those concerned with representation and social justice. How could
a writer who wrote two novels about strikes in the California agricultural indus-
try not mention migrant workers of Latinx and Asian diasporic backgrounds?
Although Steinbeck clearly intended them to be positive characters, Lee Chong
in Cannery Row and Lee in East of Eden reflect stereotypical thinking about Chi-
nese and Chinese-American people. Few African-American characters are men-
tioned in Steinbeck's fiction, and the few who are, such as Crooks in Of Mice and
Men, reflect simplistic and paternalistic perceptions about race.
Questions such as these (and many others) need to be more fully explored in

       often been seen in Steinbeck circles, but whose voices could open new vistas
       for important, rich new discussions of his work.
       The editorial staff at Steinbeck Review invites submissions on the topic of "Stein-
       beck, Race, and Ethnicity." Discussions of any Steinbeck work or works are wel-
       come. Of particular interest are discussions such as

            · Asian American and Trans-Pacific Studies perspectives on Steinbeck
            · Latinx Studies and Borderlands Studies Perspectives on Steinbeck
            · African-American Studies perspectives on Steinbeck
            · Native/Indigenous Studies perspectives (including decolonial, postcolonial,

                and settler colonial approaches)
            · Comparative Ethnic Studies approaches (including placing Steinbeck's

                work in conversation with other writers and texts)
            · Global and Transnational perspectives (including non-US ethnicities)
       All critical and theoretical perspectives are welcomed. Submissions should be
       from twelve to twenty double-spaced pages in length, should reflect an aware-
       ness of Steinbeck scholarship, and should follow current MLA style as reflected
       in the 9th MLA Handbook.

               Here the editors present the research "problems" they want
               researchers to address in their special issue. They break down the
               major theme into a list of sub-themes. In chapter four of this book,
               we discuss a variety of theoretical and critical approaches that will
               help you to address notes such as "All critical and theoretical per­
               spectives are welcomed." You would choose one or more approaches
               such as formalist, psychoanalytic, cultural studies, feminist, queer,
               etc.

       Note
       Indexed by the international database SCOPUS and the European Reference
       Index for the Humanities and Social Sciences, Steinbeck Review is a peer-
       reviewed publication on the life and works of American novelist John Steinbeck.
       With other Penn State University Press journals, it partners with Duke University
       Press as part of the Scholarly Publishing Collective.

               The note above means that the journal is recognized by credible aca­
               demic databases, that its work is accessible to other researchers
               through those databases, and that the scholarship that appears in
               their journal is peer-reviewed. To have your work peer-reviewed is to
               have it assessed by other experts in the field of study. The typical
               peer-review is :double blind," meaning that the reviewers don't know
               the name of the author whose work they are reviewing, and the
               author does not know the name of the reviewers. Double blind peer
               review helps to remove possible favoritism that might be shown to
               people based on their prior relationships or reputations. Peer review­
               ers are chosen by editors and may report three types of recommen­
               dations to editors:

                   1. Accept
                   2. Accept with revisions
                   3. Reject

               It is quite common for revisions to be requested. Usually the peer
               reviewers and editor will be quite specific in their requests for revi­
               sions. They may ask for additional research to be done, for changes in
               the structure of the essay, or for stylistic changes.

Your instructor may ask you to aim your course project towards a particular CFP, even if you
don't decide to submit your work. Doing so is a great way to learn professionalization skills
as you develop your research skills. If your instructor does not ask you to aim your work for
publication, it is still a good idea for you to aim for one as a potential target. Many published
research papers begin as class projects.

The value of a professional publication for a student's career is immense. It shows you have
the skills to make it in this highly competitive world. Also, don't be afraid of rejection. It hap-
pens to all scholars. You can practice being rejected by submitting your work to the Journal
of Universal Rejection (see below).

The process for publishing in a journal varies, but typically involves several stages. You
might begin with an informal inquiry, asking the editor if the journal is open to your idea
for a project. If so, you may be asked to submit a formal proposal or a full manuscript. The
editor will then review the submission and reply with a provisional acceptance, a request
for revisions, or a rejection. Upon complete submission, the work will go to reviewers (typi-
cally two or three readers) who will write reports about your work and recommend one of
the following: publication, revision, or rejection. Reader reports provide valuable feedback
to scholars. Keep in mind that rejection does not necessarily mean that the work is bad;
it could mean that it is not a good fit for the journal and its mission. Sometimes, finding
the right fit requires several attempts. One rule: do not make simultaneous submissions to
multiple journals. If more than one journal accepts your work then you are wasting the pre-
cious time of a poor overworked editor.

Chapter 2 Objectives

BARRY MAUER AND JOHN VENECEK

Objectives

This chapter deals with three related issues:
  · identifying a problem
  · evaluating relevance and purpose
  · considering audience

In literary studies, a problem can be a new issue or an old issue. When searching for a rele-
vant research problem, you should first determine that there is an informed audience that
will consider the issue significant, which means it is worthy of further discussion.
In the following pages, we explore relevance & purpose as they relate to possible research
problems in James Baldwin's story, "Sonny's Blues." We use literary scholar Ann Dobie's
work to show how to measure relevance using specific criteria such as materials, purpose,
and method. This section also sets up Jada's forthcoming discussion about how she con-
nected "Sonny's Blues" to her background and how she used her personal experiences to
add a new perspective to this classic story.

                                                                                                                                                     Chapter 2 Objectives | 55

        Learning Objectives

You should come away from this chapter knowing how to:
     · identify a research problem and evaluate relevance using specific criteria.
     · understand what makes a good research question.
     · develop audience awareness early in the research process.

These concepts relate to the ideas of scholarship as conversation and searching as
strategic exploration, which we will discuss in later chapters.

Introduction

 "When you don't know what you're looking for, your chances of finding it are excellent." -
                                                          Levin Becker

Many instructors and textbooks tell students to "identify a problem" for their research.
When students learn they have to find a "problem," they often think about an affliction,
disaster, or catastrophe. But in the language researchers use, a problem is just something
unknown or not understood, similar to the way math gives us problems. When facing a
math problem, we ask "What is X?" The "problem" in math - X - is neither good nor bad. In

58 | Identifying a Problem
order to get started on a research project, you need a desire for knowledge or understand-
ing about something; that something is your problem. Then, with the research materials
you discover, you will try to help your audience better understand that something by mak-
ing a claim about it. To help you learn how to identify the problem, we include the following
passages from Aaron Ritzenberg and Sue Mendelsohn:

      Strategies for Generating Scholarly Problems

       Notice that each problem requires two parts. Like a rubber band that can only
       be stretched when you pull each end in opposite directions, a scholarly tension
       requires two elements to be at odds. For instance, merely noticing that some­
       thing seems strange doesn't constitute a scholarly problem until the researcher
       places it in tension with a second element: what we think of as typical. As you
       read the highlighted passages, you'll notice that we have underlined language
       that indicates the kind of tension the author is calling attention to. As they
       research, scholars generate problems to drive their research by looking for ten­
       sions or dissonances between . . .

     Common Understanding and Complication

       Begin by observing a tension between the way others have understood the text
       and some aspect of the text that appears to diverge from that understanding.
       Example: In this excerpt from his essay "The Trouble with Wilderness," William
       Cronon complicates our common understanding of the idea of "wilderness" as a
       realm separated from civilization (passage highlighted in green). Cronon
       observes that, in fact, wilderness is a product of civilization (passage highlighted
       in yellow):

                                                                                                                                                    Identifying a Problem | 59
The common understanding of wilderness  For many Americans wilderness stands as
                                        the last remaining place where civilization,
                                        that all too human disease, has not fully
                                        infected the earth. It is an island in the
                                        polluted sea of urban-industrial modernity,
                                        the one place we can turn for escape from
                                        our own too-muchness. Seen in this way,
                                        wilderness presents itself as the best
                                        antidote to our human selves, a refuge we
                                        must somehow recover if we hope to save
                                        the planet. As Henry David Thoreau once
                                        famously declared, "In Wildness is the
                                        preservation of the World."

A complication: reasons to rethink the  But is it? The more one knows of its
common understanding of wilderness      peculiar history, the more one realizes that
                                        wilderness is not quite what it seems. Far
                                        from being the one place on earth that
                                        stands apart from humanity, it is quite
                                        profoundly a human creation--indeed, the
                                        creation of very particular human cultures
                                        at very particular moments in human
                                        history. (7)

Locate this type of problem by first researching the common understanding.

Then look for elements that this understanding can't account for.

Consider the stakes by asking how this new complication might challenge the

                                                                                   1

common understanding of the text.

A problem is something that is either not properly understood or is misunderstood. With
this definition in mind, a problem is not necessarily a bad thing to have. In fact, it can be a
great thing to have! We advance our understanding of the world when we address signifi-
cant problems.

Problems come in different types, such as technical (making a bridge that will withstand
wind and water), philosophical (defining what "being" is); economic (stretching our
resources); political (protecting human rights); ethical (why an action is or isn't good); or
historical (understanding how Hitler came to power in Germany). The best researchers
identify research problems that are rich and rewarding so that they can work on them
throughout their careers and leave more work for future generations of researchers. Marie

Curie's research problem was to understand radioactivity. Sigmund Freud's research prob-
lem was to understand how the mind worked. Zora Neal Hurston's research problem was
to preserve and promote African-American culture. Though all three researchers died long
ago, other researchers have continued their work. When we "plow the fields" of research
established by others, we owe them a debt of gratitude, which we pay by continuing the
tradition and passing it on to the next generation of researchers.

In the Humanities, we tend to look for problems that relate to human beings. We seek to
understand human qualities in terms of capacities and blind spots. What are humans capa-
ble of achieving? Where do they get stuck in foolishness, ignorance, and blindness? These
are age-old questions that motivated the ancient Greek philosophers and playwrights. They
still motivate us today. In general, if your research aims at extending human capacities and
addressing human blind spots, you are on a worthy path.

Such discussions find a ready audience and help us join the scholarly conversation. If we
think about "Sonny's Blues," for example, we can read it as a story about blind spots (Sonny's
self-destructiveness, the narrator's failure to really know his brother, the society's blind-
ness about the damage caused by racism), and about human capacities (Sonny's genius
at embodying his personal struggles - and the social situation - in his music, the narrator's
genius at coming to an epiphany and relating it to his audience).

How do we find a good problem? The best way is to follow your curiosity as your read lit-
erary works as well as the "secondary literature," which is the scholarly writing about liter-
ary works. If there is something you want to know, there is a good chance that someone
else will want to know the same thing. In addition to your natural curiosity, there is another
approach to finding a problem; the discipline of literary studies has developed a readymade
set of problems that we can use in relation to almost any literary work. These include prob-
lems such as how the work was made, what its formal properties are, what its social func-
tions are, and how it presents/represents people and their desires and struggles.

One more idea for finding good problems is to use the Feynman method, which is to
rethink the assumptions about what is known. Richard Feynmen became one of the most
famous physicists of the past hundred years. But before he was famous, when he was a stu-
dent, he hit on his famous "notebook method." James Gleick describes it as follows;

        [He] opened a fresh notebook. On the title page he wrote: NOTEBOOK OF THINGS I
        DON'T KNOW ABOUT. For the first but not last time he reorganized his knowledge.
        He worked for weeks at disassembling each branch of physics, oiling the parts, and
        putting them back together, looking all the while for the raw edges and inconsisten-
        cies. He tried to find the essential kernels of each subject.

                                                                                                                                                    Identifying a Problem | 61
  While you don't need to attempt the huge scope of Feynman's work - going through each
  branch of a discipline (in our case, literary studies) - you could apply his method to a single
  branch of the discipline. Maybe you are interested in narratology, poetics, audience studies,
  or intertextuality. You could take apart one of these branches to get to "the essential ker-
  nels" of the subject.

                                                                                2

  Addressing Problems

                        "Solutions are nearly always disappointing." - Harry Matthews
  When working with math problems, we can say we solved the problem. However, in literary
  studies, not all problems can be solved definitively. Sometimes, as in the problem of inter-
  preting a literary text, we get an answer that is better than one we had before. We often use
  the word "address" instead of "solve" in these cases. Thus, we might say that Joseph Camp-
  bell addressed the problem posed by the structure of myths. He didn't solve the problem
  definitively, since other people have addressed this problem in different ways and have
  come up with different answers.
  To address problems in literary studies, we do research. For example, to address the prob-
  lem of interpreting an Emily Dickinson poem, we might look for critical texts. Even if you
  find well-known critical texts, perhaps you see these critical texts differently from how other
  people see them; your perspective and your insights into them help others better address
  the problem.
  Sometimes, a problem is well studied, like the examples listed above. Sometimes, you dis-
  cover a new problem and are introducing it for the first time. In literary studies, lots of
  unknown things are out there, but not all of them are significant or worth knowing. For a
  problem to be significant, it means that an audience somewhere might care about it. For
  instance, perhaps we don't know how many words are in Joseph Conrad's novel Heart of

2. In the "Back Matter" of this book, you will find a page titled "Rubrics." On that page, we provide a rubric for Iden­
   tifying a Problem.
   62 | Identifying a Problem
Darkness. Just because the answer is unknown, doesn't mean it is significant. Would the
answer help us better understand the text or the author? Maybe not.

Also, consider whether the problem - the unknown something - is too easy or too difficult
to answer; then avoid doing either. Using a computer and a text file of Joseph Conrad's
Heart of Darkness, you could figure out how many words are in it quite easily, much faster
than if you counted the words yourself. We should choose problems that are not this easy
to answer. In any case, counting words in a novel makes little sense unless you can explain
why doing so helps us to address another more significant problem, like whether audi-
ences were consuming longer novels at the time, or whether the length of a novel was a
major consideration for publishers. Even then, providing a page count is probably sufficient.

Set aside questions that are too difficult to answer, like the impact of Shakespeare's work
on authors who came after him. Such a project would take an immense amount of research
and require years of study, far more than you can do for a term paper. Just because a prob-
lem is too difficult for a smaller project, however, doesn't mean it is not worth pursuing.
Measuring Shakespeare's impact on later authors is an important objective. What you can
do in a term paper is manage a smaller part of such a big question. For instance, what
impact did Shakespeare's work have on 20th century playwright August Wilson?

When you address a problem in literary studies, you should consider the history of the prob-
lem; have other people addressed it before? Weigh the significance of the problem; is it
one that has relevance to a scholarly conversation? Finally, before exploring the problem in
great detail, determine whether you can feasibly address the problem given your available
time and other constraints.

Later in the book, we explain how to develop a thesis statement: an argumentative claim
about the problem. By necessity, your claim should be different, even a little bit, from what
scholars already think about a problem. You do not necessarily reject existing knowledge,
but instead you extend it to make novel claims. Andy Norman explains that for your thesis
to have an impact on your audience, you need to move people from presumptive knowl-
edge to a nonpresumptive conclusion:

       What currently passes for good critical thinking instruction leaves students con-
       fused: it makes them defensive and leaves them with a distinct impression that
       we apply our standards haphazardly. The concept of presumption, however,
       allows us to give them real clarity: more transparent guidance about how to

                                                                                                                                                    Identifying a Problem | 63
          write a good persuasive essay, more insight into the process of building new
          understanding, and greater clarity about how to think critically. Adept critical
          thinkers understand this: good argumentation is fundamentally a matter of
          marshaling presumptive premises to defend nonpresumptive conclusions. Criti-
          cal thinking is all about finding claims that happen to sit on the wrong side of

                                                                                                                                                                                  3

          the ledger, and showing why they need to be moved to the other side

  To paraphrase Norman, we are seeking to make and share conclusions that our audience
  does not already presume to be true or right. To a degree, that means we are seeking to be
  original, but this originality is built upon claims that are not original (in other words, claims
  that our audience presume to be right). We defend our claim by warding off objections or
  counter-claims, showing how these objections or counterclaims are weaker than our claim.

  Relation of Problem to Audience

  To get a sense of whether a problem is worth addressing, you need to imagine your audi-
  ence. The audience for your research is other literary critics and scholars. The best way to
  get to know your audience is by reading what they write: works of literary criticism and
  scholarship. Your audience may range from novices (such as students) to experts (such as
  professors). In the writings of these literary scholars and critics, you will come to know what
  kinds of concerns they have and what problems they find relevant and significant. Your
  goal is to join the conversation by adding something of value.
  But first you need to know which scholarly conversation you are joining. For instance, if you

   64 | Identifying a Problem
are writing about a Jane Austen novel, such as Mansfield Park, you could consider joining
conversations among scholars in Austen studies, Victorian literature studies, post-colonial
studies, studies of the novel, women writers, etc. They overlap, for sure, but each group of
scholars may have a different set of interests.

Do Problems Need to Be "Original"?

Originality may or may not be the most important consideration for literary scholars and
writers; we can be original by doing something strange or unexpected but that otherwise
has no clear purpose or value. The most recognized works of literature, or criticism and the-
ory, are often those that show startling originality and are valued by other scholars. Learn-
ing how to recognize value, in your own work and others, is the hallmark of excellence in
our field. Typically, it involves acquiring a lot of knowledge about the field.

By reading works of literary criticism and scholarship, you will find many significant prob-
lems. Great scholars are great problem-finders, but they don't always have time to solve all
the problems they discover. Sometimes, they leave them for other people - like you - to
work on. For your research project, you don't necessarily need to come up with an "original"
problem, unless your instructor asks you to do so, because literary criticism, unlike math,
usually has more than only one possible answer. Literary criticism and scholarship are more
like law; each legal case is a "problem," and we may come to different interpretations of evi-
dence and of the law itself. Let's say you find works of literary criticism discussing the prob-
lem of the color line in the work of Langston Hughes. You can still address this problem in
your research project because you might have something new or different to say about it.
You can add value by uncovering new information or by taking a different perspective on
the problem.

We can share our understanding of a scholarly problem by writing a problem statement.
The statement includes three steps:

  1. Define the problem (use citations when needed)
 2. Explain what the consequences are if we don't address the problem
 3. Share your thoughts about the knowledge required to properly address the problem

                                                                                                                                                    Identifying a Problem | 65
To take one example, we can derive Zora Neal Hurston's problem statement by reading her
work. Hurston noted that black folk culture in the United States was disappearing. Addi-
tionally, she noted a lack of interest in preserving black folk culture. The consequences for
not addressing the problem would be that black people would lose a sense of their her-
itage and valuable cultural forms would be lost. The knowledge she believed was required
to address the problem was a combination of things: an insider's understanding of the cul-
ture (which she had from growing up in the community), a willingness to demonstrate the
power and creativity of black folk idioms in her own literary writing, and an anthropologist's
understanding of how to engage in cultural preservation.
On the following pages, we will discuss how to evaluate the relevance and purpose of the
problem you've identified.

         Establishing Relevance

  Our goal as researchers is to enter the ongoing scholarly conversation - or to start a new
  one. We enter the scholarly conversation by establishing relevance; we ask, "how is this
  work of literature, or my research about it, relevant and significant to my audience?" For
  example, Jada might ask why James Baldwin and "Sonny's Blues" are still relevant to audi-
  ences today. What lessons can contemporary audiences learn from a story written in 1957?
  Conversely, how can new perspectives that we bring to old stories keep them relevant? Rel-
  evance is established by explaining why something matters, and things matter to us now
  because we have problems today that we want to solve (or address). Such problems may
  have broader implications for literature, for society, or for a specific group of readers such
  as scholars of African-American literature. Scholars understand relevance more in terms of
  the discussion around the literary work than around the literary work itself. To understand
  whether a scholarly claim is relevant, we need to know more about the scholarly discussion.

  We don't want to propose overly simplistic answers to the question of relevance. For exam-
  ple, it is not enough to say that racism was a problem in 1957, and that it is still a problem
  today. The issue demands specificity. How is the past relevant to understanding the pre-
  sent? For example, do we see information or perspectives in "Sonny's Blues" that could help
  us address how black people deal with black history and preserve and develop black cul-
  ture? Conversely, does knowing about the current movement against systemic racism help
  us better understand what Baldwin was writing in 1957? Can we read the story as a mes-
  sage to future generations? Is there a problem related to scholarship about "Sonny's Blues,"
  Baldwin, African-American literature, or literature of the 1950s that your work can help us
  better understand? For instance, what kinds of intergenerational trauma affect black fami-
  lies and can we learn from "Sonny's Blues" how best to identify and mitigate it? Becoming
  familiar with the conversations among scholars and the general public can help you assess
  whether or not, and how much, your claims are relevant.

  The scholarly conversation around a literary text is called a "para-text." It is the discourse
  around a literary text. Think of the literary text as a traveler and of the scholarly conversation
  around it as fellow travelers. Scholars hope that when people read a work of literature, they
  will also read some of the para-text around it. Scholars aim to influence people's under-
  standing of a literary text by showing them the connection of the text to a set of ideas,

events, and practices. For instance, Edgar Allen Poe's story "Murders in the Rue Morgue" is
the first detective story. A lot of the para-text around it is about what a detective story is,
why its invention coincided with historical shifts such as the growth of cities and the inven-
tion of photography, and how the logic of the detective differed from that of the ordinary
person. Your goal as a researcher is to become a fellow traveler, adding your ideas to the
para-text that travels with the literary work.
Adding to the scholarly para-text is not so different than discussing the latest movie or
tv show with friends. When you do so, you are creating a para-text around that movie or
show. Usually we don't preserve these conversations in writing and publish them for all to
see, though many such discussions take place in social media. Scholarly para-text is a bit
different from everyday conversations about literary works (or movies, etc.). It is based on
concepts and methodologies that are developed for disciplinary use - the discipline being
Literary Studies or, more broadly, the Humanities. In these discussions, we can't be care-
less with facts or reasoning. The goal of the discipline is to uphold the highest standards
for what counts as knowledge. These disciplinary standards are far higher than those that
govern most casual conversations.
Don't be intimidated, though. The goal of disciplinary knowledge is to help you gain greater
insight into literary works, and into the connections between literature and life. The task is
difficult, but the reward is worth it.

       Identifying Criteria

Relevance and significance in literary studies are measured against established criteria.
Every field of knowledge establishes criteria. For instance, medicine establishes criteria to
determine what counts as health. Political science establishes criteria for what constitutes a
democracy. Mathematics establishes criteria for what counts as a formal proof. We advance
in our fields by learning these criteria and making use of them in strategic ways. People
who are very advanced in their fields may introduce changes to these criteria or may even
introduce new ones. When you make a claim in your writing, you should also convince your
audience of the relevance and significance of your claim by referring to the ongoing schol-
arly conversation and the criteria in it.
In literary studies, scholars establish relevance in relation to particular areas of knowledge.
For instance, we can read "Sonny's Blues" in relation to narratology, the study of narratives.
A major theorist in narratology is Gerard Genette, whose work discusses narratives in terms
of story (the events in chronological order), discourse (the presentation of these events,
which can be out of order), and the narration (the telling of the events, which can be long
or short). We can assess the relevance of "Sonny's Blues" in relation to these concepts. In
the story, the narrator learns from his mother about how his uncle was killed long before

72 | Establishing Relevance and Evaluating Purpose
  by a white driver. This event is recounted as part of a recollection the narrator has about his
  mother before she died. Why is it relevant that we learn of the mother's recollection taking
  place within the narrator's recollection?

              Example [Identifying Criteria]

       In scholar Ann Dobie's chapter "More Cultural Studies: Postcolonialism and Multi-

                                         2

       culturalism," she discusses the Black Aesthetic, a concept that artists involved in

                                                                        3

       the Black Arts Movement established in the 1960s when James Baldwin was in his
       prime as a prominent author and activist. The Black Aesthetic established criteria
       for determining what counts as "good" literature (at least among literary works that
       addressed black experience) and what doesn't. In her text, Dobie discusses three
       key criteria for the Black Aesthetic: the materials its artists work with, the purpose
       of their work, and how they go about it.

             · Materials: Black history is the source material, which Dobie says is unique
                because it creates a dual identity, "one that both partakes of America and
                doesn't, one that shares the American experience but is denied it."

             · Purpose: Dobie says, "African American artists have a strong imperative to
                reclaim their culture by defining what is of value to them. Such a reclamation
                takes place by remembering history, defining identity, gaining recognition,
                and celebrating blackness."

             · Method: Dobie notes that while African American artists may not go about

3. Note: This course uses Wikipedia (and other open sources) to provide background information on a variety of
   topics. Wikipedia, like any source, does have deficiencies, some of which are discussed on their own site.
   Wikipedia articles also include links to other sources, which makes them good places to start the research
   process.

                                                                                                                Establishing Relevance and Evaluating Purpose | 73
             their work differently from others, they are unique in that they draw from
             "folk traditions that express their beliefs, values, and social mores." She also
             cites Ron Karenga who states that the purpose of African-American art is "to
             make revolution. Its collective nature is evident in its presentation of real life
             and real people, and it is committed to permanent revolution."
     Dobie adds, "To approach a text from a multicultural perspective, a reader must
     look for more than material, purpose, and method." Readers must also "anticipate
     specific characteristics that distinguish their work." These characteristics could
     include issues such as voice and narration.

Thus, when reading "Sonny's Blues," we can read it with these specific criteria in mind and
assess the story according to the criteria. Doing so is not the end of the research process for
a critical paper, but it is a crucial part. Keep in mind that the Black Aesthetic is one set of
criteria but it is far from the only one you could apply to "Sonny's Blues."

We assess things, like literary works, against a set of standards. Many literary theories estab-
lish criteria for evaluating literary works. Another set of criteria we could apply to Baldwin's
work comes from Cleanth Brooks and the formalist critics.

  · Organic unity: all the parts of the literary work are interrelated and support its central
      idea.

  · Tensions: paradoxes, ironies, and ambiguities that the literary work resolves into a the-
      matic unity. In "Sonny's Blues," we might say that Sonny sought to destroy himself
      through drugs yet he also sought to express himself through music. The tension
      between self-destruction and self-expression is thematically unified in the blues.

In literary theories, which we discuss in another chapter, we find many sets of criteria that
we can use in our literary criticism (notice the shared root of the word "criteria" and "criti-
cism"). Your paper should explain and justify why you chose a set of criteria and excluded
others.

Some critics introduce their own criteria, which can be a very valuable contribution to the
field of literary studies. If you'd like to introduce new criteria for evaluating literary works, be
sure to explain the need for it and explain how it differs from criteria that already exists.

74 | Establishing Relevance and Evaluating Purpose
       Considering the Stakes

Another way to establish relevance is by considering the stakes of an argument. The
"stakes" means the consequences of an argument being accepted or rejected. What could
be won or lost if the argument is accepted? For instance, could an argument about a par-
ticular literary work (or works) change the paradigm of how we study literature? If so, these
are enormous stakes because it means established perspectives and methods might be
abandoned and new perspectives and methods adopted.

            Example [Considering the Stakes]

         1. Henry Louis Gates' Study of "signifyin'" black tradition in literary works such
             as Zora Neale Hurston's Their Eyes Were Watching God, Ralph Ellison's Invisi­
             ble Man, and Ishmael Reed's Mumbo Jumbo.

         2. Edward Said's study of "Orientalism" in Joseph Conrad's Heart of Darkness.
         3. Mikhail Bakhtin's study of "dialogism" in Fyodor Dostoevsky's novels.
        4. Viktor Shklovsky's reading of "defamiliarization" in Leo Tolstoy's novels.
         5. Gilles Deleuze and Félix Guattari's identification of a "minor literature" in

             the works of Franz Kafka.
        6. Sandra Gilbert and Susan Gubar's study of the "Madwoman in the Attic" in

             Charlotte Brontë's Jane Eyre.
         7. Marjorie Garber's study of "transvestite logic" in the works of William Shake-

             speare.

                                                                                                             Establishing Relevance and Evaluating Purpose | 75
These works are now anthologized in collections of literary theory and criticism but were
once seen as radical shifts or groundbreaking new directions in literary studies research.
They achieved their exalted position because they were recognized as highly relevant to
the problems of their day. These literary researchers played for high stakes and won. But
because the stakes of their work are high, it is not uncommon for other critics to challenge
their work. For example, Gilbert and Gubar's work has been challenged by Judith Butler,
Mary Daly, and Tori Moi, among others.

"Low stakes" problems are still important to address. The size of the stakes are determined
by the possible outcome. Generally, we ask "if X is true, what are the consequences"? So,
for instance, if we produce a new interpretation of a Shakespeare sonnet, is it the kind of
interpretation that changes our mind about one poem, about Shakespeare's poetry, about
poetry in general, about literature in general, or about life in general? A small stake would
be an answer that revises our thinking about one poem but not so much beyond that.

Thomas Kuhn wrote a widely cited book titled The Structure of Scientific Revolutions in
which he argued that most scientific research is "normal science," meaning it doesn't
change our fundamental understanding of the world but just elaborates on it or solves
smaller problems. "Revolutionary science," by contrast, changes the way we see the world
in fundamental ways. So, Darwin's theory of evolution is revolutionary, whereas a particular
study within that paradigm - such as a study about the evolution of a fruit fly population
- would be normal science. Normal science is still extremely important. Maybe it matters a
great deal that we know how fruit flies evolve, but the answer probably does not involve a
paradigm shift.

Basically, the higher the stakes, the greater the relevance. Darwin's theory of evolution was
extremely high stakes and extremely relevant to all of science, particularly biology, as well
as to almost all human thought. The "problem" Darwin was addressing seemed to be fairly
low stakes at first; why do finches on one island have short beaks while finches on another
island have longer beaks? Yet the answer - that species changed through natural selec­
tion - was enormously relevant to many other problems. Low stakes means the research
has narrow implications and high stakes means the research has broad implications. Your
assignment may not require you to aim for low or high stakes, but it is good for you to know
where you are aiming.

We will discuss the importance of establishing relevance more in-depth once we get into
the "Refining Your Research Question" portion of this book, but it is important to keep rel-
evance in mind during your early research process.

         Evaluating Purpose

  Joining the scholarly conversation about literature involves more than just stating an inter-
  esting fact or making an appropriate observation here and there. The conversation moves
  along rhetorical lines (it aims to persuade); therefore, to join the conversation, we need to
  think rhetorically. The major purposes in rhetoric are:

    1. Docere: teaching on an intellectual level.
    2. Movere: touching the feelings.
    3. Delectare: keeping interest alive.

  Skilled literary theorists and critics treat these purposes as interrelated. Thus, to succeed
  at docere, we also need to succeed at movere and delectare. We need to know our audi-
  ence: what pleases one audience may upset another, and what interests one audience may
  bore or annoy another. For example, humor may be useful to express feelings and keep an
  audience interested, but if the audience has strong feelings about a subject, you should
  know which kind of humor (i.e. ironic humor, parodic humor, witty humor) is most likely to
  work, or whether it's appropriate to use humor at all.

  Beyond these general aims, you should have a specific purpose related to one of the three
  types of rhetoric, which are (according to Aristotle):

    1. Deliberative (or Political): future oriented, it persuades people into action or dissuades
        them from action.

    2. Judicial (or Forensic): past oriented, it persuades people to judge an action as justifi-
        able or unjustifiable.

    3. Epideictic (or Ceremonial): present oriented, it persuades people to praise or blame a
        person or work.

Let's look at an example of a work of literary theory and criticism - Victor Shklovsky's essay,
"Art as Technique" - to understand its rhetorical practices. Shklovsky discusses Leo Tolstoy's
novels. He praises Tolstoy's artfulness (epideictic/present) and persuades us to judge Tol-
stoy's work (judicial/past) in terms of its masterful techniques:

       "Tolstoy makes the familiar seem strange by not naming the familiar object. He
       describes an object as if he were seeing it for the first time, an event as if it were
       happening for the first time. In describing something he avoids the accepted
       names of its parts and instead names corresponding parts of other objects."

In terms of its effects, Shklovsky says they "[prick] the conscience." Overall, Shklovsky's main
purpose seems to be deliberative (political/future oriented):

       "There is `order' in art, yet not a single column of a Greek temple stands exactly
       in its proper order; poetic rhythm is similarly disordered rhythm. Attempts to
       systematize the irregularities have been made, and such attempts are part of
       the current problem in the theory of rhythm. It is obvious that the systematiza-
       tion will not work, for in reality the problem is not one of complicating the
       rhythm but of disordering the rhythm - a disordering which cannot be pre-
       dicted. Should the disordering of rhythm become a convention, it would be inef-
       fective as a procedure for the roughening of language."

Shklovsky's purpose, in other words, is to persuade artists to keep inventing new techniques
for "making things strange" and to dissuade theorists from attempting to systematize such
efforts. We might take Shklovsky's essay and translate it into two columns: a set of things he
tries to persuade us to do and a set of things he tries to persuade us not to do. His lessons
apply not just to art but also to life itself.

       Kinds of Purposes

When you plan your research project, develop a statement of purpose that answers the

                                                                                                            Establishing Relevance and Evaluating Purpose | 79
question "what is my goal?" until it is clear in your mind and makes sense to other people.
In the discipline of literary studies, there are any number of purposes you can choose or
develop. Among them are the following kinds:

  1. Historical: improve our understanding and appreciation of the past. Here we might
      seek to

         Elevate an overlooked figure or literary work
         Better understand major shifts around new literary forms, genres, and movements
         Understand the relationship of literature to historical realities such as colonialism,

            industrialism, and information technologies

 2. Theoretical: improve our understanding of major principles used to study literature.
      Such goals might be to

         Better understand narrative, metaphor, and argument
         Explain the relationship of literature to other kinds of writing, to life, and to

            thought
         Explore the relevance of philosophy, psychology, sociology, and anthropology to

            literature

 3. Pedagogical: improve the ways we teach literature, literary research, and writing
      about literature. Here we might seek to

         Argue about which literary works should be included or excluded from the literary
            canon

         Understand the value of literature within education
         Develop better teaching strategies

 4. Social: improve the fortunes of society or of particular groups of people through litera-
      ture and literary study. Our goals might be to

         Reclaim identity for marginalized groups by celebrating their literature
         Build a more just and equitable society by highlighting worthy traditions within

            literary cultures
         Consider literary works as reflecting society, revealing its flaws and its potential

 5. Experimental: improve our understanding and appreciation of literature as an art
      form and a way of knowing. Such goals might be to

80 | Establishing Relevance and Evaluating Purpose
            Discover and experiment with poetics (ways of making) found in literature
            Apply new practices to literature and literary studies: for example, by creating liter-

              ary-critical hybrids
            Experiment with new information technologies (such as text-generating Artificial

              Intelligence) to test approaches to literary or critical prompt engineering.

  There are hundreds, if not thousands, more possible purposes for work in literary studies.
  Your goal is to articulate your purpose clearly, concisely, and directly in such a way that it
  guides your work. Of course, you are allowed to change your purpose along the way since
  the research process is iterative and doesn't always go in a straight line, but you should
  work with an end in mind.

  Michael Baxandall, an art historian, provided some terminology that can help us think

                                                                                                                              5

  constructively about developing our own purpose. The key terms Baxandall uses are
  charge, brief, and troc.

     · Charge: The charge is your primary purpose. Your purpose relates to a problem you
        choose to address. Baxandall discusses the relationship of these things to the bridge-
        builder Benjamin Baker, who designed the Forth Bridge in Scotland. The problem
        Baker faced was straightforward; the previous bridge, the Tay Bridge, had been
        destroyed in a storm and now there was no bridge. Baker's charge was to span a dis-
        tance over a body of water (additionally, he had to span it in such a way that the new
        bridge would not collapse). The charge for a literary scholar might be similarly broad:
        understand, elevate, and teach come to mind.

     · Brief: the specific local conditions, or the situation, that you found yourself in. The brief
        includes the resources available to you. Baxandall classifies these as "resources of
        medium, of models (both positive and negative), and of `aesthetic'" (35). To grossly
        oversimplify, Baker's medium was structurally-deployed metal, his positive model was
        the Oriental cantilever system, his negative model (an example of what not to do) was
        the Tay Bridge, which was blown down by side winds, and his aesthetic was `functional
        expressionism.' Your brief is to contribute something valuable to the discipline of liter­
        ary studies, as it exists currently. Your resources include not just literary works but
        ideas about literature. These ideas can include both positive and negative models. The
        positive models are the works of literary scholars that you wish to emulate. The nega­
        tive models are works you wish to push against. These negative models are not neces­
        sarily "bad"; they may simply constitute resources that don't fit your goal. For instance,

5. Baxandall, Michael. Patterns of Intention: On the Historical Explanation of Pictures. New Haven, Yale University
   Press, 1985.

                                                                                                                 Establishing Relevance and Evaluating Purpose | 81
      you may wish to pursue historical ends and therefore push against formalist ideas
      about literature.
  · Troc: Baxandall defines troc as "no more than the form of relation in which two classes
      of people, both within the same culture, are free to make choices in the course of an
      exchange, any choice affecting the universe of the exchange and so the other partici­
      pants" (48). The troc is a market model, "a coming into contact of producers and con­
      sumers for the purpose of exchange" (47). In our field, literary scholars are like
      Baxandall's producers and our readers are like his consumers. (In reality, scholarship
      usually involves a degree of co-creation between scholars, who are both readers and
      writers). Baxandall explains that, within a market, there is "a degree of competition
      among both producers and consumers" and "parties on either side can make state­
      ments with their feet, as it were, by participating or abstaining" (47). A troc includes
      the cultural resources available to a literary scholar (which, when selected, become
      elements of the scholar's Brief), as well as the rewards a scholar may find for their
      work. Such rewards include belonging to a community of literary scholars, recognition,
      and career advancement.

When you think about your own purpose for the literary research project you are undertak-
ing, consider charge, brief, and troc.

       Summary

Relevance and purpose are not fixed and stable categories. What is relevant one moment
might be irrelevant the next (for instance, "what are we having for dinner?" is a relevant
question but is irrelevant once we have eaten it). Our purpose is related to relevance, so it
can change too. There's no purpose to making dinner once it's already eaten (unless you
are making it for another evening).

When it comes to writing about literary works, it is a bit different: the potential audience
is much bigger than a dinner party, and literature can be consumed more than once. We
might consider the possibility, also, that some literature, like some food, is past its "expira-
tion date" and would only be interesting to historians.

Relevance is a key question for scholars. We discover relevance and we make relevance. To

82 | Establishing Relevance and Evaluating Purpose
that end, our purpose is to be like a "relevance detective" or even a "relevance inventor."
What we are looking for is the "aha!" moment that tells us we are on to something that we
want to share with others.
In terms of relevance changing, one issue that has appeared lately is text-generating AI
technology, such as GPT-3. We can ask it to write something in the style of a particular
author, but how close is it? Typically, the closest it can get is very superficial. The failures
of such machinery to capture the brilliance of literary authors raises a relevant question -
what is the gap between an author's work and a machine's imitation of it? What is miss-
ing?

       Considering Audience

When you write literary scholarship and criticism, you are writing for someone: your audi-
ence. The audience may be real or imagined; in other words, there may be a real group of
people who will read your work, or you might just be writing a practice work. Whether your
audience is real or imagined at this point, you need to consider your audience as you pre-
pare to research and write your project. Advanced researchers prioritize the reader in their
writing, which means they think about how the reader will benefit from their work. Their
goal is to make the reader's experience as valuable as possible. Such writers think, "What
does my reader need to know?" and then they ask "how do I write to meet the reader's
needs?"
Scholarly disciplines measure the impact of research by gauging audience response. When

88 | Considering Audience
readers value their experience reading your work, they cite it, others read about your work
and cite it, and so on. In other words, the reader's experience turns into impact (at least
some of the time). Critics write reviews and commentary about your work in journals, pro-
viding qualitative feedback.

We have tools to learn about ways that other researchers re-use our scholarly work within
their own; advanced researchers use tools such as the h-index to measure how often their
work is referenced in other people's research. Sometimes, impact is subtle and may not be
measurable in quantitative ways. For instance, when your readers gain insight from your
work or consider a problem from a new perspective, they may not all respond in a measur-
able way.

One of your goals as a researcher - beyond finding and addressing problems - is to impact
your audience, and you want that impact to be positive. In other words, you don't want your
audience to hold up your research as an example of bad work! Your audience should appre-
ciate your research for its wise choice of problem, its appropriate methodology, its skillful
use of sources, its insightfulness, its airtight reasoning, its relevant conclusion, and its fault-
less presentation. You want to impact your audience's thinking about a problem just as an
attorney wants to impact the jury's thinking about a case.

Your research should impact your audience rhetorically, which means your work convinces
an audience to take your side in a (potential) dispute. Share your perspective with your
readers so that they see things the way you see them. The Roman rhetor, Cicero, said that
rhetoric was Docere, Delectare, Movere: to teach, to delight, and to move. To move some-
one, rhetorically, means to convince them to shift their beliefs. We are more likely to move
our audience when we adopt the strategies of a good teacher, and to delight our audiences
while doing so. Good literary research should convince your audience and be enjoyable for
them at the same time.

In general, if you are writing literary criticism or theory, you are appealing to an audience of
other literary scholars. These scholars may be beginners, experts, or some combination of
both. Literary studies is a part of a knowledge apparatus that involves people fulfilling dif-
ferent functions. These functions include researchers, teachers, students, editors, publish-
ers, librarians, conference attendees, and many others. They all work together to advance
their discipline and its goal, which is to improve the understanding of literature and its
impacts in the world.

Everything you do as a researcher - from selecting a problem to proofreading your final
draft - should include consideration of your audience. For instance, each researcher must
make the audience's experience as effortless as possible, but not so easy that it oversim-
plifies their research. If the subject is complicated, you need to explain the complications;

                                                                                                                                                   Considering Audience | 89
however, don't overly complicate the reader's experience by adding extraneous informa-
tion, repeating points unnecessarily, using specialized terminology without offering defi-
nitions, or writing in a self-indulgent way. A good motto for writing research papers is "to
deliver rather than to promise."

Also, always imagine your audience as being critical, not that they are evaluating you neces-
sarily, but that they are evaluating your claims. Thus, avoid making unsubstantiated claims
in your writing and don't create logical gaps by leaving out warrants, which link one propo-
sition (claim) to another. For instance, Sonny, from James Baldwin's story "Sonny's Blues,"
is talking to his brother (who is the narrator) about the music of Charlie Parker. The narra-
tors asks: "Who's this Parker character?"

        "He's just one of the greatest jazz musicians alive," said Sonny, sullenly, his hands in his
        pockets, his back to me. "Maybe the greatest," he added, bitterly, "that's probably why
        you never heard of him."

The warrant would explain the link between these two statements - "[Parker is] the great-
est" and "that's probably why you never heard of him." What is the glue that connects these
two statements? The answer to that question is the warrant. Maybe Sonny is implying that
his brother is uncool. In literary works, like "Sonny's Blues," it's sometimes ok to leave the
warrant out because we are encountering the ways people speak and think in the real
world. In your scholarly writing, you want to provide the warrant so your audience isn't won-
dering what the connection is between two propositions.

Be sure to address counterclaims that your audience may consider. You should always
anticipate your audience's thoughts by imagining what questions they might ask, in which
order, and by addressing these questions systematically in your work. This way of writing is
called interrogatory, a back and forth as in a conversation. Since our reader isn't typically in
front of us as we write, we imagine a person having this conversation with us. We list ques-
tions - ones that readers might pose - that our scholarly work then answers. The answer
may raise additional questions, and so we then answer those too.

Expect that not everyone will like your work, approve of it, or agree with it, even if it's great.
We need to have some thick skin in the face of criticism. We are writing for an audience we
wish to persuade, and if they are not persuaded then we have failed. Failure is not the end
of the world, though. It means we may need to rethink our argument, or try a more recep-
tive audience, or wait until social/political conditions change. The scholarly conversation is
an ongoing and iterative process that we all learn from.

CONVERSATION

                                                                                     Chapter 3: Research as Inquiry and Scholarship as Conversation | 93
Chapter 3 Objectives

BARRY MAUER AND JOHN VENECEK

Objectives

This chapter focuses on three core components of the ACRL Framework for Information Lit-
eracy:

  · Research as Inquiry
  · Searching as Strategic Exploration
  · Scholarship as Conversation
The first of these, Research as Inquiry, sets the stage for the following two by establishing
the importance of asking good questions throughout the research process and using ques-
tions as a means toward entering the scholarly conversation.
Students often plunge into their research without taking the time to reflect about the
requirements of the assignment, the scope of the project, and what they want to gain from
their research. Our assertion is that inquiry is a reflective and critical process that is essential
for any successful research project. The ability to ask good questions is a crucial skill, even
an art form, that researchers should cultivate in an intentional manner throughout the life-
cycle of their project.

94 | Chapter 3 Objectives
Note that we discuss refining and evaluating a research question in chapter ten. The types
of questions discussed here will be more of a prelude to those later sections. This chap-
ter focuses on the role of asking questions early in the research process to guide strategic
exploration and to enter into the scholarly conversation around your topic.
How do we begin our research exploration? How do we join the scholarly conversation?
In Searching as Strategic Exploration, the ACRL emphasizes that, "Searching for informa-
tion is often nonlinear and iterative, requiring the evaluation of a range of information
sources and the mental flexibility to pursue alternate avenues as new understanding devel-
ops." In other words, research is a complex, recursive process that involves inquiry, discovery,
audience awareness, and serendipity.
Likewise, regarding Scholarship as Conversation, they note that, "Instead of seeking dis-
crete answers to complex problems, experts understand that a given issue may be char-
acterized by several competing perspectives as part of an ongoing conversation in which
information users and creators come together and negotiate meaning." Good research
questions typically don't have a single uncontested answer. Rather, they are designed to
engage scholars in an ongoing conversation that adds to the discourse in their field.
This conversation often begins within your paper as you engage with the work of other
scholars. Some research projects provide a literature review, which is a section that presents
your overview of the existing research in relation to a topic or problem. If the assignment
does not call for a literature review to be included with the project, you should still conduct
one. Doing so will help you understand the work of other scholars and gather background
information for your research.

This chapter presents you with one task: to reflect on your beliefs about research. Some of
these beliefs might be blocking you from succeeding at research. We want to identify those
blocking beliefs and develop positive beliefs about research and our abilities to do it.

                                                                                                                                                     Chapter 3 Objectives | 95

able conversing with more experienced scholars. However, the goal with these two
pages is

     · to learn how to ask good questions as part of a research program
     · to explain how to enter a scholarly conversation
     · overcome the anxiety of influence (the fear that your work will be derivative)
You accomplish these goals by identifying gaps in research and establishing rele­
vance. You're not an outsider merely stringing together other people's ideas, but
part of an ongoing discussion. You're engaged with the research and you have
something to contribute to the conversation, and you've chosen a topic that you
are truly interested in (if you were allowed a choice).

                                                                                                                                              Chapter 3 Objectives | 97
Research as Inquiry

BARRY MAUER AND JOHN VENECEK

We discuss the following topics on this page:
  · Introduction
  · Inquiry & Curiosity
  · The Art of Asking Good Questions
  · Think Questions, Not Topics
  · The Invention Process

       Introduction

The ACRL's Framework for Information Literacy states that inquiry-based research is "a
process that focuses on problems or questions in a discipline or between disciplines that
are open or unresolved." They add that "The spectrum of inquiry ranges from asking simple
questions that depend upon basic recapitulation of knowledge to increasingly sophisti-
cated abilities to refine research questions, use more advanced research methods, and
explore more diverse disciplinary perspectives." The goal is not to ask simple questions with
easy answers but to focus on increasingly complex questions that generate discussion in
the field or across disciplines.
The four concepts presented below are important precursors to the following sections of
this chapter: Searching as Strategic Exploration and Scholarship as Conversation. However,
they also set up a discussion we'll have in Chapter 9 about Refining and Evaluating your

98 | Research as Inquiry
Research Question. We're introducing them here to inspire students to think about these
concepts before we take a deeper dive into inquiry, curiosity, and asking questions later in
the course.
Note that this is an example of the scaffolding concept we discussed in the Introduction
to this course. We're presenting these concepts in a strategic way so you can build your
skills as you work through these modules. Searching strategically for resources, entering
the scholarly conversation, learning to ask increasingly complex questions will all lead you
to developing a solid research question that drives your research.
To skip ahead and read more about that now, see Chapter 9 on Developing Your Research
Question.

       Inquiry & Curiosity

There is a direct correlation between inquiry and curiosity. Curious people ask questions,
which drives inquiry. Think of how many times you've steered a conversation toward some-
thing you're curious about by asking questions and trying to make a personal connection to
the discussion. This same principle applies to the research process. Inquiry-based research
is a form of active learning and is a sign of an open mind. Embracing this idea can help cul-
tivate a sense of investment and turn your research into a true passion project.
For example, in the video on Scholarship as Conversation, Jada discusses how she con-
nected to "Sonny's Blues" because she is from the same area the story was set in and that
her father was a jazz fan. She also mentioned how she was fascinated by the different ways
scholars approached Baldwin's story and how those approaches shed light on how she
viewed her upbringing. In this way, her paper became a passion project because she was
genuinely curious about the varying perspectives on the classic story that deepened her
connection to her research. You may not always have such a strong personal connection to
your topic, but this process of asking questions and probing can pique your curiosity and
provide an entry into the scholarly conversation.

                                                                                                                                                       Research as Inquiry | 99
       The Art of Asking Good Questions

Asking good questions is not always intuitive. It's a skill that should be developed by anyone
planning to do sustained research. It may even be helpful to think of it as an art. Thoughtful
questions generate discussion in research just as they do in a social setting; the two feed
into each other. Focus on formulating critical, open-ended questions while avoiding closed
questions that provide a definitive answer or attempt to prove a preconceived claim. Closed
questions are the opposite of inquiry, which requires an open-ended approach that sparks
deeper questions that drive the discourse around a given problem.
For example, the ACRL Framework emphasizes that "Research is iterative and depends
upon asking increasingly complex or new questions whose answers in turn develop addi-
tional questions or lines of inquiry in any field." Even though we often think about research
linearly, it's helpful to keep this iterative model in mind as you begin your research and start
looking for your entry into the scholarly conversation. You will no doubt find yourself cir-
cling back before you move forward. This iterative process is normal and even encouraged.

       Think Questions, not Topics

Topics tend to be broad and general. For example, you may start with topics such as James
Baldwin or "Sonny's Blues" as starting points. However, once you begin your research in
books, journals, and databases, realize that the authors you discover there are trying to
engage with you as much as you are with them. As you review the literature, be aware of
open questions and unexplored perspectives that may open doors for your research. Keep

100 | Research as Inquiry
a running list of questions as you read and continue refining them until one emerges as a
fully-realized research question.
Literary theories, which we discuss in a following chapter, provide many of the open-ended
questions that help us get into the inquiry process. Theorists are people who ask broad
open-ended questions that spark discussion, and it is quite common for researchers to
begin with one of these theory-based questions. For instance, a question common to Marx-
ist theory is to ask why people behave in ways that seem to be contrary to their own inter-
ests.
We will return to these issues in Chapter 9 when we discuss how to refine and evaluate a
research question more in-depth. Try to have a few questions ready for that section so you
can work through that process with us.

       The Invention Process

For your research project, you will need to make an argument: a claim with supporting evi-
dence and logic. But how do you generate that "stuff"? Where does it come from? For-
tunately for us, people who lived thousands of years ago figured it out! Inventio is the
Latin term for the discovery of arguments. Most arguments - already exist (and we discover
them). Sometimes we need to get creative and make a new argument (we invent them).
The term invention covers both discovery and invention.
Imagine a warehouse full of ready-made arguments that you can visit and discover. That
approach works a lot better and is a lot easier than making up the whole thing from
scratch, and it is not cheating. The Roman lawyer Cicero used the term stasis for the process
of using ready-made questions to clarify an issue and persuade an audience. He noted four
types: conjectural (What are the facts?), definitional (What does it mean?), qualitative (How
good or bad is it?), and translative (Was the matter handled appropriately?). Using Cicero's
stasis, we can discover the "stuff" we need for our research by asking the right questions
and then answering them.

                                                                                                                                                      Research as Inquiry | 101
Dr. Kip Wheeler, of Carson-Newman University, has produced a handy guide to invention
that includes many other types of invention such as narration, description, process, cause,
effect, etc. If you get stuck figuring out what questions to ask, visit Dr. Wheeler's page and

       Introduction

Searching as Strategic Exploration is a cornerstone of the ACRL's Framework for Informa-
tion Literacy: "Searching for information is often nonlinear and iterative, requiring the eval-
uation of a range of information sources and the mental flexibility to pursue alternate
avenues as new understanding develops." Further, "The act of searching often begins with
a question that directs the act of finding needed information. Encompassing inquiry, dis-

                                                                                                                                Searching as Strategic Exploration | 103
  covery, and serendipity, searching identifies... relevant sources as well as the means to
  access those sources."

                                            1

         Inquiry

  We introduced the importance of inquiry in the previous section where we linked it to
  curiosity and the art of asking good questions. Now let's dig deeper into this idea to empha-
  size the role inquiry plays in establishing a successful search strategy. For example, before
  you begin your search, take some time to answer the following questions:

     · What is the scope of your project and your information needs?
     · What types of information might you need and how will you access that information?

        Your options might include scholarly books, journal articles, film/media, art, statistics,
        demographics, and primary sources;
     · Do you know the core journals and subject databases in your field? If not, how can you
        learn about these? Spoiler alert: Meet with a librarian!
     · Who is your target audience?
     · Have you identified someone in your field you can talk to or email for recommenda-
        tions or advice?

  Answering these questions early will do a lot of work for you because the answers will help
  you to create a strategy that will shape and give direction to your research.
  Once you begin searching journals, databases, and other resources, refine your strategy
  based on the quality and relevance of your results. An important point is to approach this
  process with an open mind and base your conclusions on the evidence you find. Generally
  speaking, you want your research to generate discussion, but the nature of that discussion
  will depend on how open or closed the questions you're asking are. Is there a wealth of

evidence supporting a particular claim or is there room for interpretation and counter evi-
dence?
For a more detailed overview of this approach, let's watch Jada discussing the early stages
of her research about the James Baldwin short story, "Sonny's Blues":

       Key quotes from the video:
       Audience:
       "I'm communicating to others in the field. And so even if I'm just an undergrad
       writing a paper I try to frame the audience on a wider level of like `this could
       possibly be published in a journal' or `this could be a conference paper or a pre-
       sentation.'"
       Discovery:
       "I also wish I would have made an appointment with the librarian for a research
       consultation, because I think that would have definitely guided my research a
       little bit more."
       Serendipity:
       "Serendipity is a really important part of the research process just because it's
       important to have an open view of what you can add to your paper."

Note how Jada began her study by conducting basic background research online. She
specifically sought out interviews and videos with Baldwin so she could hear him discuss
his motivations and influences in his own words. While this type of information is not con-
sidered scholarly per se, it adds context to the story, which helped Jada be more strategic

                                                                                                                                Searching as Strategic Exploration | 105
as she transitioned from online searching to the literature databases available through the
UCF Libraries.

       Avoid "Finding Quotes to Support Your Claim"
       Many novice researchers approach the task with the idea that they just need to
       find a few quotes to support their claim and their research is done. The sooner
       we get past this idea, the better. You are finding quotes, but you should be will-
       ing to include ones that don't support your claim. Advanced researchers think of
       "positioning" their claims in relationship to others. Positioning means that your
       discuss how your claims are closer to some and further from others. There may
       be a discernible pattern to the group of claims made by other researchers, such
       that you can divide them into sub-types and put yours into a category. Later in
       this book (Chapter 6), we discuss the process of organizing our research materi-
       als into an annotated bibliography and then a review of literature. These tools
       allow you to show your readers how your research relates to that of others.

       Discovery

Once you have a list of questions you'd like to explore in our journals and databases,
the next step will be to break those questions into strategic keywords. Unlike popular
search engines, databases don't respond well to long queries or phrases. They are designed
around subject terms and keywords. Also note that the results you find in our databases
will include a list or lists of keywords and subject terms within the article records. Those are
there to guide your search and help you learn the language of the field. What types of ter-

106 | Searching as Strategic Exploration
minology or jargon do literature scholars use? Even a slight variation can make a significant
difference in the quality of your results

As Jada began searching key literature databases such as MLA and JSTOR, she broke her
broad search into strategic keywords that yielded high-quality scholarly articles. Before
searching the databases, you should take a few minutes to break your topic into keywords.

     Tips for Generating Keywords

            · Brainstorm possible keywords about your topic and think of synonyms
                before you start searching.

            · Avoid long phrases and queries. Databases are designed around keywords
                and subject terms. If you have a research question, break it into keywords
                before you start searching (watch the above video for guidance about how
                to do this).

            · Begin searching in a database (such as MLA) by entering those key terms
                into the search field (notice that the database will provide possible alterna-
                tives). So, searching "Race" as a general keyword generates alternate terms
                such as Race AND gender, ethnicity, minority, discrimination, relations,
                education, and America.

            · However, sometimes it helps to start with a broad search and use the data-
                base limiters to help you narrow and focus. For example, "race" generates
                19,528 results in MLA. Open the subject limiter in the sidebar that extracts
                subject terms from the database's records and breaks them down by
                which ones recur most often. That tool is designed to help researchers nar-
                row and focus as they're searching and there may be some new terms in
                there as well.

            · Once you start finding some relevant result, dig deeper by mining the arti-
                cle record and noting the subject terms and author-supplied keywords (if
                any); then, read the abstract as well as the introduction and highlight any
                new terms you find there. Pay particular attention to the author-supplied
                keywords when they appear because those are there to attract like-
                minded scholars to that article, and they can provide clues as to what
                types of terms other researchers are using.

                                                                                                                               Searching as Strategic Exploration | 107
            · Remember, this is an act of strategic exploration. It involves a lot of trial
                and error!

A brainstorming activity based on James Baldwin and "Sonny's Blues" might look some-
thing like this:

            Example [Discovery]

    Key terms:

          · Keyword A: James Baldwin
          · Keyword B: Sonny's Blues

This is just a preliminary list that will grow once we start searching, but it provides a sense
of how to break Jada's broad topic into strategic keywords, each of which opens new pos-
sibilities. While creating your list, avoid using overly generic terms such as "short story" or
"novel." You will get far too many results and the vast majority of them will not be helpful to
you.

       Serendipity

Researchers rarely go to the library for one book and come back with one book; they come
back with an armful of books, and the serendipitous discoveries they make while browsing
are often the most valuable.
Serendipity is an important part of the discovery process. While it's good to be strategic,
it's also wise to be open to unexpected discoveries that may impact the scope of your
research. Jada used the river and tributary analogy to account for the serendipity of her
research process. The river is the main stream of books and articles in the library catalog
and subject databases. The tributaries, however, are the unexpected discoveries and diver-
sions you make that can have a profound impact on your research.
The unexpected discovery in Jada's case was an article entitled, "The Sociology of the
Ghetto in James Baldwin's `Sonny's Blues.'" She discovered this article by expanding her
research beyond the key literature databases to bring a more interdisciplinary perspective
into her paper. In doing so, she discovered that sociologists were interested in the same
issues that influenced Baldwin's work, which in turn shed new light on her background and
experiences with race and class.
While it's difficult to plan for a serendipitous discovery, you can enhance your chances by
doing as Jada did: expanding the scope of your research to multiple perspectives and being
open to unexpected discoveries.

          from WritingCommons.org:
          Strategy is about being nimble and smart rather than worn down to the bone,
          and strategy also relies on self-reflection.

               · Scope, Rhetoric & Context: The value of information, how it is used, is
                  deeply rhetorical. When first examining your rhetorical context, analyze
                  whether your readers are receptive to personal observation. Alternatively,
                  do they expect textual research or experimental study? Thus, it's essential
                  that you evaluate what your readers know about your topic. What types of
                  information would your audience find persuasive? How contentious or
                  emotional is the topic? How much time do you have?

               · Serendipity & Flexibility: Be open to exploring information resources you
                  may be unfamiliar with, such as subject-specific databases, discussions
                  with experts, or just browsing and tracing footnotes from article to article.

               · Knowledge of Different Search Tools and Search Techniques. Are you
                  cognizant of the limitations of a Google Scholar Search vs. a search on Web
                  of Science or JSTOR? Do you know the difference between the Open Web,
                  the Deep Web, and the TOR Network?

Introduction

Related to Searching as Strategic Exploration is the idea of Scholarship as Conversation.
From the Framework for Information Literacy: "Communities of scholars, researchers, or
professionals engage in sustained discourse with new insights and discoveries occurring
over time as a result of varied perspectives and interpretations." They further add that,
"Instead of seeking discrete answers to complex problems, experts understand that a given

114 | Scholarship as Conversation
issue may be characterized by several competing perspectives as part of an ongoing con-
versation in which information users and creators come together and negotiate meaning."

Entering the Conversation

The conversation analogy can help us grasp the meaning and purpose of audience aware-
ness, a concept that is new to many students. Academic communities revolve around
questions researchers ask that move the conversation about a specific topic or problem for-
ward. They converse with each other through the research they present at conferences and
publish in scholarly books and journals. They also converse by email, in the hallways, and
through discussion boards hosted by Humanities Commons, H-Net, and others.

Joining a scholarly conversation for the first time can be both exciting and intimidating. We
might look to the more established scholars and think that they "belong" in the conversa-
tion and that we don't. These established scholars, like other people, may be welcoming to
scholars hoping to join the conversation or they may not be. If you meet first with scholars
who are not so welcoming, keep trying (but maybe with other scholars)! Joining the con-
versation is less about who you are and more about learning the guidelines. Scholarly con-
versation often follows the principles of dialogue. Some of them are:

  1. Listen - a lot- before jumping in
 2. Learn the key terms, the key questions, the key theories, the key figures, etc.
 3. Be curious - ask questions
 4. Be respectful
 5. Offer information or perspectives that haven't yet arisen in the conversation
 6. Don't be afraid to state a claim about a subject, but be prepared to defend the claim
 7. Be willing to change your mind if challenges to your claims are warranted
 8. Be open and receptive to feedback
 9. Remember that the goal of scholarly conversation is to improve our shared under-

      standing

One thing to know about established scholars is that they too have self-doubts. Many
experience what is known as "the imposter syndrome," the belief that they are a fraud
and don't belong in the conversation. Self-assessment is good and your level of expertise

                                                                                                                                          Scholarship as Conversation | 115
should be counted as a factor. But we should strive to create an environment where every-
one feels they belong. Necessarily, such an environment must put restrictions on behav-
ior that would make others feel unwelcome or that would threaten the project of gaining
real knowledge. Thus to sustain a welcoming environment, we should follow the guidelines
listed above and encourage others to do so as well.
Being open to feedback is absolutely necessary. We all make mistakes. When we do, and
someone points it out to us, we need to recognize the value of this feedback and take it to
heart. Your instructors are doing you a favor when they point to weaknesses in your work.
Advanced scholars have to accept critical feedback as well - from editors, reviewers, other
scholars, etc. The better we become at accepting this feedback, the more likely we are to
improve.
Before we discuss this concept more in-depth, let's watch Jada discuss her approach to
entering the scholarly conversation pertaining to James Baldwin and "Sonny's Blues."

       Key Quotes from the Video:
       Entering the Conversation:
       "The `Conversation' really informed my research process because I knew that it's
       important to value what these scholars are saying and that it can really add tex-
       ture to my paper and texture to what I'm thinking about."
       Overcoming the Anxiety of Influence:
       "Overcoming the Anxiety of Influence is really important when you're entering
       the scholarly conversation ... And I think the Anxiety of Influence really stops you
       from truly engaging [with] the text, [and with] what these scholars have to say."

116 | Scholarship as Conversation
         Identifying Gaps & Establishing Relevance:
         "A gap in the research is really just like a hole that you find almost, where you
         don't really see there's a lot of people in the field talking about it ... the gap that I
         found in my research was: why aren't there scholars, literary scholars specifically,
         talking about the way that race and class function together in literature?"

  Jada's experience growing up in the Bronx, and her father's interest in Jazz, gave her a nat-
  ural connection to the themes in "Sonny's Blues", and served as her entry into the con-
  versation about Baldwin, class, and critical race theory. Jada's background directed her to
  certain kinds of scholarship, which added texture and depth to her personal story as well as
  her reading of Baldwin.

         WritingCommons.org:
         In order to easily identify a conversation between your sources, look at those
         sources (articles, websites, images, videos, books), and think of these questions:

               · What kind of conversation can you see happening between your sources?
               · How many sources are communicating with each other? How are they

                  communicating?
               · Why don't other sources join that conversation? Do they engage in

                  another conversation? Can you link all conversations in one web?

Overcoming the Anxiety Making a Convincing Argument

of Influence, or  with You as the Authority

Many beginning researchers suffer from "the anxiety of influence": the fear of appearing as
a mere imitator to a more established researcher. The anxiety of influence affects both cre-
ative writers and literary scholars, though for now we are concerned only with the scholars.
The anxiety of influence often leads students to make the mistake of avoiding other schol-
arly texts because they believe it will influence them too much and thus will quash their
original ideas. Nevertheless, original ideas don't come from nowhere; they arise from our
engagement with other scholarly texts.

"Influence" is a tricky word since it implies that the past is acting upon you; however, you,
as the scholar, are in the driver's seat. You select ideas from those around you and arrange
them in ways that convincingly make the case you set out to make. Of course, you need to
cite ideas that are not your own and give credit where it is due, but you are the one respon-
sible for the finished product.

Think of this responsibility - of being the authority - as being similar to that of a museum
curator. The curator is usually presenting other people's work but is doing so to support a

2. OkStateLibrary, director. Inform Your Thinking: Episode 1 - Research Is a Conversation. YouTube, 18 May 2016,

   118 | Scholarship as Conversation
claim or share a point of view. The curator is responsible for knowing about the material
and not misrepresenting it. The same is true for you as you write your paper.
Another analogy for positioning yourself as the authority is the tour guide. The tour guide
uses the following methods to establish authority and a point of view:

         Tell people where you are going (introduction).
         Along the way, tell them about the significance of what they will see.
         While there, point to each item and explain its significance and its relationship to

            the other items.
         On the way back (the conclusion of your essay), summarize the main points.

The key here is to decide what the significance is. For example, if you are taking a group of
people on a tour of the pyramids in Egypt, your focus might be on Egyptian mythology, and
your point might be that it contributed to Judeo-Christian beliefs and culture. Then, every-
thing you point out at the site will keep to that original point.
Instead, perhaps you want to focus on the significance of the division of labor in ancient
Egypt. Then, you will discuss work, technology, and money, and you might point to evi-
dence about how workers lived and about the tools they used. In other words, we must
decide what significance we make of the materials. The most effective way to convey sig-
nificance is by focusing on the consequences of the argument. Since X is true, then Y is a
result.

            Example [Scholarship as Conversation]

     Since ancient Egyptian society had skilled craftsmen and precise tools, they must
     have had a way to teach their technical skills to succeeding generations.

The anxiety of influence often leads students to the "hit and run" citation style: papers con-
sisting of quotes strung together with little context or analysis. Always comment on quotes
and incorporate them into your argument. Your readers want to know what you think and

                                                                                                                                          Scholarship as Conversation | 119
how you think. Show readers how you think by leading them through a series of inferences.
Imagine your work as a conversation with others in the field; be engaged as well as engag-
ing and always keep in mind why your argument is important.

       For more advice on Overcoming Anxiety and You as the Authority, consider
       the following from Harvard College Writing Center:
       As the writer of an essay, imagine yourself crossing a river, guiding a troop of
       avid readers. You bring an armful of stones to lay down and step on as you go;
       each stone is a sentence or paragraph that speaks to and develops the essay's
       thesis, or central question. If you find yourself in the middle of the river with
       another mile to shore but only a few more stones, you can't finesse such a situa­
       tion. You can't ask your readers to follow you and jump too broad a span. In such
       a case, stop. Ask yourself if you need more stones--more sentences or para­
       graphs--or if perhaps you have already used ones that more properly belong
       ahead. On a second look, you may decide that the distance between stones is
       not that great, after all; perhaps your reader only needs a hand of assistance to
       get from one stone, or paragraph, to the next.

Originality may or may not be the most important consideration for literary scholars and
writers; we can be original by doing something strange or unexpected but that otherwise
has no clear purpose or value. The most recognized works of literature, or criticism and the-
ory, are often those that show startling originality and have extremely high value. Learning
how to recognize value, in your own work and others, is the hallmark of excellence in our
field. Typically, it involves acquiring a lot of knowledge about the field.

Identifying Gaps

Many researchers find productive problems by looking for gaps in the published research.

120 | Scholarship as Conversation
"Gaps" refers to areas of research that have yet to be fully explored. They may be neglected
or overlooked areas but they can also be tensions and contradictions in the research. To go
back to the conversation analogy, gaps, tensions, and contradictions are identified through
the ongoing debate among scholars. Identifying gaps is accomplished by conducting a lit-
erature review and asking critical open-ended questions - such as who, what, when, where,
why, and how - about your findings. Your goal is to contribute something unique that will
generate new knowledge, help solve a problem, and keep the conversation going. Filling a
gap in knowledge is often a "low stakes" exercise since it accepts the paradigm of knowl-
edge - the big picture - and strives to fill in the margins. Imagine a large mosaic where the
general outline and main features are done, but not all the areas are filled in. Think of these
unfinished areas as the "gaps."

Establishing Relevance

We introduced the idea of relevance and purpose in Chapter 2 where we noted that rele-
vance is an entry into the scholarly conversation, and that it can be evaluated against spe-
cific criteria. "Sonny's Blues" raises questions about the impact of systemic racism on black
individuals and families, and it celebrates the creativity and resilience of black culture, mak-
ing the story relevant to a large audience many years later. The similarities between Jada's
experiences and Baldwin's literary work and biography motivated her to conduct research,
but Jada has to consider whether including her personal story in the writing will be relevant
or necessary to her audience and research question.

                                                                                                                                          Scholarship as Conversation | 121

Chapter 4 Objectives

BARRY MAUER AND JOHN VENECEK

Objectives

This chapter covers the following topics: research goals, theory, methodology, method,
and research skills. Engagement with a specific theory can help guide your research. For
example, Jada applied Critical Race Theory (CRT) to her interpretation of "Sonny's Blues."
This choice helped Jada establish the parameters of her literature review and allowed her
to be strategic when she was searching journals and databases. Having this theory helped
Jada interpret Baldwin's work and helped guide her research process as well.
Each theory comes with a set of methodologies, which are research positions and practices
for specific subject areas. For instance, Critical Race Theory often entails an examination
of intersectionality as a subject area; intersectionality refers to the ways that identity cate-
gories like race, class, gender, nationality, and sexual orientation combine and play out in
various situations. To understand intersectionality, a researcher working with CRT can turn
to the research practice of standpoint epistemology and structural determinism. Stand­
point epistemology takes the position that authority comes from personal experience in
social and political contexts. Therefore, while black people may share some experiences,
standpoint epistemology looks to the experiences and knowledge of particular people to
better understand each person's perspective. Structural determinism takes the position

124 | Chapter 4 Objectives
that each person's subjectivity is determined to a large extent by structural systems, such
as language, that they inhabit. A CRT researcher will look to larger structural systems, such
as institutions, languages, and information technologies, to better understand the condi-
tions in which people develop their perspectives. While standpoint epistemology looks to
the particular, structural determinism looks to the general.

A CRT research project would require study of the theory and its associated methodologies
before you begin your major research efforts into the literary work.

Once you've identified a problem you'd like to research and a theory (or theories), you'll
need to choose research methods that are appropriate for your project and some knowl-
edge about how to use them. Research methods are about where and how you search to
get answers to your research questions. Are you conducting interviews? Visiting archives?
Doing close readings? Reviewing scholarship? You will need to choose which methods are
most appropriate to use in your research and you need to gain some knowledge about how
to use these methods.

How do theory and method differ? A good rule of thumb is that a theory is an explanation
and a method is a practice. Freudian theory, for example, is an explanation about human
psychological development. Dream interpretation is an example of a Freudian method; it is
a procedure for gathering information and understanding what is going on in someone's
mind.

We use research skills to help us gather the right evidence. This evidence, comprised of
facts and reasoning, aims to convince your audience to accept your conclusions about a lit-
erary work. The most important piece of evidence in your research is the literary work itself,
which is a "fact" that your audience can witness with you. Research means finding more
facts about the literary work and tying them together with reasoning.

Theory is often understood as a lens through which we look at an object (such as a literary
work). Each literary theory provides a different lens. Different lenses can make it seem like
we are reading radically different literary works; however, they may just be different read-
ings of the same work. A theory relates to particular research methods more strongly than
others. As you explore theoretical approaches, methodologies, and methods, think about
the effects of these various lenses and be aware that the theory lens you choose will deter-

Research Goals

BARRY MAUER AND JOHN VENECEK

Researchers work with a goal in mind. Common goals include
  · Bringing readers closer to a text
  · Connecting a text to a larger context
  · Connecting a text with other knowledge frameworks such as science

Wendy Belcher, in Writing Your Journal Article in 12 Weeks, discusses the first two main
approaches to understanding literary works: looking at a text by itself (associated with New
Criticism) and looking at texts as they connect to society (associated with Cultural Studies).
The goal of New Criticism is to bring the reader further into the text. The goal of Cultural
Studies is to discuss the network of discourses that surround and pass through the text (its
context). Other approaches, such as Ecocriticism, relate literary texts to the Sciences (as well
as to the Humanities).
The New Critics, starting in the 1940s, focused on meaning within the text itself, using a
method they called "close reading." The literary text itself becomes evidence for a particu­
lar reading. Using this approach, you should summarize the literary work briefly and quote

128 | Research Goals
particularly meaningful passages, being sure to introduce quotes and then interpret them
(never let them stand alone). Make connections within the work; ask "why" and "how" the
various parts of the text relate to each other.
Cultural Studies critics see all texts as connected to society; the critic therefore has to con­
nect a text to at least one political or social issue. The methodologies associated with cul­
tural studies involve studies of power and studies of discourse (the language systems we
use to make sense of the world). How and why does the text reproduce particular knowl­
edge systems (known as discourses) and how do these knowledge systems relate to issues
of power within the society? Who speaks and when? Answering these questions helps your
reader understand the text in context. Cultural contexts can include the treatment of gen­
der (Feminist, Queer), class (Marxist), nationality, race, religion, or any other area of human
society.
Other approaches, such as psychoanalytic literary criticism, look at literary texts to better
understand human psychology. A psychoanalytic reading can focus on a character, the
author, the reader, or on society in general. Ecocriticism look at human understandings of
nature in literary texts.
Let's look at how two related theories - American formalism and Russian Formalism - seek
different goals, and note that each one has attendant beliefs and practices that are related
to these goals:

                                                                                                                                                             Research Goals | 129

  · Exercises [Discussion]

        Theory

A theory is an idea or model about literature in general (rather than about a specific literary
work). A theory can account for:

  · What things are
  · Why they are the way they are
  · How and why they work
Theories can be about physical things, like people or books, or abstract concepts, like patri-
archy, love, or being. The English word theory derives from an Ancient Greek word theoria,
meaning "a looking at, viewing, beholding." In contrast to practical ways of knowing (which
are about how to do things), theory usually refers to contemplative and reflective ways of
knowing (which are about what things are).
Theory is full of terminology, which often makes it challenging for beginning researchers.
The terminology in theory is a kind of shorthand for concepts. These concepts are similar
to those little capsule sponge critters that expand when you leave them in water. The the-
ory term is the compressed critter in the capsule and the fully explained concept is the
expanded sponge critter. Advanced theorists and critics often use just the terminology (or
the capsule, in our `sponge critter' analogy) as a kind of shorthand conversation with one
another. However, researchers who are unfamiliar with a theorist's terminology have to
expand their knowledge of the terminology (the capsule) by conducting additional analysis.
By completing this additional analysis, researchers can come to understand each concept's
relationships to other concepts (or the expanded sponge critter in our analogy). Once we
have expanded the terminology (capsule) into the concepts (sponge critter), we can realize
how valuable and significant these concepts are to our particular field of study.

134 | Theories
        Example [Theory]

        Below are a few terms (and their definitions) that start with the letter "A" selected
        from a single book by theorist Gregory Ulmer (who borrows terms from many the­
        oretical discourses and even invents some of his own):

                    · Abductive reasoning - from thing to rule.
                    · Abject - a formless value, not yet recognized.
                    · Alienation - separation from one's capacity to act; the basis of compas­

                       sion fatigue.
                    · Allegory - like a parable, a story with a moral linked via metaphor to

                       another story.
                    · Aporia - a blind spot, an impasse, a dilemma, an inability to move

                       ahead, or conventionally, an inability to choose between sets of equally
                       desirable (or undesirable) alternatives.
                    · Apparatus - technology, institutional practices, and subject formation.
                    · Arabesque - an ornamental design of interlaced patterns of repeated
                       shapes (floral or geometric) said to be the most typical feature of Islamic
                       aesthetics.
                    · Aspectuality - an image whose intelligibility is determined by the
                       aspect of the viewer: the duck-rabbit, for example.
                    · ATH (até) - blindness or foolishness in an individual: calamity and disas­
                       ter in a collective.
                    · Attraction and repulsion - two poles (the sublime and the excremental).
                    · Attunement (stimmung) - the feeling that this is how the world is;
                       results from mapping discourses.

                                                                                                1

                    · Aura - a sign of recognition.

We don't expect you to learn the terms in this list; we provide them to show how dense and
complicated theory can be. Notice how the definitions for each theory term above contain
even more terms - like "formless," "compassion fatigue," and "blind spot" - that need fur-
ther unpacking. Theory tends to be very dense; it crams lots of ideas into every page. Entire
dictionaries are devoted to literary theory terms (see for instance Joseph Childers and Gary
Hentzi, The Columbia Dictionary of Modern Literary and Cultural Criticism, Columbia Uni-
versity Press, 1995). There are entire dictionaries dedicated to the terms used by a single
theorist (see for instance Dylan Evans, An Introductory Dictionary of Lacanian Psycho­
analysis. Routledge, 2006).

Literary scholars use theories to frame their perspectives of literary works. Each theory is
like a different "lens" through which to view a literary work and changing lenses gives us
very different views of a work. Below are a few examples of major literary theories: (Note:
this list is nowhere near complete.)

      Major Literary Theories

            · Audience studies look at how a particular text was received in its day. Such
                studies might involve reading critical reviews from the period, looking at
                promotional materials, overall sales, and re-use of a text by other writers or
                artists. More recently, it could involve studying online communities and
                their uses and responses to a literary text.

            · Cultural studies theories, such as New Historicism, Post-colonialism, or
                Multiculturalism, look at how texts use discourses to represent the world,
                social relations, and meanings. Cultural studies theories also examine the
                relationships of these discourses to power: how groups in power use par-
                ticular discourses to justify their power and how those with less power
                negotiate these discourses and generate their own discourses.

            · Ecological studies examine the ways that human and natural environ-
                ments are represented in texts.

            · Feminist studies examine the way gender and sexuality shape the pro-
                duction and distribution of texts, or they examine the representation of
                gender in texts.

            · Genre studies explore what features constitute a literary genre and
                whether or how well a text meets these expectations, deviates from them
                (successfully or unsuccessfully), or establishes new genre expectations.

136 | Theories
            · Linguistic studies examine the specific uses of language within a text and
                can include regional dialect, novel use of terminology, the development of
                language over time, etc.

            · Marxist studies examine the way historical and economic factors operate
                in the production and distribution of texts, or in the representation of
                social and economic relationships of people in texts.

            · Post-structuralist studies make claims about instabilities within a text -
                particularly at how its binary structures, such as male-female, black-white,
                East-West, and living-dead, start to break down or take on one another's
                features.

            · Psychological studies look at a text, its author, or the society in which it
                was produced in terms of psychological features and processes. These fea-
                tures and processes might include identity formation, healthy or
                unhealthy qualities of mind, dreams and symptoms, etc.

            · Queer studies challenges heteronormativity in texts and focuses on sexual
                identity and desire.

Theorists find unanswered questions or return to key questions with different answers
or different approaches. By and large these questions are about things in general (for
instance, they ask about category systems). Theory is often counterintuitive, meaning that
it does not align with common sense. For instance, it was common sense that the Earth
was stationary and the sun moved across the sky, rising in the east and setting in the west.
Copernicus theorized, counterintuitively, that the Earth rotated, which made it appear that
the sun was moving. Theorists change our picture of how the world works. In your writing,
you should clearly communicate how your chosen theorist(s) change our pictures of the
world.

Before you write your research paper (or project), you should do some broad research into
the theory you are assigned (or that you choose) as well as some deeper research into
the specific concept(s) you will be using from that theory. Broad research can include
Wikipedia entries or the various "For Beginners" or "Introducing" books, such as Lacan
for Beginners by Philip Hill, (1999) or Introducing Lacan by Darian Leader and Judy Groves
(1995). Once you have a good general understanding of a theory, then dive into a work writ-
ten by the theorist. Most literary critics combine two or more theories. They choose their
theories based on their interests, their audience, or their research question. Consult with

                                                                                                                                                                       Theories | 137
your professor or a more experienced researcher about which theory or theories to use for
your research.
Each theory entails particular research questions, methodologies, and methods. For
instance, Ecological theory, also called Ecocriticism, entails questions about the representa-
tion of human culture and nature. How or where does a text draw a line between the two?
What assumptions does a text make about culture and nature? What consequences do
these assumptions produce in terms of moving us towards ecological destruction or sus-
tainability? Ecological theory employs methodologies such as studies of the environment
and historical research into ideas about nature and culture and how they have changed
over time. It also also entails particular research methods such as close readings of literary
texts and research into the scholarship of literature and nature.
Note: in literary research, a theory is not an "unproven fact." Rather, it is an explanation of
how facts relate to one another. For instance, Marxism provides a theory of various values
(such as labor value, sign value, exchange value, use value, and so on). These theories
explain certain facts, like why a necklace made with diamonds and an identical-looking
necklace made with costume jewels can have the same sign-value (in other words, the
same power to impress) but different exchange values (one being much more expensive
than another). The difference between sign values and exchange values plays out, for
instance, in Guy de Maupassant's short story titled "The Diamond Necklace." Facts are
things we can observe but also include the reasoned inferences we draw from those obser-
vations (i.e., that jewels are valuable); theories explain "the bigger picture" (like why humans
came to value jewels).

        Methodologies

Methodologies (not to be confused with methods - more about that later) are positions
and behaviors that researchers within a theoretical paradigm use in their research.

138 | Theories
        Criticism

Criticism is a specific treatment of a literary work. It often uses theory to make a case
about the work. For example, we might start a work of literary criticism by selecting a short
story by William Faulkner and considering it in terms of one of the concepts from Gregory
Ulmer's work such as abject, alienation, allegory, aporia, apparatus, aspectuality, assem-
blage, ATH, attraction and repulsion, attunement, or aura. Any of these ideas could make
for a valuable and interesting approach to Faulkner's work. Trying to write a paper without
such concepts is unlikely to yield valuable and interesting results. Theory concepts give us
lots of great material! By using the concepts and terms common to our area of study, you
connect your work to the ongoing conversation, making it relevant!

        Method

Method is the procedure that researchers use to answer their research question. For
instance, a paper investigating Faulkner's use of allegory may involve methods of historical
research that reveal how literary authors have understood allegory and used it over time.
The project could also involve methods of close reading of a literary text to notice details
other critics have missed. We will address both method and close reading more fully in the
following pages.

                                                                                                                                                                       Theories | 139
Research Skills

Research Skills are the knowledge and practices you need to gather the evidence to

answer your research question and to support your argument. These skills can include

things like how to use search engines and finding aids, how to use citation management

software,  and   how  to  evaluate  sources.

Exercises [Discussion]

linked to literary theories. Methodologies are necessary to working with theories. They serve
as the interfaces between theory (purely conceptual) and praxis (practical application).
Methodologies consist of tools and lines of investigation: sets of practices and propositions
about texts and the world. Researchers using Marxist literary criticism adopt methodolo-
gies that seek to understand literature and its relationship to the world by looking to mate-
rial forces like labor, ownership, and technology. These researchers also seek to understand
authors not as inspired geniuses but as people whose lives and work are shaped by social,
economic, and historical forces. Daniel Hartley, in his "Marxist Literary Criticism: An Intro-
ductory Reading Guide" (2018) describes some areas of inquiry and methodologies used by
Marxist literary critics.

            Example [Marxist Theory Methodologies]

     Areas of inquiry:
          · Anthropological: investigates the social functions of art
          · Political: investigates the link between literature and the political fortunes of
             classes and political systems such as capitalism and socialism
          · Ideological: investigates the link between literature and identity

     Methodologies:
          · Genetic Structuralism: "Lucien Goldmann . . . examined the structure of liter­
             ary texts to discover the degree to which it embodied the `world vision' of the
             class to which the writer belonged. For Goldmann literary works are the prod­
             uct, not of individuals, but of the `transindividual mental structures' of specific
             social groups. These `mental structures' or `world visions' are themselves
             understood as ideological constructions produced by specific historical con­
             junctures."
          · Dialectical criticism: Emphasizes "reflexivity and totality: it stresses the way in
             which `the [critic's] mind must deal with its own thought process just as
             much as with the material it works on' (Fredric Jameson); it holds that literary

142 | Methodologies
             works internalise social forms, situations and structures, yet simultaneously
             refuse them (thereby generating a critical negativity that resists vulgar eco­
             nomic or political reductionism); and it takes the mediated (not external or
             abstract) social totality as its ultimate critical purview."

Jada, in her research about James Baldwin's story, "Sonny's Blues," uses both Marxist theory
and Critical Race Theory (CRT). Critical Race Theorists seek to understand the world in
terms of structural forces that lead to unequal outcomes for different groups. It posits that
these unequal outcomes may persist even when no individual person in an institutional
role holds racial animus. For instance, there may be a gap between the student achieve-
ments of one group and those of another. Rather than posit blame on the teachers or the
students, a critical race theorist would seek to understand the structural forces leading to
these unequal outcomes; housing insecurity, hunger, and other factors may be responsible.
Below are some of the methodologies that CRT researchers use.

            Example [Critical Race Theory Methodologies]

     Critical Race Theorists use a variety of methodologies, including
          · Interest convergence: investigates whether marginalized groups only
             achieve progress when dominant groups benefit as well
          · Intersectional theory: investigates how multiple factors of advantage and dis­
             advantage around race, gender, ethnicity, religion, etc. operate together in
             complex ways
          · Radical critique of the law: investigates how the law has historically been
             used to marginalize particular groups, such as black people, while recogniz­
             ing that legal efforts are important to achieve emancipation and civil rights
          · Social constructivism: investigates how race is socially constructed (rather

                                                                                                                                                             Methodologies | 143
             than biologically grounded)
          · Standpoint epistemology: investigates how knowledge relates to individual

             experience and social position
          · Structural determinism: investigates how structures of thought and of orga­

             nizations determine social outcomes

Wikipedia can help with finding methodologies. For instance, the page about Cultural
Studies notes that the primary areas of study are about power, which consists of many
other things (such as ideology, social relations, etc.) and discourse (the languages and world
views found in and around texts). You can follow the citation links in wikipedia to research
each methodology. Better still, use your library. Cultural Studies has subdivisions, which
include New Historicism, Multiculturalism, and Postcolonialism. One methodology of Cul-
tural Studies is radical contextualism, which "rejects universal accounts of cultural prac-
tices, meanings, and identities."

Some psychological theories, such as Freudian and Lacanian, use a set of methodologies
referred to as "symptomatic." The analogy is to medicine and the ways in which doctors
seek to diagnose a patient's condition based on their presenting symptoms. Since many
medical conditions can produce similar symptoms (for instance, chest congestion can be
caused by a cold, the flu, COVID, and many other conditions), a doctor has to look closely
at a set of symptoms, use their knowledge of various medical conditions and how they pre-
sent, and reason abductively (from effects to causes) to figure out what the underlying con-
dition is. Similarly, a Freudian or Lacanian reading of a literary text will look for clues related
to the characters, narrator, author, or audience to determine what underlying conditions
are present. These conditions may be cognitive (beliefs), affective (feelings), or interpersonal
(relationships). They also can be a combination of these things.

Theorists don't always label their methodologies as such. You need to look into each theory
to see what positions the theorists take, what they study, and why. The "methods" part is
about how they study. Not every methodology will work with every theory. You will need to
do some research to discover which methodologies are most appropriate for your project.

        Research Methods

Before discussing research methods, we need to distinguish them from methodolo­
gies and research skills.

  · Methodologies, linked to literary theories, are tools and lines of investigation: sets of
      practices and propositions about texts and the world.

  · Research methods are about where and how you get answers to your research ques­
      tions. Are you conducting interviews? Visiting archives? Doing close readings? Review­
      ing scholarship? You will need to choose which methods are most appropriate to use
      in your research and you need to gain some knowledge about how to use these meth­
      ods. In other words, you need to do some research into research methods!

  · Research skills are about how you handle materials such as library search engines,
      citation management programs, special collections materials, and so on.

Your choice of research method depends on the kind of questions you are asking. For
example, if you want to understand how an author progressed through several drafts to
arrive at a final manuscript, you may need to use archival research methods. If you want to
understand why a particular literary work became a bestseller, you may need to use audi-
ence studies research methods. If you want to know why a contemporary author wrote a
particular work, you may need to interview the author. Usually literary research involves a
combination of methods such as archival research and discourse analysis.

Literary research methods tend to differ from research methods in the hard sciences (such
as physics and chemistry). Science research must present results that are reproducible,
while literary research rarely does (though it must still present evidence for its claims).
Literary research often deals with questions of meaning, social conventions, representa-
tions of lived experience, and aesthetic effects; these are questions that reward dialogue

                                                                                                                                                       Research Methods | 147
and different perspectives rather than one great experiment that settles the issue. In lit-
erary research, we might get many valuable answers even though they are quite different
from one another. Also in literary research, we usually have some room to speculate about
answers, but our claims have to be plausible (believable) and our argument comprehensive
(meaning we don't overlook evidence that would alter our argument significantly if it were
known).

       A literary researcher might select the following set of theories and tools:
            · Theory: Critical Race Theory (CRT)
            · Methodology: Social Constructivism
            · Method: Scholarly
            · Skills: Search engines, citation management

        Research Method Types

We select our research methods based on the kinds of things we want to know. For exam-
ple, we may be studying the relationship between literature and society, between author
and text, or the status of a work in the literary canon. We may want to know about a work's
form, genre, or thematics. We may want to know about the audience's reading and recep-
tion, or about methods for teaching literature in schools.
Below are a few research methods and their descriptions. You may need to consult with
your instructor about which ones are most appropriate for your project. The first list covers
methods most students use in their work. The second list covers methods more commonly
used by advanced researchers. You can use them in your research project (though it's a
good idea to ask your instructor first), and you are likely to encounter these research meth-
ods in some of the scholarship you find. Most scholars combine methods, though one may

148 | Research Methods
be the primary and the others secondary. By understanding what your project requires, you
will be able to determine which research methods you need.

Most commonly used undergraduate research methods:

  1. Scholarship Methods: Studies the body of published scholarship written about a par-
      ticular author, literary work, historical period, literary movement, genre, theme, theory,
      or method.

 2. Textual Analysis Methods: Used for close readings of literary texts, these methods also
      rely on literary theory and background information to support the reading.

 3. Biographical Methods: Used to study the life of the author to better understand their
      work and times, these methods involve reading biographies and autobiographies
      about the author, and may also include research into private papers, correspondence,
      and interviews.

 4. Discourse Analysis Methods: Studies language patterns to reveal ideology and social
      relations of power. This research involves the study of institutions, social groups, and
      social movements to understand how people in various settings use language to rep-
      resent the world to themselves and others. Literary works may present complex mix-
      tures of discourses which the characters (and readers) have to navigate.

 5. Literary Methods: A literary re-working of another literary text, making a literary text as
      research can be used to better understand a literary work by investigating its lan-
      guage, formal structures, composition methods, themes, and so on. For instance, a
      creative literary research project may retell a story from a minor character's perspec-
      tive. To qualify as research, a creative research project is usually accompanied with a
      piece of scholarly writing that explains and justifies the work.

Methods used more often by advanced researchers:

  1. Archival Methods: Usually involves trips to special collections where original papers
      are kept. In these archives are many unpublished materials such as diaries, letters,
      photographs, ledgers, and so on. These materials can offer us invaluable insight into
      the life of an author, the development of a literary work, or the society in which the
      author lived. There are at least three major archives of James Baldwin's papers: The
      Smithsonian, Yale, and The New York Public Library. Descriptions of such materials are
      often available online, but the materials themselves are typically stored in boxes at the
      archive.

 2. Computational Methods: Used for statistical analysis of texts such as studies of the
      popularity and meaning of particular words in literature over time.

 3. Ethnographic Methods: Studies groups of people and their interactions with literary
      works, for instance in educational institutions, in reading groups (such as book clubs),

                                                                                                                                                       Research Methods | 149
        and in fan networks. This approach may involve interviews and visits to places (includ-
        ing online communities) where people interact with literary works. Note: before you
        begin such work, you must have Institutional Review Board (IRB) approval "to protect
        the rights and welfare of human participants involved in research."
   4. Visual Methods: Studies the visual qualities of literary works. Some literary works, such
        as illuminated manuscripts, children's literature, and graphic novels, present a com-
        plex interplay of text and image. Even works without illustrations can be studied for
        their use of typography, layout, and other visual features.
   5. Experimental Methods: Investigates how literary practices can themselves generate
        knowledge. A key exemplar here is the experimental literary group OuLiPo. From the
        Poetry Foundation: "OuLiPo . . . emphasizes systematic, self-restricting means of mak-
        ing texts. For example, the technique known as n + 7 replaces every noun in an exist-
        ing text with the noun that follows seven entries after it in the dictionary." The goal is
        to see what results from such experiments and to determine whether they have liter-
        ary and critical value.

  Regardless of the method(s) you choose, you will need to learn how to apply them to your
  work and how to carry them out successfully. For example, you should know that many
  archives do not allow you to bring pens (you can use pencils) and you may not be allowed
  to bring bags into the archives. You will need to keep a record of which documents you
  consult and their location (box number, etc.) in the archives. If you are unsure how to use

                                                                                                                                1

  a particular method, please consult a book about it. Also, ask for the advice of trained
  researchers such as your instructor or a research librarian.

Research skills are all about gathering evidence. This evidence, composed of facts and the
reasoning that connects them, aims to convince your audience to accept your conclusions
about the literary work. The most important piece of evidence you need to discuss is the
literary work itself, which is a "fact" that you and your audience can examine together.
Research means finding additional facts about the literary work and tying them together
with reasoning to reach a significant and convincing conclusion.

Literature often presents us with factual difficulties. Sometimes authors revised their works
and multiple versions exist. William Blake printed his own works and often changed illus-
trations and words between each printing. If we are reading a translated work, there may
be more than one translation. In other words, we first need to identify which literary "object"
we are studying. Electronic databases, such as the William Blake Archive, provide scholars
with multiple versions of literary works, as well as plenty of reference sources. They are great
places to begin a study!

The kind of evidence we need is directly related to the kind of claim we are making. If we
want to claim that a literary work has seen a resurgence of public interest, we will look for
historical evidence and quantitative evidence (statistics) to show that sales of the work (or
database searches, or library checkouts, etc.) have increased. We may also seek qualitative
evidence (such as interviews with booksellers and readers) to report on their impressions.
We may look to see if there has been an increase in the number and kinds of adaptations.
One example of such a work is Denis Perry's and Carl Sederholm's edited volume, Adapt­
ing Poe: Re-imaginings in Popular Culture (Spring 2012). If we are claiming that a literary
work has a special relationship to a geographic region, we will look for textual evidence,
geographic evidence, and historical evidence. See for example, Tom Conley's The Self-Made
Map (University of Minnesota Press 1996), which argues that geographic regions of France
played a key role in Miguel de Montaigne's Essais.

                                                                                                                                                             Research Skills | 153

      Types of Evidence

         Your choice of problem, theory, methodology, and method impact the kinds of
         evidence you will be seeking. Wendy Belcher identifies the following types:

              1. Qualitative Evidence: Data on human behavior collected through direct
                  observation, interviews, documents, and basic ethnography (191).
                  The SAGE Handbook of Qualitative Research (2005) is a helpful guide. This
                  area also encompasses audience research. Examples include the jour­
                  nal Reception: Texts, Readers, Audiences, History, the edited volume The
                  Reader in the Text: Essays on Audience and Interpretation (Suleiman,
                  Crosman, eds. 1980), and Media and Print Cultural Consumption in Nine­
                  teenth-Century Britain (Rooney and Gasperini, eds. 2016).

             2. Quantitative Evidence: Data collected from standardized instruments
                  and statistics, common to education, medicine, sociology, political sci­
                  ences, psychology, and economics (191). Guides include Best Practices in
                  Quantitative Methods (Osbourne 2007) and Statistics for People Who
                  (Think that They) Hate Statistics (Salkind 2007).

             3. Historical Evidence: Data collected from examinations of historical records
                  to uncover the relationship of people to each other and to periods and
                  events, common to all disciplines and collected from archives of primary
                  materials (191). Guides include Historical Evidence and Argument (Henige
                  2006) and Evidence Explained: Citing History Sources from Artifacts to
                  Cyberspace, 2nd Edition (Mills 2009).

             4. Geographic Evidence: Data about people's relationship to places and envi­
                  ronments in fields such as archaeology (191). Guides include Qualitative
                  Research Methods in Human Geography, 5th Edition (Hay and Cope 2021)
                  and Creative Methods for Human Geographers (Benzon, Holton, Wilkin­
                  son, eds. 2021).

  Using Evidence for a Research Project.

  154 | Research Skills
              5. Textual Evidence: Data collected from texts about form (genre, plot, etc.),
                  language (diction, rhetoric), purpose (message, function), meaning (sym­
                  bolism, themes, etc.) and milieu (sources, culture, identity, etc.) (191). Guides
                  include Introduction to Literary Hermeneutics (Szondi 1995) and The
                  Hermeneutic Spiral and Interpretation in Literature and the Visual
                  Arts (O'Toole 2018).

             6. Artistic Evidence: Data from images, live performances, etc., used to study
                  physical properties of a work (size, material, form, etc.), purpose (mes­
                  sage, function, etc.) meaning (symbolism, etc.), and milieu (sources, cul­
                  ture, etc.) (191). Guides include Interpreting Objects and Collections (Pearce
                  1994) and Material Culture Studies in America (Schlereth, ed. 1982).

  In the following chapters, five through nine, we present instruction for numerous research
  skills including how to gather research from literary works and from scholarly literature,
  and other skills such as how to use library search engines, citation management, google
  scholar, and source evaluation. The main thing to keep in mind for now is that you are gath-
  ering quality evidence and putting it together to construct a convincing and compelling
  argument about a literary work (or works).

          For more advice on how to Reason with Evidence, consider the following

                                                                                 2

Chapter 5 Objectives

BARRY MAUER AND JOHN VENECEK

Objectives

This chapter covers the ways that literary scholars read and interpret literary works. Before
we can do research about a literary work, we need to have some understanding of the
literary text. Literary scholars tend to re-read a text many times: before doing additional
research, during research, and during the writing process. A literary text stands as the most
valuable "evidence" that a literary scholar presents to readers. In "Reading Literary Works,"
we introduce three strategies for reading a literary work, including explication, analysis, and
comparison/contrast. Your research project should make use of at least one of each of these
reading strategies. In "Interpreting Literary Works," we introduce two major interpretive
strategies: explicatory and symptomatic. You should choose at least one of the interpreta-
tion strategies (it's ok to combine them too).

This chapter presents you with four tasks, three of which give you opportunities to practice

                                                                                                                                                    Chapter 5 Objectives | 159
working with literary texts through reading, interpreting, and critiquing selected literary
works. The fourth task is for you to determine what intercultural competency you need to
develop for research on your chosen literary work.

160 | Chapter 5 Objectives
        Learning Objectives

These pages provide practical advice on how to read literary works before begin­
ning your research project. By learning these lessons, you will be able to use the fol­
lowing strategies in your reading of literary works:

     · explication
     · analysis
     · comparison/contrast
Great critics learn to use many reading skills and to demonstrate to audiences how
they read, understand, and critique a text. Interpretation requires great skill and is
difficult to master. The two interpretive paradigms you will learn are:
     · explicatory, which transforms implicit meaning into explicit meaning.
     · symptomatic, which suggest a text's explicit message is betrayed by another

        message that the text has attempted to disguise.
Your research will benefit when you use these strategies before you formulate your
research question and thesis statement.

        Reading Literary Works

Literary scholars care very much about how other people read texts. Reading is an activity
that reveals a lot about how we think, feel, and respond to the world around us. A text is
any artifact that can be seen as meaningful. Texts are not limited to written language - as
this text is - but can include all kinds of things such as images, audio, video, computer code,
games, and performances. We might argue that the natural world can also be read as a
text. Reading should be appreciated as an exciting activity - one that is itself a text. When
we are reading the works of scholars and critics, we are reading their reading of a literary
text. Another scholar might read a critic's reading of a text and produce their own reading
of that reading. The layers of reading are potentially endless!

Research into literature requires us to put more energy and attention into reading than we
normally do for activities such as light reading or reading for enjoyment. Basically, we want
to get a very good sense of what the literary work is before we start formally interpreting
or critiquing it. Scholars know that before they can produce an interpretation or critique,
they must first construct a conceptual "model" of the literary work. They pay attention to
various features of literature such as narrative structure, character development, diction,
time, space, and many other features. Only when a conceptual model of the literary work is
somewhat in hand can we really begin the interpretation or critique. Researchers read lit-
erary works multiple times using a variety of reading strategies:

     Reading Strategies

            · Exploratory reading: or pre-reading, looking for key phrases, words, and
                headings to get a general sense of what the work is about.

            · Skimming: looking for main ideas, topic sentences and paragraphs, as well
                as abstracts.

            · Revision: re-reading to test your recollection of the text and to check your
                understanding.

            · Search: looking for specific information.
            · Mastery: slow, careful reading and paying attention to details.

                                                                                                                                                Reading Literary Works | 163
            · Critical: assessing and reviewing ideas within the text as well as looking for
                examples of reasoning, irony, satire, sincerity, etc.

It may seem odd to put questions to a written text since, as Socrates once said, it "always
gives one unvarying answer." Yet, asking questions of a text, a practice called interrogatory
reading, makes some sense because reading can be like a dialogue in which the reader
brings important things to the interaction. All writing contains "gaps" that require us to fill
in what's missing. Charles Dickens begins his novel A Tale of Two Cities with the words, "It
was the best of times, it was the worst of times . . . " A reader might ask, "how can some-
thing be both the best and the worst when those words mean opposite things?" We then
look for additional evidence in the text as well as in our own experiences, to help answer the
question. For instance, maybe high school graduation comes to mind as a "best of times,
worst of times"; it is a time to celebrate an achievement, but also a time when key friend-
ships might come to an end. Graduation can produce a sense of freedom and a sense of
terrible uncertainty. We can read Dickens with our understanding of high school gradua-
tion in mind, but we should also consider that Dickens' text may be suggesting something
quite different. Re-reading a text might bring us different answers if we have changed our
framework for understanding.

        Beginning Your Reading

Your instructor may require a research project about a specific literary work, a body of work
by a single author or authors, a comparative study of multiple literary works, or may leave
the choice to you. To complete a successful literary research project, you will need to know
how to read literature the way a researcher does. Reading for pleasure is good, but is not
sufficient (because literary research goes beyond stating that you enjoyed - or didn't enjoy
- a text). Your goal is to understand a text. Understanding a text does not require you to
like the text, agree with the text, or identify with the text. Some literary works, like Fyodor
Dostoevsky's "Notes from Underground," may be quite unpleasant to read. But we need to

164 | Reading Literary Works
understand what a text is, what it does, and what it is telling us. To answer these questions,
you should note the following:

     Features of Literary Works

            · Genre (poem, short story, drama, novel, creative nonfiction, comic, elec­
                tronic literature, etc.)

            · Major themes
            · Primary structure (narrative, metaphor, argument, etc.)
            · Cultural context (nationality, period, culture, etc.)
            · Point of view (first person, second person, third person, omniscient, lim-

                ited)
            · Setting(s)
            · Primary characters
            · Intended audience (children, adults, students, workers, nobility, etc.)
            · Style (playful, challenging, blunt, academic)
            · Possible functions (to entertain, educate, persuade, criticize, etc.)

In literary studies, we do not grant authors the final word over what a piece of literature is,
means, or does because authors may not be fully aware of their own assumptions, blind
spots, cultural conditioning, and so on. Also, authors, like everyone else, may forget, dis-
tort, omit, and misrepresent their own work. Their comments on their work are impor-
tant, though, and we shouldn't ignore them. Our goal as literary researchers is to capture
and represent the intentions of a text, whether the author is aware of them or not. For
instance, JK Rowling has disparaged transgendered people, but many readers of the Harry
Potter series find that the text affirms transgender identities.

                                                                                                                                                Reading Literary Works | 165
        Analysis

Literary critics practice various kinds of reading but one of the most important is analysis.
Analysis involves selecting a passage of the text for a "close reading," examining the details
and nuances of the text to see how they fit together and achieve their effects. Generally,
you will do a close reading on only a portion of a text, but it is possible to do a close reading
of an entire text, especially if it is very brief. In general, you should do an analysis of at least
one passage from a literary text in your research project.
Below is analytical close reading of a short poem. Poetry has many things going on at once:
metaphor, theme, subject, form, elements, means, images, diction, syntax, alliteration and
assonance, rhyme, meter, tone, genre, paradox, etc. Poetry also makes use of narrative and
argument. All of these elements are important, but usually the metaphorical structure of
poetry is critically important. Poetic metaphor is not as much about people and/or things
as it is about the relationships between people and/or things. We make sense of relation-
ships by comparing them to other relationships.
Let's analyze a poem from the 9th century. We will see how complicated the central
metaphor is.

               Doesn't he realize
               that I am not
               like the swaying kelp
               in the surf,
               where the seaweed gatherer
               can come as often as he wants.

                        Ono no Komachi, Translated from Japanese by Rexroth and I. Atsumi

How to make sense of it? We first need to fill in the metaphorical algebra: A is to B as
C is to D, or He (A) is to Me (B) as the Seaweed Gatherer (C) is to the Swaying Kelp (D). To
understand the relationship between the speaker and the "he" of the poem, we first have
to figure out the relationship of the seaweed gatherer to the swaying kelp. The most obvi-

166 | Reading Literary Works
ous thing about this relationship is that swaying kelp is passive while the seaweed gatherer
is active. The kelp (which is a form of seaweed commonly used in Japanese cuisine) can't
fight back or escape. It just sways in the surf and the seaweed gatherer can take it if he
likes. The speaker seems to be saying that she is passive while he is active. Presumably, this
means he can gather what he wants from her (which could be love, money, or sex) without
her having any means to stop him.

People and seaweed differ in many other ways that are either less relevant or not relevant
here. Seaweed is a plant while people are animals. People have legs and seaweed does not.
There are probably millions of differences between people and seaweed, and many similari-
ties too. For the sake of our reading of the poem, however, these similarities and differences
are less relevant than the qualities active and passive.

But we have to change our view of the relationship between the man and the woman in
the poem when we attend to the word "not." The speaker says she is not like the swaying
kelp. Her negation of the metaphor using the word "not" means we have to switch her posi-
tion from passive to active, since being able to say no would make her different from the
swaying kelp. In other words, she seems to be saying that she can stop him from taking
what he wants from her.

But the structure of the poem makes us change our reading of the metaphor again. The
speaker of the poem does not address the man directly (with "Don't you realize . . . "), but
addresses a third person. If she were truly able or willing to say "no" - to be active - she
would tell the man directly, "I am not like the swaying kelp." By asking, "doesn't he realize?"
she implies that he doesn't realize. In the man's mind, he is the seaweed gatherer and she is
the swaying kelp and she won't do anything to change the relationship. She will only com-
plain to a third person, who might be herself, a friend, or you, the reader, about how she
wishes she were active.

The poem is relatable because many people have been through times when they wish they
could say "no" but don't. We rehearse what we might say, knowing that we likely won't say
it to the right person at the right time. "Doesn't he realize" does not authorize complacency.
Rather, it draws our attention to the ways in which we try to convince ourselves we are
standing up for ourselves without actually doing so.

Your research project should include analysis of at least one portion of a text.

                                                                                                                                                Reading Literary Works | 167
        Explication

Explication expands our understanding of a text, elaborating on what the text gives us. It
makes explicit that which is implied by a text. Explication means looking at the whole of
a literary work as greater than the sum of its parts. "Parts" can refer to different charac-
ters, plot elements, themes, or other features of a literary text. For instance, we might read
"Sonny's Blues" in terms of the relationship between language and music as different forms
of communication. The narrator, Sonny's brother, tries to communicate with Sonny through
language but repeatedly fails. Though he is extremely articulate, he can't reach his brother.
Only at the end does he realize that communication goes two ways and he has not really
listened to his brother. His brother communicates through music more than through lan-
guage. The story is more than just a story of two brothers, more, even, than a story about
music. Here is the second-to-last paragraph in which the narrator finally hears and under-
stands his brother through his music.

     Excerpt from James Baldwin's "Sonny's Blues"

       Then they all gathered around Sonny and Sonny played. Every now and again
       one of them seemed to say, amen. Sonny's fingers filled the air with life, his life.
       But that life contained so many others. And Sonny went all the way back, he
       really began with the spare, flat statement of the opening phrase of the song.
       Then he began to make it his. It was very beautiful because it wasn't hurried and
       it was no longer a lament. I seemed to hear with what burning he had made it
       his, with what burning we had yet to make it ours, how we could cease lament-
       ing. Freedom lurked around us and I understood, at last, that he could help us to
       be free if we would listen, that he would never be free until we did. Yet, there
       was no battle in his face now. I heard what he had gone through, and would
       continue to go through until he came to rest in earth. He had made it his: that

168 | Reading Literary Works
       long line, of which we knew only Mama and Daddy. And he was giving it back,
       as every thing must be given back, so that, passing through death, it can live for-
       ever. I saw my mother's face again, and felt, for the first time, how the stones of
       the road she had walked on must have bruised her feet. I saw the moonlit road
       where my father's brother died. And it brought something else back to me, and
       carried me past it, I saw my little girl again and felt Isabel's tears again, and I felt
       my own tears begin to rise. And I was yet aware that this was only a moment,
       that the world waited outside, as hungry as a tiger, and that trouble stretched
       above us, longer than the sky.

The narrator comes to a better understanding of his brother - and even himself - through
music rather than through language. Something kind of magic happens in this paragraph
as well. Paradoxically, the narrator is able to transform Sonny's music into language and to
share it with us, his readers. Thus, the text shows us that the gulf between language and
music, just like the gulf between the narrator and his brother, is bridgeable. Here the text
summarizes a lot of the materials we learned from earlier in the story, but puts them in
context with Sonny's music. Typically, analysis and explication work together, with analysis
going closer into the details and explication moving out to show us the bigger picture.
Your research project should include an explication that builds on some close reading
analysis.

        Comparison and Contrast

Sometimes, a literary work comes into better focus when we read it alongside another
work. The other work may be by the same author, or by a contemporary author of a similar
genre or from another culture, etc. The point is that we don't really understand a literary
work in a vacuum, but instead, we read it in relation to other works. In your research, you
should decide whether it is necessary or valuable to compare and contrast your chosen
work with another.

                                                                                                                                                Reading Literary Works | 169

Both Jesus' and Kafka's parables are about gateways. Jesus's parable is about the gateway
separating foolishness from wisdom. Kafka's parable is about the gateway separating injus-
tice from justice. In The Trial, Joseph K. has been accused of a crime, though the details of
the supposed crime are never explained. Joseph K. is told that to be accused is also to be
condemned (his guilt is already certain), but that he should review his life to understand
what he might have done wrong. He seeks access to legal officials to whom he can plead
his case. Here a priest, who is an employee of the court, introduces himself to Joseph K. and
tells him this parable. Following the parable, Kafka provides a discussion between Joseph
K. and the priest about its proper interpretation, just as Jesus and his disciples discuss the
proper interpretation of the "Sower of Seeds" parable.

Each part of Jesus's parable has a single meaning that links elements of horticulture to spir-
itual teachings. By contrast, in Kafka's parable, the priest and Joseph K. discuss numerous
possible interpretations of the parable. Unlike Jesus, the priest who presents "Before the
Law" did not create the parable, and he is not an ultimate authority on its meaning. In fact,
it's unclear if there is any ultimate authority on its proper interpretation.

By contrast, Jesus's parable offers a clear way to cross the gateway to wisdom, though it
is highly contingent. If a man is given the seed (the divine word) and it lands in fertile soil
(a receptive soul) it can grow and he can harvest the fruit (wisdom). Wisdom is contingent
because certain people may not want wisdom or may have souls that are not prepared for

it or may be in an environment not conducive to it. Jesus even says that he doesn't want
everyone to understand his message: "To you are given the secrets of the Kingdom of God;
but to those who are outside all comes through parables, so that they may have sight but
not see, and hear but not understand, lest they be converted and forgiven." The Kafka para-
ble also shows us a gateway  to justice  but it is quite unclear whether it can be crossed
at all or what justice will be on the other side. It is unclear whether the parable is meant for
one person, for some people, or for everyone.

Jesus compares something less understood (how to spread wisdom) to something more
understood (that plants grow from seeds). The complicating factor in Jesus' parable is that
he presents different kinds of people with different kinds of souls to explain why wisdom
grows in some but not in others. Kafka's parable is less straightforward because he is com-
paring something difficult to understand (access to justice) to something that is strange
and only partially known - a guard at a door meant only for one person. We understand the
parable as being relevant to Joseph K., who belongs to a category (the accused), but why is
he in that category? What other choices did the petitioner have?

A major difference between the two parables is that Jesus limits interpretation while Kafka
invites us to consider multiple interpretations and to continually speculate about what is
unknown (and perhaps even unknowable).

        Reading with and against the Grain

                                                                                                                                                                                     1

In their textbook, Ways of Reading, David Bartholomae and Anthonly Petrosky. discuss the
differences between reading "with" and "against" the grain. The analogy here is to wood-
working. Wood has fibers that align more in one direction than in another. If you cut the
wood with the grain you tend to get a smooth surface, but if you cut it against the grain
you tend to get splinters and a rough surface. To read a text with the grain is to follow the
overt intentions of the author, the text, and the culture in which the text was produced. To
read against the grain means to ask questions that push against the overt intentions of the

  author, text, and culture in which the text was produced. Another way of framing the dif-
  ference between reading with and against the grain is to think of dominant and resistant
  readings.

       Sample A: Dominant and resistant readings of
                                                 2

       Cinderella

          The dominant reading of Cinderella presents an ideal image of romantic love
          that survives against the odds. The prevailing message of this story encourages
          readers to believe that dreams can come true.
          A resistant reading of Cinderella reveals the love interest to be a shallow man
          who judges women solely on the basis of physical attractiveness. A man who
          will marry a woman on the basis of a few hours of dancing is likely to leave Cin-
          derella if someone with daintier feet comes along. The story also represents a
          woman's physical appearance as a commodity for her to use to gain social sta-
          tus and wealth. The prevailing message cautions readers against believing in
          romantic love.
          A feminist reading of Cinderella sees the heroine as repressed and abused. To
          break free of this repression she is forced to enter into a world full of masculine
          power where she is appreciated for her ball gown and refinement. Further, her
          only hope to escape the shackles of domestic bondage relies on her ability to
          seduce and ensnare a man. The prevailing message points out the misogyny
          inherent in the societal structures surrounding Cinderella.

  Sometimes reading against the grain can appear hostile towards the author, text, or cul-
  ture. Other times it just moves in a different direction than the intended one; we can read
  a text against the grain by reading it for our own purposes and not for its intended mes-
  sage. For instance, it is possible to read a bank statement as a poem, a recipe as a historical
  document, and a personal letter as a literary work. Doing so is neither friendly nor hostile

to the intended meaning; it is indifferent to it. This approach is called "creative misreading"
and also "repurposing." For instance, the French New Wave critics and filmmakers of the
1950s creatively misread American B movies (usually cheaply made gangster films) - which
had been considered disposable trash - as high art. The act of placing a text in a new con-
text is sufficient to produce such a creative misreading. Putting a movie poster in an art
museum leads us to read the poster in a different way: not as an advertisement for a film
but as a work of art in its own right. Shakespeare was considered mass entertainment and
was performed across the United States in Vaudeville shows. When Vaudeville was eclipsed
by movies, Shakespeare was repurposed as high art.
As we read literary texts, we should practice reading with and against the grain. When read-
ing against the grain, we should practice reading both to resist and to repurpose.

         Interpretation Introduction

  Interpretation is the process of making meaning from a text. Literary theorists have dif-
  ferent understandings of what meaning is, what constitutes a "good" interpretation, and

whether we should even be interpreting literary texts at all. Frank Kermode, for example,
claimed that the only people who are able to interpret stories properly are insiders, but even
the most knowledgeable insiders - such as Jesus' disciples - are prone to errors (Jesus had
to explain his parables to the disciples because they needed his help). Susan Sontag argued
that we should refrain from interpretation and confront the literary and artistic work "as is"
so we can experience it on its own terms and not as a different thing (such as an explana-
tion). Umberto Eco stated that literature allows for a range of interpretations but that some
interpretations are better than others (though we need to establish standards to assess the
quality of different interpretations).

Disagreements about interpretation focus mainly on the reader's limits. Should the reader
be able to make any meaning whatsoever from a text? Does the text resist interpretation
and insist on being read on its own terms? What constrains the reader's freedom to inter-
pret? Do constraints arise from the author, from within the text itself, from within the
reader, or from within the culture? Whose culture, we might also ask, should determine the
proper interpretation: the reader's, the author's, or someone else's?

Interpretation is a process of gathering evidence (from within the literary text) and making
reasoned inferences from that evidence. Our goal when interpreting a text is to offer a bet-
ter interpretation than the others available. A better interpretation is one that meets par-
ticular criteria, though we have to justify and explain why we chose those criteria and not
others. Because it it is possible to overlook evidence, misread evidence, etc., we can say that
an interpretation that makes good use of evidence is likely better than one that does not.
We can also say that a better interpretation will provide a coherent conceptual framework
with which to understand a literary text. A better interpretation might account for possible
counter-arguments and make a compelling case against each of them.

A better interpretation is also one that is free from reasoning errors. For example, if some-
one says 2+3+4 = 5, we can say that their chain of reasoning is flawed. Since it is possible
to make reasoning errors, we can likely conclude that an interpretation that includes fewer
errors in reasoning is better than an interpretation that has serious errors in reasoning. A
better interpretation is likely one that produces a greater quantity and quality of meaning
than a competing interpretation. Therefore, some interpretations are better than others
because they make better use of evidence and reasoning, provide clear conceptual frame-
works, and demonstrate advantages over weaker interpretations. Good interpretations give
us insight.

                "Departures"
                Storm Jameson
                The September day we left for London was cold and cloudily sunny. In the few
                minutes as the train drew out past the harbour, I felt myself isolated by a bar­
                rier of ice from every living human being, including the husband facing me.
                Like a knot of adders uncoiling themselves one departure slid from another
                behind my eyes--journeys made feverish by unmanageable longings and
                ambitions, night journeys in wartime, the darkened corridors crammed with
                young men in clumsy khaki, smoking, falling asleep, journeys with a heavy
                baby in one arm. At last I come to the child sitting in a corner of a third-class
                carriage, waiting, silent, tense with anxiety, for the captain's wife to return
                from the ticket office. A bearded gentleman in a frock coat--the stationmas­
                ter--saunters up to the open door and says, smiling, something she makes no
                attempt to hear. Her mother walks lightly across the platform. "Ah, there you
                are, Mrs. Jameson. Your little girl was afraid you weren't coming," he said ami­
                ably. Nothing less amiable than Mrs. Jameson's coldly blue eyes turned on
                him, and cold voice.
                "Nonsense. My child is never afraid."
                Not true . . .

       ley, and Ulmer provide us with the following information:
                This selection is the conclusion of a chapter from Margaret Storm Jameson's
                autobiography, Journey from the North [1969]. In it she begins to tell of a train
                journey from Yorkshire (in the north of England) to London made with her
                husband during World War I. But, in the telling, her mind moves back
                through memories of other departures to an anecdote of an earlier departure
                from Yorkshire, this one with her mother (the wife of a sea captain). Jameson
                was the author of many novels and other books. (15)

       We build a conceptual model of the text by doing a close reading, drawing infer­
       ences from what we read, and relating the parts to the whole:

            1. The author's current train journey is bringing up memories of a much earlier
                train journey and the author's mind is traveling through time - "one depar-
                ture slid from another" - as her body travels through space.

           2. This journey through time is deeply disturbing ("adders" are snakes).
           3. The narrator's journey through time appears to be involuntary.
           4. Being a passenger on a train is - like the narrator's memory - to be unable to

                control the trip.
           5. The inability to control things might be frightening for the narrator.
           6. The narrator's memory journey arrives "at last" to her first journey by train.
           7. The author (an adult) sees herself when she was a child - "sitting in a corner of

                a third-class carriage, waiting, silent, tense with anxiety."
           8. The child is afraid because her mother abandoned her in a strange place.
           9. The stationmaster who comments to the mother - "Your little girl was afraid

                you weren't coming" - seems more concerned with the child's wellbeing than
                the child's mother is.
          10. The mother is more concerned about her image as a responsible mother -
                "Nonsense. My child is never afraid." - than she is about her child.
           11. The mother's comment is also a message to the child that showing fear is not
                acceptable.
          12. If the child shows fear it might bring judgment upon the mother, which is
                also not acceptable.

        13. The mother has a Stoic attitude - British people call it "Keeping a stiff upper
             lip": a commitment to avoid showing fear.

       14. This attitude has been dominant in England for hundreds of years (a bit of
             contextual knowledge about this English attitude is needed here).

        15. This Stoic attitude prevents people from being known by others, leading to
             them feeling "isolated."

       16. The lessons learned by the child in this moment have affected her negatively
             until the present day ("I felt myself isolated by a barrier of ice from every living
             human being, including the husband facing me.")

        17. The story identifies the harm caused by the mother, her "lesson," and the
             Stoic attitude in general.

       18. There isn't a clear resolution in this story, meaning that the narrator does not
             solve her problem of feeling isolated. Rather, she solves a different problem,
             which is figuring out when and where this feeling originated.

       19. The coda, or aftermath of the events depicted, is her writing of the story.

     The "meaning" of the story is that trauma can originate in socio-cultural conditions,
     in this case the Stoic attitudes of Britain as exemplified by the narrator's mother.
     Notice how this step-by-step reading does the following:

         1. It uses evidence - in the form of quotes - from the literary text.
         2. It creates a conceptual "model text" - in this case it explains that the author

             travels backward in her mind through time and sees herself as a child who
             learns a painful lesson.
         3. It infers general statements - in this case about dominant attitudes - from
             specific observations of people, places, and events.
        4. It makes explicit that which is implied in the text.
         5. It argues that the literary text has a particular purpose or point - in this case
             to criticize the Stoic attitude in Britain.

The interpretive steps above are by no means the final word on this story and you should
feel free to make your own interpretation of it. Note, however, that interpreters of literature
make use of others' work. If your interpretation goes further or in a different direction from
the one above, you would make use of this example to explain how and why yours differs.

                                                                                                                                           Interpreting Literary Works | 181
        Discourses

Scholars read literary works within a variety of discourses. Roughly, these discourses are
grouped in four general types: social-cultural, creative, psychological, and genre:

Scholars apply discourses not only to literary texts but also to the contexts around those
texts. Contexts can include the life of the author, the place and time of the writing, the audi-
ence, other literary works, critical reception of the work, etc. So, for example, a scholar may
discuss the poetry of Ezra Pound using the discourse of genre, which the critic can apply
both to Pound's poetry and to his context, which includes the poetry of other writers of his
time.

182 | Interpreting Literary Works
        How to Interpret Literary Texts Using Schemata

There are numerous schools of interpretation, each with their own interpretive schema. A
schema is a broad theoretical framework - a meta-story - for understanding the world. We
discussed a variety of these theoretical frameworks in the previous chapter. To oversim-
plify: psychoanalysis uses the schema of personal development; Marxism uses the schema
of class struggle; feminism uses the schema of gender inequality; Christianity uses the
schema of sin and redemption; etc.

     Producing an Interpretation

            1. Notice significant details in the literary text
           2. Find a pattern in those details
           3. Map the pattern found in the literary text to an interpretive schema
           4. Claim that X in the literary text is really Y from the schema

When we write about a literary text, we are first creating a conceptual model - a critical
description - of the text, seeing it as an author's attempt to address a problem (which can
be aesthetic, technical, social, political, etc.). The model we construct is built from a set of
details about the literary work and its context, organized into a pattern. Michael Baxandall,
an art critic and historian, notes that we build conceptual models any time we think or
write about an object - a literary text, a person, a natural phenomenon, a concept; when we
encounter any of these things we are constructing/fabricating a model of it in our minds.

                                                                                                                                           Interpreting Literary Works | 183
  Baxandall describes this conceptualizing process as it relates to creating critical descrip-

                                             4

  tions of paintings.

          If we wish to explain pictures, in the sense of expounding them in terms of their
          historical causes, what we actually explain seems likely to be not the unmedi-
          ated picture but the picture as considered under a partially interpretative
          description. This description is an untidy and lively affair.
          Firstly, the nature of language or serial conceptualization means that the
          description is less a representation of the picture, or even a representation of
          seeing the picture, than a representation of thinking about having seen the pic-
          ture. To put it in another way, we address a relationship between picture and
          concepts.
          Secondly, many of the more powerful terms in the description will be a little
          indirect, in that they refer first not to the physical picture itself but to the effect
          the picture has on us, or to other things that would have a comparable effect on
          us, or to inferred causes of an object that would have such an effect on us as the
          picture does. The last of these is particularly to the point. On the one hand, that
          such a process penetrates our language so deeply does suggest that causal
          explanation cannot be avoided and so bears thinking about. On the other, one
          may want to be alert to the fact that the description which, seen schematically,
          will be part of the object of explanation already embodies preemptively explana-
          tory elements - such as the concept of `design'.
          Thirdly, the description has only the most general independent meaning and
          depends for such precision as it has on the presence of the picture. It works
          demonstratively - we are pointing to interest - and ostensively, taking its mean-
          ing from reciprocal reference, a sharpening to-and-fro, between itself and the
          particular.
          These are general facts of language that become prominent in art criticism, a
          heroically exposed use of language, and they have (it seems to me) radical impli-
          cations for how one can explain pictures - or, rather, for what it is we are doing
          when we follow our instinct to attempt to explain pictures. (10-11)

Below is an example of this kind of work by a famous critic, Walter Benjamin, writing about
a picture by Paul Klee called Angelus Novus (1920):

From Benjamin:

                Interpreting Literary Works | 185
               A Klee painting named Angelus Novus shows an angel looking as though
               he is about to move away from something he is fixedly contemplating. His
               eyes are staring, his mouth is open, his wings are spread. This is how one
               pictures the angel of history. His face is turned toward the past. Where we
               perceive a chain of events, he sees one single catastrophe which keeps pil-
               ing wreckage upon wreckage and hurls it in front of his feet. The angel
               would like to stay, awaken the dead, and make whole what has been
               smashed. But a storm is blowing from Paradise; it has got caught in his
               wings with such violence that the angel can no longer close them. The
               storm irresistibly propels him into the future to which his back is turned,
               while the pile of debris before him grows skyward. This storm is what we
               call progress.

Notice that Benjamin creates a conceptual model of the picture by accounting for the
details of the picture, but also by explaining what he makes up about the picture and its
effect on himself. Benjamin's reading involves his imagination and he famously turned the
picture into an allegory of modernity.

From Baxandall, we can learn the process of creating conceptual models of literary works
by replacing the word "picture" with "text." In the example above in which we read Storm
Jameson's "Departures," we built a conceptual model of the text by, in Baxandall's terms,
creating "a representation of thinking about having [read the text]." We referred "to the
effect the [text] has on us, or to other things that would have a comparable effect on us,
or to inferred causes of an object that would have such an effect on us as the [text] does."
Finally, "the description has only the most general independent meaning and depends for
such precision as it has on the presence of the [text]."

The process of creating conceptual models often goes unrecognized. For instance, when
we identify a person by their face, we are going through an enormous number of sensory
and mental processes very quickly. Our brains take a bunch of shapes, lines, and colors, and
construct a mental model, then compare it to an existing mental model and conclude, "Oh
yeah, that's Jane." In working with literary texts we are more explicit about the process. For
instance, in Cleanth Brooks' writing about "Canonization," he selects and organizes features
of the text showing how they relate to one another and to his framing concept: paradox.
Propp does the same thing around narrative actants and functions in folk tales.

Notice that interpretation moves from the specific to the general, from the details of the

186 | Interpreting Literary Works
literary work into more abstract conceptual terms. Most critics only use some, not all, of the
details from a literary work in the interpretation. If you disagree with a critic, you can pose a
contrary interpretation by claiming that the critic overlooked significant details from the lit-
erary work, formed a misleading pattern, and mapped those details to the wrong schema.
Finally, you should offer your own interpretation, following the steps outlined above. Many
critics combine interpretive schemas. Also, it is acceptable to be suspicious of schema and
of overarching narratives, especially ones that supposedly "explain everything."
In the sample interpretation above, the schemata used to interpret the Storm Jameson
story "Departures" is social-cultural. The interpretation views the story through a lens of cul-
tural critique that sees Jameson as criticizing the dominant Stoic attitude in British life.

        Symptomatic and Explicatory Interpretations

David Bordwell, in his book Making Meaning (which is primarily about film interpretation
but works quite well for understanding literary interpretation), discusses two major inter-
pretive traditions: explicatory and symptomatic. A symptomatic reading is one in which
the critic treats the text with suspicion, as though it disguises its true intentions. Your goal,
using this method, is to get the text to "confess" its meaning by pointing to "symptoms"
in the text. Freud stated, "A symptom is a sign of, and a substitute for, an instinctual satis-
faction which has remained in abeyance; it is a consequence of the process of repression"
("Inhibitions, Symptoms, and Anxiety" 20.91). The symptomatic critic is looking for signs that
betray the real intention of the text or the author, just as Freud seized on forgotten names
or slips of the tongue as symptoms that more accurately revealed the patient's state of
mind than did their explicit statements. In a symptomatic reading, a reader might argue
that a text that seems anti-racist hides a racist intent or effect.
An explicatory reading is one in which the critic turns implied meaning into explicit mean-
ing. An explicatory reading does not treat the literary text with suspicion. For instance, you
might find a text that seems anti-racist, and your interpretation explains how it is, in fact,
anti-racist.

                                                                                                                                          Interpreting Literary Works | 187
Bordwell argues that critics often switch the way they read depending on the literary work.
Some literary works  ones that critics believe are ideologically abusive  are read symp-
tomatically, while other works  those critics believe are ideologically healthy  are read
using explicatory methods.
Bordwell presents the following passage about explicatory criticism:

               On a summer day, a suburban father looks out at the family lawn and
               says to his teen-aged son: "The grass is so tall I can hardly see the cat
               walking through it." The son construes this to mean: "Mow the lawn." This
               is an implicit meaning. In a similar way, the interpreter of a film may take
               referential or explicit meaning as only the point of departure for infer­
               ences about implicit meanings. That is, she or he explicates the film, just
               as the son might turn to his pal and explain, "That means Dad wants me
               to mow the lawn." Explicatory criticism rests upon the belief that the
               principal goal of critical activity is to ascribe implicit meanings to films
               (Making 43).

The flip side of this paradigm is that critics tend to perform symptomatic criticism on texts
they consider ideologically suspect. Bordwell explains symptomatic criticism in this pas-
sage:

               On a summer day, a father looks out at the family lawn and says to his
               teen-aged son: "The grass is so tall I can hardly see the cat walking
               through it." The son slopes off to mow the lawn, but the interchange has
               been witnessed by a team of live-in social scientists, and they interpret
               the father's remarks in various ways. One sees it as typical of an American
               household's rituals of power and negotiation. Another observer construes
               the remark as revealing a characteristic bourgeois concern for appear­
               ances and a pride in private property. Yet another, perhaps having had
               some training in the humanities, insists that the father envies the son's
               sexual proficiency and that the feline image constitutes a fantasy that

188 | Interpreting Literary Works
               unwittingly symbolizes (a) the father's identification with a predator; (b)
               his desire for liberation from his stifling life; his fears of castration (the cat
               in question has been neutered): or (d) all of the above. [...] Now if these
               observers were to propose their interpretations to the father, he might
               deny them with great vehemence, but this would not persuade the
               social scientists to repudiate their conclusions. They would reply that the
               meanings they ascribed to the remark were involuntary, concealed by a
               referential meaning (a report on the height of the grass) and an implicit
               meaning (the order to mow the lawn). The social scientists have con­
               structed a set of symptomatic meanings, and these cannot be demol­
               ished by the father's protest. Whether the sources of meaning are
               intrapsychic or broadly cultural, they lie outside the conscious control of
               the individual who produces the utterance. We are now practicing a
               "hermeneutics of suspicion," a scholarly debunking, a strategy that sees
               apparently innocent interactions as masking unflattering impulses (Mak­
               ing 71-72).

Critics employing the symptomatic approach look for "incompatibility between the film's
explicit moral and what emerges as a cultural symptom" (75). In other words, the sympto-
matic approach looks for instances that indicate a text's explicit message hides a less flat-
tering message. Such symptomatic readings warn people not to be fooled by appearances;
the true, yet disguised, intentions of a text  its "repressed meanings"  are apparent if
you know how to look for them. Explicatory criticism, by contrast, urges the audience not to
miss the text's implied messages.

The distinction between explicatory and symptomatic criticism is hinted at by their names.
Both have to do with intentionality. An explicatory interpretation explains - it clarifies the
author's overt intention (and is generally flattering), while a symptomatic interpretation
points to a covert intention (and is generally unflattering); it claims that a literary work is a
symptom of an unflattering impulse or state of affairs.

If we look at "Tell Me a Story" by Paul Auster (below), we might say that his overt intention
is to explain how he became a writer by listening to his father's stories. His covert intention
could be to reproduce his father's evasiveness by telling stories that distract from his vul-
nerabilities. We might go further and argue that storytelling is a form of manipulation and
control used to fool people.

                                                                                                                                          Interpreting Literary Works | 189
Note that both kinds of criticism still use conceptual frameworks.

        Steps to Interpretation

An interpretation, which translates the details of a literary work into the schemata of a dis-
course, requires that we go through a series of steps.

  1. A denotative reading of a text provides an inventory of what is in it. It tells us things
      like setting, characters, action, point of view, etc.

 2. A connotative reading of a text tells us what these things suggest or "mean" within
      their cultural context; it tells us what is implicit.

 3. An explicatory reading argues that a text has an overt intention; it has a purpose and
      lesson(s) for the reader.

 4. A symptomatic reading reveals that a text has a covert intention; it tries to conceal or
      disguise an unflattering truth.

At the very least, any interpretation must produce an explicatory reading, which is itself
based upon solid denotative and connotative readings. A symptomatic reading must be
based on denotative, connotative, and explicatory readings, and must show how the symp-
tomatic reading differs from the explicatory one.
Here is a video explaining the four levels of meaning.

190 | Interpreting Literary Works
Example: Interpretation of excerpt from "Sonny's Blues"

    1. Denotative: The narrator's mother tells him a family secret about an uncle
        who was killed by white men while his brother - the narrator's father -
        watched.

    2. Connotative: The mother wants her son - the narrator - to realize that, as was
        the case with the uncle, his brother Sonny is at risk even though Sonny is
        "good" and "smart."

    3. Explicatory: The narrator retells the story to his reader because he wants us to
        avoid making the same mistake that he did, which is that he "pretty well for-
        got my promise to Mama" and failed to let his brother know he was there for
        him. In other words, he forgot solidarity is required to resist racism. Read
        within a socio-cultural framework, the mother's story reveals the sense of
        entitlement and impunity that defines whiteness - "They was having fun,
        they just wanted to scare him, the way they do sometimes, you know" - and
        the precarity that defines blackness in America - "'I ain't telling you all this,'
        she said, `to make you scared or bitter or to make you hate nobody. I'm telling
        you this because you got a brother. And the world ain't changed.'" The
        mother's story to the narrator is a version of "the talk" that black parents give
        to their children about the dangers of living in a racist society.

   4. Symptomatic: Typically, a literary work that reveals a social pathology (in this
        case, racism), doesn't need to be subjected to a symptomatic reading
        because critics understand the work as already doing a symptomatic reading
        (of the society). We might argue, however, that the narrator is retelling this
        story because he feels the need to confess his guilt for failing to fulfill his
        promise to his mother. But the narrator admits that motive, so stating it more
        plainly in our interpretation is explicatory and not symptomatic.

                                                                                                                                     Interpreting Literary Works | 191

Exercises

  1. Practice your reading skills on the story below using explication, analysis, or compari-

192 | Interpreting Literary Works
son/contrast.

   Make sure you tell us what the story is about. At a literal or denotative level it is
      about a son remembering his father telling him stories. But we also need to know
      at a connotative level what the story is about. Is it about the power of stories? Is it
      about emotional connection/disconnection? Is it about how the author became an
      author? Ask yourself questions like these and answer them.

   Make sure you identify a schemata you are using - genre, social-cultural, creative,
      and/or psychological.

   Make sure you create a model text from the story. I provide an example of this with
      the Storm Jameson text on our Interpreting Literature page.

   Make sure you move from specific to general, showing how you made the connec-
      tions. For instance, the son's request for a story (specific) means he wants emo-
      tional connection with his father (general). The father tells a story about himself
      that is not true (specific), therefore deflecting his son's request (general) but also
      satisfying the son's request through substitution (general) by telling a compelling
      story rather than a true one (specific).

 Tell Me a Story

 I remember a day very like today. A drizzling Sunday, lethargy and quiet in the
 house: the world at half-speed. My father was taking a nap, or had just awoken
 from one, and somehow I was on the bed with him, the two of us alone in the
 room. Tell me a story. It must have begun like that. And because he was not
 doing anything, because he was still drowsing in the languor of the afternoon,
 he did just what I asked, launching into a story without missing a beat. I remem-
 ber it all so clearly. It seems as if I have just walked out of that room, with its gray
 light and tangle of quilts on the bed, as if, simply by closing my eyes, I could
 walk back into it any time I want.
 He told me of his prospecting days in South America. It was a tale of high adven-
 ture, fraught with mortal dangers, hair-raising escapes, and improbable twists
 of fortune: hacking his way through the jungle with a machete, fighting off ban-
 dits with his bare hands, shooting his donkey when it broke its leg. His language
 was flowery and convoluted, probably an echo of the books he himself had read
 as a boy. But it was precisely this literary style that enchanted me. Not only was

                                                                                                                                  Interpreting Literary Works | 193
          he telling me new things about himself, unveiling to me the world of his distant
          past, but he was telling it with new and strange words. This language was just as
          important as the story itself. It belonged to it, and in some sense was indistin-
          guishable from it. Its very strangeness was proof of authenticity.
          It did not occur to me to think this might have been a made-up story. For years
          afterward I went on believing it. Even when I had passed the point when I
          should have known better, I still felt there might have been some truth to it. It
          gave me something to hold on to about my father, and I was reluctant to let go.
          At last I had an explanation for his mysterious evasions, his indifference to me.
          He was a romantic figure, a man with a dark and exciting past, and his present
          life was only a kind of stopping place, a way of biding his time until he took off
          on his next adventure. He was working out his plan, figuring out how to retrieve
          the gold that lay buried deep in the heart of the Andes.

        Introduction

Critique is something we do all the time when we consume media like books, television
shows, movies, or online content. Critique just means we explain why something is good or
bad, or why we like it or dislike it. The key to critique is to supply reasons for our judgment.
The better the reasons, and the more we connect them to the text or to our experience of
the text, the better the critique.
Critics aim to improve literature and many critics believe literature, in certain circum-

196 | Critiquing Literary Works
stances, can improve society. Literature is certainly about pleasure and displeasure, but it
is also about what is true and false, and what is right and wrong. The "stakes" of criticism,
therefore, are usually much higher than promoting or demoting a particular literary work.
The larger aim of critique is to set a high bar for what counts as quality literature; the word
"quality" can refer to form or structure, features, originality, purpose, function, effects, or any
other aspect of a literary work.

Literary scholars often engage in critique, meaning they evaluate the quality of a literary
work. Critique is not just a matter of personal opinion, though scholars can and do have per-
sonal preferences, because critique requires research into evaluative criteria and the partic-
ulars of each literary work. In addition, critique is comparative; it claims that a literary work is
superior, inferior, or equal to another literary work. Critique is not just descriptive (i.e., detail-
ing the features of a literary work); it is also prescriptive (i.e., it tells us what good literary writ-
ing should be). Students sometimes imagine that "critique" means finding things wrong
with a piece of literature. It doesn't have to be that at all. You can praise a work too. You just
have to explain why it's praise or blameworthy.

Literature can be critiqued using a vast number of criteria. For instance, a poem can
be critiqued for its choice of subject and theme, setting, speaker, addressee, imagery,
word choice, rhythm, sounds, repetition, form, structure, tone, pace, title, flow, use of irony,
metaphor, allusion, and hundreds of other factors. Each poem can be compared to others
in terms of originality, significance, artfulness, insightfulness, and power. To be an effective
critic, you have to keep asking yourself and the text questions. The more questions you pro-
duce, the better. Another point is that you can evaluate not just the literary work but also
your experience of the work. You can discuss whether you find pleasure in reading the work
(a lack of pleasure doesn't necessarily mean you had a bad experience or that the work is
bad), difficulty, or emotions like apprehension, suspense, or satisfaction.

Many students are reticent to critique literary works, believing that art, like literature, should
not be judged, or that all art is more or less equal, or that it is unfair to judge a work of art
or an artist because it might hurt someone's feelings or sensibilities. But these excuses for
avoiding critique don't really stand up for the simple reason that literary authors are them­
selves critical of their work. They read other authors' works and determine for themselves
what counts as good and what doesn't. Most authors want to produce something "good"
or "better," whatever those terms mean to them. So if authors use critique to evaluate liter-
ature, surely critics can too.

                                                                                                                                              Critiquing Literary Works | 197
        Critical Discourses

Critics use a variety of critical discourses to evaluate literary works. These discourses contain
values and sets of criteria that help us determine literary quality. Some critical discourses
focus on social and political issues in and around the writing, while others focus on formal
qualities of the writing itself: its structure, language, and themes. Many critics accept that
literary form has political implications and that the two types of criticism - social and formal
- can't be easily separated.

We usually associate critical discourse with movements or theories. Movements include
neoclassicism, romanticism, and modernism. Theories include New Criticism, reader
response, and new historicism. Each movement and theory operates under a different set
of principles and values about quality. A work that is "good" according to one theory may
be bad in terms of another! To write criticism, you need to familiarize yourself with the con-
cepts and criteria of a movement or theory and become adept at applying these concepts
to literary works.

Just as critics evaluate literary works, critics also evaluate other works of criticism. One critic
might say that another critic's work is superficial, malicious, or just wrong. As a critic, you
need to state your criteria explicitly. These criteria should apply not just to one work but to
other works too - whether all literary works, works of the same genre, or works with sim-
ilar purposes. For instance, you might claim that a good short story would be one that is
relatable and has tension. Then you need to justify those criteria. Another critic might argue
with the ones you provide and offer different ones. You need to be able to defend the crite-
ria you provide.

        Case Study: Pound's "In a Station of the Metro"

Let's look at a famous poem by Ezra Pound that critics generally rate as extremely good and
significant. The poem is very short - two lines (or three, if you include the title) - and Pound
wrote his own piece of criticism about his work, explaining how the final version improved
upon an earlier version.

198 | Critiquing Literary Works
On "In a Station of the Metro"
Ezra Pound (from Gaudier-Brzeska, 1916)
Three years ago in Paris I got out of a "metro" train at La Concorde, and saw sud-
denly a beautiful face, and then another and another, and then a beautiful
child's face, and then another beautiful woman, and I tried all that day to find
words for what this had meant to me, and I could not find any words that
seemed to me worthy, or as lovely as that sudden emotion. And that evening, as
I went home along the Rue Raynouard, I was still trying and I found, suddenly,
the expression. I do not mean that I found words, but there came an equation . .
. not in speech, but in little splotches of colour. It was just that - a "pattern," or
hardly a pattern, if by "pattern" you mean something with a "repeat" in it. But it
was a word, the beginning, for me, of a language in colour. I do not mean that I
was unfamiliar with the kindergarten stories about colours being like tones in
music. I think that sort of thing is nonsense. If you try to make notes perma-
nently correspond with particular colours, it is like tying narrow meanings to
symbols.
That evening, in the Rue Raynouard, I realized quite vividly that if I were a
painter, or if I had, often, that kind of emotion, of even if I had the energy to get

                                                                                                                                   Critiquing Literary Works | 199
       paints and brushes and keep at it, I might found a new school of painting that
       would speak only by arrangements in colour.
       And so, when I came to read Kandinsky's chapter on the language of form and
       colour, I found little that was new to me. I only felt that someone else under-
       stood what I understood, and had written it out very clearly. It seems quite nat-
       ural to me that an artist should have just as much pleasure in an arrangement
       of planes or in a pattern of figures, as in painting portraits of fine ladies, or in
       portraying the Mother of God as the symbolists bid us.
       When I find people ridiculing the new arts, or making fun of the clumsy odd
       terms that we use in trying to talk of them amongst ourselves; when they laugh
       at our talking about the "ice-block quality" in Picasso, I think it is only because
       they do not know what thought is like, and they are familiar only with argument
       and gibe and opinion. That is to say, they can only enjoy what they have been
       brought up to consider enjoyable, or what some essayist has talked about in
       mellifluous phrases. They think only "the shells of thought," as de Gourmont
       calls them; the thoughts that have been already thought out by others.
       Any mind that is worth calling a mind must have needs beyond the existing cat-
       egories of language, just as a painter must have pigments or shades more
       numerous than the existing names of the colours.
       Perhaps this is enough to explain the words in my "Vortex": --
       "Every concept, every emotion, presents itself to the vivid consciousness in some
       primary form. It belongs to the art of this form."
       That is to say, my experience in Paris should have gone into paint. If instead of
       colour I had perceived sound or planes in relation, I should have expressed it in
       music or in sculpture. Colour was, in that instance, the "primary pigment"; I
       mean that it was the first adequate equation that came into consciousness. The
       Vorticist uses the "primary pigment." Vorticism is art before it has spread itself
       into flaccidity, into elaboration and secondary application.
       What I have said of one vorticist art can be transposed for another vorticist art.
       But let me go on then with my own branch of vorticism, about which I can
       probably speak with greater clarity. All poetic language is the language of explo-
       ration. Since the beginning of bad writing, writers have used images as orna-

200 | Critiquing Literary Works
ments. The point of Imagisme is that it does not use images as ornaments. The
image is itself the speech. The image is the word beyond formulated language.
I once saw a small child go to an electric light switch as say, "Mamma, can
I open the light?" She was using the age-old language of exploration, the lan-
guage of art. It was a sort of metaphor, but she was not using it as ornamenta-
tion.
One is tired of ornamentations, they are all a trick, and any sharp person can
learn them.
The Japanese have had the sense of exploration. They have understood the
beauty of this sort of knowing. A Chinaman [sic] said long ago that if a man can't
say what he has to say in twelve lines he had better keep quiet. The Japanese
have evolved the still shorter form of the hokku.
"The fallen blossom flies back to its branch:
A butterfly."
That is the substance of a very well-known hokku. Victor Plarr tells me that once,
when he was walking over snow with a Japanese naval officer, they came to a
place where a cat had crossed the path, and the officer said," Stop, I am making
a poem." Which poem was, roughly, as follows: --
"The footsteps of the cat upon the snow:
(are like) plum-blossoms."
The words "are like" would not occur in the original, but I add them for clarity.
The "one image poem" is a form of super-position, that is to say, it is one idea set
on top of another. I found it useful in getting out of the impasse in which I had
been left by my metro emotion. I wrote a thirty-line poem, and destroyed it
because it was what we call work "of second intensity." Six months later I made a
poem half that length; a year later I made the following hokku-like sentence: --
"The apparition of these faces in the crowd:
Petals, on a wet, black bough."
I dare say it is meaningless unless one has drifted into a certain vein of thought.
In a poem of this sort one is trying to record the precise instant when a thing

                                                                                                                                   Critiquing Literary Works | 201
       outward and objective transforms itself, or darts into a thing inward and subjec-
       tive.

Notice that in Pound's commentary on his poem, he uses words that we typically use to
evaluate things: words like "beautiful," "vividly," "pleasure," "adequate," and "bad." When he
describes his first attempt to write a poem that captured the feeling he had in the Metro, he
critiques it as being a work "of second intensity." It was Pound's dissatisfaction with his own
efforts that led him to keep going until he was satisfied with his work. Only at that point of
satisfaction did he consider his poem to be finished.

Notice too that Pound criticizes other people for what he considers to be their inability to
adequately critique what is new in art.

        When I find people ridiculing the new arts, or making fun of the clumsy odd terms
        that we use in trying to talk of them amongst ourselves; when they laugh at our talk-
        ing about the "ice-block quality" in Picasso, I think it is only because they do not know
        what thought is like, and they are familiar only with argument and gibe and opin-
        ion. That is to say, they can only enjoy what they have been brought up to consider
        enjoyable, or what some essayist has talked about in mellifluous phrases. They think
        only "the shells of thought," as de Gourmont calls them; the thoughts that have been
        already thought out by others.

Here Pound is disagreeing with the critics who fault the art he likes; he basically says, "they
don't get it - because they are stuck in their old habits."

Notice too that Pound is naming the kind of art he likes, referring to it as Imagism and Vor-
ticism. By doing so, he is creating not just the categories of new art; he is also creating the
language necessary to critique that art.

Pound is teaching us a valuable lesson here; the artist and the critic are partners working
together to help audiences appreciate works of art. Sometimes this partnership exists
within the same person (here, Pound assumes the roles of both poet and critic), and some-
times they are assumed by different people, as was the case with the critic Cleanth Brooks
and the author William Faulkner.

        The Stakes of Criticism

Good critics are good teachers. They perform a valuable role by helping writers and readers
distinguish between good and bad literature. We might consider some literature to be
"bad" because it doesn't have a clear purpose, or because it aims for a bad purpose (such
as misleading people). It can be bad because it has a good purpose but doesn't achieve its
aim; we might say of such works that the idea is ok but the writer failed in the execution.

For much of its early history, criticism was taught as a set of universal standards. Aristotle,
one of the earliest and most important literary theorists, wrote a book called The Poetics.
"Poetics" means "making," and what Aristotle was aiming for was an account of how lit-
erature was made. The Poetics consisted of four smaller books on different literary genres:
tragedy, comedy, epic and lyric. Of the original four, only three remain (the book on the
comic genre was lost sometime in the middle ages).

While Aristotle's Poetics appears to be mostly descriptive - accounting for the forms and
functions of the various genres - many of the literary writers and critics who followed him
used his work prescriptively. In other words, they used it to determine what was good liter-
ature (i.e., whatever adhered to Aristotle's theory) and what was bad literature (i.e., whatever
deviated from it) and encouraged writers to stick to the formulas.

Shifting from theory to criticism - in which the descriptive becomes prescriptive - is com-
mon in the field of literary studies. While it has helped writers and readers better under-
stand literary arts, a problem with this approach is that it can result in the rejection of new
works that don't fit the constraints set by the theory. The long history of criticism in recent
centuries has led to innovations, such as the appreciation of genres - like novels, short sto-
ries, and essays - that hadn't yet been invented in Aristotle's time, and shifted from "univer-
sal principles" of criticism to more situated ones.

This shift away from universalism resulted from a recognition that literature was not pro-
duced and consumed solely by a monolithic dominant culture, but also by people who had
been historically marginalized. The literary "canon" - what is assumed to be the "best/most
important" literature - has been expanded to include works by women authors, LGBTQ+
authors, and non-European and non-white authors. Key to the expansion of the literary
canon was the work of critics who argued passionately that the standards of literary quality

                                                                                                                                             Critiquing Literary Works | 203
that had prevailed was, intentionally or not, excluding literature by these writers. New stan-
dards had to be articulated: ones that situated the writing of various cultures in their own
terms.

The literary canon is a hotly contested subject because there is only so much room in it. The
canon consists of works that are routinely included in anthologies and textbooks and in lit-
erature classes. A whole field of experts - scholars, critics, editors and publishers, teachers,
and administrators - determines what is and isn't in the canon. They present their cases for
what should be included, excluded, added, or subtracted.

The argument over the canon is a very high stakes one, but not all literary criticism is about
the canon. Criticism aims to shift our valuation of a literary work: to appreciate its virtues
or to be wary of its shortcomings. Good criticism opens our minds to new possibilities for
literature in general, and not just for a particular literary work. It is a key part of the literary
world.

        Steps to Criticism

The first thing a critic must do is establish criteria, which are standards of quality. Standards
are words that denote particular qualities, which we put into columns that indicate good or
bad - or better or worse. We can adopt critical standards from others, or we can make our
own. Either way, we have to explain why we chose those standards and not others. Many
critics begin their essays by contrasting their critical approach with those of another critic;
they do so to establish that their critical approach has advantages over the other one. In
other words, critics criticize other critics!

We might compare the work of the literary critic to that of a food critic. All food critics have
standards about what is bad food (i.e., food that tastes so unpleasant that it is inedible) and
what is good food (i.e., delicious!). Of course, food critics don't just say "unpleasant" or "deli-
cious" and call it a day. They use lots of words to indicate why something tastes unpleasant
or delicious. And they use different criteria for different things; for instance, they have differ-
ent standards for desserts than for salads. We don't want to evaluate a salad by saying that
it fails as a dessert (unless it was intended as a dessert).

204 | Critiquing Literary Works
Different cultures have their own standards for taste. For instance, in European cultures,
insects are normally considered to be inedible. Yet 80% of the world's population eats
insects and people have criteria for what counts as the most delicious insects and the most
delicious ways of preparing them. We don't have to change our minds just because some-
one else likes something that we don't, but we can learn that standards vary - and that
people may heave excellent reasons for keeping those standards. In the next section of this
chapter, we discuss intercultural competence, which is how we learn to shift perspectives
and understand the values held by people with different cultural experiences.
The late 19th century English critic Matthew Arnold championed literary works that had
"sweetness and light," by which he meant beauty and intelligence. Such writing is likely to
please most people. But one thing to know about literary criticism is that lots of "unpleas-
ant" writing has earned praise from one literary critic or another. For example, the 20th
century critic and author, Georges Bataille, praised writing that he called "heterogenous,"
which he defined as non-productive, excessive, and "unassimilable" (which means some-
thing like "inedible"). His point was that such writing presented us with important knowl-
edge about the world and about life. His own writing strikes most readers as scandalous
and morbid, but his criticism explains and justifies his choices. Again, we don't have to like
it, but it helps to understand the claims he is making.
The second thing a critic needs to do is apply the critical standards to a case study: a par-
ticular literary work (or works). Criticism is often comparative, meaning that the critic will
evaluate two or more works and discuss important qualitative differences between them.
The critic will explain what a text does well and what it doesn't do well, according to the
critical standards.
Ultimately, the critic reminds the reader why they chose or invented the critical standards
and why other critics should adopt them. It also explains why literature in general would
improve if writers followed these criteria and why it would deteriorate if they don't.

E. E. Cummings

How do we crItique a poem like "r-p-o-p-h-e-s-s-a-g-r"? At first glance it looks like an
incomprehensible mess. Maybe we should give it an "F" and say it is a bad poem because
it makes no sense. But doing so would be a mistake. What if we assume the poem does
make sense, but not in the ways that are familiar to us? Let's assume, for now, that Cum-
mings is challenging the way we make sense of poems (and maybe of the world). We can
use the criteria from Victor Shklovsky then, who argued that literature should defamiliar-
ize the world by slowing down our perception. In Shklovsky's view, a "good" literary work

206 | Critiquing Literary Works
is one that increases our awareness of perception. I will argue that "r-p-o-p-h-e-s-s-a-g-r"
does that and is thus a good poem.

We still need to know what Cummings is defamiliarizing and how he is doing it. It seems
he is doing two things at once:

  1. Defamiliarizing poetry itself and how we read it.
 2. Defamiliarizing an experience that the poet had and sharing it with his readers.

On the first point, we are used to poems that we can read out loud. Perhaps we can read "r-
p-o-p-h-e-s-s-a-g-r" out loud, but it presents numerous difficulties. For the title, do we read
each letter separately or try to pronounce it as a word? What do we do with all the blank
spaces? Do we pause our reading when we come to them? What do we do with "!p:"; do
we say "exclamation point, p, colon"? What do we do with "rea(be)rran(com)gi(e)ngly"? Two
words are mingled here: "rearrangingly" (which is not a common adverb) and "become."
Should we speak them as one word or as two separate words? The last line of the poem is
",grasshopper;" - it seems to ground the poem because we can now identify a subject (or at
least a provisional one). The title of the poem now makes sense - "r-p-o-p-h-e-s-s-a-g-r" is
grasshopper with the letters rearranged. Now the word "rearrangingly" makes some sense.
Cummings is rearranging the spelling of the word grasshopper for the title. But why?

To answer that question we need to turn to the second point, about Cummings' expe-
riences. The poet (along with at least one other person) had an experience in which a
grasshopper leapt near him. At first he was surprised by its movement and didn't know
what it was. There was a brief moment before he was able to identify it as a grasshopper.
The interim - the moment where he experienced it without knowing what it was - is the
experience of defamiliarization that he wished to capture and communicate in his poem.
The poem is not about the grasshopper leaping. It is about the poet experiencing a variety
of sense experiences before identifying what it is or what it means. The apparent disorder
of the poem simulates the experience of surprise followed by recognition.

Because Cummings' poem successfully combines two kinds of defamiliarization - of the
world and of poetry - it stands as a lesson in the power of poetry and the need for poets to
continue to innovate and find new ways to defamiliarize both our experiences of the world
and of poetry itself.

            Takeaways: Key Points about Literary Criticism

         1. Critics go beyond telling us about a literary work. They make arguments
             about the quality of a literary work using evaluative terms.

         2. To do criticism requires that we establish criteria: the standards by which we
             evaluate literary works. Critics must also justify their choice of criteria, arguing
             why it is preferable over another choice.

         3. Criteria relate to particular literary theories or movements within literary arts.
        4. Criteria may vary depending on the kind of the literary work being evaluated.
         5. Criticism can be high stakes (for example, about what should be included in

             the literary canon) or low stakes.
        6. Criticism must apply the criteria rigorously to a case study (a work of litera-

             ture) or do a comparative study of two or more works of literature.
         7. The critic should remind readers why their chosen criteria has advantages for

             other critics and for literary authors.

        Exercise

  1. Make a critique of the literary work below, a literary anecdote by Walter Benjamin, who
      was an early 20th century German-Jewish writer. What critical standards will you use?
      What do you need to know about Benjamin's writing to adequately critique it?

208 | Critiquing Literary Works
  Brief note: The Benjamin story seems to conceal as much as it reveals. There was
    an actual historical context for the story; Benjamin had gone to Riga, Latvia to
    meet Asja Lacis (who directed a children's theater), but didn't let her know he was
    coming. Both Walter and Asja were married to other people. Also, there had been
    actual shooting in Riga recently. Notice that the main "action" of the story - the
    narrator seeing the woman or she seeing him - is in the conditional verb tense,
    meaning it might happen but has not actually happened.

"Ordnance" Walter Benjamin
I had arrived in Riga to visit a woman friend. Her house, the town, the language
were unfamiliar to me. Nobody was expecting me, no one knew me. For two
hours I walked the streets in solitude. Never again have I seen them so. From
every gate a flame darted, each cornerstone sprayed sparks, and every streetcar
came toward me like a fire engine. For she might have stepped out of the gate-
way, around the corner, been sitting in the streetcar. But of the two of us I had to
be, at any price, the first to see the other. For had she touched me with the
match of her eyes, I should have gone up like a magazine.

        Introduction

Until a few decades ago, academic programs focused almost exclusively on literature by
DWM (Dead White Men). Then social movements such as civil rights, feminism, LGBTQ+
equality, and anti-colonialism drew attention to writing by women, nonwhite, nonwestern,
queer, and contemporary authors, leading to more variety in the literature we study. The
group of researchers studying literature has become more varied too as educational oppor-
tunities grew for marginalized groups, and networked media created more global connec-

210 | Intercultural Competence
tions. Entering the scholarly conversation about literature is more complicated in some
ways now; we need intercultural competence to participate in it effectively and respectfully.
Intercultural competence does not just mean knowledge of different religious, nations, eth-
nic groups, linguistic communities, genders, etc. It also means learning to perceive one's
own culture differently and to examine its rules, values, styles, beliefs, and practices, under-
standing them as historically contingent (i.e., invented by people in relation to their specific
historical circumstances), rather than as unproblematically "natural" or "eternal."

        Discussion of James Baldwin's "Sonny's Blues"

James Baldwin's "Sonny's Blues" offers a complex set of challenges requiring intercultural
competence. Set mostly in Harlem, New York City, in the 1940s and 1950s, the story opens
with news of Sonny's arrest on drug charges, and it closes with the narrator, who is Sonny's
brother, hearing Sonny play jazz at a nightclub in Greenwich Village (also in New York City).
When the narrator hears his brother play, he understands something fundamental about
Sonny, and about himself, for the first time (we will discuss what that understanding is fur-
ther below).
"Sonny's Blues" asks readers to learn about the blues, which is at the root of the jazz music
that Sonny plays. Even though black musicians were central to the development of jazz
music, not all black Americans liked or even understood the music. Jazz was a subculture
with its own rules, values, styles, beliefs, and practices, and Baldwin illustrates how misun-
derstood it was even in black communities. In the following scene, the narrator, and his
brother Sonny, have just been to their mother's funeral. Before she died, the mother told
the narrator to take care of his younger brother, Sonny. In this scene, the narrator tries to
find out who Sonny is as a person.

                                                                                                                                             Intercultural Competence | 211
     Excerpt from Baldwin's "Sonny's Blues"

       And, after the funeral, with just Sonny and me alone in the empty kitchen, I tried
       to find out something about him.
       "What do you want to do?" I asked him.
       "I'm going to be a musician," he said.
       For he had graduated, in the time I had been away, from dancing to the juke
       box to finding out who was playing what, and what they were doing with it, and
       he had bought himself a set of drums.
       "You mean, you want to be a drummer?" I somehow had the feeling that being
       a drummer might be all right for other people but not for my brother Sonny.
       "I don't think," he said, looking at me very gravely, "that I'll ever be a good drum-
       mer. But I think I can play a piano."
       I frowned. I'd never played the role of the older brother quite so seriously before,
       had scarcely ever, in fact, asked Sonny a damn thing. I sensed myself in the pres-
       ence of something I didn't really know how to handle, didn't understand. So I
       made my frown a little deeper as I asked: "What kind of musician do you want
       to be?"
       He grinned. "How many kinds do you think there are?"
       "Be serious," I said.
       He laughed, throwing his head back, and then looked at me. "I am serious."
       "Well, then, for Christ's sake, stop kidding around and answer a serious question.
       I mean, do you want to be a concert pianist, you want to play classical music and
       all that, or - or what?" Long before I finished he was laughing again. "For Christ's
       sake, Sonny!"
       He sobered, but with difficulty. "I'm sorry. But you sound so - scared!" and he
       was off again.
       "Well, you may think it's funny now, baby, but it's not going to be so funny when

212 | Intercultural Competence
you have to make your living at it, let me tell you that." I was furious because I
knew he was laughing at me and I didn't know why. "No," he said, very sober
now, and afraid, perhaps, that he'd hurt me, "I don't want to be a classical
pianist. That isn't what interests me. I mean" - he paused, looking hard at me, as
though his eyes would help me to understand, and then gestured helplessly, as
though perhaps his hand would help - "I mean, I'll have a lot of studying to do,
and I'll have to study everything, but, I mean, I want to play jazz," he [Sonny] said.
Well, the word had never before sounded as heavy, as real, as it sounded that
afternoon in Sonny's mouth, I just looked at him and I was probably frowning a
real frown by this time. I simply couldn't see why on earth he'd want to spend
his time hanging around nightclubs, clowning around on bandstands, while
people pushed each other around a dance floor. It seemed - beneath him,
somehow. I had never thought about it before, had never been forced to, but I
suppose I had always put jazz musicians in a class with what Daddy called
"good-time people."
"Are you serious?"
"Hell, yes, I'm serious."
He looked more helpless than ever, and annoyed, and deeply hurt. I suggested,
helpfully: "You mean - like Louis Armstrong?"
His face closed as though I'd struck him. "No. I'm not talking about none of that
old-time, down home crap."
"Well, look, Sonny, I'm sorry, don't get mad. I just don't altogether get it, that's all.
Name somebody - you know, a jazz musician you admire."
"Bird."
"Who?"
"Bird! Charlie Parker! Don't they teach you nothing in the goddamn army?"
I lit a cigarette. I was surprised and then a little amused to discover that I was
trembling. "I've been out of touch," I said. "You'll have to be patient with me.
Now. Who's this Parker character?"
"He's just one of the greatest jazz musicians alive," said Sonny, sullenly, his hands
in his pockets, his back to me. "Maybe the greatest," he added, bitterly, "that's
probably why you never heard of him."

                                                                                                                                  Intercultural Competence | 213
       "All right," I said, "I'm ignorant, I'm sorry. I'll go out and buy all the cat's records
       right away, all right?"
       "It don't," said Sonny, with dignity, "make any difference to me. I don't care what
       you listen to. Don't do me no favors."

214 | Intercultural Competence
        Framing

The way we approach other cultures is through a device called "framing"; a particular word
or phrase evokes a frame that characterizes a subject in such a way that it leads auto-
matically to a judgment. The narrator here recalls his father's framing of jazz musicians as
"good-time people." This framing sets up an opposition between people who work (use
their time productively) and people who play (waste their time profitlessly). Thus, using the
term "good-time people" to characterize jazz musicians could make us judge them as use-
less or even dangerous. But being a good musician in any style of music takes serious effort
and jazz music can have many purposes beyond just "good times." It can bring commu-
nities together, pay homage, and showcase creativity. The narrator here lacks the intercul-
tural competence necessary to understand his own brother!
Intercultural competence requires knowledge, skills, and attitudes. The list below summa-
rizes The American Association of Colleges and Universities' (AACU's) rubric on Cultural
Competence.

        Intercultural Competence Learning Objectives

  · The knowledge of one's own culture, its rules and biases, and how history has shaped
      these rules and biases.

  · The knowledge of cultural frameworks (the way members of other cultures view "their
      history, values, politics, communication styles, economy, or beliefs and practices").

  · The skill of empathy (the ability to "interpret intercultural experience from the per-

                                                                                                                                             Intercultural Competence | 215
        spectives of [one's] own and more than one worldview").
     · The skill of understanding differences in verbal and nonverbal communication

        between cultures.
     · The attitude of curiosity ("asks complex questions about other cultures, seeks out and

        articulates answers to these questions that reflect multiple cultural perspectives").
     · The attitude of openness ("Initiates and develops interactions with culturally different

        others").

         From Ethnocentrism to Ethnorelativism

  "Sonny's Blues" is, in part, about the narrator's transformation from ethnocentrism (in
  which different perspectives are denied, or ignored, and one's own culture is the only thing
  taken into account) to ethnorelativism (where one's own culture is considered as one per-
  spective among many more that propose alternative worldviews).

  216 | Intercultural Competence
Denial

When people are in cultural denial, they perceive another culture in a simplistic way, with-
out recognizing particularities and often through stereotypes. For example, all jazz musi-
cians are "good-time people." Such denial denigrates others simply because they belong to
a certain group.

Defense

When people are in defense mode, they feel threatened by another culture and seek to
defend their own culture. The narrator of "Sonny's Blues," Sonny's brother, has a college
degree and works as a teacher; he defends his culture (valuing family life and a career) by
suggesting that Sonny, unlike himself, will be unable to earn money: "Well, you may think
it's funny now, baby, but it's not going to be so funny when you have to make your living at
it, let me tell you that." The narrator seeks to curtail Sonny's choices because Sonny's cul-
ture is different - and seen as inferior - to the narrator's.

Minimization

When people use minimization, they deny cultural differences and make broad claims
about the similarity of all human experiences. Thus, they avoid learning about other cul-
tures and empathizing despite the differences. The narrator in "Sonny's Blues" tries to
bridge his differences with Sonny by arguing that everyone suffers; therefore, the two
brothers are not really that different.

       I said, "that there's no way not to suffer. Isn't it better, then, just to - take it?"
       "But nobody just takes it," Sonny cried, "that's what I'm telling you! Everybody
       tries not to. You're just hung up on the way some people try - it's not your way!

As the group Organizing Engagement points out:
        By reframing cultural differences in terms of human sameness, minimization enables

                                                                                                                                            Intercultural Competence | 217
        people to avoid recognizing their own cultural biases, avoid the effort it would take
        to learn about other cultures, or avoid undertaking the difficult personal adaptations
        required to relate to or communicate more respectfully across cultural differences.
        [Developmental Model of Intercultural Sensitivity]

Acceptance

When people show acceptance, they identify cultural differences and accept that culture
shapes personal beliefs, behaviors, and values in some ways. Acceptance does not mean
agreement with another culture, but it does imply tolerance. The narrator of "Sonny's Blues"
shows some acceptance by recognizing that the world of the nightclub is truly different
from the world he inhabits.

       ... it turned out that everyone at the bar knew Sonny, or almost everyone; some
       were musicians, working there, or nearby, or not working, some were simply
       hangers-on, and some were there to hear Sonny play. I was introduced to all of
       them and they were all very polite to me. Yet, it was clear that, for them, I was
       only Sonny's brother. Here, I was in Sonny's world. Or, rather: his kingdom. Here,
       it was not even a question that his veins bore royal blood.

Adaptation

When people are in the process of adaptation, they can interact in another cultural envi-
ronment in a relaxed and productive way. They are not seeking to assimilate the other
culture to their culture, but rather come with the purpose of learning and developing
empathy. While the narrator is listening to his brother begin his performance, he starts
thinking about the differences between himself (the person who hears music) and his
brother (the person who makes music) in more adaptive terms.

218 | Intercultural Competence
       All I know about music is that not many people ever really hear it. And even
       then, on the rare occasions when something opens within, and the music
       enters, what we mainly hear, or hear corroborated, are personal, private, vanish­
       ing evocations. But the man who creates the music is hearing something else, is
       dealing with the roar rising from the void and imposing order on it as it hits the
       air. What is evoked in him, then, is of another order, more terrible because it has
       no words, and triumphant, too, for that same reason. And his triumph, when he
       triumphs, is ours.

Integration

When people are in the process of integration, they integrate elements from other cultures
into their own cultural experience. They not only accept other points of view but incorpo-
rate some of them authentically. As Bennett explains:

        Integration of cultural difference is the state in which one's experience of self is
        expanded to include the movement in and out of different cultural worldviews.... peo-
        ple are able to experience themselves as multicultural beings who are constantly
        choosing the most appropriate cultural context for their behavior.
The narrator, Sonny's brother, finally reaches this point when he recognizing that Sonny's
music benefits both of them.

       I seemed to hear with what burning he had made it his, with what burning we
       had yet to make it ours, how we could cease lamenting. Freedom lurked around
       us and I understood, at last, that he could help us to be free if we would listen,
       that he would never be free until we did. Yet, there was no battle in his face now.
       I heard what he had gone through, and would continue to go through until he
       came to rest in earth. He had made it his: that long line, of which we knew only
       Mama and Daddy. And he was giving it back, as everything must be given back,

                                                                                                                                            Intercultural Competence | 219
       so that, passing through death, it can live forever. I saw my mother's face again,
       and felt, for the first time, how the stones of the road she had walked on must
       have bruised her feet. I saw the moonlit road where my father's brother died.
       And it brought something else back to me, and carried me past it, I saw my little
       girl again and felt Isabel's tears again, and I felt my own tears begin to rise. And I
       was yet aware that this was only a moment, that the world waited outside, as
       hungry as a tiger, and that trouble stretched above us, longer than the sky.

Here the narrator is accepting the gift that Sonny is offering him: access to his world, the
world of jazz. In this jazz world, there is meaning and value and the narrator is incorporating
it in his own life and encouraging others to do the same.

        Cultures and Subcultures

Intercultural competence asks a lot of us. It requires, "knowledge of cultural worldview
frameworks." For instance, "Sonny's Blues" discusses a split within the jazz world. Bebop,
the music that the fictional Sonny played and that real life Charlie Parker pioneered in the
early 1940s, was perceived as a distinct break from earlier forms of jazz. Unlike earlier forms,
Bebop was aggressively avant-garde. Its leading practitioners did not aspire to make "pop-
ular" music as much as they sought to expand the expressive possibilities of music. For a
while, there was animosity within the jazz community (mostly from some elder jazz musi-
cians towards the younger bebop musicians). Louis Armstrong, a famous jazz innovator
who had gained fame in the 1920s, said of bebop: "All them weird chords which don't mean
a thing . . . you got no melody to remember, and no beat to dance to." Later, Armstrong
befriended some of the Bebop jazz musicians, such as Dizzy Gillespie, and came to appre-
ciate their work.

220 | Intercultural Competence
        Gillespie and Armstrong
Learning about the styles of jazz, the people involved, the social and economic conditions,
the historical changes, and other factors requires a good bit of research. Such research may
be necessary to understand Sonny and his culture.

                                                                                                                                             Intercultural Competence | 221

Using Primo

BARRY MAUER AND JOHN VENECEK

Primo is the name of the UCF libraries' online catalog. The key access point is located in the
center of the UCF Libraries' homepage. Primo provides access to books, e-books, videos,
journals, documents, and other resources owned by the UCF Libraries. For an overview of
how to start searching Primo, let's watch this short video:

                    One or more interactive elements has been excluded from this version of the
                    text. You can view them online here: https://pressbooks.online.ucf.edu/strate­
        gies2e/?p=142#oembed-1

Now let's review some of the key points covered in the video:
Introduction: People often ask if you can search our subject databases in Primo. The answer
is yes, but not all. For more comprehensive database searches, it's recommended that you
access those databases individually and use Primo primarily as a catalog search for books,
media, course reserves, and other material owned by the UCF Libraries.
Basic Searching (0:27): Covers the most basic aspects of Primo searching such as using the
main search bar and limiting your results by format and type of material you want such as
books, articles, and videos.
Search Filters (0:56): Once you run a simple search, you'll be taken to a results page where
you have more search options and filters to help you refine your results by criteria such as
date, language, and subject. You can use these filters to both include and exclude criteria
to meet your needs. One important tool is the Subject Filter, which will break your search
into more refined subcategories. For example, a basic search on "James Baldwin" yields 531
results:

228 | Using Primo
That's a lot to wade through, but browsing the subject limiter will help you focus on the
subcategories that most interest you. These could include "African Americans in literature"
(76 titles) or "criticism and interpretation" (74 titles). Options will vary by your search criteria.
My Account (1:45): You can use the My Account feature to save books or articles you want
to come back to, manage material you have checked out, and request items we don't have.
Primo Search Tools (2:07): This part of the video covers some useful tools to help you man-
age your research. These appear in the tool bar next to each record that shows what you
can do with that item. Options include pinning it to save it for later as well as a list of other
sources that cite that book or article, sources cited within that item, a citation template, a
permalink, email options, and more.

                                                                                                                                                                Using Primo | 229
Virtual Browse: Another important Primo feature is virtual browse, which allows you to see
books related to your search. This is like browsing physical book stacks online. Here's a short
video explaining how this works:

Available Now: Online and On Shelf: This is the new default setting in Primo. This will dis-
play books and other items that are immediately available to checkout or access online:

230 | Using Primo
Note that there are two other settings available: Everything and UCF Library Catalog. Here's
an overview of the difference between those options:
UCF Library Catalog: Select this option if you want to see books or other items we own that
may be checked out or that are otherwise unavailable.
Everything: Select "Everything" and you'll see records for items that UCF doesn't own. In
those cases, you'll want to request those items from Resource Sharing & Document Deliv-
ery (formerly Inter-Library Loan). To request an item, simply open the record, sign in with
your NID, and follow the prompts to request the item: This is a fast and easy way to expand
your search beyond what is owned by UCF, which will make your literature review more
comprehensive. Any item we don't own may be requested in this way.

            Key Library Resources

      The UCF Libraries provides access to many high-quality subject databases, academic
      journals, and scholarly monographs as well as reference materials and primary source
      collections. Knowing how to locate these high-quality resources efficiently will help
      make your research process a stress-free experience.
      If you are unsure how to locate these resources, the best starting point will be the Eng­

             Key Quotes from the Video:
             Using Subject Databases:
             "A lot of times, I think we can just speed read and click all over the place and
             refresh the page and get frustrated. And honestly, like, I know, it can be
             hard, and it can take a lot of time, but that's important. And it's an
             exploratory process. It's not a way to just answer your questions right away.
             That's not the point. It's supposed to be like a long process."
             Research Consultations:
             "Outside of talking to professors, I think it's really important to talk to librari-
             ans and to your librarian specifically, because, the librarians, that's like their
             special thing ... Their job is to show you how to research and how to connect
             your research question to your search process, or how to make your research
             question out of your search process."

      Jada began by reviewing the scholarship on James Baldwin in MLA, JSTOR, and several
      African American studies databases. In the discovery stage, Jada is taking snapshots of
      the scholarship in an attempt to identify recurring themes, concepts, and connections
      as well as gaps and tensions in the research that will be her entry into the scholarly
      conversation. There is a lot of trial and error at this stage. Many students get frustrated
      when they don't immediately find what they're looking for, but there's a lot of explo-
      ration in the early stages of research. Be strategic with your keywords and don't forget
      to explore multiple subject databases.
      For example, Jada explored databases outside literature to incorporate varying per-

234 | Library Services & Resources
spectives on her topic. The most fruitful of these was an article entitled, "The Sociology
of the Ghetto in James Baldwin's `Sonny's Blues.'"

Throughout this process, Jada discovered two themes she felt were worth exploring:
Marxism and critical race theory. While still broad, these are narrow enough to get her
started. As she continues with her literature review, she'll want to sharpen these into a
more focused research question, a process we will discuss in the next section.

     Literature Databases

             Modern Language International (MLA): The premier English/literature
                database. This should be your starting point as it indexes most of the
                key literature journals.

             Academic Search Premier: Not exclusively an English/literature-spe-
                cific database, but "ASP" will contain a good variety of literary scholar-
                ship and should be part of any literature review.

             Dictionary of Literary Biography: The online version of the classic DLB
                contains critical essays on the lives, works, and careers of the world's
                most influential literary figures from all eras and genres.

             JSTOR: A multi-disciplinary full text database that provides access to
                more than 12 million academic journal articles, books, and primary
                sources in 75 disciplines.

             Literature Criticism Online: Excerpts and full text of articles and essays
                providing a critical discussion of authors and their works.

             Literature Resource Center: Information on literary figures from all
                time periods of writing in such genres as fiction, nonfiction, poetry,
                drama, history, journalism, and more. Includes the Dictionary of Liter-
                ary Biography.

             Oxford English Dictionary: The online version of the OED is widely
                regarded as the accepted authority on the English language. It is an
                unsurpassed guide to the meaning, history, and pronunciation of
                600,000 words -- past and present -- from across the English-speak-
                ing world.

             Project Muse: An extremely high-quality collection of scholarly journals

                                                                                                                                Library Services & Resources | 235

                      arly societies.

            Related Databases

      As literary studies become increasingly multi-disciplinary, it is wise to search for schol-
      arship in other subject databases such as Historical Abstracts, PsycInfo (Psychology),
      ERIC (education), Film and Television Literature Index, the Philosopher's Index, and oth-
      ers. You can access these and many more on our main database page.

            Academic Journals

      Searching core journals by title can be beneficial as well. This can be a smaller, more
      controlled search that will provide insight into current trends in your field and can also
      help you track down specific citations. To access journals individually, click on "Journals"
      next to the Primo Search bar on the Libraries' homepage:

236 | Library Services & Resources
From there, you can search journals by title, keyword, or browse by discipline. For exam-
ple, typing "digital humanities" into the search bar will show you all the journals we
have access to with that phrase in the subject or title. For more details about how to
search and access specific journals, watch the following short video.
Note that the journals tab is now in a different location than when this video was cre-

            Scholarly Monographs

      Although much current scholarship can be accessed in online journals and databases,
      books are still common and invaluable resources. These can be accessed by conducting
      a Primo search. When conducting your literature review, focus on books published by
      university presses and academic publishers. If a book is available electronically, there
      will be a direct link to that version in the catalog record where it can be read online and/
      or downloaded, depending on what kind of access we have to that title.

            Reference Materials

      Reference materials include resources such as bibliographies, biographies, dictionaries,
      encyclopedia, guides, and handbooks. Reference materials can be located by doing a
      keyword search in Primo; just add one of the terms above to your search. These refer-
      ence materials can add much needed context to your research.
      You can also run a general search in Primo and, once you have some results, use the
      "Library Section/Area" filter in the sidebar to isolate reference materials. This same strat-
      egy can be used to locate media, documents, and other specialized formats.
      You can also use a database called Reference Universe to search our entire reference
      collection at once. This tool is useful in locating resources that are easily overlooked but
      useful for your research. The results will not only point you to specific books with infor-
      mation on your topic, but they'll provide the exact page number as well!

 Research Consultations: Subject librarians are available to meet with students to
   discuss their research strategies. You can schedule an appointment with the
   librarian in your major through their profile page or by completing the consulta­
   tion request form.

        Database Search Strategies Tips

This section covers several database search tips, including Boolean Operators, wildcards,
and shortcuts, that will make your research more efficient.
Quotation Marks: To search for a phrase, use quotation marks around the words that make
up the phrase. For example, instead of putting in Olympic and gymnast as separate terms,
put them together like this: "Olympic gymnast." Doing so helps narrow down your search.
Boolean Operators: Strategically incorporating And, Or, and Not into your searches will
help you get better results by narrowing or expanding your search and by eliminating
unnecessary terms from your results.

240 | Database Search Strategies
            Example

          · And: You can narrow your results by adding AND to your search. If you com-
             bine "Shakespeare" AND "modern adaptations," your results will contain both
             terms.

          · Or: Conversely, searching social media OR digital literacy will expand your
             search by retrieving results with either one of those terms.

          · Not: This will narrow your results by excluding a term that is irrelevant to you.
             For example, searching social media NOT digital literacy will eliminate a term
             that occurs frequently in James Baldwin searchers. If that's not the focus of
             your research, excluding it from your results can help streamline the search
             process.

The Boolean operators will be located in the drop down menu within a database's
advanced search options. For example, this is what they look like in MLA:

Truncation Symbols: Including asterisks, question marks, and exclamation points can help
streamline your searches by ensuring that you are capturing word variations and alternate
spellings.

                                                                                                                                          Database Search Strategies | 241
            Example

          · Asterisks: Placing an * at the point where the spelling of a word could change
             will search for every variation of that word. For example, when dealing with
             James Baldwin, race and racism will be a recurring theme. You can save time
             by searching for rac* which will retrieve results for race, racism, racialized,
             racial, and raced.

          · Exclamation Points: Used for searching variations of the same word with
             alternative spellings. For example, wom!n = women or woman.

          · Question Marks: Useful for searching words and names with alternate
             spellings, such as British and American variants or words that are translated
             in slightly different ways. For example, colo?r = color and colour.

Now that you're adept at finding high-quality resources, the next step will be to think about
how to organize and manage all that research.

        Citation Management Approaches

Students often overlook the importance of managing and organizing their research. There
are many free programs available online, such as Zotero. It's important to have a system
that works for you.
As you continue down your path to becoming a researcher, one of two things tends to hap-
pen. A) you have a closet full of printed journal articles that you are saving "just in case," but
you have no idea what's in there, or why it was important; or B) you are constantly trying to
remember what that one article was that you read that one time, but it wasn't relevant at
the time, so you threw it away.
Luckily there are citation management programs to help you wrangle and organize your

click of a button.

        Creating Search Alerts

Databases, journals, and Google Scholar allow you to set up alerts based on author names
or keywords to help researchers stay current in their subject areas. This is done by entering
your email address along with your selected keywords to receive a notification any time a
new article is published that matches your criteria. One word of caution: while search alerts
are effective tools, they can be overwhelming if you create too many, so be selective.

Objectives

This chapter focuses on a key companion to library resources: Google Scholar. Although we
focused on subject databases in the previous unit, Google Scholar can be a helpful addition
to your literature review. Not only does it capture resources not available directly through
UCF, but it includes useful tools such as journal and author alerts, the "cited by" feature,
journal metrics, author profiles, and more. We review these and other research tools and
show you how to use Google Scholar in tandem with our subject databases.

As you read through this chapter, your tasks are to practice locating scholarly sources for
your research project using Google Scholar and then storing your citations.

                                                                                                                                                    Chapter 7 Objectives | 251

Getting the Most Out of Google
Scholar

BARRY MAUER AND JOHN VENECEK
Google Scholar is an invaluable companion to our subject databases and should be part
of any literature review. This chapter provides an overview of the most common Google
Scholar features as well as some tips to make your searching more efficient and compre-
hensive. Some of these features are obvious and intuitive while others are more hidden. To
get started, let's watch this short video that covers how to find full text by linking to the UCF
Libraries, the cited by feature, locating related articles, the citation template, and author
profiles.
Getting the Most out of Google Scholar [2 min 5 sec]

                    One or more interactive elements has been excluded from this version of the
                    text. You can view them online here: https://pressbooks.online.ucf.edu/strate­
        gies2e/?p=156#oembed-1

Let's take a closer look at the features covered in the video.
Linking to UCF Libraries Full Text Options (0:21): You can link Google Scholar to any library
by selecting the Library Links option in the settings menu. You can access the settings
menu by clicking on the three bars in the upper left of the Google Scholar home page, then
clicking on the gear icon at the bottom of the menu.
Cited By / Citation Chaining (0:49): Using the "Cited By" feature is also part of an effective
search strategy called "citation chaining." This helps you track the development of a topic
backward and forward in time. For example, it is common to "mine the bibliography" of
an article to see who the author(s) cited during their research. This provides insight into
who influenced them, what theories and methods they used, and how they developed their
argument.
The next link in the chain is to see who has cited a work of scholarship after publication and
what they're saying about it. How often has it been cited? Who has cited it? What are other
researchers saying about it? Google Scholar and Web of Science are the two resources that
offer this feature. This was demoed in the video, but here's an overview of how this feature
works:
Search any article, book, or book chapter title in Google Scholar. When the result pops up,
you'll see "Cited by":

To access those articles, simply click on the link and you'll be given access to those results:

                                                                                                                                                                                     | 255
You can then expand the scope of those resources by mining their bibliographies to see
who they cited, then go to Google scholar to see who cited them. Citation chaining can
also give you some insight into where those authors fit within the scholarly conversation on
their topics.
Related Articles (1:05): Similar to the above, the related articles link will retrieve a set of
results based on your search criteria. These won't be directly cited in your original article;
they will be related or similar to it in some way. This feature is located directly next to the
Cited by link:

256 |
Related articles won't be direct citations; rather, they'll be suggestions that may or may not
be relevant.
Citation Template (1:22): This feature will provide a template for the full citation in all the
major citation styles. Note that this is just a template. . . be sure to check the citation against
an official source, such as the MLA or APA styles guides, to make sure it's accurate.
Author Profiles & Journal Metrics (1:37): If an author's name is underlined in green, that
indicates that they have a Google Scholar Account. For example, when searching "social
media in writing classrooms," I noted that a recent book by Ken Hyland has a high citation
count:

Clicking on his underlined name links to his profile page where you can get an overview of
his research interests, publications, citation counts, and even a list of his co-authors. Google
Scholar also ranks his publications by citation to illustrate which of his works are making
the biggest impact in the field. If you find a scholar whose work is particularly relevant, you
can create a search alert using their name.
Journal Metrics
The Metrics link allows you to search for the highest-ranking journals by field. The rankings
are determined by the "h5" index, which documents the number of articles published in a
journal over the last five years that have been cited at least ten times. The first page shows
the rankings for all scholarly journals, which include Nature, The New England Journal of
Medicine, and Science as the top three. From there, you can click on the categories tab to
view the results by discipline:

                                                                                                                                                                                     | 257

Most of Google Scholar is straightforward. However, there are a few tips and tricks that will
help make your searching more efficient and successful. To get started, let's watch this
short video:

                    One or more interactive elements has been excluded from this version of the
                    text. You can view them online here: https://pressbooks.online.ucf.edu/strate­
        gies2e/?p=167#oembed-1

Now let's take a closer look at some of the key points raised in the video:
Basic Searching (0:08): One point presented in this video but not discussed in depth is the
use of Boolean Operators. Even if you don't know what Boolean Operators are, you've likely
used them in your personal searching at some point. Basically, they are commands that can
be used in search engines, database, or online catalogues. The most popular commands
are AND, OR, and NOT. Other commands include parentheses, truncation, and phrases.
Here's how they work:
AND/NOT/OR

                                                                                                                                           Advanced Search Features | 259
  · AND: Place "and" in between two words or phrases to run a combined search. If you
      search two short phrases such as "James Baldwin Sonny's Blues" Google Scholar will
      assume AND is between two and do a combined search for you.

  · NOT: Place a "not" before a word or phrase to exclude that from appearing in your
      search results. This is useful when there's a particular word that's cluttering your
      results.

  · OR: This is useful when you want to search one thing OR another. This will also expand
      your results.

Truncation Symbols & Stemming

In chapter seven, we discussed the use of truncation symbols as a way to search for words
with multiple variations. For example, placing an asterisk at the end of a word like German*
will retrieve german/german's/germans/germany/germanic.
Google Scholar does not recognize truncation symbols. Rather it uses a stemming system
that searches for variations of the word you searched without the use of symbols. For exam-
ple, searching "German" in Google Scholar will retrieve "Germans" but not Germany or Ger-
manic. The key difference between stemming and truncation symbols is that stemming is
based on whole words and truncation is based on partial or roots of words.

Quotation Marks

If you don't want synonyms cluttering your search results, place quotation marks around a
word or phrase or use the "exact phrase" option in the advanced search section for a more
controlled search. This also helps weed out unrelated results caused by common terms,
which would be a potential problem when researching an author with two common names
such as James Baldwin. For example, searching "James Baldwin" or "Sonny's Blues" with
quotes or using the exact phrase option will weed out unwanted results.

Search Limiters (0:30): Here the video discusses some other ways to refine your results

260 | Advanced Search Features
using the tools that appear in the sidebar. This includes creating a customised date range
and changing how results are sorted.
Search Alerts (0:45): Related to the above, is creating search alerts so you can be notified
when a new article is published that matches your search criteria. This is a great way to
stay current when you're conducting a literature review. You'll need to be signed into your
Google Scholar account or enter your email address to do this.
Advanced Search Options (0:56): We discussed these above in the Boolean Operator sec-
tion. You can access these options by clicking on menu bar in the upper left.
My Library (1:27): If you have a Google Scholar account, you can create a personal library
of resources. Use the folders option to separate the resources by project, create alerts, and
share your sources with others.
Citation Template (1:50): We covered this on the previous page, but the video reviews this
option again. Use this feature to generate a full citation in any style, but don't forget to
check it against an authoritative style guide.
Cited By & Related Articles (2:06): Also covered on the previous page, but worth reviewing
again here. Use the "Cited by" feature to locate articles that cited one you're using for your
research. . . also called "citation chaining." This is a great way to get a sense of the schol-
arly conversation that's unfolding around the sources you're using, a concept we discuss
more in-depth in the "Scholarship as Conversation" section of this book. "Related articles" is
a similar idea based more on recommendation than direct citation, but it's still a useful way
to locate relevant sources.
Versions (2:19): You'll often see a versions option below a record with a number of variants
available. Sometimes these are the same versions available in multiple locations, or it can
be a different version like an unpublished pre-print. In either case, this can be a useful fea-
ture when searching for full text. If the first version that pops up doesn't have a full text
option, try the others.

Other Search Tips: Here are a couple other points not covered in the video but are worth
knowing:

                                                                                                                                           Advanced Search Features | 261
Emphasize Keywords over full sentences or questions
As with subject databases, Google Scholar will yield the best results if you break a sentence
or question into keywords or short phrases. See chapter three for a more in-depth discus-
sion about the value of strategic keywords.

Synonyms

One way Google Scholar differs from many academic databases is that it searches for syn-
onyms of your keywords. Most academic databases are built on controlled vocabulary and
won't search for synonyms. Be aware of this difference when using Google Scholar and refer
to the following bullet points for tips on creating more controlled searches.
Now that we've talked in-depth about how to locate scholarly resources, let's discuss how
to evaluate those sources.

        Exercises

  1. Using Google Scholar, find three scholarly sources for your research project.
 2. Store your citations in your chosen citation management system.

Chapter 8 Objectives

BARRY MAUER AND JOHN VENECEK

Objectives

This chapter focuses on ways to select resources that are relevant, significant, and trustwor-
thy. In other words, we need to address the issue of authority, which is the trust we grant to
reliable sources of information. With so much misinformation and disinformation flooding
our society, we need to be extremely careful. How do we handle the question of "bias"? Is it
always a bad thing? How important is currency (the most recent information)?
Reviewing the Secondary Literature is an important section designed to demystify schol-
arly articles and books. Primary literature is a literary work or a report by someone with first-
hand knowledge (such as the author of "Sonny's Blues"). Secondary literature is any text
that discusses the primary text. Secondary literature includes scholarly analyses, interpre-
tations, criticisms, and other forms of commentary. Your research paper will include both
primary and secondary sources. We focus on the concepts of thinking while reading, strate-
gic skimming, active reading along with some valuable tips for note-taking.
The Annotated Bibliography section explains the purpose as well as the scope of your anno-
tated bibliography. The annotated bibliography serves as a resources as you assemble your

264 | Chapter 8 Objectives
research project. Later you will synthesize these materials into a review of literature, which
we will learn about in Chapter 10. The review of literature puts your research into a form that
presents your argument clearly to your readers.
The project tasks for this chapter is to evaluate the credibility of the sources you found in
the tasks for the previous two chapters and to write an annotated bibliography.

                                                                                                                                                   Chapter 8 Objectives | 265
            Learning Objectives

     Use this chapter to help you
          · Evaluate which sources are most credible and why.
          · Learn to select the best sources to establish your authority on your subject.
          · Join the fight against misinformation and disinformation.
          · Understand the process of annotating your scholarly sources. Later you will
             synthesize these annotations into a review of literature, which is a structured
             presentation of your research and how it relates to your research problem. By
             reading this chapter and responding to the related discussion prompts, you
             will learn to:
                   understand the elements that go into an annotated bibliography and
                      their relevance.
                   develop skills for reading strategically and efficiently.
                   identify current trends, niches, research gaps, and other opportunities to
                      join the scholarly conversation to add your unique perspective.

Finding Trustworthy Sources

BARRY MAUER AND JOHN VENECEK

We discuss the following topics on this page:
  · Authority is Constructed and Contextual
  · Aristotle's Ethos
  · A Note about Bias

We also provide the following activity:
  · Finding Trustworthy Sources [Refresher]

This page addresses several questions: How do we know which sources to trust? What
sources will our audience find most relevant and significant? How important is currency
(not money, but information that is the most recent)? Should we be concerned about
whether a source is "biased"? How do we avoid repeating misinformation to our audience?
At the heart of these questions is the issue of "authority," which is the trust we grant to reli-
able sources of information.

                                                                                                                                       Finding Trustworthy Sources | 267
                                                                                                                                                              1

         Authority is Constructed and Contextual

                 Information resources reflect their creators' expertise and credibility and
                 are evaluated based on the information needed and the context in which
                 the information will be used. Authority is constructed in that various
                 communities may recognize different types of authority. It is contextual
                 in that the information needed may help to determine the level of

                                                                      2

                 authority required.

  Is there ever a good reason to use low quality sources in a research paper? If our goal
  is to show readers the difference between good and bad information, then reproducing
  the unreliable information is justified (because we are identifying it as such). Researchers
  can and should discuss the false and dangerous things people believe, or what they want
  others to believe, without falling into the trap of believing it themselves. Therefore, pur-
  posely looking for low sources of information might be justified. Problems occur, however,
  when researchers confuse low quality information with high quality information. We need
  to maintain a set of standards and use our critical judgment when evaluating sources to
  ensure that statements of fact are indeed true and that claims follow allowable inferences.
  It is our responsibility to make proper assessments of information sources and to point out
  flaws when we find them.

  The usefulness of a resource will differ by discipline and the scope of your project. For exam­
  ple, currency, meaning the work was published more recently, is extremely important in
  the sciences but not always so in the humanities where scholars routinely work with clas­
  sic texts. In the digital humanities, and in any field that deals with digital media, things will
  develop faster and, therefore, currency will be more relevant.

  As you conduct your literature review, you should be aware of criteria such as currency, rel-

  evance, authority, and purpose, but do so with what the Association of College & Research
  Libraries (ACRL) calls an "attitude of informed skepticism and an openness to new perspec-
  tives, additional voices, and changes in schools of thought." Effective researchers "under-
  stand the need to determine the validity of the information created by different authorities
  and to acknowledge biases that privilege some sources of authority over others, especially
  in terms of others' worldviews, gender, sexual orientation, and cultural orientations."
  Many novice scholars make the mistake of doing a quick web search without going any
  further. The materials a scholar finds through this method can be extremely poor. The
  method most likely to produce credible materials is to search academic library databases
  for peer-reviewed scholarly sources (see the "Continuum of Credibility" below). Even within
  the scholarly sources, there are more and less credible sources.

  The continuum above is just a guide and not a law. A blog - which is categorized as "less
  credible" here - may contain credible information. We need to exercise independent judg-
  ment. For a more complete overview of constructing authority, see the ACRL Framework .

       Aristotle's Ethos

Aristotle's term ethos evaluates expertise in these terms. Ethos has an ethical dimension
and is separate from self-confidence or popularity since it is possible to be self-confident
and popular without any ethical grounding. We can get a sense of whether an authority
is ethical by investigating how others have evaluated their work. Over time, scholars get a
reputation from other scholars who evaluate their knowledge, trustworthiness, and disin­
terestedness.
Aristotle was suspicious of people who argued for money. Cynically promoting views you
don't agree with in order to profit personally constitutes a form of malpractice. Honest self-
advocacy is fine, however. For instance, disabled scholars who advocate for better trans-
portation for people with disabilities do not present ethical problems with their advocacy.

270 | Finding Trustworthy Sources
       A Note about Bias

We routinely hear that "bias" is bad; therefore, the reasoning goes, if we find a work of
scholarship that shows "bias," we should reject it. But not all bias is bad. If bias is towards
the truth, then we should accept. If we hear two scholars arguing about what the moon is
made from, and one says cheese and the other says rock, we should not discount the one
who says "rock" because it appears they are biased. As scholars, we are called upon to act
as referees, and it is up to us to take sides when necessary. In this example, claiming that
both sides are right, or that the truth is in the middle, is a dereliction of our duty as schol-
ars. It is warranted to be biased against the bad behavior or false claims of scholars, but it
is not warranted to be biased against good evidence and arguments nor is it warranted to
be biased against scholars based on their race, gender, or other identity categories. If we
notice unwarranted bias in the work of other scholars, we have an obligation to point it out
in our work.

         Avoiding Misinformation, Disinformation, and
         Dismediation

  Good scholarship protects us from misinformation (wrong or misleading information), dis­
  information (intentionally deceptive information), and dismediation (intentionally decep-

                                                                                                                                    1

  tive efforts to discredit reliable channels of information). Popular social media platforms in
  particular are rife with misleading, wrong, and deceitful claims. You should not rely on such
  sources for factual claims (unless you are a pro who can independently verify the informa-

  tion you get from them - and even then, you will need to explain why you are using such
  sources instead of scholarly ones).

  The institutions that support scholarship, such as granting agencies, peer-reviewed jour­
  nals, libraries, and so on, rely on gatekeepers to keep bad information out and allow good
  information in. Of course, no such system is foolproof, so we need to maintain our own
  critical abilities. The scholarly system, when it works well, polices itself. When scholars see
  misinformation, disinformation, or dismediation in the work of other scholars, it is their pro­
  fessional responsibility to point it out and demand a correction.

  We don't want to be too strict about information sources, however. Some scholars dismiss
  journals that are new, have a low rejection rate, don't have illustrious board members, pub-
  lish infrequently, only publish online, etc. In other words, it might be snobbish to believe
  that nothing published in such journals can be taken seriously because the journal (the
  media channel) itself is suspect. While long-established journals with low acceptance rates
  and illustrious board members, etc. have earned their good reputations, they also can
  become stodgy and boring. Journals that are new or less well-known can be good sources
  of information because they might be in a better position to introduce new ideas to the
  field.

  Discernment

  As readers, we bring critical thinking to our research. Gullibility, or trusting too easily, is a
  problem because it means we are more likely to accept misinformation, disinformation, or
  dismediation. But we can go too far in the other direction and end up in cynicism - not
  trusting at all - which leads us to reject reliable sources. For instance, the internet has enor-
  mous amounts of information that is true and useful. Refusing to accept it because it's on
  the internet is as problematic as accepting everything that's on the internet. Our struggle
  is to practice discernment: when to trust and when not to trust. Discernment requires care
  and effort.

  Our blind spots - gaps in our knowledge - present obstacles to discernment. These gaps
  make us vulnerable to the Dunning-Kruger effect: "people suffering the most among their

                                                                                                                                                                                                                    2

278 | Reviewing the Secondary Literature
       What Do We Mean by Literature?

When we use the word "literature" in the phrase "literature review," we are not talking about
literary writing such as novels, poems, and plays. Instead, we are talking about scholarly
research, which is often referred to by scholars as "secondary literature." Our objective when
creating a research project is to tell the story of research up to the point in time of our own
contribution. Then, you add your own contribution. You should start by thinking about what
types of information and resources you will need to complete your project. In the case of lit-
erary studies, we often start with peer-reviewed journal articles and scholarly monographs
that can be accessed through the library catalog and subject databases. These are both
essential resources, but you may need more.
For Jada's research project about James Baldwin's "Sonny's Blues," we might also think
about exploring newspapers and primary source collections related to civil rights, African
American studies, and social activism. Your topics may require different types of media,
data sets, or case studies, etc.

       Reading Like a Researcher

While conducting your literature review, you will encounter many types of scholarly writing.
This material is often long and dense and can seem intimidating to beginning scholars.
There is a remedy, however. Reading like a researcher is a skill that demystifies scholarly
articles and monographs while making your review more efficient. The key is knowing that
reading scholarship is different from other types of reading (like reading literary works). It
is an active and strategic process that will help you identify the structure of an academic

                                                                                                                             Reviewing the Secondary Literature | 279
book or article, an author's thesis, their argument, and the scholarly conversation in which
they are engaged. We'll also discuss thinking while reading, the anatomy of a journal article,
and strategies for effective note-taking.
A word of caution about reading the scholarly literature; many scholars begin their writing
by presenting the opposing case. Do not confuse this presentation with the scholar's own
case. For instance, in Cleanth Brooks' "The Language of Paradox," the first chapter of his
book, The Well-Wrought Urn: Studies in the Structure of Poetry, he begins with these
words: "Few of us are prepared to accept the statement that the language of poetry is the
language of paradox. Paradox is the language of sophistry, hard, bright, witty; it is hardly
the language of the soul." Many students incorrectly read this passage as one that Brooks
is affirming. But he spends the rest of his chapter making the opposite case. In his second
paragraph, we get an early hint that he is shifting away from his opening remarks: "Yet
there is a sense in which paradox is the language appropriate and inevitable to poetry." The
word "yet" signals that he wants to object to the claimed he opened with. While Brooks
doesn't credit anyone for holding the claim he opposes, he is familiar enough with it to
present it as a consensus point of view. Again, please be careful not to mistake a scholar's
opposing argument for the one they are affirming.

       Taking Notes While Reading

As you read, take notes on the following:

     While Reading Scholarly Literature, Ask

            · What is the subject of the reading? What is it about?

280 | Reviewing the Secondary Literature
            · If it is a research paper or theoretical text, what is the thesis?
                      List at least three main points used to support the thesis.
                      What evidence is offered in support of the major argument?

            · What is the subtext (the author's purpose)?
            · Who is the intended audience?
            · How credible is the work?
            · What applications can the work have (how might it be used)?
            · How relevant are these applications?

Students are strongly encouraged to adopt a note-taking/citation management system.
UCF offers students one of the most popular programs, EndNote, at no charge. In Chapter
7, we discuss how to use citation management systems like EndNote.

       Strategic Skimming

Given the length and density of scholarly books as well as articles, it would be difficult to
read them closely during your literature review. At this stage, you're scanning and compil-
ing possible resources for your review. Therefore, strategic skimming is an essential skill.
Think of it as getting a bird's-eye view of an article or book chapter and selectively zoom-
ing in and out of the sections that are most relevant to you. You may go back to those
sections for a closer reading, but for now, you're using this process to identify possible
resources. Understanding how scholarly monographs and articles are organized will make
this process easier and more efficient.

     Journal Articles

       The Abstract: The abstract is a concise paragraph that is considered the "execu-
       tive summary" of the article. Here, you can identify the author's purpose, main
       problem or research question, methodology, and key findings.
       The Introduction: This section builds on the abstract and is where authors make
       a real effort to connect to their audience. Introductions vary quite widely, but
       generally, they start broadly and narrow down; they state the author's aims and
       the importance of their research; they state the hypothesis or research question,
       and they include a thesis statement. They may also include what is sometimes
       referred to as a "forecasting statement," which helps prepare the reader and
       guide them through the rest of the paper.
       Section Headers: If an article is broken into subsections, explore how those sub-
       sections are organized to get a sense of how the authors constructed their argu-
       ment. These subsections may also generate ideas for how you can narrow and

282 | Reviewing the Secondary Literature
focus your topic. You may find that just one subsection is worth digging into
deeper, then note who the author cited in that section to help you establish the
theoretical foundation for your project.
Keyword Searching: Effective keywords will not only help you locate high qual-
ity articles in our subject databases, they can also help you strategically skim
through articles to quickly determine their relevance to your project. This strat-
egy can also be effective if you've found a reference to an idea in an abstract or
introduction and want to jump to that section to get more info. Skimming is not
a replacement for a close reading of an article, book chapter, or book; it's a
method for sifting and establishing relevance during the literature review. Think
about the article's title: why did the author choose it? Does it epitomize the
argument? Also, don't just grab a sentence from a text that agrees with your
viewpoint without reviewing the larger context. The sentence you grab may not
represent the author's views at all, but may be the author's presentation of an
opposing argument.
The Conclusion: This section can be read in tandem with the introduction.
Authors often use the conclusion to restate key points; however, they may also
ask unanswered questions and leave clues for future research. Sometimes, they
state these questions explicitly as if they are expecting others to build on what
they've started. These questions and clues are points for you to jump into the
conversation.
Other: Familiarizing yourself with the norms of your field is part of reading like a
researcher. Depending on the field, journal articles may also include sections
such as a literature review, keywords, methodology, results, discussion, and
directions for future research. We'll discuss these points further in "Anatomy of a
Research Article" below.

                                                                                                                  Reviewing the Secondary Literature | 283
     Scholarly Monographs

       Preface: This section of the book is equivalent to the abstract in a journal article,
       in which authors address their main argument, thesis, and often provide a brief
       overview of each chapter. The preface can help guide you to the most relevant
       sections of the book.
       Table of Contents: Not only will this index include a list of chapters, it can also
       orient you to the theoretical focus and structure of the book. It is useful for
       understanding the specific text and for providing insight into how you might
       organize your own study. Much like the "section headers" discussed above, there
       might be something in a single chapter worth further investigation.
       Introduction & Conclusions: Just as with journal articles, the introduction builds
       on the preface by providing a more in-depth discussion of the author's argu-
       ment, thesis, and their findings. The conclusion (if there is one - not all scholarly
       books have one) might be a recap of the thesis and the key findings. Consider
       reading these sections together before you read the body of the text.
       Indexes: A variation of "keyword searching" discussed above is to skim the index
       to identify sections of the book that are most relevant to you. This approach is
       also an effective way to build and refine your list of keywords that you will search
       for in library subject databases.

       Active Reading

You should approach the literature review as an active reader who believes that other

284 | Reviewing the Secondary Literature
scholars have something important to say, but also as a skeptic searching for gaps in the
conversation and ways to add constructive context or relevance to the discussion.
In "Scholarship as Conversation," we discussed how the idea of an intended audience can
help frame your argument so that you are contributing to the discourse on your topic and
are moving the conversation forward. Likewise, when conducting your literature review, try
to determine the intended audience of each article, book chapter, or book that you read
and what kind of conversation is taking place between these sources. After a while, you
should start to see connections within the various works. Ask yourself these questions: who
is building on whose argument and where do certain scholars agree and disagree? Do
these authors point to areas of further research that you can build on?
Think of others' research as a relay, or a kind of loose model, for producing your own
research project. Published articles and book chapters, especially in edited volumes, pro-
vide insight into how researchers target specific audiences and tailor their arguments to
meet their reader's expectations. In your writing, a clear sense of audience awareness will
help you establish the proper tone and give your paper a sense of purpose. It can also help
establish the scope of your literature review and determine which resources will be most
effective in your final draft.

       The Anatomy of a Journal Article

With a little experience, you'll be able to tell a lot about a journal article just by examining its
structure, or anatomy. Articles in the humanities are usually relatively simple compared to
the social sciences and STEM (Science Technology, Engineering, Math). While there may be
some variation depending on journal requirements, here is a basic breakdown of the two:

                                                                                                                             Reviewing the Secondary Literature | 285

                                          Conclusion
                                          Works cited

Let's examine an article to see how much information we can glean from the first page
alone:

286 | Reviewing the Secondary Literature
This article is from a nursing journal. Note how we get the name of the journal with a link to
the journal's homepage, the title of the article, the authors with their credentials and affilia-
tions, the abstract, and a list of keywords to index the article and to provide the reader with
several search terms. Without reading a word, you should immediately discern from the
layout that this is a scientific article published in a scholarly, peer-reviewed journal. Every-
thing here is transparent, and that transparency enhances the validity of the journal, the
authors, and their study.
As noted above, humanities articles have a more basic structure that often flows from the
abstract, to the introduction, to the body of the text. For example, here's a peer-reviewed
article on Milton retrieved from the MLA database:

                                                                                                                             Reviewing the Secondary Literature | 287
While the layout is much simpler than in a STEM article, it conforms to the norms of a
humanities journal and is easily identifiable as a work of literary criticism. For example, it fol-
lows a basic beginning structure of title, author, abstract and introduction. Unlike the STEM
article, the author's affiliation will be at the end of the published work, after the works cited.

       Making Notes on Books

Scholarly books can be touchstone works in literary studies. Before reading a whole book,
take some steps to see if doing so is necessary for your project. Time is a precious resource,
and you need to use it wisely! Read book reviews to gauge the book's likely relevance as
well as its strengths and weaknesses. Then, read the Table of Contents and the Introduc-
tion. If there's a specific chapter that seems most relevant, skim it first. If there's a specific
detail you're investigating, use the index to find that smaller section. If, however, you decide
that the whole book is relevant (or that it's been assigned by your instructor), then read the
instructions below to learn how to take effective notes while reading.
Please do not try to remember a whole scholarly book in your head; our brains are not made
to process and store this quantity and density of information. Instead, get in the habit of

                                                                                                                             Reviewing the Secondary Literature | 289
taking notes and making an index of the book as you read. Here are some tips to guide you
through the process:

            1. Think of your notes as your personal reference for the book. Mark page
                numbers before each note so you can find your way through the book
                again later, using your notes as a guide.

           2. If you see a key term, jot it down. You can usually identify key terms
                because they repeat.

           3. Sometimes, a book will identify its key terms, sometimes not. If you see a
                term you don't know, jot it down. If you see a word you know, but it's being
                used in an unfamiliar way, jot it down. It is important to remember that
                various disciplines and authors use words in a specialized way, and we
                must be careful to keep their sense of the term. Because of this, try to fig-
                ure out the meaning of the term from the context before going to a dictio-
                nary.

           4. Do not add comments, criticize, or "figure out" the author's ideas in your
                reference notes. The purpose of the notes is to keep a faithful index of the
                book; if you refer to your notes later, it should be clear which ideas are the
                author's and which are not. Your comments, questions, and criticisms can
                be made in a separate column if you choose (see the Cornell Method video
                above).

           5. Take at least one note per page of text.
           6. A note does not have to be a full sentence; fragments are fine.
           7. An outline is a very useful form for your notes, since it helps to keep track

                of the parts of an argument, including its thesis, sub-claims, evidence,
                opposing arguments, etc.
           8. Don't take too many notes. A map of Utah is useless if it's the same size as
                Utah. The purpose of note-taking is to have the information in usable (i.e.
                reduced) form.

Once you have a set of notes on your scholarly readings, go back through them and notice
repeated themes and linked ideas. Highlight the notes that stand out to you. Make a sec-
ond set of notes that is more condensed than the first. This second set of notes will be raw
materials for your research and writing.

  stage is to write an annotated bibliography - a set of notes on discrete items, and the sec-
  ond stage is to synthesize these notes into a review of literature, which we present in Chap-
  ter 10. The annotated bibliography lists your sources in alphabetical order by author's last
  name, just as you would do for a list of works cited. But the list also includes annotations,
  which are your words detailing relevant points from each source. The annotation is not just
  a simple summary of the source, but specifically indicates why information in the source

  ating an Annotated Bibliography.
  294 | The Annotated Bibliography
is relevant to your research problem. Use the annotations to explain the relevance of each
source for your research.

Your research problem determines the scope of your research, which is the broadness or
narrowness of the information you need. Keep in mind that we are not just looking for facts
here but also for a sense of the scholarly discussion, which usually covers a range of thought
about a given area of knowledge.

Keep in mind that you don't want to only include facts or claims from the secondary litera-
ture that support your argument. A better strategy is to think of organizing the material you
find in terms of what Gregory Ulmer calls the CATTt - Contrast-Analogy-Theory-Target-tale.
Contrasts are approaches to the research problem that differ from yours approach; Analo­
gies are ways of thinking about your research problem that come from a different knowl-
edge domain; Theory is a general explanation of the problem, Target is the result you want
to see in the scholarly conversation; and tale is the demonstration of your method. Your
annotations can indicate how various sources relate to these categories.

Broadly speaking, the sources you gather should relate to your literary case study, the schol-
arly problem you have identified, and the relevant theories, methodologies, and methods
you are including. Though you are gathering sources for you to use in your research, you
should still keep your audience in mind; think about how your audience make sense of the
sources you have identified and what you need to do with the sources to present your argu-
ment. The following questions should help you to make appropriate annotations on your
sources:

            1. What was done?
           2. Why it was done?
           3. What was found?
           4. What are the implications of the results?
           5. What future research should follow up on this work?
           6. What did you not understand in the paper that someone else can help you

                with?

While annotated bibliographies are sometimes published as useful guides to areas of
knowledge, most scholars don't include annotated bibliographies in their published work.
Instead, researchers use the much more reader-friendly review of literature, which we will
be learning about in Chapter 11. The review of literature is where you synthesize your

                                                                                                                                        The Annotated Bibliography | 295
research sources by looking for similarities and differences (among arguments, narratives,
and trends in the sources), and organize them in terms of their function - case study, the-
ory, methodology, etc. - within your research.
To help you gather annotated materials in one place, we provide a Matrix Tool that helps
you organize your research. The annotated bibliography, unlike the literature review, does
not need to be essayistic. We also provide an example of an annotated bibliography created
by UCF student Dolores Batten that explains how her readings relate to her research pro-
ject (her research project was to help develop methods for improving student writing).

RESEARCH QUESTION

298 | Chapter 9: Developing Your Research Question
Chapter 9 Objectives

BARRY MAUER AND JOHN VENECEK

Objectives

This chapter focuses on the art of crafting a clear, concise research question that will drive
your research. Beginning researchers often struggle with the task of framing a research
question, but we show how asking critical, open-ended questions can provide an entry
point into the scholarly conversation on your topic. As we will discuss, a good research ques-
tion has a clear purpose because it addresses a scholarly problem. It should relate to the
work of other scholars and should be one they find relevant and significant.
Developing a good research question requires asking lots of other questions. Think of the
research question as the engine that drives your project. If the engine is too simple, it may
not work at all. If it's too complicated, it may not work efficiently or effectively. The goal is to
have your research question take you a long way toward producing new understanding to
add to the scholarly discourse.
This chapter will focus on strategies to help you develop, refine, and evaluate a good
research question. We'll begin with Dr. Bruce Janz, professor of Philosophy at UCF, who dis-
cusses how he approaches the art of asking good questions with students in his courses.

                                                                                                                                                   Chapter 9 Objectives | 299
Dr. Janz's thoughts provide a good starting point that we'll build on in the next section,
Refining Your Research Question" where we'll watch Jada discuss how she used an inven-
tion process that consisted of "built-in" questions, frames, and methodologies that caused
her to view James Baldwin's work in an unexpectedly personal way.
In the final section entitled "Evaluating Your Research Question," we'll circle back to Dr. Janz
who provides some strategies for evaluating your question to ensure that it's clear, com-
plex, focused, and that the answer is arguable. The focus is on devising an open-ended and
arguable question that adds to the discourse rather than answering a simple question.

Please complete the following tasks as you read through this chapter. Keep track of your

work and reflect on how these tasks relate to the ones you have already completed.

                                                                                                                                                    Chapter 9 Objectives | 301

     Your thesis statement will answer your research question, so having a polished
     question is essential to the development of your thesis statement. Having both are
     essential to writing an abstract. Hence, this chapter helps you to

The Art of Asking Good Questions

Guest contribution: Bruce Janz on the Art of Asking Questions

Introduction
Bruce Janz is Professor in the Department of Philosophy at UCF, graduate faculty in the
Texts & Technology Ph.D. program, and co-director of the Center for Humanities and Digital
Research.
We asked Dr. Janz to contribute to this course because he has some interesting thoughts
on the topic of questions and questioning in philosophy but also beyond that, drawing
on other disciplines. This is very much in line with our thoughts in this chapter where we
present the ability to ask good questions as an important but vastly underappreciated
research skill, even an artform.

                                                                                                                                The Art of Asking Good Questions | 303
Dr. Janz's approach is to take students through a critique of their provisional questions and
to revise those until they come to something that they can really get behind.

"I encourage students to trust their guts," he says, "because sometimes the realization that
a question is present comes before its clear articulation. I get them to look for the "hmm,
that's weird" moments in data or texts or whatever they are working with - that's a site
for questions. All this gets them to be a philosopher rather than study philosophy, and the
same would be true of other disciplines as well."

Here are some more of Dr. Janz's thoughts about developing good questions, which is the
focus of this chapter:

On "how" questions: People often use "how" questions as research questions (how does
something happen/come to be/end up like this), and these assume that something is
the case. They ask for an account of something. You might have to take a step back and
demonstrate that the thing you say is happening is really happening.

"That's weird" moments: I sometimes talk about "that's weird" moments in looking at the
data or phenomena. Moments like that are more like "why" questions. They are an attempt
to give an account of something that's not adding up, that is a certain way but it's not clear
why. That suggests that there are forces at work that need to be brought into the open. So,
are there any "that's weird" moments? Something you would expect to be one way but it's a
different way? I'm not saying that if there are no such moments there's nothing to explain,
but it's easier if you see something like that.

Questions imply methods or disciplinary frameworks: You could, for instance, ask a ques-
tion in such a way that it suggests that you are looking for a cause for some phenomenon,
in which case you would have to use methods that could yield causes. It's worth being
aware of which methods or disciplines you are implicitly appealing to by asking a question.
A method is a way of answering a question (among other things).

What's the ontology of your question? In other words, what are you assuming exists in
the world of your question, and how do things relate to each other? Does your question
assume, for example, that individuals are the atoms of the world and any answer must refer
back to what individuals do?

Questions that take risks: That is, the risk that your answer could be wrong. So it's always

304 | The Art of Asking Good Questions
worth asking about any question whether someone could disagree with you and still be
right. If you are arguing for using a particular lens to understand something, could some-
one come along with a different lens and also give a coherent analysis? And if so, are these
two lenses essentially the same thing? Is one better than the other in the end? Are these
two explaining different aspects of a phenomenon? How exactly do different answers relate
to each other? Also, what kind of evidence could there be that might convince you or some-
one else that your account is wrong? Is there anything? And if not, have you taken any risk
in your question?

Small changes in wording: Questions might take on a different complexion with a very
small change in wording. That's why it is worth going over your question many times, with
different wordings, to see whether something new comes up. Defining words in a question,
even (maybe especially) the seemingly easy ones, can help you to think about the space
your question operates in or opens up.

More "that's weird" moments: Questions might have as their goal to fit something into an
existing way of understanding the world (the "that's weird" moment might get resolved so
that it does in fact line up with other existing knowledge). On the other hand, a question
might open up a whole new way of thinking (the "that's weird" moment might lead us to
realize that our accounts of the world aren't adequate). It's worth knowing what you think
your question (or its answer) is doing or leading to.

Unspoken parts of questions: Questions have unspoken parts. Sometimes those are
assumptions, maybe ones that seem obvious and don't need defense (always be wary of
those - they might in fact need attention). There might be an assumption that something
causes something else to happen - that's an assumption that might need its own support.
Sometimes the unspoken parts are about the audience, or they are about who is asking
the question and from what social, cultural, racial, gendered, epistemological, religious, or
other position. Sometimes there's an assumption about shared knowledge between the
writer and the audience, or shared understanding of social conventions, or something like
that. It's worth bringing out into the open as many of the unspoken parts as possible,
because it might affect the kind of question you can or should ask.

What happens when you answer a question? Does it just disappear like a checked box in
a to-do list? Or does it live on, and if so, why? Is it because the world keeps changing and so
the question remains a live one?

What does your question tell you about your own view of the world? How do you know
when you've asked the wrong question, and how do you change your mind on your ques-
tion?

                                                                                                                                The Art of Asking Good Questions | 305
How do questions relate to beliefs or worldviews? Do beliefs or worldviews govern the
kinds of questions you think are legitimate? What would it be like to ask questions from
outside of that space - would you just have to entirely change the ontology of your world
for the question to make sense at all?
Where do new questions come from? Sometimes from reading more. But sometimes
from living, from doing things. Sometimes from talking to people. Sometimes you have to
put yourself in an uncomfortable or unfamiliar space. And sometimes, questions cross-pol-
linate from other areas, morphing from a familiar space to a new one.

Now let's look at how to apply these ideas to the development and evaluation of your
research question.

Refining Your Research Question

  BARRY MAUER AND JOHN VENECEK

                 Research is iterative and depends upon asking increasingly complex or
                 new questions whose answers, in turn, develop additional questions or

                                                                                        1

                 lines of inquiry in any field.

  We discuss the following topics on this page:
     · Introduction
     · Narrowing Your Research Question
     · The Invention Process
     · Asking Critical Questions

  We also provide the following activity:
     · Refining Your Research Question [Refresher]

         Introduction

  You should start developing your research question as you embark on your literature

                                                                                                                                   Refining Your Research Question | 307
review. We introduced this idea in chapter three when we discussed the notion of research
as inquiry and emphasized the importance of curiosity and asking good, critical questions
early in the research process. The idea is that, by asking questions and engaging with the-
ory, you will develop a clear, concise question that will guide your research.

The scope of your research question is a critical consideration. Are you focused on one piece
of literature or on a broader subject such as a literary genre, period, or theme? Most often,
scholars ask questions about a specific work or works of literature, even if they want to bet-
ter understand a broader subject. One approach to writing about a broader subject is called
the case study. An individual work of literature becomes a "case" - an instance - of a larger
phenomenon you want to understand. For instance, we might look at a poem by Emily
Dickinson as a case study for understanding Dickinson's poetry writing in general. Dickin-
son's poems are mostly composed of quatrains, which are stanzas of four lines each. But
occasionally she deviates from the quatrain. A literary scholar might do a case study or two
from her works to better understand her use of the quatrain and her deviations from it.

Doing research is an inventive process that involves asking critical open-ended questions.
These questions usually start with who, what, where, when, how, why. While these may
seem simple at first, they all perform very specific functions. For example, you may start
by asking why something happened (why a literary work was produced at a particular
moment in history), but your question will become increasingly complex as you dig deeper.
Sometimes it is good to ask questions about things people take for granted and therefore
to open them up to new insights. A professor once noted that a really interesting research
question was "why three little pigs? Why not one or two?"

Your first question raises another one, and the answer to the second raises a third one. For
example, "Sonny's Blues" contrasts different kinds of music: the jazz that Sonny plays, the
gospel music the narrator hears in the street ("The Old Ship of Zion"), and the dance (juke)
music that their uncle played at parties. What roles did these different kinds of music have
in black communities? We could easily find out that Gospel music is sacred, and that jazz
and juke music are secular. Jazz music was considered sophisticated (requiring lots of study
and practice), while juke music was mostly played by amateurs. But having this answer isn't
enough to build a paper around. So, let's ask the next question: what is Baldwin's purpose in
showing us this variety of black music? Keep going until you get to something really good.

The research question should be related to your purpose. In Chapter 2, we discussed the
kinds of purpose that a research project can have, which include historical, theoretical, ped-
agogical, social, and experimental, among others. Your purpose is divided into two parts:
what you want to learn about literature, and what you want to teach your audience. Once
you have learned something relevant and significant about the literature, you then teach it
to your audience. You should be able to clearly state the learning objectives for your audi-

308 | Refining Your Research Question
ence; "by reading this research you will learn [x, y, and z]." These objectives may include
words such as: identify, distinguish, define, evaluate, understand, make, demystify, con-
clude, etc.

       Narrowing Your Research Question

Position your research question in relation to the scholarly discussion by finding gaps or
problems that still need to be better understood. Many times, scholars identify such gaps
or problems in their published work and leave it to other scholars to address them. Focus
your question on the most relevant part of a problem. For instance, if writing about racism,
note which aspect of racism you are focused on - is it the legacy of racism in the family? in
the music industry? in literary stereotypes? Racism in its entirety is probably too much to
address in a short paper.
Your research question should be about a clearly identified "thing" - usually a literary text or
texts. Whatever the "thing" is you are asking about, you should include it in your question.
It's ok to start with a broad research question and then narrow it by applying the following
criteria:

  1. The more generative the question is, the better. We want questions that will require
      more thought and more research to answer.

 2. The more relevant the question is, the better. We want questions that will be relevant
      to a community of scholars.

 3. The more original the question is, the better. We want questions that haven't been
      asked before - or, if they have been asked before, we want a different answer from
      what we already have.

 4. The less obvious the answer to the question is, the better. We want questions that will
      shift our assumptions and help us learn something new.

Let's try applying these criteria to some possible research questions about "Sonny's Blues"
and see what happens.

                                                                                                                                Refining Your Research Question | 309
       First attempt: Does Baldwin's story, "Sonny's Blues," criticize racism?

It's fine to start the process of invention with a question as broad as this, but we should
check it against the criteria. Is the question generative? Not really because it can be
answered with a simple yes or no. Is it relevant? Sure (though most scholars would already
agree that the answer is yes). Is it original? No. Many scholars have written about Baldwin's
anti-racism. Is it obvious? Yes, it criticizes racism. So, we can only meet one out of four crite-
ria here and even then, it doesn't promise to add much knowledge to what's already writ-
ten. Let's try again by narrowing the question.

       Second attempt: Is Baldwin's critique of racism in "Sonny's Blues" different
       or more effective than critiques of racism in works by other
       African-American authors?

Notice that this question assumes that Baldwin's work does criticize racism, but asks a
more narrow question: how does he critique it and is his critique different or more effective
than others? Is it generative? Yes, it requires lots of additional thought and research since
the answer would have to include comparison/contrast with works by other African-Amer-
ican authors. Is it relevant to a community of scholars? Yes. Is it original? Maybe. We would
have to do some research into the scholarly conversation to get a sense of how original this
question is. For instance, there may already be critical work comparing Baldwin to other
African-American authors such as Zora Neal Hurston, Langston Hughes, Richard Wright,
Ralph Ellison, and others. Is the answer obvious? No (and that's a good thing). We would
need to do some work to get to an answer. We know that Baldwin commented about his
own writing.

        The bottom line is this: You write in order to change the world, knowing perfectly well
        that you probably can't, but also knowing that literature is indispensable to the world.
        The world changes according to the way people see it, and if you alter, even by a mil-
        limeter, the way people look at reality, then you can change it...If there is no moral
        question, there is no reason to write. I'm an old-fashioned writer and, despite the odds,
        I want to change the world.

Should we be satisfied with our second attempt at a research question? It depends. Maybe
it's not possible to know how effective Baldwin's writing is, but we can try. Was it more
effective for some audiences than it was for others? We could focus on black and white
audiences to start, but we could also ask about audiences in Baldwin's time and audiences
today. Did the story help change attitudes or policies? We would need to do historical
research to answer that question. Additionally, we would need to explain what we mean
by "different" - Is Baldwin's critique of racism in "Sonny's Blues" different or more effective

310 | Refining Your Research Question
than critiques of racism in works by other African-American authors? If we mean that Bald-
win applied different critical tools to understand racism, we would need to be able to define
what those critical tools are. If we mean he applied a different moral standard, we would
need to explain what it is. If we mean that Baldwin suggested different reforms, we need to
be able to describe them.

Let's assume, for now, that we can proceed with our second attempt at a research question.
However, given that other scholars may have already addressed these questions, we will
agree to modify them if we find more information that pushes us to do so. Notice the way
that one question leads to others. Here our question prompts additional questions that
must be answered before we can address the main question. The structure of questions
and their relationships looks like this:

  · Primary question: Is Baldwin's critique of racism in "Sonny's Blues" different or more
      effective than critiques of racism in works by other African-American authors?
         Secondary question: what do we mean by "different"?
               Tertiary question: Baldwin's use of critical tools?
               Tertiary question: Baldwin's application of moral standards?
               Tertiary question: Baldwin's suggested reforms?

         Secondary question: what do we mean by "effective"?
               Tertiary question: Do we need to examine different audiences to determine
                  whether the story is more effective with some than it is with others?
               Tertiary question: Did the story help change attitudes or policies?

We can begin a research project with a primary question such as this one, accepting that
we will need to answer secondary and tertiary questions to properly answer the primary
one. We should also be prepared to change our questions should our research point us in a
more productive direction.

Let's watch Jada discuss how this process worked for her:

       Key Quotes from the Video:
       The Invention Process:
       "James Baldwin's story dramatized something that felt very real to me. And it's
       one of the most beautiful stories written about music and family and brother-
       hood and living urban life ... And that prompted a little more of my research as
       well, because I started to think a lot about music and race. I started to think
       about addiction and race."
       Asking Critical Questions:
       "In James Baldwin's story I ended up coming to the conclusion and the thesis
       statement of race and class being inseparable. And the way that I got there was
       not just from reading his story, but also asking critical questions about my thesis
       statement ... once I kept asking questions, then I got to the general thesis of race
       and class are in fact, inseparable, and James Baldwin's story does show this
       through urbanization and music and addiction."

        The Invention Process

Jada's perspective on Baldwin, which includes Critical Race Theory, comes with "built-in"
questions, frames, and methodologies that she will refine throughout her research. These
built-in questions, frames, and methodologies come with the territory of studying Baldwin
and his writing, and may come from scholarship in related disciplines. For instance, Critical
Race Theory originated in legal studies and is still used within that discipline.
Critical Race Theory uses a variety of methodologies, such as interest convergence, inter­
sectional theory, radical critique of the law, social constructivism, standpoint epistemology,

and structural determinism. Let's look at a methodology - interest convergence - taken
from the work of Derrick Bell. Bell argued that the rights of black people don't advance
unless they converge with the interests of white people. With that methodology in mind,
we might ask whether the rights of black people in the story have advanced. Sonny's uncle
was killed decades earlier by a group of whites, and they got away with the killing. The story
doesn't provide enough information to say whether such a thing also occurred in the "pre­
sent day" setting of the story. But we could look at the history of the time (1957) to see how
often white people were held accountable for the killing of black people and how that com­
pared to earlier periods (such as the 1930s and 1940s). If we find that there was an improve­
ment over time, we might ask whether there are signs of interest convergence. The story
doesn't give us much to go on as there are no significant white characters. But at least we
now have a framework for asking more questions. and we can study the historical record to
get more information.

What does our literary work and our theory have to teach us that we don't already know?
Another example, "Sonny's Blues" provides a fictional lens through which we can under-
stand real events such as drug busts of jazz musicians in New York City. Fictionalized events
- such as Sonny's arrest - offer unique insights we don't get from studying statistics or
other types of analyses. Jada noted that even though the sociology paper she found pro-
vided a unique insight into Baldwin's work, it wasn't as visceral as the experience of reading
the story itself, especially its depiction of live jazz performance and other events she could
relate to on a more personal level. These two perspectives work in tandem: "Sonny's Blues"
dramatized something that felt very real to Jada, which prompted her to ask the types of
questions that will drive her research about Baldwin and "Sonny's Blues."

If we ask whether a literary work "reflects" some aspect of reality, we won't get very far. Most
literature can be said to reflect reality, at least in part. But literary authors don't just hold up
a mirror to the world. They construct a perspective on reality. We can ask what their per-
spective is, why they created it, how they created it, and what it says about other perspec-
tives. Questions about the author's perspective will get us much further than questions
about a literary work as a reflection of reality.

                                                                                                                                  Refining Your Research Question | 313
        Asking Critical Questions

Jada began with an overly broad idea about the intersection of race and class, which is
common at this stage. Then she began narrowing her topic into a more refined research
question by asking critical questions about how Baldwin dealt with these issues in the story.
Her focus moved more specifically to questions about urbanization, addiction, and jazz:
issues that are as relevant today as they were then, which is why Baldwin remains such a
touchstone for scholars in literature and related fields, such as sociology.
Is this topic still too broad for one research project? Jada's next step is to evaluate her ques-
tion to see if it can be further refined.

         Evaluating Your Research Question

          The spectrum of inquiry ranges from asking simple questions that depend
          upon basic recapitulation of knowledge to increasingly sophisticated abilities
          to refine research questions, use more advanced research methods, and

                                                                                                                           2

          explore more diverse disciplinary perspectives.

  The research question is your ticket to joining the scholarly conversation. It should help the
  reader to consider something that is either not well understood or that is currently misun-
  derstood within the current scholarly conversation. Note that your research question can
  be about either a work (or works) of literature or about the scholarly conversation related to
  a work of literature.

 Key Concepts

     · Does your question have a clear purpose?
     · Is your question clear, complex, and focused?
     · Is your answer arguable?
  Once you have developed a workable research question, the next step is to ensure that it's
  clear, complex, focused, and that the answer is arguable. This brings us back to the conver-
  sation analogy: Will others in your field - your audience - want to discuss your question?
  Will your findings add anything meaningful to the discourse and keep the conversation
  going?

   ating a Research Question

     Evaluating Your Research Question

            · Are you filling a gap or solving a problem in relation to the existing schol-
                arly discourse? (Either is fine - just know which direction your research is
                going).

            · Is your question leading or loaded? (If so, ask a question that doesn't
                assume the answer)

            · Does your question cover too much subject matter? If it is about the entire
                history of literature, it is likely too broad. (If so, narrow your question)

            · Is the scope of your project realistic and researchable within the given
                timeframe? Keep in mind that some kinds of studies - like comparisons
                between two authors - can take longer than others. (If not, keep refining
                your question)

            · Do you have the tools and/or technology needed to accomplish your task?
                (If not, keep refining your question)

            · Do you have access to the information and resources you will need? (If not,
                keep refining your question)

       Keep in mind the proper relationship between theory and literature. The theory
       is the lens through which critics look at literary works. So, it's better not to ask if
       we can see Freudian theory in James Baldwin's "Sonny's Blues." Ask instead how
       Freudian theory might help use understand the narrator's psychological state,
       as in this question: "Is the narrator more interested in protecting himself than he
       is in protecting his brother? Can Freudian theory help us better understand his
       motives?"

Let's watch Jada discuss how she evaluated the question she discussed in the last section:

Literature Research Strategies - Part 5 [3 min 19 sec]

                    One or more interactive elements has been excluded from this version of the

        gies2e/?p=183#oembed-1

       Key Quote from the Video:
       Is your question clear, complex and focused?
       "So, when thinking about my research question and my thesis statement ... one
       of the things that I tried to think about and I wish I would have thought about a
       little bit more, is, `is my thesis clear, complex and focused?' And then the other
       part of that is, `is it arguable?'
       It's important to have a complex research question and then also an arguable
       thesis statement, because once those two come together, you can have a more
       productive scholarly conversation ... And you can shift the conversation in a dif-
       ferent direction and bring a different light. Because as a writer, as a researcher,
       you're bringing forth more evidence and more complex and different ideas that
       you maybe weren't important before, weren't relevant before."

A key strategy is to avoid questions with easy `yes' or `no' answers such as "Did `Sonny's
Blues' contain autobiographical elements?" Probably yes. A more interesting question
might be to ask how or why Baldwin worked autobiographical elements into "Sonny's
Blues." Questions that can be answered with a simple yes or no generally end the discus-
sion, and the goal of your research should be to continue the discussion by making an
arguable claim. At the time Jada wrote her paper, her research question centered around
why James Baldwin and "Sonny's Blues" are still relevant today. However, now that we've
been through the refining and evaluation process, we see that she could further narrow
her question to focus on topics such as as urbanization, race, and addiction. For instance,
how did urbanization after World War II affect the lives of black people? Did changes in
urban life lead to more addiction among black people? What does Baldwin's story teach us
about these issues and what can we learn from them about urbanization, race, and addic-
tion today?

As we discussed in the Scholarship as Conversation section, the problems addressed by

                                                                                                                              Evaluating Your Research Question | 319
  Baldwin are largely unresolved; such unresolved problems continue to engage researchers
  from many fields. Jada could expand on what she started here by adding her personal per-
  spective to her research in literature and sociology. Further work can be done by posing
  questions about the scholarly literature on Baldwin. For instance, Emmanual S. Nelson

                                                                                                                                                3

  writes about the search for self-identity in Baldwin's writing. Nelson writes, "Baldwin sug-
  gests that one can achieve a genuine and liberating sense of self only through complete
  acceptance of one's self, through loving commitment to another, and through identifi-
  cation with one's community." When that community is despised by the majority, then
  identifying with that community can produce "anguish" and "despair." We might ask what
  happens when people resist identifying with their community. Do they engage in more
  self-destructing behaviors? To ask such questions is to follow up on the scholarly conversa-
  tion put forth by Nelson. When we ask a question such as this, we address both Baldwin
  and Nelson in our research.

  Move beyond your first question by asking a second question, a third question, and so
  on. The answer to your first question will have further implications; if X (is true), then Y (is
  implied). Your second question might be to ask about these implications. For instance, your
  first question might be about categories, such as categories of music in Baldwin's story.
  Your second question can be about the function, history, and relationships of music in these
  categories. Your third question might be about Baldwin's personal experience with these
  categories of music. Your fourth might be about the role these categories of music play in
  his story. Your fifth might be about the legacy of these music categories within black cul-
  ture today. We can read about the uneasy relationship between black gospel music and
  more secular forms such as blues and jazz. How does this uneasiness play out in Baldwin's
  life? In the story? In black culture today?

  If you are still unsure if your question is refined enough, Wendy Belcher, author of Writing
  Your Journal Article in 12 Weeks, suggests talking through your research question with a
  friend or advisor. She also suggests writing an abstract and sending it to a friend or advisor
  for review. Even when an abstract is not required for your assignment, consider writing one
  and soliciting feedback as Belcher suggests. Feedback can be invaluable since at this point
  you are looking for your moment to jump into the conversation.

  In the "Back Matter" of this book, you will find a page titled "Rubrics." In that page, we pro-
  vide a rubric for the research question.

INFERENTIAL AND CRITICAL
PROCESS

324 | Chapter 10: Research as an Inferential and Critical Process
Chapter 10 Objectives

BARRY MAUER AND JOHN VENECEK

Objectives

Much of this chapter deals with constructing cohesive arguments. In "Research as an Infer-
ential and Critical Process," we discuss how inferences allow us to move from one thought
to another; they are the pathways by which thinking occurs.
In "Relating the Conceptual and the Concrete," we return to our analogy between argu-
mentative writing and law by focusing on how to use deductive logic to make your case.
A good detective or lawyer alternates between the conceptual and concrete, just as you
should in your research project. Deductive logic uses syllogisms, which are three-part struc-
tures that tell us what to think about a specific case (person, place, thing, group, event, etc.).

Our first task for this chapter is to select a type of literature review. We will be learning about
the different kinds and why you might choose one over another. The second task is to cre-

                                                                                                                                                  Chapter 10 Objectives | 325
ate a literature review by synthesizing the materials we collected earlier using library and
Google Scholar searches, and for which we produced an annotated bibliography.

326 | Chapter 10 Objectives
        Learning Objectives

Keep the detective analogy in mind as you work through this chapter. Much like a
detective, researchers use deductive, inductive, and abductive logic to make sense
of their material. The most important lessons you will learn are to:

     · ask critical questions
     · note claims that follow from a given proposition (or statement of facts)
     · synthesize your research into a literature review

        Inferences

In Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's story, "The Blue Carbuncle," Sherlock Holmes asks Watson:
        "What can you gather yourself as to the individuality of the man who has worn this
        article?"
        "I can see nothing," said I, handing it back to my friend.

328 | Research as an Inferential and Critical Process
        "On the contrary, Watson, you can see everything. You fail, however, to reason from
        what you see. You are too timid in drawing your inferences."
Without inferences, there is no thinking, critical or otherwise. Inferences allow us to move
from one thought to another; they are the pathways by which thinking occurs. To think
inferentially is to ask questions about pieces of information. What does this information tell
us? Does it lead us to a hypothesis? Does it support our hypothesis or challenge it? If the
information is true, what other claims follow logically from it? What additional knowledge
is required to make sense of the information?
Thinking critically requires us to restrict ourselves to allowable inferences. For instance, we
can observe that the surface of the moon is not smooth but appears to have holes in it.
We might conclude that it is made of Swiss cheese. Science would reject this inference, but
poetry would allow it. We could say that each area of knowledge has its own inference rules,
just like each game has different rules of play.

                                                                                                              Research as an Inferential and Critical Process | 329
William Parkhurst offers an amusing discussion of Monty Python's famous scene mocking
the faulty reasoning of witch trials. Non-allowable inferences are called fallacies. In some
settings, logical fallacies lead to injustices (like in the witch trials), while in others they may
lead to laughter (like in Monty Python). In humor, logical fallacies are ok. In trials, they are
not.

        Reasoning

Reasoning is the process of putting inferences together. There are many kinds of reasoning;
one of the common, called abductive reasoning, involves reasoning about causation. If we
see a house on fire, we reason that there must have been a cause. Was it an accident or was

330 | Research as an Inferential and Critical Process
the fire set intentionally? Without more information, we are merely speculating, or reason-
ing with insufficient information.
A common mistake in abductive reasoning is to assume that correlation equals causation.
Correlation means that two things merely appear together. For example, if we see a book
of matches at the scene of a fire, we might assume that the matches were used to start
the fire. Yet the appearance of the matches merely correlates with the appearance of the
fire. Unless we can rule out other causes, we can't conclude with any certainty that these
matches caused the fire. Similarly, if we discover that two authors met once, we do not have
enough information to conclude that a literary work written by one author was intended
as a response to the other author. We can speculate, but we must indicate that it is only a
speculation.
Some types of reasoning are very loose and allow multiple associations. Let's take a hypo-
thetical car advertisement in which a shiny new car is parked in the middle of a football
field while a male peacock walks around it with its colorful tail fanned out. The peacock is
eye-catching and football is about toughness; we associate both with the car. We might
make any number of inferences from this scene, such as that the car is supposed to impress
and intimidate (which is what male peacocks do with their display) and that it will grant the
car's future owner the same powers. Such associative reasoning can help us understand
metaphors and allusions in literary works.

       Prototype, Template, and Procedural Knowledge

We build inferences from our knowledge of how the world works. This knowledge can be
divided into types: prototype, template, and procedural.

  1. Prototype knowledge tells us what category or class something belongs to; it can help
      us relate a literary work to a genre, period, or movement.

 2. Template knowledge is about patterns and structures (such as the different pieces on
      a chess board); in the study of literature, we bring knowledge of templates such as
      narrative structures and symbolic systems.

                                                                                                              Research as an Inferential and Critical Process | 331
 3. Procedural knowledge is about how a process (like eating or riding a bicycle) is done;
      in literary studies, procedural knowledge can help us understand the composition of a
      work, the distribution process, the reading process, interpretation, and so on.

When we are trying to understand new information, we usually bring prototype, template,
and procedural forms of knowledge together with the new information. For example,
in writing about "Sonny's Blues," we need to know that segregation existed in America
and separated black and white communities (and that we are still living in the legacy
of that separation). Our knowledge about the period of official segregation is prototype
knowledge. We can make sense of the relationship between the narrator and his brother
using template knowledge. Procedural knowledge can help us understand the causes and
effects of addiction.
Writing a research paper involves problem solving (research question being the problem).
You have to relate the information in the problem (the research question) with the research
material you find -- and the relevant prototype, template, and procedural knowledge --
before making your inferences. If you don't follow this process, you won't be able to solve
the problem successfully (unless you just make a lucky guess -- but even then you still have
to support your argument!).
Your paper should demonstrate to your reader how you made your inferences; by doing so,
you are providing a warrant for your claims by explaining how you move from one propo-
sition to another. Your reader should be able to clearly explain to a third person how you
reached your conclusion.

       Ideology

Keep in mind that prototype, template, and procedural knowledge are culturally and his-
torically specific and that they represent the "ideology" of a culture. In other words, this
knowledge is not necessarily objective reality. It contains within it a whole set of assump-
tions about how the world works and these assumptions may be wrong or may serve the
interests of one group at the expense of another. For example, race, class, nationality, pro-

332 | Research as an Inferential and Critical Process
fession, gender, and sexual identity can be understood in terms of prototype, template, and
procedural knowledge, but this knowledge may be based on outdated and oppressive ways
of thinking such as crude stereotypes. We must use prototype, template, and procedural
knowledge to produce a research project, but should be aware that all such knowledge
deserves scrutiny.
Literary theories, such as feminist, psychoanalytic, new historical, Marxist, etc. provide their
own versions of prototype, template, and procedural knowledge. Such knowledge is also
subject to scrutiny, but scholars have recognized much of it as valuable for making infer-
ences within the field of literary studies. When writing a literary studies research paper, you
should familiarize yourself with the prototype, template, and procedural knowledge related
to your chosen theory.

       Relating the Conceptual and Concrete

Just as a lawyer in a courtroom alternates between presenting legal principles (concepts)
and a specific case (concrete facts), you need to alternate between the conceptual and
concrete when you present your argument to readers. Generally, researchers use deductive
reasoning to make their case to their readers. Deductive reasoning uses syllogisms that tell
us what to think about a particular case. In deductive logic you need to prove both premises
are true and prove that the conclusion must follow from the premises.

                                                                                                                         Relating the Conceptual and Concrete | 335
            Example

            A syllogism is
                 1. [Major premise - conceptual] The Black Aesthetic is defined as litera­
                     ture or art that seeks to remember history, define identity, gain recog­
                     nition, and celebrate blackness;
                2. [Minor premise - concrete] `Sonny's Blues' seeks to remember history,
                     define identity, gain recognition, and celebrate blackness;
                3. [Conclusion] Therefore, `Sonny's Blues' is an example of the Black Aes­
                     thetic.

The major premise is about a broad concept (the Black Aesthetic) and its general principles
and purposes. The minor premise is concrete since it is about a particular case: James Bald-
win's story "Sonny's Blues." The conclusion results from applying the conceptual principle
to the concrete case.
Our sample syllogism is not very good, however, since it tells us something that we already
knew or could discover easily. We can make a better argument by considering a specific
problem. Addiction is one of the themes in "Sonny's Blues." A relevant research question
might be: "How does the Black Aesthetic help us to understand or solve the problem of
addiction?" The thesis, or answer, might have something to do with figuring out how the
loss of history, identity, recognition, and celebrations of blackness draws some black peo-
ple into addiction and how the restoration of those things might help prevent addiction or
help addicts recover.
If we pursue this line of inquiry, we can keep our syllogism above, but we need to add a new
one to it:

336 | Relating the Conceptual and Concrete
            Example

                 1. [Major Premise] Sometimes addiction is a response to anomie, which
                     Emile Durkheim conceptualized to mean rootlessness, alienation, and
                     a lack of belonging.

                2. [Minor Premise] Black people (such as Sonny) have experienced
                     anomie because they have lost much of their history and identity to
                     racism.

                3. [Conclusion] Therefore, black people (such as Sonny) are more likely to
                     turn to addiction.

Here you need to define key concepts and show how they apply to the particular case of
Sonny. You need to support your major premise; how strong is the theory that anomie is a
cause of addiction? You also have to explain what "sometimes" and "more likely" mean; are
there statistics you can find?

When we find data that supports a major premise, we are using inductive reasoning. The
deductive syllogism we discussed earlier moved from conceptual principle (about addic-
tion and anomie) to a concrete case (Sonny's experiences with anomie as a result of racism).
The inductive argument moves the opposite way; it gathers concrete cases from the real
world (found in scientific studies) to see if there is a strong relationship between addic-
tion and anomie, and between anomie and racism. If we can support our premises through
inductive reasoning, then our deductive argument is more secure.

But you should expect pushback against your argument. For instance, in "Sonny's Blues,"
Sonny plays music that is integral to black history and identity, so has he really lost a sense
of black history and identity? It is Sonny's non-addicted brother, our narrator, who realizes
that he, much more than Sonny, has lost a sense of black history and identity. Given this
information, should we give up on our argument? Not necessarily! Sonny's music may not
solve the problem of his addiction, but it may keep him from getting worse. The narra-
tor, though not an addict, may be suffering in other ways as a result of his loss of black

                                                                                                                         Relating the Conceptual and Concrete | 337
  history and identity. Carefully assess the scientific, historical, and textual evidence to make
  your argument.

  An abductive argument is about the causal relationships of events. It is similar to the rea-
  soning that detectives and doctors use every day when they see a result (evidence of crime
  or illness) and reason backwards to determine its causes. The deductive argument about
  Sonny' addiction discussed above could be reframed as an abductive argument, reasoning
  from results to causes. What caused Sonny's addiction? Were there multiple factors? Often
  with abductive arguments we need to gather more evidence to make sure we have identi-
  fied the correct causes.

  Conductive reasoning is associative logic based on resemblance, puns, homonyms, and
  images. It explains how we make associations, such as the way people get nicknames. A
  famous nickname, used in "Sonny's Blues," is the name "Bird," referring to jazz musician
  Charlie Parker. How did Parker get the name "Bird"? There are many theories:

                 The origin stories about his nickname Yardbird (usually shortened to
                 Bird) include that it derived from a cousin mispronouncing his name as
                 "Yarlie", and that it was conferred by a musician after Parker rescued a
                 chicken that had been struck by a car and then had it cooked for dinner.
                 The most convincing explanation is the one provided by trombonist
                 Clyde Bernhardt, in his autobiography I Remember. "Charlie told me he
                 got the name `Yardbird' because he was crazy about eating chicken:
                 fried, baked, boiled, stewed, anything. Down there in the South, all chick-

                                                                                    1

                 ens are called yardbirds."

  A research paper into "Sonny's Blues" might examine the ways in which conductive reason-

                                                                                                               2

         The Literature Review

  Conducting a literary studies research project involves time and effort, with much of it
  going towards the development of a literature review. A literature review synthesizes the
  materials you gathered for your annotated bibliography and provides the conceptual
  "map" in which you will position your argument. It sets your reader up to understand the
  scholarly conversation about your research problem. The literature review might fill several
  pages of your research paper and usually appears soon after an introduction but before you
  present your detailed argument.

  A literature review provides your audience with an overview of the available research about
  your area(s) of study, including the literary work, your theory, and methodology. The litera-
  ture review demonstrates to the reader how these scholarly discussions have changed over
  time, and it allows you to position your research in relation to research that has come before
  yours. Your aim is to present the discussion up to this point. Depending on the nature of
  the assignment, you may also include your critical commentary on prior research, noting
  among this material the weaker and stronger arguments, breakthroughs and dead ends,
  blind spots and opportunities, the invention of key terms and methods, mistakes as well as
  misreadings, and so on.

  Once you have gathered the research materials you need for your literature review, you
  have another task: conducting an analysis on the research to see where your original con-
  tribution fits into the scholarly conversation. As the saying goes, "we are standing on the
  shoulders of giants." Your job is to show a portrait of these giants to your audience, and
  to show how your work relates to the portrait. On many scholarly topics, literature reviews
  already exist. You may refer to such existing reviews within your own, indicating any materi-
  als might have been overlooked, new developments that have arisen since the publication
  of the existing literature review, and new perspectives or insights you have about the mate-
  rials.

  Some beginning researchers try to tear down the work of other researchers in an effort to
  make their own work look good by comparison. It rarely works. First, it tends to make your
  audience skeptical of your claims. Second, it ignores the fact that even the mistakes, blind
  spots, and failures of other researchers contribute something to our knowledge. Albert Ein-

stein didn't disrespect Sir Isaac Newton by saying Newton's theory of space was wrong
and terrible and that Einstein's own theory was great by comparison. He built upon New-
ton's work, showing how it could be improved. If, however, a researcher willfully sets out
to deceive or distort or to tear down the work of other scholars without good reason, then
their work does not deserve such deference.
Most literature reviews appear after the introduction. It presents your reader with relevant
information about the scholarly discussion up to now. Later in your paper, you discuss your
contribution. Before you begin work on your literature review, let's discuss what we mean
by "literature"; understand the purpose and scope of the review; establish criteria for select-
ing, organizing, and interpreting your findings; and discuss how to connect your findings
to your research question.

       What is the Purpose of the Review?

Many students seek to "find sources that agree with my claim or idea." That approach is too
narrow, in our view. If we use such an approach, we may get the following results:

  1. Because we can find sources that agree with almost any claim, readers will wonder
      whether your claims are weak and the sources are cherry picked.

 2. While literary scholars sometimes cite authorities to support their claims, they don't
      rely only on authority. They respect authority, but not too much. Your own claims need
      to rely more on evidence (from the literary text, historical and biographical informa-
      tion), and your critical and creative reasoning skills.

 3. Scholarship is a conversation; thus, the goal is less about finding agreement and more
      about joining the conversation with the aim of making a valuable contribution to the
      discussion.

The literature review provides your reader with an overview of the existing research about
your topic or problem. It provides the context necessary for your reader to catch up with the
scholarly conversation and then to appreciate the value of your contribution to it. The lit-

342 | Writing the Literature Review
erature review sharpens the focus of your research and demonstrates your knowledge and
understanding of the scholarly conversation around your topic, which, in turn, helps estab-
lish your credibility as a researcher.
Creating the literature review involves more than gathering citations. It is a qualitative
process through which you will discover what is already known about your topic, and iden-
tify the key authorities, methods, and theoretical foundations, so you can begin to position
your contributions within the scholarly conversation.

       What is the Scope of the Review?

Defining the scope of your review will also help you establish criteria to determine the rel-
evance of the sources you are finding. At this stage, you are not reading in-depth; instead,
you are skimming through what has already been published and identifying the major
concepts, theories, methodologies, and methods present within these published works.
You should also be identifying connections, tensions, and contradictions within the already
published works of your topic or problem. This involves building on the knowledge of others
and understanding what methods, measures, and models we have inherited from previous
researchers in our field.

         Strategies for Getting Started

  A literature review helps your reader understand the relationship of your research project
  to the work of other scholars. It covers the existing knowledge about a problem, and allows
  you to show the relevance/significance of your contribution to the discussion. Your reader
  may or may not have read scholarly literature about the theories, methodologies, and liter-
  ary works you are discussing. But they want to know that you have read it and have thought
  about it. Your literature review provides not only an overview of the existing scholarship for
  readers; it also offers your perspective on it.
  Begin your work on the literature review by synthesizing the various sources in your anno­
  tated bibliography.

          For advice on Synthesizing Sources, consider the following from The Purdue

          Online Writing Lab:
          Note that synthesizing is not the same as summarizing.

               · A summary restates the information in one or more sources without pro-
                  viding new insight or reaching new conclusions.

               · A synthesis draws on multiple sources to reach a broader conclusion.
               · Don't force a relationship between sources if there isn't one. Not all of your

                  sources have to complement one another.
               · Do your best to highlight the relationships between sources in very clear

                  ways.
               · Don't ignore any outliers in your research. It's important to take note of

                every perspective (even those that disagree with your broader conclu-
                sions).

Not all humanities research projects contain literature reviews, but many do. Keep in mind
that the type of literature review you choose (see list below) pertains to the secondary
research - other scholarly sources - and not to the primary literary work. For instance, a
literature review about Kate Chopin's writing will be your thoughts about the scholarship
on Chopin and not about Chopin's text itself. You are summarizing what you see in the
scholarly literature about Chopin's writing. The literature review puts you in the position
of authority not just on Chopin's writing but on the scholarship about her writing. You are
seeking to understand what scholars have said about her work. Scholars might belong to
different schools of thought (psychoanalytic, feminist, Marxist, etc.). They might make dif­
ferent arguments about Chopin. They might use different methodological approaches.
If your research involves two or more theories, such as psychology and genre studies, you
may need to create multiple literature reviews, one for each theory or methodology. If the
theories overlap with each other significantly (i.e., Marxism and Cultural Studies), you may
combine them. Your literature review need not include everything about the subject area
- you would need to write a book to cover a single theory - but only those concepts and
methods that are most relevant to your research problem.

     Factors to Consider When Developing Your Literature
     Review

            · Determine the Scope: How broad or narrow should your literature review
                be? You may want to focus on recent scholarship only, or on a particular
                school of thought in the literature. Your scope is determined by your pur-
                pose; what is it you aim to achieve with your research?

                                                                                                                                      Writing the Literature Review | 345
            · Establish Criteria: We discussed the importance of defining the purpose
                and scope of your review on the previous page, but it's worth reviewing
                here as well. This step will help you establish important criteria and focus
                your searching. For example, how many sources will you need? What types
                of sources (primary, secondary, statistics, media)? Is currency important?
                Do you know who the prominent authors or theorists are in your subject
                area? Take some time to map out these or other important factors before
                you begin searching journals and databases.

            · Consider Your Audience: Unlike a work cited page or an annotated bibli-
                ography, both of which are lists of sources, a literature review is essayistic
                and can be considered a precursor to your final paper. Therefore, it should
                be written in your own voice, and it should be geared toward a specific
                audience. Considering your audience during this early stage will help focus
                your final paper as well.

            · Find Models: We'll discuss the different types of literature reviews and how
                to locate examples in the section below. However, even if you're undecided
                about what type of review will work best for you, you may want to review
                some example literature reviews to get a sense of what they look like
                before you begin your own.

One piece of advice before starting: look for existing literature reviews on your area of schol-
arship. You can build on the work that other scholars have put into reviewing the scholarly
literature. There's no need to completely "reinvent the wheel" if some of the work is already
done.
Scholars sometimes publish "stand-alone" literature reviews that are not part of a larger
work; such literature reviews are valuable contributions to the field, as they summarize the
state of knowledge for other scholars.

346 | Writing the Literature Review
        Types of Literature Reviews

Maria J. Grant and Andrew Booth's "A Typology of Reviews" identifies 14 distinct types of lit-
erature reviews. Further, the UCLA library created a chart to complement the article and for
easy comparison of those 14 types of reviews. This section provides a brief summary of the
most common literature reviews. For a more complete analysis, please see the full article
and the chart.
To choose the most appropriate structure, put yourself in your reader's shoes and think
through their need for information. The literature review is about providing context for your
contribution. How much context do people need? Keep it to the minimum necessary; com-
pressing a lot of information into a small amount of text is a must.
These structures are not meant to be straightjackets but tools to help you organize your
research. If you find that the tool is working, then keep using it. If not, switch tools or modify
the one you are using. Keep in mind that the types of literature reviews are just differ-
ent ways of organizing information. So, you can discuss literary trends without organizing
your review of secondary literature by trend; your discussion can be organized by theory or
theme, for examples. In our literature reviews, we are not recounting other scholars' argu-
ments at length but merely providing key concepts so we can summarize the discussion
so far and position our own claims. You don't have to adhere strictly to one structure or
another. They are just organizing tools that help you manage your material (and help your
reader make sense of it).

     Types of Reviews

            · Traditional or narrative reviews: This approach will generate a compre-

                                                                                                                                      Writing the Literature Review | 347
                hensive, critical analysis of the published research on your topic. However,
                rather than merely compiling as many sources as possible, use this
                approach to establish a theoretical framework for your paper, establish
                trends, and identify gaps in the research. This process should bring your
                research question into clearer focus and help define a thesis that you will
                argue for in your paper. This is perhaps the most common and general
                type of literature review. The examples listed below are all designed to
                serve a more specific purpose.
            · Argumentative: The purpose of an argumentative literature review is to
                select sources for the purpose of supporting or refuting a specific claim.
                While this type of review can help the author make a strong case for or
                against an issue, they can also be prone to claims of bias. Later in this text-
                book, we will read about the distinction between warranted and unwar­
                ranted bias. One is ok and the other is not.
            · Chronological: A chronological review is used when the author wants to
                demonstrate the progression of how a theory, methodology, or issue has
                progressed over time. This method is most effective when there is a clear
                chronological path to the research about a specific historical event or
                trend as opposed to a more recursive theoretical concept.
            · By trend: This is similar to the chronological approach except it focuses on
                clearly-defined trends rather than date ranges. This would be most appro-
                priate if you want to illustrate changing perspectives or attitudes about a
                given issue when specific date ranges are less important than the ebb and
                flow of the trend.
            · Thematic: In this type of literature review, the author will select specific
                themes that he or she feels are important to understanding a larger topic
                or concept. Then, the author will organize the sources around those
                themes, which are often based on relevance or importance. The value of
                this method is that the process of organizing the review by theme is simi-
                lar to constructing an argument. This can help the author see how
                resources connect to each other and determine how as well as why spe-
                cific sources support their thesis.
            · Theoretical: The goal of this type of review is to examine how theory has
                shaped the research on a given topic. It establishes existing theoretical
                models, their connections, and how extensively they have been developed

348 | Writing the Literature Review
                in the published research. For example, Jada applied critical race theory to
                her analysis of Sonny's Blues, but she might also consider conducting a
                more comprehensive review of other theoretical frameworks such as femi-
                nism, Marxism, or postmodernism. Doing so could provide insight into
                alternate readings and help her identify theoretical gaps such as unex-
                plored or under-developed approaches to Baldwin's work.
            · Methodological: The approach focuses on the various methodologies used
                by researchers in a specific area rather than an analysis of their findings. In
                this case, you would create a framework of approaches to data collection
                related to your topic or research question. This is perhaps more common
                in education or the social and hard sciences where published research
                often includes a methods section, but it is sometimes appropriate for the
                digital humanities as well.
            · Scoping: The aim of a scoping review is to provide a comprehensive
                overview or map of the published research or evidence related to a
                research question. This might be considered a prelude to a systematic
                review that would take the scoping review one step further toward
                answering a clearly defined research question. See below for more details.
            · Systematic: The systematic review is most appropriate when you have a
                clearly-defined research question and have established criteria for the
                types of sources you need. In this way, the systematic review is less
                exploratory than other types of reviews. Rather, it is comprehensive, strate-
                gic, and focused on answering a specific research question. For this rea-
                son, the systematic review is more common in the health and social
                sciences, where comprehensiveness is more important. Literature reviews
                in the Humanities are not usually exhaustive but tend to show only the
                most representative or salient developments in the scholarship.
            · Meta-analysis: Does your research deal with statistics or large amounts of
                data? If so, then a meta-analysis might be best for you rather than provid-
                ing a critical review, the meta-analysis will summarize and synthesize the
                results of numerous studies that involve statistics or data to provide a
                more comprehensive picture than would be possible from just one study.

An argumentative literature review presents and takes sides in scholarly arguments about
the literary work. It makes arguments about other scholars' work. It does not necessarily

                                                                                                                                      Writing the Literature Review | 349
involve a claim that the literary work is itself making an argument. Likewise, a chronological
literature review presents the scholarly literature in chronological order.
You don't need to keep strictly to one type. Scholars often combine features from various
types of literature reviews. A sample review that combines the follow types -

  · Argumentative
  · Thematic
  · Theoretical
  · Methodological
  · Scoping
- is the excellent work of Eiranen, Reetta, Mari Hatavara, Ville Kivimäki, Maria Mäkelä & Raisa

tory and Narratology," Scandinavian Journal of History, 47:1, 1-15

        Composition Guidelines

When writing your literature review, please follow these pointers:
  · Conduct systematic searches
  · Use Evidence
  · Be Selective
  · Use Quotes Sparingly
  · Summarize & Synthesize
  · Use Caution when Paraphrasing
  · Use Your Own Voice

350 | Writing the Literature Review
Advice from James Mason University's "Literature Reviews: An
Overview"

A note on synthesizing: Don't make the common mistake of summarizing indi-
vidual studies or articles one after the other. The goal is to synthesize -- that is,
to make observations about groups of studies. Synthesis often uses language
like this:

     · Much of the literature on [topic x] focuses on [major themes].
     · In recent years, researchers have begun investigating [facets a, b, and c] of

        [topic x].
     · The studies in this review of [topic x] confirm / suggest / call into question /

        support [idea / practice / finding / method / theory / guideline y].

                                                                                                                            Writing the Literature Review | 351
               · In the reviewed studies [variable x] was generally associated with higher /
                  lower rates of [outcome y].

               · A limitation of some / most / all of these studies is [y].

          sity.

         Structure of a literature review4

              1. Problematization: The 2 to 3 pages of problematization are a distinct, iter-
                  ative, step. It may take doing such a statement a few times before moving
                  forward to writing the actual paper.

              2. Search: Write down your keyword sets, your updated keyword sets, and
                  databases. It is perfectly within a reviewer's rights to ask for these details.

              3. Summary: Really getting to know major themes requires some annotation
                  of articles. You want to identify core papers and themes and write about
                  them. This helps you really learn the material. [ChatGPT or Wikipedia are
                  no substitute for deep engagement with a paper.]

             4. Argument: Either outline or create a slide deck that help you express the
                  arguments in your paper. Read them out loud. Have friends look at them.
                  Present them. [Every literature review has an argument. If not, it's a sum-
                  mary. A summary does not merit publication in a top outlet.]

              5. Unpacking: Once you've nailed the short pitch, unpack the full argument.
                  [ a) Take time in each major section to map out a) the argument, b) the
                  supporting evidence, and the takeaway.
                  b) Take those major sections, reconcile them, make sure they don't over-

                lap, then move on to writing.
                c) Sketch out the paper's sections, tables, figures, and appendices.]
           6. Writing: Writing is the easy part. You can always put words to the screen.
                [Revising and improving is hard. Make time to write every day. Improving
                requires feedback. Find a writing partner to give feedback. Create your
                tables and figures. Write to them. Make sure the words in the paper align
                to the visuals.]
           7. Communicate: When the paper is done, go back and create a paper pre-
                sentation. [I do this for the papers that I'm most serious about. The act of
                storyboarding helps me sort out the small pieces of the story that don't fit
                together. If I really want it to succeed, I present it. The act of presenting
                helps me get it right. My best papers sometimes take seven or eight pre-
                sentations to get it right. Then I return to the paper and fine tune it. Only
                then, does it have a shot at a top outlet.]

        How to Locate Reviews by Discipline

Literature reviews can be published as part of a scholarly article, often after the introduction
and sometimes with a header, but they can also be published as a standalone essay. To find
examples of what reviews look like in your discipline, choose an appropriate subject data-
base (such as MLA for literary criticism) and conduct a keyword search with the term "Liter-
ature Review" added in quotes:
Lit review_1.PNG

                                                                                                                                      Writing the Literature Review | 353
 This search yields four results:

Not only do these examples demonstrate how to structure different types of literature
reviews, but some offer insights into trends and directions for future research. In the next
section, we'll take a closer look at some reading strategies to help guide you through this
process.
Since scholars already have produced literature reviews on various scholarly conversations,
you don't always need to "reinvent the wheel" (start a literature review from nothing). You
can find a published literature review and update it or amend it; scholars do that all the
time. However, you must properly cite work you incorporate from others.

Objectives

Many novice researchers struggle with crafting an effective thesis statement. We walk you
through the steps of writing a good thesis statement and provide examples of thesis state-
ments gone wrong. We also discuss an underrated skill: composing a title.
From there we discuss the importance of defining your terms. In "Scholarship as Con-
versation," we explain how to avoid the "hit and run" citation style in which quotes are
strung together with little or no context. We previously emphasized the importance of
using strategic keywords in your research, but part of your job as a writer is to define and
contextualize those terms for your audience. Some terms may have multiple meanings; the
definitions you provide will allow your audience to know how you understand them.

                                                                                                                                                   Chapter 11 Objectives | 359

         Positing a Thesis Statement

  We posit the thesis statement as part of a scholarly discussion. To posit is to put something
  - in this case an argumentative claim - in place, to take up a position in relation to a
  research question. A thesis statement still in development is called a hypothesis. Once a
  hypothesis has been sufficiently framed and tested, using critical thinking skills, we can
  call it a thesis statement. We frame a thesis statement by putting it in relation to a body
  of knowledge (such as the study of narrative, of race and gender, of environment, etc.), and

1. In the "Back Matter" of this book, you will find a page titled "Rubrics." On that page, we provide a rubric for Posit­
  ing a Thesis Statement.
  362 | Positing a Thesis Statement
we test a thesis statement by trying to falsify it; in other words, we see if our thesis state-
ment is strong enough to withstand challenges. These challenges include evidence that
doesn't seem to fit the claim, reasoning that doesn't seem to add up, or alternative claims
that might better answer our research question.

For discussion purposes, let's pose this research question about James Baldwin's "Sonny's
Blues"; is the high quality of Sonny's music due mostly to his suffering? A conventional
answer might be yes - because many great artists have suffered for their art. Examples
include Janice Joplin, John Coltrane, John Lennon, Billie Holiday, and Jimi Hendrix. We
might come to the conclusion that these artists are great because they were traumatized
and became addicted to drugs. The narrator of "Sonny's Blues" describes hearing Sonny
play and what he hears is Sonny's painful history through his music:

        I heard what he had gone through, and would continue to go through until he came
        to rest in earth. He had made it his: that long line, of which we knew only Mama and
        Daddy. And he was giving it back, as everything must be given back, so that, passing
        through death, it can live forever. I saw my mother's face again, and felt, for the first
        time, how the stones of the road she had walked on must have bruised her feet. I saw
        the moonlit road where my father's brother died.

There's a famous quote by Sonnys' hero, Charlie Parker: "`If you don't live it, it won't come
out of your horn." Parker's words have been interpreted by many aspiring musicians to
mean that you should suffer for your art, and that if you don't suffer then your art will be
inauthentic. But we may need to make some important distinctions before settling on the
thesis that suffering causes high quality art. First, we might say that a dead artist is no
longer an artist at all and that trauma and addiction can lead to death. So, clearly not all
trauma and addiction lead to good art. Some of it leads to death. Beyond that, as was the
case with Charlie Parker himself, he became a great musician because he practiced for up
to 15 hours a day for three or four years! Drugs didn't cause him to play so well; the drugs
interfered with his art! Parker's trauma and addiction eventually reached a point where his
music suffered; he would be so "out of it" sometimes that he couldn't play.

Our research might lead us to the work of Mihalyi Csikszentmihalyi, whose book Creativity
included studies of the most creative people - in all areas, including the arts - and con-
cluded that they tend to be happier and more well-adjusted than the average person. Csik-
szentmihalyi's study throws a wrench into the common stereotype of the suffering artist.
The artist usually experiences joy in their work, not suffering.

With these objections in mind, we might amend our thesis statement to say that while suf-
fering and addiction don't cause artists to be great, but that great artists can transform
their suffering and addiction into art, turning adversity into a resource for growth. That

                                                                                                                                         Positing a Thesis Statement | 363
claim makes a good thesis statement! It tells us that there is a relationship between suffer-
ing and art, but it's not what most people think.

We might imagine a different argument; that being a great artist requires openness, a vul-
nerable state in which you experience tremendous joy and pain as well as the need to share
it with others. Sonny says:

        It's terrible sometimes, inside . . . that's what's the trouble. You walk these streets, black
        and funky and cold, and there's not really a living ass to talk to, and there's nothing
        shaking, and there's no way of getting it out- that storm inside. You can't talk it and
        you can't make love with it, and when you finally try to get with it and play it, you real-
        ize nobody's listening. So you've got to listen. You got to find a way to listen.

Openness can be unbearable for long periods of time, so artists turn to drugs to shut down.
When his brother challenges Sonny on his drug use, Sonny explains: "There's no way not to
suffer. But you try all kinds of ways to keep from drowning in it, to keep on top of it, and to
make it seem-well, like you. Like you did something, all right, and now you're suffering for
it. You know?"

Maybe our thesis is that artists have a symbiotic relationship with openness that makes
them prone to drug use as a coping mechanism. Are we satisfied yet? Probably not. We
want to ask if this is really true by finding research about the subject. Maybe it's true in
some cases and not others. If it is true, or mostly true, we want to keep pushing by turning
our conclusion into a premise and asking what additional conclusion we can draw from it.

To develop a good thesis statement is to have a breakthrough - an epiphany (a flash
understanding) - that changes our own thinking. We want to pay close attention to such
moments and reflect on them carefully. Epiphanies are usually rare, but they are the most
valuable things that artists and scholars can produce. We want more of them! One way to
get more of them is to observe when and how they happen. There tends to be patterns
to epiphanies, and we can learn to repeat those patterns. One lesson about epiphanies is
that they seem like sudden - almost magical - inspiration. But mostly they occur after a lot
of perspiration (hard work). Our minds work on important problems even when we are not
aware of it, and sometimes the mind delivers when we are not focused on the problem. But
this usually happens only after focusing intensely on the problem for a while.

Your thesis statement is an epiphany put into a concise form so that others can share your
understanding!

        What Makes a Good Thesis Statement?

                        "A conclusion is the place where you got tired of thinking."
                                                         - Steve Wright

A good thesis statement usually requires a lot of thinking. We don't want to go with the
first conclusion we reach. We need to see what other conclusions are possible and see if
one supportable conclusion might lead to another more profound one. Also, any conclu­
sion we reach needs to be checked out to see if it explains things adequately and can be
properly supported with evidence and sound reasoning. So, in regard to the quote above:
keep thinking!
Additionally, your thesis statement should have an impact on your audience; as Andy Nor­
man explains, the goal is to move people from presumptive knowledge to a non-presump­
tive conclusion:

       What currently passes for good critical thinking instruction leaves students con-
       fused: it makes them defensive and leaves them with a distinct impression that
       we apply our standards haphazardly. The concept of presumption, however,
       allows us to give them real clarity: more transparent guidance about how to
       write a good persuasive essay, more insight into the process of building new
       understanding, and greater clarity about how to think critically. Adept critical
       thinkers understand this: good argumentation is fundamentally a matter of
       marshaling presumptive premises to defend nonpresumptive conclusions. Criti-

                                                                                                                                         Positing a Thesis Statement | 365
          cal thinking is all about finding claims that happen to sit on the wrong side of

                                                                                                                                                                                   2

          the ledger, and showing why they need to be moved to the other side.

  To paraphrase Norman, we are seeking to make and share conclusions that our audience
  does not already presume to be right. To a degree, that means we are seeking to be original,
  but this originality is built upon claims that are not original (in other words, claims that our
  audience presume to be right). Our next task is to ward off objections, or counter-claims, by
  showing they are weaker than our claim.

  You can start developing your thesis by making guesses at the answer to your research
  question. Any hypothesis can work as a starting point because you will be rejecting or revis-
  ing those that don't work. A good strategy is to write down a number of possible answers
  to your research question, even ones that seem absurd, and then start testing them by
  gathering more evidence and testing each thesis statement on your list. If the thesis state-
  ment is contradicted by credible evidence and valid reasoning, then you should reject it. For
  instance, we might ask how authors use each other's work as models for their own writing.
  But before making a claim that an author modeled their writing on another author's work,
  we should ask if the chronology makes sense. In other words, if author A published a piece
  in 1879 and author B published a piece in 1884, we can't assume that author A modeled
  their work on author B's if it wasn't published yet. You might investigate further, however.
  Maybe the two authors knew each other and discussed their work together; it then might
  be possible for author A to have known about the author B's work before it was published.
  We need research to answer our questions with more certitude.

  Note that a degree of certitude is a feature of any claim. Some claims can be stated with
  near certainty, or even absolute certainty (close to 100%). Other claims may be less cer-
  tain and can be qualified in various ways (50% or some other amount). Such qualifications
  might include the limits of the available information or the openness to interpretation of
  a given text or source. It is fine to posit a thesis statements that cannot be defended with
  absolute certainty. Because we are contributing to a scholarly conversation, we can posit
  thesis statements that are speculative, conditional, provisional, limited, and open to revi-
  sion. Many valuable works of literary criticism posit such claims.

   366 | Positing a Thesis Statement
The thesis statement is one of the most important steps in writing, so it deserves a lot of
attention. Below is some advice:

            1. Make sure the thesis statement answers a research question.
           2. Make sure the question and thesis are of possible interest to scholars in

                the area.
           3. The best way to make your thesis statement powerful and relevant is to

                position it within the ongoing scholarly conversation.
           4. The thesis statement is your way to join the scholarly conversation - it says,

                "hey, pay attention here to something significant/relevant to us in this area
                of study."
           5. The way to add significance/relevance is to expand or change our current
                understanding of a literary work, topic, or problem people in the scholarly
                community are discussing.
           6. A good way to do that is to reference other scholars directly. For instance,
                "this paper argues that ____ [something in the literary work, something in
                the scholarly literature] revises our understanding of ____ [something in
                the literary work, something in the scholarly literature] from ____ [previ-
                ously held belief] to ____ [new belief]."
           7. So, for example, "Sigmund Freud's work on projection revises our under-
                standing of Hawthorne's `Young Goodman Brown' from a creepy horror
                story to a warning about how religiously-induced guilt creates scape-
                goats."
           8. The above thesis statement is clear, arguable, relevant, and compelling to
                scholars of literature. Of course, Freud is somewhat old news and scholars
                may have already treated Hawthorne's work in just these terms. You would
                need to look at the scholarly literature to see if the above claim is just a
                rehashing of what's already out there. If it is, you can maybe add some-
                thing to it. For instance, you might make a claim about how such projec-
                tion typically makes scapegoats out of women.
           9. The thesis statement is probably the hardest part of writing. It takes a lot
                of practice to produce your first good thesis statement. After that, it gets
                easier.
          10. One of the best ways to learn how to do it is to look for thesis statements in
                the work of other scholars. Then emulate what they do.

                                                                                                                                         Positing a Thesis Statement | 367
                      For instance, in Viktor Schklovsky's Art as Technique, he presents a
                        general thesis about all art (including literature): "The purpose of art
                        is to impart the sensation of things as they are perceived and not as
                        they are known. The technique of art is to make objects `unfamiliar',
                        to make forms difficult, to increase the difficulty and length of per­
                        ception because the process of perception is an aesthetic end in
                        itself and must be prolonged. Art is a way of experiencing the artful­
                        ness of an object; the object is not important."

                      Schklovsky then discusses particular works of literature, and for each
                        he presents a thesis statement. About Tolstoy, he claims, "Tolstoy
                        makes the familiar seem strange by not naming the familiar object.
                        He describes an object as if he were seeing it for the first time, an
                        event as if it were happening for the first time. In describing some­
                        thing he avoids the accepted names of its parts and instead names
                        corresponding parts of other objects."

                      Schklovsky positioned his claims in the ongoing conversation by sid­
                        ing against his colleagues who argued that the main purpose of art
                        was to create images.

                      Schklovsky's claims still resonate powerfully to this day in studies of
                        art and literature, and in studies of Tolstoy particularly. These few sen­
                        tences from him (of course he explains and defends his claims in the
                        rest of his work) have affected the community of scholars for more
                        than a century. His thesis statements were that good!

Place your thesis in your paper before you state your overview of the supporting arguments

the context of existing discourse. An effective thesis statement has the following features:

            · It answers a research question
            · It is arguable, meaning other answers are possible, but they are not as

       Although readers might assume _________________ [the commonplace idea

       Example:

               Although viewers might assume the romantic comedy Sixteen Can­
               dles is merely entertaining, I believe its message is political. The film uses
               the romance between Samantha, a middle-class sophomore, and Jake,
               an affluent senior, to reinforce the fantasy that anyone can become
               wealthy and successful with enough cunning and persistence.

Now it's your turn to try with your own research topic!

         Composing a Title

  Once you formulate your thesis statement, you will be prepared to create a title for your
  research project. Think of your title as a tool that helps other scholars select materials that
  best fit their needs. For example, if your title does not include the name of the literary work
  you are discussing, the author's name, the theory, or method that you are using, your title
  may not be clear enough to help another researcher make a choice. Your paper may fit their
  needs perfectly, but if you do not include enough information in your title, that researcher
  is likely to skip over your work.

1. In the "Back Matter" of this book, you will find a page titled "Rubrics." On that page, we provide a rubric for Com­
  posing a Title.
                                                                                                                                                           Composing a Title | 375
  Your title can include a reference to your thesis statement. The title can thus function as
  an additional way of stating an argument, and help your reader know what to expect from
  your paper.

We also provide the following activity:
  · Defining Key Terms [Refresher]

       Defining Key Terms

Earlier in this course, we discussed how to conduct a library search using key terms. Here
we discuss how to present key terms. Place yourself in your audience's position and try to
anticipate their need for information. Is your audience composed mostly of novices or pro-
fessionals? If they are novices, you will need to provide more definition and context for your
key concepts and terms.
Because disciplinary knowledge is filled with specialized terms, an ordinary dictionary is
of limited value. Disciplines like psychology, cultural studies, and history use terms in ways
that are often different from the way we use the same words to communicate in daily life.
Some disciplines have their own dictionaries of key terms. Others may have terms scattered
throughout glossaries in important primary texts and textbooks.

                                                                                                                                                     Defining Key Terms | 379
Key terms are the "means of exchange" in disciplines. You gain entry into the discussion by
demonstrating how well you know and understand them. Some disciplinary keywords can
be tricky because they mean one thing in ordinary speech but can mean something dif-
ferent in the discipline. For instance, in ordinary speech, we use the word shadow to refer
to a darker area produced by an object or person between a light source and a surface. In
Jungian psychology, shadow refers to the unconscious or unknown aspects of a personal-
ity. Sometimes there is debate within a discipline about what key terms mean or how they
should be used.
Every researcher is responsible for defining the key terms of their research. If you think
your audience already knows the terms, your reader still wants to know how you define the
terms. If a definition is contested -- meaning different writers define the term in different
ways -- make sure you acknowledge these differences and explain why you favor one def-
inition over the others. Cite your sources when presenting key terms and concepts. In the
"Back Matter" of this book, you will find a page titled "Rubrics." On that page, we provide a
rubric for Defining Key Terms.

Formatting and Style Guidelines:
MLA, APA, and Chicago

BARRY MAUER AND JOHN VENECEK

We discuss the following topic on this page:
  · Formatting and Style Guidelines: MLA, APA, and Chicago

       Formatting and Style Guidelines: MLA, APA, and
       Chicago

Scholars format their work using the style guidelines provided by professional organiza-
tions such as the Modern Language Association (MLA) and the American Psychological
Association (APA). These two are the most common, but far from the only, style guidelines
used by researchers in the Humanities. Most student projects rely on these guidelines for
document formatting, in-text citation, and works-cited lists. Your instructor should let you
know which formatting style is required or whether you are allowed to choose one. Listed
below are a few resources that will help get your citations right.

  · UCF Libraries Research Guides
         MLA Style Guide, 9th edition. This is a quick reference guide to the 9th edition of
            the MLA handbook. It includes general formatting guidelines, examples of com-
            mon in-text citation, examples of how to format a works cited page, and links to
            other resources.

Writing an Abstract

BARRY MAUER AND JOHN VENECEK

We discuss the following topic on this page:
  · Writing an Abstract

We also provide the following activity:
  · Writing an Abstract [Refresher]
  · Exercise

       Writing an Abstract

Put simply, an abstract is a 150-500 word paragraph that provides a quick overview of your
paper. Publications may have specific requirements for what to include in an abstract but,
in general, they include your research purpose, methodologies, methods, key evidence,
results and conclusion. Most undergraduate students would never consider writing an
abstract for an assigned research paper. However, as we will discuss here, writing an
abstract, especially early in your process, can be an effective way to evaluate your research
question.

                                                                                                                                                     Writing an Abstract | 385
Before we begin, watch this short video with Jessica, a Texts & Technology graduate stu-
dent, discuss the importance of the abstract:
Texts & Technology - Part 6 [2 min 56 sec]

                    One or more interactive elements has been excluded from this version of the

        gies2e/?p=185#oembed-1

       Key Quotes from the Video:
       Articulating Your Purpose in the Abstract:
       "Write an abstract early in your drafting process and your research writing
       process because an abstract should absolutely have a definitive statement once
       you, in the abstract, talk about the context of your research and your methodol-
       ogy - you mention those things briefly in an abstract. Often what follows from
       that is, `the purpose of this study is to ...' or, `in this article, I argue that ...' Being
       able to articulate that early on is a really good test of focus because sometimes I
       would try to write that sentence and it would be two or three sentences long
       and I need to be able to say this much more concisely."
       Getting Feedback on Your Abstract:
       "[Wendy Belcher suggests] emailing a colleague or friend or advisor and say,
       `Hey John, I'm working on this research project and here's what I think my argu-
       ment is ... ` and sending that out to a few trusted friends or colleagues just to get
       some trusted feedback. Because, really, when something is arguable it means
       that you're taking a position in response to this conversation that you've
       entered, that you've been listening to, and now you're going to jump in and say
       something. And to be able to say it cleanly and clearly and directly so that some-
       body else who hasn't been reading all the literature that you've been reading for
       the last weeks or months - if the people you send it out to go `Oh, that's a really
       cool idea . . . ` or `I'm not sure what you mean there ...' that can be a really good
       check that what you've got is a focused argument."

386 | Writing an Abstract
  Jessica referenced Wendy Belcher's Writing Your Journal Article in 12 Weeks in which
  Belcher suggests talking through your argument with a friend/colleague/advisor. She also
  suggests writing an abstract early in the writing process and sending it to friends/col-
  leagues/advisors for review. Jessica also noted the "natural reflexiveness" that happens
  when she's reading literature, analyzing data, and targeting a particular journal. She's lis-
  tening to lots of scholars while looking for her place to jump into the conversation. When
  she does, she'll need to have something meaningful to add to the discourse on her topic.

  Even if you're not planning to present on or publish your paper right away, the exercise
  of writing an abstract can help you articulate your purpose, framework, methodologies,
  methods, scope, results, and conclusions. If there are any aspects of your project that
  remain unclear, this process will help you iron them out.

                                                                                                                        1

      Tips for Writing a Good Abstract

               · What makes your work unique? The answer may be in your methods, how
                  you apply theory to a research problem, and where your research fits and
                  builds upon other research.

               · Do you need to include more critical context? Such context showcases the
                  importance of your work in relation to others, and it helps the readers
                  know how it relates to the field.

               · What is the "problem" and your "solution"? This question is another way
                  for you to think about the purpose of your study. The problem may just be
                  a gap in the current literature.

               · Do you list the most important aspects of your methods and results? This
                  synopsis usually indicates the "meat and potatoes" of your work. Just as
                  you may look for studies with abstracts detailing methodology akin to how
                  you want to do research, think about others reading your abstract, perhaps
                  with the same intent.

1. In the "Back Matter" of this book, you will find a page titled "Rubrics." On that page, we provide a rubric for Cre­
  ating an Abstract.

                                                                                                                                                        Writing an Abstract | 387
            · Is your abstract coherent? Invite someone unfamiliar with your work to
                read your abstract. Can that person understand it? Use complete sen-
                tences and active verbs, if possible. It is important for your work to be
                understandable and as engaging as possible, while at the same time
                being concise.

            · How do you conclude your abstract? Are you listing the main takeaways
                for the reader?

Even if you don't need to write an abstract for your assignment, doing so can be an effective
way to evaluate your research question. Start early and revise it as your research devel-
ops. Your abstract should evolve along with your project and it can be a strong indicator
of what's missing and what needs adjusting. Leaving the abstract for the very last step is
common, even among experienced researchers, but we recommend approaching this as
an ongoing exercise rather than a final chore.
We strongly recommend that you share drafts of your abstract with others, especially your
mentor, to get feedback and improve your work.

PROCESS

Chapter 12 Objectives

BARRY MAUER AND JOHN VENECEK

Objectives

Once you have synthesized your research materials and are ready to address your audience
with a clear purpose in mind, you should start the process of putting your research in a pre-
sentable form. We start this chapter with a page on "Writer's Block," a common affliction to
writers. We argue that writer's block can be a productive period because working through
the blocks prepares us to solve problems and become stronger writers. "Structures" are
there to help writers organize their ideas, which will help readers to follow them.
"Revision" is when you review your writing to see whether it meets your objectives. Since
virtually no one can write a successful research paper in one draft, writers go through the
process of revision (usually through multiple drafts) until they are satisfied they have met
their objectives. Your objectives are to join the scholarly conversation, have a clear purpose,
a compelling case, and a research project that rewards your audience for their attention. As
a student, you also need to meet the requirements of the assignment you've been given.
Professional writers often give themselves assignments, which can mean they write for
publications.

                                                                                                                                                   Chapter 12 Objectives | 391
We discuss revisions in terms of content and form. In practice, content and form are insep-
arable. If your ideas (content) are not intelligible in your writing (form), your audience will
not be able to engage with your ideas. You have to know what to say and the best way to
say it.
The tasks for this chapter take us through the major writing portions of the research pro-
ject. They are built upon all the tasks we've done to this point. Make sure to consult your
earlier work and build on it during these tasks.

392 | Chapter 12 Objectives
        Learning Objectives

Revision is where you make major changes to your ideas and the form in which
they are expressed. It often involves rewriting whole sections, moving sentences
and paragraphs around, and making sure all transitions are clear and logical. Writ­
ing guidelines are meant to help make your writing accessible and clear for read­
ers. From the following pages you will learn how to:

     · contribute to the scholarly conversation.
     · convince your reader to adopt your argument as their own.

       Common Obstacles and Suggested Ways to Deal with
       Them

Just about every writer experiences obstacles in their writing. When these obstacles
become very problematic and we are unable to write, we refer to the condition as writer's
block. The "block" means that something stands between the writer and the task. It may
be frustrating but it can be productive if you work through it. Overcoming writer's block
strengthens your ability to solve problems and become a better writer.
A block can be internal, such as psychological resistance. If so, find out why it's coming
up. If it's external, it's an opportunity to change your circumstances or your priorities. If it's
about the research project itself, it's an opportunity to address complexities or rethink the
research problem or your approach.

     Example: Common Obstacles and Suggested Ways to
     Deal with Them

1. Bad writing (shapeless or meandering prose). Advice: find a scholar whose
    work you really admire. Try to write in the style of that person or examine the
    structure of their work and see if you can structure yours in a similar way. For
    example, maybe the text you admire is structured as a comparison/contrast.
    See if that structure works for your project. Ask for feedback and advice from
    more advanced researchers and writers.

2. Blocked access to research materials. Advice: prepare in advance so you are
    not without your research materials. If you are working with digital materials,
    carry them with you on a storage device such as a flash drive or in cloud stor­
    age. If you need access to printed library materials, make sure you look them
    up in the online catalog first to see if they are available. Schedule a time to go
    to the library and scan/photograph shorter works or excerpts and store those
    on an electronic device or in cloud storage.

3. Busyness. Advice: commit to a schedule. Do your research and writing on a
    regular basis (like three times a week). Start the work session by setting a
    timer and work for 15 minutes without a break. When the time is up, see if you
    can keep going. Make sure you take an actual break and walk around at least
    once an hour. If there seems to be too many activities in your life that are
    overlapping (i.e., social gatherings and research time), buy a planner or use
    your phone's calendar with audio reminders to help you commit to your
    schedule. If all else fails, you may need to choose one activity over the other.

4. Depression/Anxiety. Advice: prioritize self-care, such as proper eating, sleep,
    and exercise. Let go of toxic relationships. Get help from professionals if
    needed. Think of writing as a meaningful activity that actually helps many
    people overcome their psychological pressures. If you need additional help
    from UCF, please visit CAPS (Counseling and Psychological Services).

5. Distraction. Advice: shut down other things, like video games, web browsers,
    music, and text messaging. If you care about your success as a student, you
    will prioritize your research over distractions.

                                                                                                                                                  Writer's Block | 395
        6. Exhaustion. Advice: get an early start if possible and go at a steady pace. If
             you try to do too much too fast, you'll get burn out.

         7. Family and work responsibilities. Advice: you may need to change your work
             schedule, find childcare, etc. The realities of life can make being a successful
             researcher difficult. Make adjustments as you can.

        8. Fear of being wrong. Advice: do your research and writing in good faith (by
             trying not to deceive yourself or others) and if you later discover you were
             wrong about something, you can produce another piece of writing explaining
             how your views evolved. We likely will be wrong in our writing from time to
             time.

         9. Fear of controversy. Advice: if your methods or argument are likely to be con­
             troversial, be prepared to defend and justify them in your writing. If you can
             strongly defend these things, then controversy itself is not a sufficient reason
             to stop a research project.

       10. Getting started. Advice: put words on paper (or on screen). Lots of people
             have difficulty taking the first step on a research project. Motivate yourself by
             using fun activities to reward yourself after you've done some research and
             writing. Starting is the most important thing, so don't worry if your first words
             on paper or screen are bad. Use accountability partners; take turns reading
             each other's work every few days.

        11. Getting stuck in the middle. Advice: list the remaining tasks. Do the critical
             tasks first. Be willing to change to a different part of the research or writing
             project. Think about your various projects the way a chef does; some things
             are on the front burners and some things on the back burners. When one
             project needs to rest, put it on the back burner and work on something else.

        12. Language fluency. Advice: plan extra time for your work. If you are reading
             and writing in a language that you don't feel fully fluent in, try writing your
             main ideas in your first language and then work on translating them.

        13. Negative self-assessment. Advice: get support from other people. Our self-
             talk can get negative and tell us we are not smart enough or not capable
             enough. Other people can see our intelligence and our capabilities even
             when we can't. Have them tell you about yours!

       14. Not in the mood. Advice: don't allow yourself to get too fussy about your envi­
             ronment. Some people need a specific set of conditions to do their research
             and writing: a cup of coffee, a quiet room, and a soft cat. These are all fine, but
             the best way to get in the mood to write is to start writing.

396 | Writer's Block
        15. Other priorities. Advice: prioritize things by deadlines and that are most
             valuable to your career (i.e., prioritize work on high value assignments). If
             other things are left unfinished temporarily, that's ok.

       16. Panic. Advice: plan far ahead and scheduling tasks on various projects. If it
             gets to be close to the deadline and you still have too many projects due, pri­
             oritize the ones that are most important, take the loss (you'll probably have
             more opportunities in the future), and let go of the panic.

        17. Slow pace of writing. Advice: keep making progress. Are you making measur­
             able progress? Then you are doing well. Some research and writing tasks take
             longer than others. If you are stuck in the weeds (getting obsessive about
             details), go back to the big picture.

       18. Too much research. Advice: know when enough research is
             enough. Researchers rarely have the luxury to gather all the available knowl­
             edge about a topic (a maximizing strategy called "coverage"). Sometimes
             researchers feel they must keep going until they understand what everyone
             has ever said about a topic. We have to accept that uncertainty is part of the
             process and make the project as good as we can (a strategy called "optimiz­
             ing") or, if we need to move on, make it good enough (a strategy called "satis­
             ficing)."

       19. Uncertainty. Advice: approach complicated issues in your project systemati­
             cally. Sometimes writers are overwhelmed with the complexity of the task
             before them. Write down a list of the complications in your project and
             address them one at a time.

       20. "What I have so far is terrible!" Advice: take what you have and see how it
             can be better. Then do it again. Research and writing are about improvement.
             Making steady improvements is a process called hill climbing. Eventually you
             will be high enough on the hill that you can see above the clouds. Judging
             your work as terrible is part of "Negative Self-Talk." Your project is probably not
             as bad as what your inner-voice is telling you. Don't think of what you have
             written as "terrible"; focus on the good parts of your writing!

All writers want the muse to carry them across the finish line. The truth is that most good
writing requires more perspiration than inspiration; inspiration occurs because we created
the conditions for it with our perspiration. Keep at it. Inspiration may or may not come. Your
writing will improve as you practice and learn.

                                                                                                                                                              Writer's Block | 397

        Introduction

Your instructors know that writers face anxiety about writing, but they want to see your
enthusiasm, not your anxiety, in your writing. They want to know what you think and how
you reason. One approach to thinking about a research project, such as a paper, is that it is
just an elaborate form of show and tell. You tell your audience what you are going to show
them, you show them, and then you tell them about what you've shown. The "show" part is
the literary work and the scholarly conversation about it. The "tell" part is your perspective
on the literary work and on the scholarly conversation. Your research "show and tell" must
have a clear purpose: to address a relevant and significant scholarly problem.

                                                                                                                                                                   Structures | 403
Here are some tips for structuring your writing:

                                                                                                                         1

      Tips for Structuring Your Writing

              1. Always keep your audience in mind and make your writing as accessible as
                  possible.

             2. Address your research question explicitly by showing how you understand
                  it. Explain how you interpret the research question and the significance/
                  relevance of the research question before you move ahead into an argu-
                  ment or discussion.

             3. Provide a brief overview of the rest of your response: what resources --
                  conceptual, methodological -- are you bringing to the research question?
                  How will you proceed?

             4. Define key terms before you begin a discourse about them. Even if you
                  think your readers share an understanding of these terms, they want to
                  see how you define them before moving ahead.

             5. When you cite a scholarly text, provide context. In other words, explain
                  where that text fits in the scholarly discussion. Treat the material dialecti­
                  cally, meaning that you show your reader how a "branch of knowledge" or
                  a "school of thought" relates to other branches or schools, how the branch
                  you are dealing with is divided, and how the various parts relate to each
                  other. Be systematic, but also be critical, where appropriate.

             6. State your thesis clearly. What is your position? Explain how you will back
                  up your claim.

             7. Present obvious counter-arguments to your claim clearly and refute them
                  systematically using strong evidence and clear reasoning (see box below
                  for addressing counter-arguments) Do not dismiss counter-arguments out
                  of hand without first engaging them.

             8. In your writing, alternate between the conceptual and the concrete (we
                  discussed this practice in a previous chapter). In other words, when you
                  discuss a concept, show us how it applies to a particular case. When you

  Structuring Your Writing.

                                                                                                                                                                                       | 405
                discuss a case, explain which concepts you use to make sense of it.
           9. Explain the warrants -- logical connections -- as you move your reader

                from thought to thought or from claim to claim. Make sure your readers
                can follow your connections and that they make sense logically.
          10. Avoid common stylistic errors such as the use of vague pronouns ("it" and
                "this" are the usual suspects), passive voice sentences that hide agency,
                and common punctuation problems such as comma splices.

        Presenting Counter Arguments

You should assume your audience will look with skepticism at your thesis. They will be
considering alternative claims and will be looking for weaknesses in your argument. You
should, therefore, address the reader's questions and concerns clearly and directly by
putting yourself in the reader's shoes, imagining these possible questions and concerns,
and addressing them one by one.
One approach is to present counter-arguments other critics have made and then contrast
the weaknesses in their arguments to the strengths in yours. Sometimes you may not be
able to find counter-arguments to your thesis in other publications. In that case, you should
imagine possible objections to your arguments and state them clearly in your paper before
refuting them with evidence and persuasive reasoning.
This process of argument/counter-argument is what you would expect in a courtroom trial
where a prosecutor and defense attorney take turns building up their own arguments and
tearing down arguments from the opposing side. In most academic papers, your tone will
be civil. In general, there is no need to berate a scholar who happens to be wrong. The
16th-century astronomer Tycho Brahe believed that the sun orbited the Earth. It doesn't

406 |
help your case to write, "Tycho Brahe! What a loser!" Instead, you should explain why Brahe
believed what he did and then explain that he was lacking the information or the perspec-
tive that you have now.

        Basic Structure of Academic Writing

The structure described below is a bare-bones, basic framework for college writing. You are
not locked into it (unless your instructor says so) and there are many other structures, but
this one will do for most research papers.

     Basic Structure of Academic Writing

            I. Title
                      Reference your thesis statement, theory, method, or topic; name the
                        author and title of the work being analyzed.
                      Example: The Downfall of the Southern Gentry: A Marxist Reading of
                        Faulkner's "Barn Burning."

           II. Introduction (usually one paragraph)
                      Attention-getting opener: problem, anecdote, question, quote, anal-
                        ogy, definition, or example
                      Narrowing of general topic
                      Research question
                      Thesis:

                                                                                                                                                                                    | 407
                              Clarifies specific topic, purpose, and focus (your particular point
                                or perspective about topic)

                              Does not "announce" these things ("In this paper I will") but
                                explains why the claim is significant or necessary.

                              Usually the last sentence of introduction paragraph
                              The rest of the paper supports and explains the claim made in

                                the thesis

          III. Body

                      In your transition from the thesis statement to the body (main part)
                        of the essay, you lead the reader through your argument and its rele-
                        vance. Avoid the temptation to merely summarize a literary work.
                        You may, if you choose, present a preview of your argument while
                        summarizing the literary work along the way.

                      Topic sentence: each paragraph has a topic sentence that states the
                        main idea of the paragraph

                      Support:

                              Reasons/Explanations: show your reader the evidence and rea-
                                soning that supports each claim

                                      Evidence includes direct quotations from the text; try to
                                         avoid long quotes by paraphrasing or by breaking them
                                         into smaller parts.

                                      Never include a quotation without framing it within your
                                         argument. Introduce the quote, then present the quote,
                                         then comment on it.

                              Climactic order: your best or most significant idea should be
                                discussed in your last body paragraph

          IV. Conclusion (usually one paragraph)

                      Reaffirm thesis: don't use exactly the same sentence, but remind
                        reader of the main idea

                      Finish with a broad point or generalization, a suggestion for further
                        research, or a rhetorical question

Wendy Belcher's Writing Your Journal Article in 12 Weeks provides excellent advice for
structuring your research paper:
"Structure is the organization of your argument and the evidence for your argument. When
each part of your article leads logically to the next part, you have a coherent structure" (172).
Structures allow your reader to make logical connections as they move through your ideas.
They also help you, as you are writing, to connect your ideas into a greater whole."
Belcher identifies two types of structure: micro (paragraph level) and macro (paper level):

     Paragraph Level

            1. Description: provides information about a topic and answers who, what,
                where, and when. Includes "for example," "such as," and "that is."

           2. Sequence: chronological or procedural information such as background,
                histories, and experiments. Includes: "before," "after," and "more recently."

           3. Causation: cause and effect relationships. Includes "because," "thus," and
                "therefore."

           4. Problem/solution: asks and answers questions. Includes "argues that,"
                "proposes," and "responds."

           5. Comparison: differences and similarities. Includes "in contrast," "instead,"
                and "on the other hand" (173).

                                                                                                                                                                                    | 409
     Project Level

       In general terms, you should start with an introduction that focuses the reader's
       attention, then provide background, propose your argument, provide evidence,
       confront counter-arguments, and state a conclusion. Most undergraduate
       essays follow the structure of topic, thesis, evidence, and conclusion. More
       specifically, you introduce the problem, discuss critical approaches, apply the
       approach, speculate on implications, and conclude (Belcher, 180).
       Two millennia ago, Roman scholars Cicero and Quintilian developed the six-part
       structure of argumentative presentation that we use to this day.

            1. Introduction (exordium). The beginning in which you give your main
                argument and relevant information.

           2. Statement of the case(narratio). Discuss the facts and qualities of the
                case. For a paper on literary studies, the "case" is the literary work you are
                examining.

           3. Outline of the major points in the argument (divisio or partitio). Present
                the disputed issues and list the arguments in the order you will present
                them.

           4. Proof of the case (confirmatio). Validate the statements in the narra­
                tio and divisio.

           5. Refutation of possible opposing arguments (confutatio). Anticipate dis-
                agreements and refute them.

           6. Conclusion (peroratio). Sum up your arguments.

Structure helps your reader stay connected to the flow of your ideas. Belcher offers the fol-
lowing advice for organizing your ideas in a reader-friendly way:

410 |
Principles of Organization

    1. "Go from what your readers know to what they don't know. That is, start
        with the familiar."

   2. "Go from the simple to the complex. Get your reader comfortable before
        introducing the difficult."

   3. "Go from the uncontested to the more contested. Readers who have been
        convinced to believe one thing may be more easily convinced to believe
        the next."

   4. "Go from the general to the particular. Start with the large picture and
        then focus on the details."

   5. "Go chronologically from the past to the present (This common structure
        is not always the best one for your particular argument and evidence)."

   6. "Go spatially through a succession of linked objects, as if on a guided tour.
        This works particularly well for art history, geography, and so on." (Belcher,
        174)

Solving Structural Problems

To maintain your paper's coherence, connect every sentence to the next sen-
tence. The same is true of paragraphs (182). Below are additional strategies you
should use to organize your paper.

    1. Use Subheads: Subheads help the author and the reader to group infor-
        mation (182-183).

   2. Use Summary: Peter Elbow writes, "Good summaries move the article for-
        ward by articulating what has been said and what will be said. Good sum-
        maries are not simplistic, verbatim restatements" (183).

                                                                                                                                                                           | 411
           3. Organize around your argument: Relate all particulars (evidence and
                proofs) to your argument.

           4. Stay focused. Don't change topics. Ask whether everything relates to the
                main argument (184).

           5. Develop examples evenly: Develop all of your sections equally. Don't treat
                one part of your argument at length and another with a brief statement
                (185)

           6. Do not use a discovery structure: Structure your presentation based on
                evidence (not on your discovery process). Organize notes in the data col-
                lection stage around themes and topics. Your structure will emerge from
                these themes and topics (183).

           7. Do not use the "mystery novel" structure : State your argument up front.
                Tell people where you are going, then lead them through your evidence
                (183).

Additional Advice

If you are struggling to follow the instructions above, there is a shortcut. Find a profession-
ally written research paper that you admire. It doesn't have to be in the discipline of lit-
erary studies, but something in the humanities is preferable. Keep the structure of that
paper and replace the content with your own. While in graduate school, Dr. Mauer, one of
the authors of this textbook, used this method to overcome writer's block and structure
his master's thesis. He took the structure of a research paper he found about filmmaker
Jean-Luc Godard and replaced it with his own content, which had to do with experimen-
tal research methods. The essay on Godard was structured as a comparison/contrast in
which the author contrasted Godard's films with conventional Hollywood films. The inven-
tion process was the same for Dr. Mauer's work. It involved creating a table of two columns,
one for the features of the experimental research methods he was studying and the other
for conventional research methods. His thesis was built around the table.

Revisions

BARRY MAUER AND JOHN VENECEK

We discuss the following topics on this page:
  · Content
  · Form

We also provide the following activity:
  · Revisions [Refresher]

A revision is a rethinking and reorganizing of your research paper at a macro level. Revisions
are different from proofreading, in which you clean up smaller things like any errors in
spelling, grammar, and punctuation. A revision involves a big picture review of two things:
content and form.

        Content

Content refers to the various elements that are combined to create a fully realized research
project.

414 | Revisions
     Components of Research Contents

            · topic
            · research question
            · thesis statement
            · theory
            · method
            · major supporting arguments

Reread your work and determine whether you made the best choices in each of these cate-
gories. Gather feedback from others, especially experts in the discipline. Professional schol-
ars frequently count on feedback when they write. Constructive feedback, if you are able
to receive it, is the highest form of flattery and can be extremely helpful in revisions. Some-
times your revision process will lead you to a total rethinking of the research project with a
new topic and research question. That's ok; no matter how far down the wrong road you go,
it's always a good idea (if you've left enough time) to turn around and find the right road.

        Form

Form refers to the chosen structure of your paper, the order of presentation, logical con-
nections, use of examples, etc.
Researchers typically organize their presentation using one or more of the modes of writ-
ing. These modes include

                                                                                                                                                                     Revisions | 415

Using the modes can help you stay organized! Try using one if you are struggling to get
your thoughts into a coherent form. To learn more about modes, download Modes of Writ-
ing by John C. Hodges.
During revision, consider whether you need to move paragraphs, add or remove examples,
eliminate redundancies, provide transitions between paragraphs, strengthen your conclu-
sion, etc.
Professional writers often go through many revisions before they are ready to submit their
work for publication. Publishers then review the work and may accept it as is, reject it, or
accept with revisions. Accept with revisions is a common outcome; the publisher will spec-
ify what needs to be revised, with the understanding that the paper will be published if the
requested changes are made.

       Writing Guidelines

Writing guidelines are standards for achieving consistency, clarity, and precision in your
writing, which enables readers to better appreciate your ideas.
Your reader should not have to struggle with prose that is confusing, wordy, vague, or
poorly structured. Use these guidelines to keep your writing strong and reader-friendly.

418 | Writing Academic Prose
Writing Guidelines

     · Use active voice sentences and avoid passive voice sentences.Active voice
        sentences have people doing things. They place the subject first and then
        the verb.
              "F. Scott Fitzgerald wrote The Great Gatsby," is an example of an
                active voice sentence; "F. Scott Fitzgerald" is the subject and "wrote"
                is the verb.
              "The Great Gatsby was written by F. Scott Fitzgerald" is an example of
                a passive voice sentence.
        Active voice sentences engage the reader. The subject and verb are closer
        together, which strengthens the logical connection between them. Pas-
        sive voice sentences typically lead to wordiness. In the examples above, the
        passive voice sentence contains two extra words. Your sentences should be
        no longer than necessary to convey the required information; we don't
        want readers to work more than necessary. Passive voice sentences are
        appropriate when the focus is on the object of the sentence. For example,
        we could say that a literary work "was released as a special edition." In this
        example, we are not concerned with who released the special edition
        (which would be the subject of the sentence), but only that it was released.
        The most problematic passive voice sentences are those in which a subject
        is expected but is absent. For example, "The Great Gatsby was written" is a
        complete sentence but is inappropriate for a scholarly paper.

     · Use logical connecting words to make the relationships of ideas clear to
        your reader. Logical connecting words include "because," "since," "there­
        fore," "although," "however," "thus," "if . . . then," "both . . . and," "neither . . .
        nor," and "from . . . to."

                                                                                                                                    Writing Academic Prose | 419
            · Avoid vague expletives ("It is," "There are"). Such constructions create
                murky prose and make your reader work harder than necessary to under-
                stand your claims. Additionally, such constructions, usually placed at the
                beginning of sentences, lead to lengthy and weak sentences. Instead, start
                with the subject of the sentence (the person or thing doing the action) fol-
                lowed by an active verb.
                      Don't write: "It is obvious that there are many ways in which Zora
                        Neal Hurston's childhood impacted her writing."
                      Instead: "Zora Neal Hurston's childhood impacted her writing in
                        many ways."

            · Replace "to be" verbs (is, are, was, were, be, will be, etc.) with active
                verbs.
                      Don't write: "It is important to know that there is a lot of interest in
                        this text from scholars."
                      Instead: "Scholars show significant interest in this text."

            · Avoid strings of prepositional phrases.
                      Don't write: "In light of evidence from the end of the eighteenth cen-
                        tury about the process of printing, an improvement in technological
                        means was occurring."
                      Instead: "Printing technology improved near the end of the eigh-
                        teenth century."

            · Do not use "this" as a stand-alone pronoun to refer to the general sense
                of a prior sentence. "This" and "which" are adjectives, not pronouns. Using
                them as pronouns causes imprecision.

420 | Writing Academic Prose
         Don't write: "Fitzgerald wrote The Great Gatsby about a group of fic-
           tional characters, focusing on a millionaire (Gatsby) and his obsession
           with Daisy Buchanan in the Jazz Age. This (???) makes for a great
           meditation on the American Dream."

         Instead: Follow "this" or "which" with a specific noun as in "This
           novel makes for a great meditation on the American Dream."

· In American scholarship, periods and commas go inside end quotation
   marks, unless the quote is followed by a citation.
         Without citation
         Don't write: "Edgar Allan Poe wrote more than just horror stories like
           `The Tell-Tale Heart'".
         Instead: "Edgar Allan Poe wrote more than just horror stories like `The
           Tell-Tale Heart.'"
         With Citation
         Don't write: "Edgar Allan Poe wrote more than just horror stories like
           `The Tell-Tale Heart.'" (Zeeber and Kooki, 2012)
         Instead: "Edgar Allan Poe wrote more than just horror stories like `The
           Tell-Tale Heart'" (Zeeber and Kooki, 2012).
   Colons and semicolons go outside end quotation marks, unless they are
   part of the quotation.

· Do not use "their" when you mean "there" or "they're." Homonyms are
   words with the same sound but different spellings and meanings.

· Know how to properly format titles. Use quotation marks for titles of
   essays, short stories, songs, and shorter poems. Italicize the following: very
   long poems, book titles, movie titles, television series, comic strips, record

                                                                                                                             Writing Academic Prose | 421
                album titles, magazines, and newspapers. The title of your own paper
                should not be in quotation marks. Do not put a period at the end of your
                title. If your paper's title includes the title of another work, such as a novel
                or short story, be sure to italicize or use quotation marks, using the guide-
                lines above.

            · When referring to people, do not use the pronoun "that" when you
                mean "who."
                      Don't write: "People that live in glass houses should not throw
                        stones."
                      Instead: "People who live in glass houses should not throw stones."

            · Avoid comma splices. A comma splice joins two independent clauses
                (each of which can stand as a separate sentence), unconnected by a con-
                junction, with a comma.
                      Don't write: "Gatsby is a man given to obsession, he thinks about
                        Daisy without stop."
                      Instead: replace the comma with either a semi-colon or a period, or
                        you may simply add a conjunction (such as the word "and") after the
                        comma. "Gatsby is a man given to obsession; he thinks about Daisy
                        without stop."

            · Avoid dangling modifiers. Modifiers, usually at the beginning of a sen-
                tence, must relate to the subject of the sentence or they will dangle.
                      Don't write:: "Expecting an important call, the telephone was always
                        at Gatsby's side." Telephones don't "expect."
                      Instead: "Expecting an important call, Gatsby stayed close to the tele-

422 | Writing Academic Prose
                          phone."

               · Sentence elements that are parallel in function should be parallel in
                  grammatical form.
                        Don't write: "Gatsby liked to play and winning." (Mixes an infinitive,
                          "to play" and a present participle, "winning.")
                        Instead: "Gatsby liked playing and winning" or "Gatsby liked to play
                          and win."

               · Substitute familiar for unfamiliar or archaic words.
                        Don't write: "Gatsby was not fully cognizant of the dangers."
                        Instead: "Gatsby was not fully aware of the dangers."

  Scholars should aim to write without reproducing sexist language and stereotypes. See this

writing is through your fingertips. When Dr. Mauer was told by one of his professors that
his writing was unacceptable, this professor provided valuable help; he rewrote the first two
pages of Mauer's paper in his own crystal-clear style and gave Mauer the following assign-
ment: "Retype these two pages, exactly as I have written them, without thinking about it."

Mauer felt, in his fingers, what it was like to write like a master! He could feel the rhythm of
the complex sentences with their dependent clauses, the power of the active verbs, and the
flow of the paragraphs. He grasped the placement of the thesis, the structure of the argu-
ments, and the arrangement of the appeals. This assignment did more to help him learn
the patterns of good writing than did all his other writing instruction.

We can learn the rules for punctuation, grammar, and structure, and still not know how to
write effectively. Just learning the rules is not enough. We needed training to learn the right
habits.

If you are struggling to write effective academic prose, do the following:

  1. Find a published academic essay, the best example of writing you can find in the
      scholarly literature. If you're not sure what qualifies, ask your instructor.

 2. Retype the first two pages.
 3. Add the following statement: "I did not copy-and-paste this text; I typed all of it

      myself." Sign your name.
 4. Share it with someone else (your instructor, if permitted).

You may find it a relief to get away from rules and from the pressure to be original. You are
just copying.

If you think this exercise is a kind of cheating or even "plagiarism," don't worry; you are not
claiming the model essay as your own. You are learning the proper style. The analogy is to a
tennis student who learns a swing by copying a master (or having a master move the ten-
nis student's arm during the swing). All the theory and advice about playing tennis cannot
replace the feeling of the swing itself.

       The Craft of Writing

The basic skills involved in the craft of scholarly writing are to:
  1. Anticipate the reader's need for information, explanation, and context
 2. Use logical connections between ideas
 3. Use appropriate, clear, and smooth transitions

                                                                                                                                              Writing Academic Prose | 425
   4. Use sophisticated sentences, appropriate word choice, and professional conventions of
        written English

  The reader should be able to follow your writing without having to ask unnecessary ques-
  tions about the meaning of a specialized term, the relation of ideas to one another, the
  identity of a character in a literary work, etc.
  A reader should not have to struggle through prose that is vague or has weak sentence
  structure. No reader wants to confront technical errors such as poor grammar, misspellings,
  or misuse of punctuation. The best way to write for your reader is to imagine yourself in
  your reader's position and anticipate the reader's need for information. In other words, ask
  yourself questions while you read your work and try to answer them all. Ask other people to
  read your work and to indicate where they have unanswered questions. Then answer these
  questions in your writing.

         The Word "I"

  In literary research papers, there is no hard rule against using the word I unless your instruc-
  tor makes it a rule. I can be unnecessary. You don't need to write "I think," for instance,
  because your reader assumes your words are your thoughts.
  You don't need to tell us the story of your research process unless doing so is particularly
  relevant. For instance, if you struggled to obtain a document, and that story is worth telling,
  you can explain what happened using I. It is better to use the word I if avoiding it would
  make your prose awkward. For example, if you are describing your own experience with a
  text (ex.: "I first read The Great Gatsby in high school"), writing "One first read The Great
  Gatsby in high school" is not going to work.

                                                                                                                                                                                                         2

  John Horton explains when using I can be not only appropriate but also a good thing.

       Writing with the first person `I' can be good for:

            · Making a connection between you and the reader, making your writing
                engaging, affecting and accessible

            · Helping you to become more self-aware (or `reflexive') about your deci-
                sions, reasoning and ways of working as a researcher

            · Disclosing how you are moved, troubled or transformed by research activi-
                ties, participants, encounters and contexts (Widdowfield, 2000)

            · Being more honest and transparent about the messy process of doing (or
                trying/failing to do) research

            · Recognising, disclosing and critically reflecting upon how your identity,
                background, norms and assumptions (your `positionality') invariably affect
                research encounters, data and outputs (Rose, 1997)

            · Subverting norms of academic writing, acknowledging that you are not an
                all-knowing, all-seeing, all-confident, neutral, authoritative expert by writ-
                ing `vulnerably - i.e. not as the objective master of all you survey but as
                someone in the thick of things, experiencing clarity, confusion, joy, bore-
                dom, pain and more' (Crang and Cook, 2007: 175-6)

            · Acknowledging the complex processes and encounters involved in any
                research, and thinking about where (and how) you stand amongst the
                many interconnected participants, events, bodies, spaces, materialities,
                discourses, power relations and inequalities that constitute any research
                setting

            · Thinking about how you, as a researcher, have distinctive ethical responsi-
                bilities and a duty of care towards research participants

            · Developing your own style of writing - or related creative practice - that
                allows some of your personality, positionality, cares, enthusiasms, culture,
                community and politics to become more fully part of your work

            · And creating a context where others feel able to do some or all of the
                above.

        Avoiding Plagiarism

Susan A. Crane explains: "copying isn't the problem that produces plagiarism; lack of cita-
tion does." Scholars use other people's ideas and words all the time. You can use as many of
them as you need; there's no limit! The only requirement is that you cite them.
Scholars keep track of their references as a way to build upon and give credit to other
scholars. The trail of references from one scholar to another are like breadcrumbs that
researchers can follow to find their path back through a scholarly discourse. By citing oth-
ers, we are respecting their work and the tradition that keeps the trail of breadcrumbs leg-
ible so others can follow it after us.
Plagiarism is not just a theft of someone else's ideas or words, but is also a violation of the

430 | Avoiding Plagiarism
  code that scholars and researchers live by. Without a clear picture of where ideas and schol-
  arly language come from, we lose our trail.
  Wendy Belcher, in her book Writing Your Journal Article in Twelve Weeks: A Guide to Aca­
  demic Publishing Success, provides advice for avoiding plagiarism. First, she notes that you
  will be caught. Especially with the digital search tools available today, checking for plagia-
  rism has become fast and easy. And the penalties can be severe. Plagiarism has cost schol-
  ars their reputations and livelihoods. It's just not worth it!

                                                                                                          1

      To Avoid Plagiarism, Do Not

               · Present someone else's entire work as your own
               · Change little bits and call it your own
               · Reword it and call it your own
               · Translate it and call it your own
               · Take sections or paragraphs and call it your own
               · Use word-for-word quotes unless you put them in quotation marks and

                  properly cite them (161).

  Additionally, be careful when paraphrasing that your wording is too close. If you are having
  a hard time paraphrasing, it is better to use direct quotes instead of paraphrasing (161).

 Scholars often build on their previous work and when they do, they cite
 it. But it is not ok to reproduce parts of a previous work you've written
 without citing it properly. Doing so is called "self-plagiarism." So, if you've
 turned in an assignment for another class but want to use some of it for a
 different assignment, you must properly cite your earlier paper.

  Below is a flow chart that takes you through the decision tree of when to cite.

          consider the following from The Purdue Online Writing Lab:
          There are instances when something is clearly intentional plagiarism: buying,
          stealing, or borrowing a paper from someone else. This includes:

               · Copying a blog post or stealing an article from online.
               · Hiring someone to write your paper for you.
               · Copying a large section of text from a source without making it clear it

                  comes from somewhere else through quotation marks or proper citation.
               · Intentionally failing to cite someone else's work, to claim that the ideas

                  and words belong to you.
               · It is possible to plagiarize from yourself. In academia, if you repurpose a

                  paper from previous class or write one paper for two classes without the
                  instructor's permission this is plagiarism.
          Writers may also unintentionally plagiarize. This usually happens for a few com-
          mon reasons:

               · The writer doesn't fully understand the citation system they are using and
                  ends up missing key elements of the source attribution.

               · The writer thinks they are paraphrasing (restating a source's point in their
                  own words) and ends up accidentally directly quoting words or phrases
                  without realizing.

               · The writer misattributes a quote or idea to the wrong source; this is espe-
                  cially common in larger research projects where the writer is dealing with
                  a lot of source material.

          Here is a brief list of what needs to be credited or documented:

               · Words or ideas presented in a magazine, book, newspaper, song, TV pro-
                  gram, movie, website, computer program, letter, advertisement, or any
                  other medium.

               · Information you gain through interviewing or conversing with another
                  person, face to face, over the phone, or in writing.

               · When you copy the exact words or a unique phrase.
               · When you reprint any diagrams, illustrations, charts, pictures, or other

                  visual materials.
               · When you reuse or repost any digital media, including images, audio,

          There are certain things that do not need documentation or credit, including:

               · Writing your own lived experiences, your own observations and insights,
                  your own thoughts, and your own conclusions about a subject.

               · When you are writing up your own results obtained through lab or field
                  experiments.

               · When you use your own artwork, digital photographs, video, audio, etc.
               · When you are using "common knowledge," things like folklore, common

                  sense observations, myths, urban legends, and historical events
                  (but not historical documents).
               · When you are using generally accepted facts (e.g., pollution is bad for the
                  environment) including facts that are accepted within particular discourse
                  communities (e.g., in the field of composition studies, "writing is a process"
                  is a generally accepted fact).

                      Take notes with the same citation habits you would use in the paper.
                      If you have a lot of online sources such as journal articles in PDF for-

                        mat, use a PDF reader to write your notes on the source directly so
                        they do not get disconnected from the original.
                      Use a citation manager like Zotero and keep a copy of your notes
                        associated with the source entry there.

            · Interviewing & Conversing

                      Take lots of thorough notes; if you have any of your own thoughts as
                        you're interviewing, mark them clearly.

                      If you're interviewing via email, retain copies of the interview sub-
                        ject's emails as well as the ones you send in reply. If your email server
                        allows it, create individual folders that you can further organize in
                        order to have easy access if you need to go back.

            · Writing Paraphrases & Summaries

                      Use a statement that makes it clear you are referencing another
                        source (e.g., According to Jonathan Kozol...).

                      If you are struggling with a summary, try to paraphrase or summa-
                        rize the text without looking at the original source material, and sim-
                        ply rely on your memory. What sticks out to you about the original
                        source is what will be important for you to discuss anyway.

                      Put quotation marks around any unique words or phrases that you
                        cannot or do not want to change.

            · Writing Direct Quotations

                      Keep the source author's name in the same sentence as the quote.
                      Mark the quote with quotation marks or set it off from your text in its

                        own block, per the style guide your paper follows.
                      Quote no more material than necessary; if a short phrase from a

                        source will suffice, don't quote an entire paragraph.
                      Use ellipses to (...) to mark where you have cut portions of a quote.

                        Make sure that you are not omitting any portion that would change

                      The name of the idea's originator should always be mentioned in the
                        sentence or throughout a paragraph about the idea.
                      Parenthetical citations, footnotes, and endnotes are used to refer

                        citation is important so that your teachers or classmates are able to

        Chat-GPT

ChatGPT and other Artificial Intelligence tools present new opportunities and challenges
to scholars. They can be useful tools for producing facts (you always want to double check
them) and summaries, overcoming writer's block, helping with revisions, and trying differ-
ent formats (such as stories, questions, instructions). Of course, you should not claim that
AI-generated writing is something you wrote. Just cite it properly. You can claim credit for
writing original prompts and for modifying the output of an AI. Check with your instructor
for their policies related to AI for assignments.
Chat-GPT and other generative AI tools have the ability to write your paper for you. Is this
ok? Of course not! Generating text via a machine means you did not write it. Passing it
off as your own writing is ethically wrong and could land you in a lot of trouble. Does that
mean you should never use these tools? No. There are a variety of legitimate reasons for
using Chat-GPT, such as gathering background information, comparing and contrasting
your ideas with those of a generated text, investigating the capacity of AI tools, etc. If you
want to use Chat-GPT for any of these reasons, you should make sure your instructor is ok

                                                                                                                                                     Avoiding Plagiarism | 437
with it. Then, if you plan to incorporate any of the generated text in your research project,
you should do the following:

         Explain and justify why you are using generative AI.
         Explain how you are using AI to address a problem; are you using it to summarize

            research? develop an outline? develop possible research questions?
         Provide the prompt you used to generate the text.
         Make sure the entirety of any generated text is quoted and properly attributed in

            your final work.

  Read over each of the following questions, and respond to a discussion post as to whether
  or not each uses citations accurately. If it doesn't, improve it so it's properly cited. All the
  questions refer to the following passage from Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.'s "Letter from the
  Birmingham Jail":

          You deplore the demonstrations taking place in Birmingham. But your statement, I
          am sorry to say, fails to express a similar concern for the conditions that brought about
          the demonstrations. I am sure that none of you would want to rest content with the
          superficial kind of social analysis that deals merely with effects and does not grap-
          ple with underlying causes. It is unfortunate that demonstrations are taking place in
          Birmingham, but it is even more unfortunate that the city's white power structure left
          the Negro community with no alternative.
    1. Dr. King was certain that nobody would want to be contented with a feigning type of
        social analysis that concerns itself only with effects and doesn't deal with root causes.
    2. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. wrote that the city of Birmingham's "white power structure"
        left African-Americans there with "no alternative" but to demonstrate ("Letter from
        the Birmingham Jail" para. 5).
    3. In "Letter from the Birmingham Jail," King writes to fellow clergy saying that although
        they "deplore the demonstrations taking place in Birmingham, your statement fails to
        express a similar concern for the conditions that brought about the demonstrations."

BARRY MAUER AND JOHN VENECEK

Objectives

In this final chapter we help you steer clear of plagiarism, which is the use of others' words
and ideas without proper attribution, find resources to help you with your research, and
provide an assignment that puts in place the components necessary for finishing your
research project.
Plagiarism is a violation of scholarly integrity and hurts not just the plagiarist (who gets
caught) and the source of the information (who is uncredited), but also the knowledge pro-
fession itself, which depends on an unbroken chain of attribution so that other researchers
can follow the scholarly conversation back to its sources. In our page on plagiarism, we pro-
vide advice for how to credit your sources and avoid plagiarism.
Researchers need lots of resources, including training, sources, time, funding, and publish-
ing venues, to do their work. In our page on additional resources, we provide information
about many valuable resources, such as UCF's University Writing Center, Information Liter-
acy Modules, Research Tips Thursdays, Undergraduate Research Opportunities, Showcase

of Undergraduate Research, The Pegasus Review, UCF Funding Opportunities, and Pub-
lishing and Conferences.
Finally, we provide a Foundational Materials assignment in which you put in place the com-
ponents necessary to complete your research project. These components include a title,
research question, thesis statement, abstract, and annotated list of sources.
Now that we've done the bulk of our writing, our primary task is to make sure we have not
plagiarized.

Research Tips Thursdays

Research Tips Thursdays is a webinar series created by the UCF Libraries one Thursday each
month. Some of the early videos are longer in length (30-40 minutes) but the more recent
ones are short (2-3:00 minutes and focus on specific skills that all researchers need to know.
Topics include evaluating resources, the research process, search strategies, and tips for
success. See the RTT website for more information.

Undergraduate Research Opportunities

The Office of Undergraduate Research offers a plethora of useful information for under-
graduates including research opportunities, a database for research positions, funding
sources, publishing and presenting opportunities, trainings, resources for getting started
with research and training to further develop your skills.

Honors Undergraduate Thesis (HUT)

From the HUT website:
        The Honors Undergraduate Thesis (HUT) program is the oldest and most prestigious
        undergraduate research program at UCF. HUT provides juniors and seniors from all
        disciplines the opportunity to engage in original and independent research or cre-
        ative activity as principal investigators and independent scholars.
        Over the course of two to four semesters, students work closely with a faculty commit-
        tee to research, write, defend, and publish an original thesis that serves as an honors
        capstone product of their undergraduate career. This thesis is published through the
        university library and is available to researchers worldwide through electronic data-
        bases.

You do not need to be admitted to the Burnett Honors College to participate in HUT. Visit
HUT!

                                                                                                                                                   Additional Resources | 445

Assignment

BARRY MAUER AND JOHN VENECEK
        "I never know what I think about something until I read what I've written on it."
                                                      William Faulkner

This assignment is a major step on your way to the research project. It includes the follow-
ing components:

Rubrics for each of these components are available in the "Rubrics" section of the appendix.
You can absolutely re-use past assignments here, but it is a good idea to rework them, espe­

                                                                                                                             Foundational Materials Assignment | 447
cially once you see all the parts together. Think about how all the parts relate to one another
and adjust them if they need to be more cohesive.

If you've been following this textbook, you should have completed all these steps by now.
For this assignment, you put them together and see that they all relate. Your Foundational
Materials work may only end up a couple of pages long, but we are going for quality not
quantity. Begin with a clear sense of audience and purpose, and clearly define the prob-
lem, research question, thesis, and argument. Provide context for your work by citing the
scholarly discussion. You should identify a journal or other scholarly platform (conference,
showcase, edited collection, etc.) that would be a good fit for your research.

Your arguments need specificity, strength, support, and coherence. Please ask for your
instructor's feedback or help if you need it before turning in this assignment.

If your instructor has given you a choice of prompts, indicate which prompt from the pro-
ject assignments you are referring to. By choosing one, you are choosing the "frame" for
your work. Make sure you incorporate key terms in your proposal. If your research is about
metaphor in a literary work, you need to explain which metaphor(s) in particular you are
addressing. It shouldn't be about metaphor in general. The parts of the assignment, such
as composing a title, developing a research question, writing a thesis statement, and so on,
are explained in the chapters of this book. Following the advice in these pages will help you
stay away from many common yet avoidable mistakes.

        1. Titles: If a key word appears in your title, it needs to appear somewhere else in your
            proposal.

               The title should indicate which text is your object of study. It should also indi-
                  cate which theory, methodology, or method you are using to discuss the work.

               Your title needs to give the reader some guidance on what to expect in the
                  paper. Imagine that your title is listed among twenty other titles in a journal -
                  how will readers know which text you are discussing? Which theory or per-
                  spective are you taking?

               You should capitalize all words in your title except for prepositions (unless a
                  preposition is at the beginning of the title, in which case you capitalize it).

               Your own title does not go in quotation marks.
               It is a mistake to imply in your title that a particular writer is using a theory in

                  their writing (as in this made-up example: "Judith Williamson's Myth Structure
                  in Poe's `The Masque of the Red Death.'" The word "in" here implies that
                  Williamson's theory is in the story itself. Instead, you could say you are doing a
                  reading of the story through Williamson's theory).

448 | Foundational Materials Assignment
2. Research questions: An assignment prompt is not the same thing as your
    research question.

        Your research question should be aimed at filling a gap in the scholarly litera-
          ture or clearing up a misunderstanding about a topic related to literature.

        A research question can include primary, secondary, and tertiary questions.
        What is it you want to know about this text?
        Don't make your research question too broad.
        Make your research question about a specific text (usually no more than two

          for an undergraduate paper) and specific topics (such as particular metaphors
          or paradoxes, social or psychological questions, etc.).
        The research question should be answerable with an arguable claim.
        Make sure your research question is relevant to an audience of literary schol-
          ars.
        Don't ask whether we can apply a theory to a text. We can apply almost any
          theory to almost any text, but what is it you want to know about the text? Is
          there some specific benefit we gain from a theory that can't be gained by
          other means?

3. Thesis statement: Writing a good thesis statement is one of the most difficult
    tasks in academic writing.

        Your thesis statement should answer your research question.
        It should relate to a specific text or texts, rather than (merely) to a general

          topic.
        Because you are stating an arguable claim, you should do more than claim

          you will discuss or will analyze a text (these terms imply an explicatory paper,
          which is "about" something, and not an argumentative one that makes a
          claim).
        Avoid claiming we can "understand" a text (instead tell us what we should
          understand).
        Avoid making claims that are presumptive (already known or generally
          accepted), such as that Ernest Gaines' writing is about injustice. Tell us what
          actions he portrays that are unjust and explain why they are unjust.
        Avoid vague language. Stating that something is "different" or "unique" is not
          an arguable claim.
        Avoid claiming that a text is an example of a theory. Most theories are general
          enough to cover a potentially infinite number of examples. Tell us what is spe­
          cial about a text and why it matters.

                                                                                                                  Foundational Materials Assignment | 449
               Avoid claiming that you will prove a theory. If a theory is in the scholarly litera-
                  ture, it is presumptively true. You can criticize a theory or even seek to dis-
                  prove it. You can explain how other theorists have amended and extended
                  particular theories. (Remember that a theory is not a fact; it is an explanation
                  that accounts for a set of facts).

               Keep your thesis statement as short as possible (though it can be several sen-
                  tences) and put longer explanations in the abstract.

       4. Abstract: Explain what your research contributes to the scholarly conversation.
            Your abstract should explain your argument in more detail and provide an idea of
            what support you are using and why your claim is significant.

       5. Literature Review: How are you positioning your argument in relation to that of
            other scholars? Which ones do you agree with or disagree with? Of the ones that
            agree, how will your work differ from or add to theirs? Are you deviating from
            other scholarship in some ways? Building upon it? Providing meta-commentary
            on it?

               Which sources are you using for evidence?
               How does your work contribute to the scholarly discussion?
               Keep in mind that your sources may focus on different things: the literary

                  work, the theory, the methodology, etc.
               If your proposal refers to a theory or method, include something about it in

                  the bibliography about it. Sometimes one source you found will be closest to
                  the paper you are writing. You can use it as your primary jumping off point -
                  how does your work differ or supplement this work?
               Each work listed in your literature review should have a full citation. Make sure
                  your citations are properly formatted (MLA, APA, etc.).
               If you'd like to see an excellent example of a literature review, see this one
                  about narratology by Carissa Baker.

Stylistics: General scholarly practice is to write in present tense. In other words, avoid writ-
ing "this paper will . . . ," which is future tense.

               Avoid passive voice sentences, especially agentless ones that don't tell us who
                  is doing what.

               Make sure your arguments are strong and clear and that there are no
                  mechanical or style problems to slow down your reader. Your reader wants to
                  learn and enjoy - they do not want to struggle to figure out what you mean,
                  how your ideas are connected, or to confront style problems. Writers work

450 | Foundational Materials Assignment
                  harder so that their readers don't have to.
               Short story titles go in quotation marks and book titles go in italics.
               Avoid using "this" as a stand-alone pronoun, which leads to vagueness.
If your project uses a theory outside of its normal application, then explain why it is doing
so and how you are making it work. For instance, Vladimir Propp's morphological theory
is about folktales. If you are applying Propp's theory to a modernist literary work, explain
why Propp's theory is relevant outside of folktales. Your reader may think, for example, that
modernist works don't follow the narrative structures of folktales and that applying Propp
to one will just tell us what we already believe - that folktales and modernist literary works
are different. But if applying Propp to a modernist literary work reveals something about
that work we could not have understood otherwise, then by all means, use it!
Research projects take time to prepare and write. Be sure to schedule time regularly to do
this work. Start with something very manageable like 15 minutes a day, and then if you go
over that time, consider it a bonus. The hardest part is starting.
Plagiarism is a serious academic offense that can lead to expulsion from the university. You
must properly cite your sources, using quotation marks (or offsetting longer quotes) and
providing proper citation. See Avoiding Plagiarism for information.

                                                                                                                             Foundational Materials Assignment | 451

We discuss the following topics on this page:
  · Showcase of Undergraduate Research
  · The Pegasus Review
  · Publishing and Conferences

Introduction

Sharing research with other scholars is the most valued activity any researcher can do in
their career. UCF provides venues where student researchers can share their work. The
wider world also awaits your research, and the various CFP lists provide thousands of oppor-
tunities for you to gain the professional experience of showcasing your research and shar-
ing it with other scholars!

452 | Scholarly Venues
Showcase of Undergraduate Research

The Showcase of Undergraduate Research Excellence (SURE) is a poster forum for UCF
undergraduates to present their research and creative projects to the broader university
community. Undergraduates from all disciplines are encouraged to present current or
recently completed academic projects showcasing the diversity of topics, approaches, and
interests at UCF. This is an excellent opportunity to showcase your work among the best
undergraduate researchers at UCF. You can showcase your research in a poster session first,
then as an article for the Pegasus Review.

The Pegasus Review

Even as an undergrad, publishing your research is a real opportunity and is especially worth
considering if you're planning to go to grad school. The Pegasus Review is UCF's journal of
undergraduate research and they're always on the lookout for high-quality student work,
especially from the humanities. If you're interested in publishing your research, consult
their submissions guidelines and review their archive of back issues.

Publishing and Conferences

Humanities venues are always looking for new research, and students can start their
careers through these avenues. You can find CFPs (Calls For Papers) in the following:

Note to students: the assignment below may be modified or replaced with a different
assignment by your instructor.

         "Write, let no one hold you back, let nothing stop you: not man; not the imbe­
         cilic capitalist machinery, in which the publishing houses are the crafty, obse­

             quious relayers of imperatives handed down by an economy that works
                                              against us and off our backs."
                                                        - Hélène Cixous

           "It is my ambition to say in ten sentences what others say in a whole book."
                                                    - Friedrich Nietzsche

                                             "Don't be `a writer'. Be writing."
                                                      - William Faulkner

                                                                                                                                          Final Research Assignment | 457
The purposes of the final research paper are to

  · use your research skills
  · apply your knowledge of literary theory and methodology to interpret, critique, histori-

      cize, or creatively adapt a work of literature
  · apply best writing practices, explained in this text, to produce a strong argument

      within a polished academic research project

Your work should be aimed at publication in a literary studies journal or other professional
venue (conference, platform, etc.). It is your choice whether to actually submit your work to
the journal or platform, but doing so is not required for the assignment. The project should
be accompanied with a brief note to the prospective journal or platform (so your instructor
knows which one you are aiming for).

Because we are doing a relatively short research project (and not something like a whole
book), our project should focus on a particular case study or two at most. A case study is
a particular work of literature, event, or phenomenon. We don't have the time or space to

458 | Final Research Assignment
properly research an entire literary period, movement, or even the complete works of a sin-
gle author. Keeping things simple and focused is key to making this project work!
You must include at least three outside sources (in other words, sources that have not been
assigned to the class) in your research project. The three works you choose to cite must be
scholarly works; in other words, they must be from scholarly journals, books, or websites.
You may cite additional, non-scholarly works, but do not do so exclusively. The total length
for a conventional essay is 5-20 pages. Journal articles are usually between 300-6000 words.
Essays are not your only option, however, and you may produce a graphic work, conference
presentation, video, exhibit, or other form of work. See Presenting Your Research Visually:
Academic Posters and Slides, if you are interested in using these media.
Your project must include an abstract, as well as a review of literature (see the Types of Lit­
erature Reviews page for advice on how to develop your annotated bibliography into a lit­
erature review), a properly formatted works cited page, and all of the components we have
covered so far (research question, thesis statement, title, etc.). You may choose MLA, APA,
or Chicago as your style guide. These components should be integrated into the paper. The
abstract can serve as the first paragraph and the review of literature can be in one place in
the paper (usually close to the beginning) or may be distributed throughout (particularly if
your review touches on different topics).
By doing this assignment, you are learning and demonstrating skills - such as close read-
ing, argument construction, and clear writing - that you can transfer to other classes and
projects.
Make sure you refer to this textbook for instructions about writing the essay.

Presenting Your Research
Visually: Academic Posters and
Slides

BARRY MAUER; JOHN VENECEK; AND ERIKA HEREDIA

The essay is an enduring form for presenting research, but research also appears in other
forms such as visual media. Two of the most conventional forms of scholarly visual media
are posters and slides. In general, both posters and slides preserve the classic structure of
information organization found in essays, and include elements such as title, introduction,
literature review, methodology, findings, discussion and conclusion. Posters and slides can
play a supporting or collaborative role in a verbal presentation, during which the speaker
refers to graphs and charts, featured images, and bullet points. Other times, posters and
slides stand on their own without a speaker there to present them.

482 | Presenting Your Research Visually: Academic Posters and Slides
Posters

An academic poster summarizes your research in a way that is visually compelling. Made up
of the harmonious arrangement of graphics, images and text, the poster can be an oppor-
tunity to engage in public speaking, share ideas, and demonstrate your expertise while net-
working at conferences, symposia, showcases and other scholarly events.

Successful posters have information arranged strategically and are easily readable. Some
good practices include:

  · Use a short and interesting title
  · Make your main text readable from 10 feet away
  · Only include the main ideas about your research
  · Make the layout clean
  · Use a text body of 300 to 800 words in a readable font
  · Use bullets points, numbering and headlines to create a visual hierarchy for the con-

      tent
  · Use a compatible set of colors and a balanced visual structure
  · Include your name, acknowledgments and institutional affiliation. (NYU Libraries, 2021)

What information to include in a poster?

Traditionally, a poster is divided into sections which organize information clearly and con-
cisely.

  · Title: brief and succinct presentation of the research. Include your name and institu-
      tional affiliation in a subheading.

  · Introduction: This section is dedicated to establishing, in no more than 200 words, a
      context of the investigated topic. It is useful for target people outside of your field.

  · Summarized literature review including the most representative authors to demon-
      strate the connection with the academic discussion in the field.

  · Research question (see chapter XY) and the methodology proposed for addressing the
      research question (see chapter MN).

  · Discussion including the analysis of the most important findings. You can incorporate
      charts, graphs and images.

  · Conclusion establishing the relevance of your research, connecting once again the
      research question and your proposal to address it. Point out limitations, if any, and
      future research.

                                                                                  Presenting Your Research Visually: Academic Posters and Slides | 483

Applying design principles to posters

A poster designed respecting design fundamentals must strike a balance between nega-
tive space (white space) and positive space (where the text is positioned). An overcrowded

484 | Presenting Your Research Visually: Academic Posters and Slides
poster will discourage reading. Think about your target audience and in turn make your
task easier when presenting your research.

  · Consider cultural factors. In the West we are used to reading information from left to
      right; therefore follow this visual guide to organize your information and make it easier
      to the reader.

  · Remember that your poster will be spotted several meters away, so consider organiz-
      ing the information in blocks to make it more attractive and readable.

  · The use of cold colors is recommended, in the range of blues and greens, and neutrals
      to establish softer transitions in sight.

  · Use warm colors (yellow, red and orange) if you want to highlight certain specific
      phrases.

Colors and accessibility

The use of light backgrounds in contrast to dark font colors is called luminance contrast
ratio and is recommended for a smooth and intuitive reading. Moreover, its use helps peo-
ple with visual impairments to not miss substantial information. The highest luminance
contrast ratio is the combination of white background and black font but that does not
mean that you cannot combine other alternative equal accessibility friendly. Here there is a
tool for helping you with picking colors for your poster https://color.adobe.com/create/color-
contrast-analyzer
As a rule, if possible, use no more than 4 colors in your design and no more than 2 fonts,
one for the title and one for the body. Subheadings can be bold or in a different color than
the body text to bring dynamism to the overall composition.

Slides

In general, slides accompany an oral presentation. To do a slide presentation, consider your
message and your audience's knowledge, beliefs, and feelings about your topic. In this way,
the slides will highlight the main points and present the evidence that supports our argu-
ment.

                                                                                  Presenting Your Research Visually: Academic Posters and Slides | 485
General recommendations

  · Length: The rule of thumb is "one slide per minute," though 1 slide every 2 minutes
      may work better, depending on the density and complexity of the information. The
      typical conference presentation is 20 minutes, which may stop at the 15 minute mark
      to allow 5 minutes for questions.

  · Text: Avoid overcrowding the slides, and include only principal ideas. Break your text in
      bullet points (no need for complete sentences), use a headline per each slide, and
      avoid spelling and grammar mistakes.

  · Fonts: use font size: 30 - 48 point for headlines, 24 - 28 for body text. Use conventional
      fonts like Arial, Verdana, Times New Roman or Calibri to avoid unexpected problems
      with the layout.

  · Images: Include images and figures that are relevant for supporting your argument.
      Use labels for images (titles, credits, etc.).

Applying design principles to slides

Good design involves a clean and consistent layout. Many products, such as PowerPoint,
provide vertical and horizontal guide markers to align elements. Your audience will group
items by proximity, so put things together that go together.

Keep your presentation focused on the content and make it easy for your audience to fol-
low. Make sure fonts are legible and large enough, and that there is some space on the
slides (so they're not too crowded). Keep slides in the same style with the same designs,
colors, and fonts. Avoid animated transitions.

At the end, practice your oral presentation while reviewing the entire slide deck to confirm
it has a logical organization, that the design is consistent, the text is accurate, and the
images are relevant.

Software

There is specific software for designing poster layout. The most standard and popular are
Illustrator, Photoshop and InDesign, all of them included in Adobe Suite. Currently, Adobe
Suite offers discounts for college students that can be checked in the company website.

486 | Presenting Your Research Visually: Academic Posters and Slides
Nevertheless, there are alternatives to Adobe Software that can deal with poster layout like
Gimp, CorelDraw, Affinity Designer and MS Word.
For designing slides, the most popular are MS Power Point, Google slides, Prezi, Slide Share,
Apple Keynote, Slidebean, among many others.
In recent years, there were developed online software that works with intuitive interfaces
for those who are not familiar with design skills, many of them could be accessed creating
a user or login through Google mail or Facebook account. Examples of them are Genially,
Visme, Canva, PickToChart, DesignCap, Desygner, among others. Almost all of them allow
creating posters and slide presentations that can be accessed by a computer, laptop or
smartphone.

Sample Syllabus for Strategies for Conducting Literary
Research, 2e

Catalog Description: Research and Writing about Literature (LIT 3212). This course is
designed to teach literary research and writing skills. PR: Grade of "C" (2.0) or better required
in ENC 1102 or C.I. Research, writing, and critical analysis skills applicable to upper-level Eng-
lish courses. 3 credit hours

Research-Intensive Course statement: You will actively engage in research processes and
a significant portion of your grade will be derived from course-related project(s) based on
original research and/or creative scholarship.

Detailed Description: This course walks you through the process of conducting literary
research while helping to refine your library skills. Along the way, we will draw from the
Association of College and Research Libraries (ACRL) Information Literacy Framework.
According to the ACRL, "Research is iterative and depends upon asking increasingly com-
plex or new questions whose answers lead to additional questions or lines of inquiry in any
field." We will discuss this concept more in-depth throughout the course. Your goal in the
course is to produce a research paper suitable for publication in a literary studies journal.

The course will also focus on a research project created by Jada, an English major who con-
ducted a literary study of James Baldwin's classic short story, "Sonny's Blues."

The basic textbook we will be using for our class is Strategies for Conducting Literary
Research, 2e. It has loads of concepts and vocabulary, some of which you may not have
encountered before. In a research-based course, your instructor will require you to write
a research paper of 5-8 pages, but the knowledge you need to perform this task can fill
dozens of pages. Writing about literature is a complicated, often messy process; it needs
to meet high standards while incorporating knowledge from other fields such as psychol-
ogy, history, science, and other arts. It entails knowledge about language, genre, structures,
styles, and more. To produce good research about literature, we need to know a lot of things
about a lot of things!

Although we will discuss the research process in a linear fashion throughout this course,

                                                                                                                                                          Sample Syllabus | 495
you'll find that, in practice, literary research is a highly recursive process. We're constantly
circling back through the process as we write. Because writing instructors are locked into
presenting the writing process in a linear way, we tend to discuss it in terms of stages
such as preliminary research, drafting, revising, and so on. But writing a research paper
requires us to rethink and redo our work at any stage. It's not uncommon for writers to be
in the middle of proofreading (one of the final stages) and realize they need to go back and
gather more research. Though this course focuses on research about literature, the skills
and knowledge in these chapters apply to many other areas and topics, especially in the
humanities.

We have many short exercises in our textbook and they are designed as a scaffold leading
up to the final research assignment. As you do each of the smaller assignments, archive it
and bring it up again when you do the next one. They are all connected and build upon one
another. By the time you come to the final research project, you will have done most of the
work already.

Course Objectives

  1. Students need help to enter into academic and professional discourse. My teaching
      aims to help you enter these communities by integrating four knowledge areas: liter-
      acy, critical thinking, self-knowledge, and citizenship.

         Literacy is more than the ability merely to read and write; it is also the ability to
            read reality and to interpret the "instrument panels" (the mediated data streams
            and theoretical frameworks) that tell us about it. At the university level, literacy
            means the ability to communicate within academic and professional communities
            using specialized discourses. From my perspective, I want your literacy skills to be
            high enough to write for publication in a professional peer-reviewed journal. Such
            work requires new habits of reading and writing, habits that do not come easily or
            naturally for most people. Gregory Ulmer used to remind me that a pencil was
            probably the cheapest technology a person could buy but the most expensive to
            learn to use effectively. I focus on improving each student's abilities regardless of
            his or her skills on the first day of class. You may not reach the level of a profes-
            sional writer, but with practice you will move closer to that goal.

         Critical thinking is the ability to assess the merits of an idea or It requires skills in
            analysis and interpretation. Analysis describes what type a text is, how it functions,
            details its elements and explains how it achieves its effects. Interpretation declares
            what a text means, what its major themes are, and what morals or lessons the
            reader should draw from it. When students become adept at these skills, they are
            ready to assess the merits of ideas, including their own.

         Self-knowledge lies at the origins of scholarly learning, beginning with the Del-
            phic Oracle's instruction to Socrates: "Know thyself!" Self-knowledge is the process
            of creating an inventory of one's thoughts and behaviors, discovering one's values,
            and checking for congruence. By studying literature, we explore different ways of
            being in the world.

         Citizenship is a process of engagement with the world, one that balances empow-
            erment with humility. It begins with an understanding of self, of groups, of tradi-
            tions, and of actions and their consequences. The citizenship process is like the

                                                                                                                                                          Sample Syllabus | 497
            self-knowledge process. It entails examination of a group's values and its beliefs
            and behaviors. Again, theory and the arts are agents for understanding what it
            means to have responsibility, power, and limitations in our own place and time.

By integrating these four areas, you will gain a sense of confidence about your place in aca-
demic and professional worlds. You will have the ability to find, evaluate, and use informa-
tion. Below are additional goals of the course.

 2. To train you to work in the field of literary studies.
 3. To identify the formal and stylistic features of a variety of texts.
 4. To identify the methods of composition practiced by the producers of such.
 5. To learn how to read and incorporate elements from difficult works, including experi-

      mental texts, theories that account for such texts' methods and meanings, and written
      accounts of complex historical events on your own.
 6. To write persuasively about the "how" and "why" of critical and theoretical work, par-
      ticularly your own. Each act of composition, even in theory and criticism, involves
      developing the "rules of the game," a set of constraints about what is and isn't You will
      learn to explain and justify the rules of the game for your own as you communicate
      your findings.
 7. To formulate an original research question or objective appropriate to the discipline.

Course Projects and Grading

Projects

  · Final research assignment is a literary research project of 5-8 pages (or equivalent)
      (300 points/30%), aimed at publication in a professional journal or platform. Students
      investigate a literary work and produce an argument about it. Objectives
         o use your research skills
         o apply your knowledge of literary theory and methodology to interpret, critique,
            historicize, or creatively adapt a work of literature
         o apply best writing practices, explained in our Strategies for Conducting Literary
            Research. 2e text, to produce a strong argument within a polished academic
            research paper

The skills involved in producing this project are required in upper division literature courses.

498 | Sample Syllabus
The skills you learn and demonstrate in this work are also transferable to any activity that
requires careful reading, critical thinking, rhetoric ability, and effective writing.

Make sure you refer to the textbook for instructions about writing the essay.

You must also include at least three outside sources (in other words, sources that have not
been assigned to the class). The works you choose to cite must be scholarly works; in other
words, they must be from scholarly journals, books, or websites. You may cite other, non-
scholarly works, but do not do so exclusively. Length: 5-8 pages.

  · The Foundational Materials assignment (100 points/10%) is a late "midterm" assign-
      ment (it comes nearer the end of the course) that compiles five previous assign-
      ments--spaced throughout the semester--proposed title, research question, thesis
      statement, abstract, and annotated bibliography. The assignment requires research
      into literary works through secondary sources and engagement with original evi-
      dence.

  · Discussions (100 points/10%). For each of the class modules, discuss at least one ques-
      tion (which can be your own, someone else's, or just one from any provided by the
      instructor), but feel free to discuss as many as you'd like. Also, the discussion gets lively
      if you check back in with it to see if anyone has responded to your post.

  · Quizzes (42 total at 5 points each). Quizzes are incorporated in the module pages/text-
      book and each is worth five points. You have unlimited attempts at each quiz and the
      best score is recorded in the gradebook.
