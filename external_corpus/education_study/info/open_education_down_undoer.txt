1 | FOREWORD

FOREWORD

   by Dr Adrian Stagg

`Human nature', and `instinct' are often uncritically used to rationalise or explain baser behaviours, yet
rarely acknowledged as positive forces motivating compassion, empathy, and community. When
establishing a motive for both the best and worst actions of humanity, individuals often provide the same
answer `I had no choice'. The desire to demonstrate understanding, welcome into community, care for, and
nurture each other is the lesser recognised instinct - yet without it, civilisation, the sharing of knowledge,
and the advancement of society are left poorer. To use Hobbes' phrase, when speaking about the absence
of an organising force on humanity, life would be `solitary, poore, nasty, brutish, and short' (1651, XIII).

Our ancestors were capable of community-building and care for the individual; activities easily recognisable
by their modern counterparts. The anthropologist Dr Margaret Mead asserted the first piece of evidence to
civilisation - in her mind - was a broken femur than had healed (Byock, 2012). Evidence of early medicine
and wound care meant that rather than abandon the injured companion, someone stayed and helped -
nursing them back to health. That act of compassion - she asserts - was the true beginning of a civilisation.
Cave paintings in France evidence art lessons for children, coupled with children's art in places they could
have only reached with an adult lifting them up. More recently, excavations of early human remains show
the presence of Downs Syndrome in early humans - with many of the skeletons estimated to have received
care from the community (Bowler, 2024). Inclusivity and care were hard-coded into communities, and
nurturing appears - at the risk of romanticising the findings - to have been a social norm.

Collating knowledge is the act of connecting with previous generations and respecting the wealth of
intellectual, creative, and emotional work; curating and adding to that knowledge creates a `common
wealth' for future generations. The Library of Alexandria was architecturally designed to open toward
the docks, allowing cataloguers to descend upon arriving vessels and remove all written works - with the
promise to return copies to their owners (Mader, 1976). The originals were organised, curated, and added
to a growing wealth of knowledge in the ancient world. Indeed, the concept of sharing information - the
inter-library loan - was practiced here. Surety for the book's safe return was indexed to the cost of a trireme
(a type of warship), underpinning the value placed on such items (I have asserted the world would be a
different place indeed if libraries continued to be paid in warships, but that is a digression beyond the scope
of this foreword).

Even earlier, the Egyptian Pharoahs funded archaeological and restorative work to statuary and
monuments, annotating the hieroglyphic record to attribute the original work, and then to record the
details of restorative work (including the funder and archaeologist undertaking the work) - a cross between
annotated resource, and attribution. Building on previous works, and preservation of knowledge is by no
means a new phenomenon.
                                                                                                                                           FOREWORD | 2

In 1945, with the conclusion of the Second World War, Vannevar Bush, Director of the Office of Scientific
Research and Development (USA) wrote `As we may think', explaining the collaboration between
scientists, `burying their old professional competition in the demand of a common cause'. This solidarity
and collegiality - admittedly driven by a global need - causes him to question the future state of research,
and lament the speed at which new knowledge was generated, and despair that `publication has been
extended far beyond our present ability to make real use of the record' (1945, p. 101). In other words,
the abundance of information coupled with the diversity of formats (photograph, audio, video, and text)
and ability to share created complex knowledge networks that offered great promise and great challenges in
equal measures.

Where I am going with this is to reflect on not only the basic human desire - perhaps even need - for
community, and connect it with an environment of abundance. Building a `common wealth' of knowledge,
educating society to be critical consumers of research, and applying the benefits of that knowledge equally
is the foundation for a fair, just, and tolerant society. The intervening years since Vannevar Bush's
observation that volume of information could impede scientific discovery without adequate mechanisms
to organise and access is no less true almost eighty years later.

There is, however, a clear and present challenge faced by modern society - enclosure. Public institutions
use public funds to generate new knowledge, only to enclose them in proprietary systems that restrict
access and promote inequality. The ability to access knowledge - even for universities - is predicated on
funding. For the average citizen, paywalls represent a costly (in some cases insurmountable) challenge to
access. Outmoded notions of scarcity prevail - despite advances in technology that can serve information
at a fraction of a cent. Just as access for universities is predicated by funding, so too is access to learning for
citizens. The seemingly inseparable relationship between debt and education can be uncritically accepted,
and even - more dangerously - romanticised as `the poor and struggling student', as though this is a rite of
passage to earn a degree.

As open educators and practitioners, we realise a responsibility to shift higher education into an abundance
mentality; that just because students have traditionally struggled does not make it a template for future
generations. Many open educators I have met provide at least one story explaining their motivation toward
fair, accessible, and equitable education - essentially recognising and empathising with the student
experience and responding because `I didn't have a choice'.

Open education, however, will not solve these problems alone. It can't. Open education, though, is
inherently combinatorial, it seeks symbiosis with other elements in the institutional ecology. If open
educational principles are paired with open licencing regimes and free and open knowledge, the result
are open educational resources (OER). Resources alone cannot ensure quality assured learning (or even
understanding). Combining OER with accessibility standards and user experience design supports wider
access to the resources. Active learning design supported by OER can result in a mOOC (micro-Online
Open Course), and when further combined with assurance of learning manifests as micro-credentialing.
Open learning design combined with authentic assessment practices can create opportunities for engaged,
3 | FOREWORD

invested students who add value to their profession and society during their studies - normalising sharing
and co-creation.

Whilst not exhaustive, the examples combine and complement the constituent parts. As a symbiotic
relationship, both parties offer something of value, yet the result is beneficial for both. Higher education
is already accustomed to the term `predatory' (although `parasitic' may be more apt) for elements in the
ecology, yet open education invites collaboration and combinatorial power leading to positive outcomes for
staff, students, and society.

The most powerful combination is open educational practices and community.

This text acts as a turning point in Australian open educational practices; not only because the community
is generously and freely sharing their experiences of implementing OEP, but rather because we have a
wealth of experiences across the sector from which to draw. Catalysed by the work of advocates and
professional bodies such as ASCILITE and the Council of Australasian University Librarians (CAUL),
open education has gained significant traction and recognition as a mechanism to enable equity of access,
greater affordability, and a deeper authenticity in learning and teaching. CAUL's `Enabling the modern
curriculum` projects elevated OER to national prominence for librarians, and provided a much-needed
focal point for advocacy, publishing, and professional learning, whilst the ASCILITE OEP SIG provides a
space for the community to meet, disseminate practice, and conduct research.

This book is the result of Alice Luetchford (James Cook University) and Angie Williamson (Deakin
University) recognising the need to collate current Australasian practice as not only a celebration of
national achievement, but to provide practitioners with a `common wealth' of examples that answer the
question `what does open education look like?' In the spirit of abundance, the text is offered freely (by the
generous actions of CAUL) and openly to all in the hopes it inspires further action (and a cycle of new
submissions, perhaps?). When Alice and Angie called for support to complete the text, an entire Editorial
Team stepped forward - you'll find their details on this text - and took up the work in an act of true
community.

The resulting book is an accomplishment worthy of celebration as a testament to those who contribute
to making education - as John Dewey would describe it - `designed to encourage creativity, exploration,
independence, and cooperative work'.

I commend this text, and its attendant community, hoping it will inspire, guide, and act as a foundation for
further work in this space.

Perhaps the final sentiment is encapsulated best in one of Buckminster Fuller's quotes that has guided my
practice for some time, and I hope offers wisdom for yours.

`You never change anything by fighting the existing reality. To change something, build a new model that
makes the existing model obsolete.'

TEXTBOOK COST-TO-STUDENTS
MINIMISATION PILOT

   University of South Australia

   Ash Barber and Sarah McQuillen

Overview

This case study outlines the University of South Australia's Textbook Minimisation Pilot, a two-year
project which aimed to reduce the number of assigned textbooks only available for institutional purchase
under a limited user license or in print only. This pilot allowed for adoption of formats other than OER,
and so can be considered a `soft transition' toward the adoption of OER. Thirteen courses adopted OER
as a result of the pilot, saving the student body an estimated $9 million.
This case study provides a whole-of-University framework to facilitate and support academic staff to
transition from traditional commercial textbooks, toward more flexible materials such as OER. The
chapter includes a strong focus on awareness-raising and educational outreach activities undertaken by
the Library to highlight barriers anticipated to be encountered by institutions undertaking resource
transitions, and provides strategies and support networks to overcome these.

   Using this case study

     This case study is useful for teaching academics, learning designers and library staff. After
     reading this chapter:

          · Academic staff will: Develop awareness of the perils of relying on commercial textbooks
             from financial, equity and accessibility perspectives; and understand the range of
             alternative resources available, including OER.

          · Learning Designers will: Understand common barriers at a strategic level which can
             prevent academic staff from resourcing their courses as desired, and learn strategies
             through which these can be mitigated and to advocate for change.

          · Library staff will: Learn strategies and techniques for building engagement across all
             stakeholders and gain an insight into a successful workflow with a view to leverage
             opportunities for promoting and adopting alternatives to commercial textbooks, including
             OER.

Why minimise textbooks?

UniSA prides itself on being a university of equity. With a large percentage of students from diverse
socioeconomic backgrounds, combined with a significant online-only cohort, UniSA has long embraced a
digital collection as a means to facilitate equitable access to course resources.

In recent years, Library efforts have been impeded by restrictive ebook licensing conditions imposed by
commercial publishers, such as single to three user licenses with minimal download provision; prohibitive
pricing; release of print-only formats to libraries; and bundling of eTextbook titles with additional content
only made available to individual purchasers. Whilst academic staff often rely on textbooks to structure
teaching and assessment, they are often unaware of the cost to students, or the limitations on Library
access.

To understand the textbook financial burden on students, UniSA conducted a small-scale survey, which
found 68% of students had chosen not to purchase a textbook at least once, with 48% relying on the Library
copy. In addition, 41% said textbook purchases had impacted their ability to pay for rent, food, transport
and other living costs, and 9% had unenrolled from a course to avoid these costs (view full survey results in
this video). As one student described:

      "The tutor told students that if we did not have the required textbook, we would not be able to pass
      the course. The textbook was super expensive and at the time I was dealing with significant financial
      hardship. This put me in a state of extreme academic stress that later flowed into other parts of my life, so I
      unenrolled."
      -- Bachelor of Social Work student

To mitigate this financial burden on students, the UniSA Textbook Cost-To-Student Minimisation (aka
`Textbook Minimisation') pilot was born.

What is the Textbook Cost-To-Students Minimisation
pilot?

Conducted during 2021 and 2022, the pilot was a joint initiative of UniSA Library and the UniSA
13 | TEXTBOOK COST-TO-STUDENTS MINIMISATION PILOT

Teaching Innovation Unit, a team of practised academics and specialists in learning design and technology.
Academic Board endorsed the pilot, adding it to the University's Academic Enterprise Plan 2021-2025
[pdf] (see Strategic Priority 2.7) and engaging Deans of Programs to drive participation.

A whole-of-library approach was employed in supporting the activities of the pilot. Under the leadership
of a central Project Coordinator, a representative from each of the library discipline teams conducted
engagement and communication activities and drew upon their teams' support staff to conduct searching
and resourcing activities.

Technical teams were also included in a monthly Library Staff Community of Practice group. This aimed
to provide advice and library staff training and offer suggestions on untapped opportunities to improve
existing workflows.

Throughout the pilot, the Library consulted with a range of stakeholders including the Teaching
Innovation Unit, who assisted with advocacy at the strategic level, and with other administrative groups to
source data and to update textbook-related documentation throughout the University.

Academic advocacy was crucial to raising awareness of the pilot and ebook licensing issues. Library staff
presented at academic discipline Teaching and Learning Strategy Groups, and provided regular reports
and updates. Similarly, the Coordinator engaged two project students enrolled in UniSA's Library and
Information Management program, who conducted a small-scale student survey on textbook purchasing
behaviours and attitudes and created a promotional video.

A summary of pilot staff roles and stakeholders is presented in Figure 1 below.
                                                                              TEXTBOOK COST-TO-STUDENTS MINIMISATION PILOT | 14

In addition to reducing textbook costs and raising awareness, the Library aimed to develop sustainable
textbook minimisation practices. The Library also set a target to remove or replace 50% of existing limited
licence textbooks with more flexibly licensed alternatives including OER.

How did we do it?

The workflow comprised three phases:

Figure 2: "Textbook minimisation workflow", by University of South Australia, licensed under
CC-BY-NC-SA 4.0 [Go to image description]
15 | TEXTBOOK COST-TO-STUDENTS MINIMISATION PILOT

As indicated in the workflow above, library staff began by confirming whether the usage of the text
meets UniSA's formal definition of a textbook: a resource that the student will require continual access to
throughout the course. If usage did not meet this definition, it could simply be relisted as a reference text
instead as this signals to UniSA students that continual access or purchase is not required.
When the assigned text did meet UniSA's textbook definition, the Library liaised with academic staff
to identify the information need being met by the text for which the Library would then strategically
recommend alternatives.
A huge variety of options are available to remove or replace limited licence textbooks, so the Library found
it challenging navigating this nuanced conversation with academic staff who are not familiar with licence
restrictions or copyright allowances. The Library, therefore, created a hierarchy of resourcing options,
prioritising flexible options such as OER, which was shared during discussions with academics. (See Figure
3, below.)

Figure 3: "Hierarchy of textbook alternative resource options used in the project" by University of South
Australia, licensed under CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 [Go to image description]

An emphasis of these conversations was the broad range of resourcing options available and the reassurance
that academic staff held the ultimate decision as to whether the textbook was removed, replaced or even
retained. As academic staff were empowered to opt out of the project at any stage, in some cases the
workflow finished at this step with the academic indicating a solid rationale for retaining the text.

Outcomes: Where are we now?

The project saw a total of 47% reduction of limited licence textbooks across the entire two year pilot, just
                                                                              TEXTBOOK COST-TO-STUDENTS MINIMISATION PILOT | 16

shy of the 50% target. Based on the Recommended Retail Price (RRP) of print textbooks, when the cost
saved per course is multiplied by the number of student enrolments (14,096), the project achieved a total
potential saving to UniSA students of approximately $9 million.

The success of the two-year pilot was such that we have now transitioned the project into business as
usual, leveraging the new connections and workflows created to ensure textbook licensing considerations
are a frequent topic whenever in contact with our academic teaching staff, with the knowledge that early
identification of problematic texts is key.

The Textbook Minimisation pilot paved the way for OER activities at UniSA, with 13 courses adopting
12 OER as replacements for restrictively licensed commercial textbooks. Academics have been primed with
two years of knowledge of the dire financial situation for students and now have experience and trust in
the ways the Library can help to identify alternative resource options without adding pressure to change
their course materials. Throughout the Textbook Minimisation pilot, the Library remained committed to
upholding academic freedom, acting only as a knowledgeable information source, listening to the needs of
academics and their students, and providing options, not demands. This commitment from the Library to
consistently recognise the academic as the content expert and, therefore, the final decision-maker, has been
integral to building trusting relationships with staff.

The project had a positive impact on all interested parties:

  · Academic staff
          Have greater choice when selecting course readings and materials
          Discover more flexible ways they can teach with OER and suites of readings redefining the
            "textbook"

  · Students
          Save on removed textbook costs
          Library studies students gained experience designing and conducting surveys, and knowledge
            of ebook licensing models and alternatives such as OER/CC

  · Library
          Changed processes to leverage opportunities for textbook alternatives, organically capturing
            instances where textbooks with insufficient access may have been assigned
          Educated staff on OER and textbook licensing issues
          Empowered staff to conduct informed and impactful conversations with publishers about
            access models

  · Teaching Innovation Unit
          Gained awareness of extensive Library services to support course resourcing
          Built knowledge of problematic ebook licensing and potential alternative options
          Reduced workload related to creation of in-house learning objects
          Embedded best practice in online course development by including relevant and accessible
            materials

Recommendations and pitfalls to navigate

Throughout the project, we identified a variety of barriers to textbook minimisation. These pitfalls and
recommendations for mitigation may be useful for other institutions to consider when conducting similar
activities.

Awareness and advocacy

It is evident that ongoing advocacy work with academic staff is still required to improve awareness of:

  · The need (both financial and equitable) for textbook minimisation, and the benefits, from academic
      and student perspectives

  · University operational distinctions between a textbook and a reference text
  · Extensive support available from the Library

Timing and workload

The majority of restrictively licensed texts retained were due to timing and workload concerns, wherein
some courses were not being actively taught, where academic workload precluded capacity to review or
enact adoption of suggested materials, or where course coordinators were newly assigned and so did not
feel confident to make changes.

This could be mitigated through changes to workflows, to seize early opportunities in course or program
development, in refresh cycles, or during accreditation. At this early stage, academic staff have more time
allocated to review options. Furthermore, as they then build the course around the suggested resources, the
burden of disentangling an unsuitable textbook (and potential supplemental resources) is removed. Thus,
these early intervention efforts are generally more successful than engaging with a course at a later stage of
the cycle.

Publisher-supplied supplemental resources

Some courses had integrated publisher-supplied supplemental learning objects such as quizzes, case studies,
animations and slides. As these learning objects are only made available to academic staff who set the
associated textbook as the official course textbook, to remove or replace the listed textbook would require
significant changes to the course site, where each learning object had been embedded, and to the weekly
lesson plans designed around these objects.

Attachment to familiar texts

Some academic discipline cultures demonstrated strong attachment to familiar texts which had been used
                                                                              TEXTBOOK COST-TO-STUDENTS MINIMISATION PILOT | 18

historically, or had a desire for students to build a professional library of textbooks. However, when Deans
of Programs expressed their support and encouraged their academic staff to engage with the project,
minimisation activities were more successful.

Niche publishing areas

Niche areas, such as Australian content and custom course editions posed a challenge for sourcing
alternatives. Individual meetings with Course Coordinators were helpful in overcoming this challenge.

Failure to implement change

A few successfully targeted courses did not officially delist the textbook or have since listed new limited
licence texts following a change of Course Coordinator. Reassuring academics that the project was not
an attempt to encroach on their territory as subject and pedagogical experts helped to assuage a pervasive
concern that all textbooks would be removed and without consultation. Maintaining a positive relationship
with academic staff facilitated successful future conversations.

The Textbook Cost-to-Students Minimisation pilot has been challenging, but it has compelled us as a
library to examine our digital practices and evolve to suit the changing textbook publishing landscape.
Through these efforts, we hope to further alleviate the hidden, but often devastating, cost of textbooks for
students.

Champion statements

       "The textbook minimisation project is a great idea and approach to help reduce the cost of
       studying for students by reducing the number of textbooks that students need to buy. In
       place of textbooks, open access and other centrally licenced or free resources are provided to
       students to aid them with their studies. The library was very helpful in identifying suitable
       resources for a couple of more foundational physics courses, and we have now switched to
       using a free online textbook which the students really appreciate."
19 | TEXTBOOK COST-TO-STUDENTS MINIMISATION PILOT

                -- Dr Sam Tuttle, Lecturer: Applied Physics, Semester 2, 2021

       "From the perspective of the editorial team of `Teach, Design, Thrive', publishing our
       professional development resources as an OER is a wonderful opportunity to:

                · Establish a one-stop-shop repository for organising and sharing curated resources
                produced in-house. As we are a large team of prolific content creators, this is a much-
                needed improvement in our practice.
                · Share our resources with non-UniSA educators who may not have access to similar
                support (for example, people working in under-resourced institutions)
                · Gain visibility for our work outside of UniSA and build a reputation among our peers
                as creators of high-quality content
                · Experience the OER creation process first-hand, so that we can use this learning to
                support other UniSA educators wishing to publish their own resources
       Importantly, we view open publishing as a way to enact all the UniSA core values, i.e.:
       Integrity and accountability; Diversity and social justice; Engagement and collaboration;
       Agility and innovation; Scholarship and excellence. The diversity and social justice elements
       is one we feel especially strongly about, not only in terms of providing access to published
       content at no cost to users, but also as OER publishing creates opportunities for under-
       represented groups and niche researchers to share their knowledge with the broader
       academic community, even when publication may not be commercially viable.
       What we would like to see moving forward is greater recognition of the scholarly work
       involved in OER publishing, with institutions valuing OER creation as a demonstration of
       engagement in the Scholarship of Teaching and Learning and therefore equivalent to
       academic research publication. Without this recognition, allocating workload to OER
       creation can be challenging, especially when there are many competing priorities. Despite
       these challenges, we are thoroughly enjoying the creation process and look forward to
       publishing our OER and sharing it with the tertiary educators' community."

In practice

Reflect on this case study by considering the following questions in relation to your own
practice:

     · Is your textbook access equitable and sufficient for your students?
     · Are you aware of the range of alternative resources available, including OER which you

        could adopt instead? And do you know how to find these?
     · How could your library support you in improving textbook access for your students?
     · What are the strategic barriers that need to be addressed at your institution to

        encourage OER adoption or to implement an OER program?

ALIGNING OPEN EDUCATION PROGRAMS
WITH ACADEMIC REWARD AND
RECOGNITION

   La Trobe University

   Hugh Rundle and Steven Chang

Overview

Open Education Practice (OEP) programs often wrestle with a key dilemma: how do we attract academic
project participation in an institutional environment that doesn't reward open educational practices
(OEP)? Standard academic reward and recognition is tied closely to research publication outputs. By
contrast, publishing teaching texts is unrewarded at best and often actively discouraged.

For teaching staff, investing time into open education initiatives will only become a priority if these projects
will:

 1. advance a greater purpose beyond the open educational resource (OER) itself
 2. actively solve existing problems in learning & teaching practices
 3. align with academic reward and recognition program criteria.

This case study explores how the La Trobe eBureau, an open education program, tackled this problem. It
focuses on how librarians used reflexive and reflective thinking to draw upon the experiences of academic
open practitioners and develop solutions to this dilemma.

We suggest that the most effective way to align OEP with institutional incentives is to target award, grant,
and promotion programs that are learning and teaching focused (rather than research publication focused).
Our experiences highlight that the key avenues for achieving this are empowering teaching staff as open
practitioners and equipping them to engage in OER-enabled scholarship of learning and teaching.
25 | ALIGNING OPEN EDUCATION PROGRAMS WITH ACADEMIC REWARD AND RECOGNITION

   Using this case study

          · Open Education teams will: Learn strategies for developing impactful open education
             projects and incentivising academic authors.

          · Educators will: Understand the benefits to their teaching and opportunities for
             academic reward available by engaging with open education on its own terms.

What we were trying to solve

  · Resistance or hostility from senior academics to support teaching staff time for writing OERs due to
      the perceived negative impact on academic progression: time writing an OER is time not writing
      research articles

  · Struggles experienced by authors to get their OERs classified as research outputs to get recognition
      for the work and "justify" the workload

  · The need to improve how we promote our OERs both internally and externally.

What we initially tried

  · Seeking grants and funding to pay out teaching time for academics to spend the time writing their
      OER textbook - looking for external grants and talking to the Advancement team

  · Advocating to senior academics on the merits of open textbooks from a student equity perspective
  · Developing promotion and communications campaigns and holding online book launches.

Doing OER advocacy `smarter, not harder'

The La Trobe eBureau was founded in 2016 and has spent almost a decade engaging in serious OER
advocacy, which has brought both immense successes and many failures. Recently, we shifted gears to a
strategy focused on advocating for OER in a `smarter, not harder' way. A key part of this change was
adopting a slower, analytical, debrief-based approach powered by reflective practices. This aimed to unearth
the underlying drivers for both our unexpected successes and our recurring stumbling blocks.

Formalising reflection and reflexion

In 2024, we began normalising a new practice of holding formal "retrospectives" with everyone involved
in a particular open education project (both academics and professionals), scheduled just prior to the
point of publication. This structured practice serves as a project debrief and provides valuable insights into
what worked and did not work for each project. Crucially, it also encourages reflexive practices, which is
an approach that goes deeper than reflective practice. Its distinguishing feature is that it focuses on how
participants see themselves and their `given' assumptions. This can cultivate thinking about how they have
changed as practitioners.

This generates questions like:

  · `how does my positioning affect my assumptions about Stakeholder A?'
  · `how do my initial assumptions about the benefits of OER affect how I collaborate with

      Community A to achieve project goals X and Y?'

These insights have generated a profound rethinking process about fundamentals, which has compelled
us to revisit the purpose of open education and how we reframe it to ourselves, our colleagues, and the
university community. These changes have been so powerful that we have now embedded reflective practice
across our whole open education program.

Reflexive practice question: how do our unexamined assumptions
compromise our advocacy?

We use the term `reflexive practice' here to highlight how we critically examined our own position as
librarians with no lived experience being an academic. Recognising this helped us to `unlearn' our
assumptions about how academic workloads operate. This made us more attentive to how teaching staff
experience OER barriers.

Critically understanding our own positioning helped us position our OER advocacy differently. We used
this `smarter, not harder' approach to recognise we were on the wrong path when we asked academics to
estimate how much money would pay out teaching hours to free up time for developing open textbooks.

Feedback from teaching staff identified the following problems with this idea:

  · Estimating this figure was difficult because the question "how much time do you need to write a
      textbook" is impossible to answer without any specific context

  · Paying out teaching time withdraws teaching staff from active teaching practice which severs the
      "live" link between OER development and reflective practice

  · Single-minded focus on a sole specific long-term task (like developing an OER) will be crowded out
      by competing priorities unless it is nested as a means to achieve a higher priority purpose
27 | ALIGNING OPEN EDUCATION PROGRAMS WITH ACADEMIC REWARD AND RECOGNITION

  · Finding colleagues who can replace teaching staff is difficult. This takes a significant amount of time,
      handover work, and administrative planning.

In a nutshell, we identified that we were framing OER development as a separate activity to be added
to and subtracted from academic workloads. This approach creates a major problem because it frames
OER initiatives to teaching staff as standalone units of `more work'. This additive approach also separates
it from teaching activities, rather than seeding projects from existing teaching practice to solve problems
from within (by doing them differently). This `more work' narrative means that teaching staff often
(understandably) dismiss these ideas as "nice to have, but yet another thing I can't fit into my unsustainable
workload".

Reflective practice question: what is the point of open education?

Our reflections about why our approach was failing led us to a broader examination of how we see open
education and frame its purpose.

When we first launched the La Trobe eBureau, we primarily envisaged it as a social justice intervention
to save textbook costs for students (Salisbury et al, 2023). This rationale was understandable at the time: it
was driven partly by our institution's values and student demographics, and partly because as an emerging
program we took a lead from experienced U.S. initiatives.

However, our experiences highlight that framing student cost savings as the primary benefit of OERs has
three weaknesses, particularly in Australia:

 1. Zero Textbook Cost programs for saving student costs aren't directly rewarded (in their own
      right) in the current Australian higher education system (unlike in the U.S.)

 2. Framing OER as "just like commercial textbooks, but free" is enormously self-limiting, as it
      doesn't recognise the full spectrum of OER capabilities for transforming teaching. For example,
      many La Trobe academics express frustration about the `one size fits all' nature of traditional
      textbooks: that they are static, dry, and content-focused rather than pedagogically-focused. By
      contrast, OER projects can enable much more ambitious goals such as `fit-for-purpose' alignment of
      form, content, and pedagogy. This is because they are uniquely flexible and not required to `be
      everything for everyone' for mass market profits.

 3. Single-minded focus on student cost savings does not always speak to the diverse priorities
      of teaching staff. Putting all our eggs in this basket meant we missed the big picture: `OER-enabled
      pedagogy'. This is a radically open-ended toolbox for solving a wide spectrum of problems (Wiley,
      2021). Its broad utility to all open practitioners is enabled by the defining feature of OERs: the `five
      Rs'. Many academics do care deeply about student equity but are rarely incentivised to tackle this
      problem, so in a time-poor environment, it is often drowned out by competing priorities. A narrow
      advocacy strategy focused solely on one benefit will fail to engage these other urgent priorities.

Centring the practitioner on their own terms

Bringing these three points together, we decided to broaden our view of open education beyond student
cost saving benefits. We were influenced by researchers who have highlighted that teaching practitioners'
agency is decisive for widening OEP engagement (Stagg, 2023). This research suggests that practitioners are
influenced by a wide `ecology' of context-sensitive factors, and therefore advocacy needs to be flexible rather
than singular or static.

Combining our experiences with this research, it became clear that we needed to diversify our advocacy.
This pivot aimed to recognise the wide-ranging priorities of teaching staff on their own terms and actively
align OEP with them. Taking this as our new starting point, we became much more effective at articulating
open education as an extension of practitioners' existing work to address goals that are meaningful to them,
rather than `more work' that adds new goals. This does not mean advocates should deprioritise student cost
saving benefits, but it does mean situating these benefits as one element in a richer multi-pronged advocacy
strategy, thereby avoiding a single point of failure.

Rethinking our fundamental vision

Fitting a square peg into a round hole

For years we wrestled with a key dilemma: how do we incentivise open textbook projects, given that
OERs are excluded from the criteria for classification as research publication outputs? It makes sense that
research outputs are a priority for many academics, given that it has implications for academic workload
allocation. However, after investing immense efforts into diverse strategies to solve this problem, we found
very little success except one sole win for the humanities open textbook Democracy in Difference. This was
discouraging, but our initial disappointment enabled us to take an important step back so we could reflect
and reframe our approach.

Transitioning from OER to OEP

Our pivot to searching for alternative solutions turned out to be decisive. Reflexive practices helped us to
step back from the `librarian perspective' and examine the big picture. We then used our new broadening
understanding of open education to find better ways of supporting teaching practitioners. This meant
redeveloping the La Trobe eBureau's fundamental vision.

Our first step was to abandon our traditional Library-centric `production pipeline' mindset in which we
positioned ourselves primarily as OER publishing experts. In this schema, publishing OERs was the project
endpoint in itself, rather than one key project milestone towards achieving broader transformation to
achieve open practitioners' goals. This was clearly reflected in our OER development workflow at the time,
which represents a single-minded focus on OER production (see Figure 1).
29 | ALIGNING OPEN EDUCATION PROGRAMS WITH ACADEMIC REWARD AND RECOGNITION

                 Trobe eBureau's traditional practices by La Trobe University Library, licensed
                 under CC BY [Go to image description]

This approach suffers from a fatal gap: it is not primarily framed by actual teaching staff practices and
experiences. This is a key omission because these are the guiding stars for the most important pair of
elements in any OER project: problem-focused ideation and post-publication implementation into
learning design. These elements should drive OER production, not the other way around.

                        description]

Our reflexive practices created the space for us to embrace sustained uncertainty about our new model.
`Wiping the slate clean' enabled us to transition towards a broader OEP-oriented framework (see Figure 2).
This situates OERs in context: as a tool that must be paired with symbiotic learning & teaching practices
to be impactful. Together, this pairing equips open practitioners to solve diverse problems.

Shifting focus to learning & teaching recognition

We turned our attention towards learning & teaching reward programs (e.g. teaching awards, grants, and
promotions) once we recognised that it was a dead end to get OERs counted as research publications.
Naturally, the criteria for these programs are much more strongly aligned with open education projects
compared to research publications criteria.
However, this alignment is not plainly self-evident. These incentive programs do not mention OERs
and therefore open education programs can play an invaluable role by connecting the dots to support
practitioners (see Table 1). We have been successful in articulating these connections to achieve recognition,
but this was only possible because of our new approach to open education.

OER projects as evidence for teaching recognition

Academics seeking recognition face a key challenge: the bulk of their teaching labour is ephemeral and
therefore often rendered invisible and difficult to evidence. OER are uniquely placed as a tangible form
to embody these practice-based efforts. OER analytics are powerful for this, as quantitative indicators are
easily understood by university administrators.

We have found this to be a transformative discovery for using `primary OER' (such as open textbooks)
to support award, grant, and promotion applications. So we are now piloting this strategy across the
whole learning & teaching cycle (See Figure 3). We use our open repository to publish `secondary OER'
as open artefacts (e.g. assessment rubrics and OEP project tools / surveys). Consciously or otherwise,
this exemplifies the knowledge production aspects of Hamilton and Hansen's `practice-led research' OEP
model (2024).

Problem-focused OER design for impact

From our experience, there is one common factor that generates both academic motivation for open
education projects and success in reward & recognition: a systematic understanding of the problem being
solved. Less successful projects all suffered from vagueness in this area.
We illustrate this by examining two of our OEP projects that are successful in this way.

Example 1 - Threshold Concepts in Biochemistry

In the case of Threshold Concepts in Biochemistry, the project was driven by enthusiastic academic
motivation for OER development. This energy was generated by strong clarity about the project's greater
purpose for solving specific teaching problems (it's `why'). A key ingredient was investing in patient
ideation for understanding the problem on a deeper level, enhanced by a collaborative `critical friend'
model.
Our methods included:

  · classroom observations and reflective teaching practices
  · analysis to identify common student errors
  · a targeted literature review of biochemistry education studies
  · breaking down the problem into distinct elements
33 | ALIGNING OPEN EDUCATION PROGRAMS WITH ACADEMIC REWARD AND RECOGNITION

  · scoping out the breadth of the problem

These efforts directly generated a clear series of guiding principles for how we would achieve problem-
focused OER impact (see Table 2). In turn, these naturally led to formulating well-defined project aims
and scope: to develop a concise and conceptually-focused resource that specifically tackles STEM threshold
concepts in an accessible way.

Table 2: How a systematic understanding of the problem can create purposeful guiding
                                      principles for OER design

Problems identified                             Guiding principles for OER-enabled solution

Intimidating content-heavy traditional textbooks Tightly focused scope, exclude unnecessary detail

Discipline-wide and global learning problem     Choose permissive open license to enable reuse

The harmonious relationship between this project's purpose, principles, and outcomes resulted in strong
OEP alignment with all the reward criteria discussed earlier in Table 1.

This led to several career recognition achievements for the lead author (Julian Pakay) such as:

  · Successful CAUL grant application
  · Being commissioned by two biochemistry journals to write articles on OER
  · Attracting two cross-institutional co-authors
  · 12,500 web engagements; 5,633 visitors; 2,480 downloads
  · International recognition through three glowing reviews on Open Textbook Library

Julian also won a Scientific Education Award in Australian biochemistry by applying similar problem-
focused OER design methods for an earlier project, Foundations of Biomedical Science: Quantitative
Literacy Theory and Problems.

Example 2 - Becoming a Climate Conscious Lawyer

In this example, we demonstrate how OER projects can scale up impact by seeding themselves inside larger
practice-based interventions to enhance existing project goals. In this case, the educational intervention is
not merely a "new open textbook", but rather a sweeping project called Climate Conscious Lawyers led by
legal educators and practitioners. It aims to fundamentally change the nature of Australian legal education
by mainstreaming climate change considerations into it.
                            ALIGNING OPEN EDUCATION PROGRAMS WITH ACADEMIC REWARD AND RECOGNITION | 34

Our open textbook Becoming a Climate Conscious Lawyer forms a key part of this, but was itself generated
by the preceding foundational project phase to systematically understand the problem through a national
survey of law academics. This created strong clarity of purpose for the second phase to develop Becoming
a Climate Conscious Lawyer as the `core content' OER responding to the climate change teaching gaps
expressed by the survey respondents.
This OER is powered by an unusually large group of practitioners (many recruited as authors from the
survey contact list) because the project's problem-focused clarity resonates with their collective values
and teaching experiences. This group has formed an emerging community of practice generated by their
passion for solving this problem (see Figure 4).

                                   Figure 4: Collective passion for solving a problem
                                   brings together a community of practice by La

                                   to image description]

Climate Conscious Lawyers is a project that uses OER as one of its three primary tools (see Figure 5). It is
an expansive OEP-powered project to solve problems in legal education at scale, rather than a standalone
OER production project. This is a more holistic approach where OER production serves a greater purpose
than itself.

Impact evaluation follows from problem focus

Establishing a clear problem to be solved made it easier to assess OEP project impact. Evaluation methods
follow directly from the problem-focused OER ideation phase. Like any other teaching intervention, it
boils down to these questions:

  · Based on our goals established to solve the problem, how do we know if the intervention worked?
  · Did it work?
At this point, things came full circle to solve an unexpected earlier dilemma. We observed that our most
engaged practitioners shared a common general process:
 1. Identify a phenomenon within teaching and learning
 2. Develop a hypothesis about the phenomenon
 3. Run a controlled teaching intervention to test the hypothesis
 4. Evaluate the intervention's impact in these terms
Sure looks like a scientific experiment to us!
This simple formula generates a multitude of open publications and artefacts that directly address common
institutional priorities around supporting the scholarship of learning and teaching (e.g. research-in-practice
                            ALIGNING OPEN EDUCATION PROGRAMS WITH ACADEMIC REWARD AND RECOGNITION | 36

conference talks, journal papers on the teaching intervention, datasets, and other outputs). This process
began as an OER evaluation method, but accidentally created a solution for our original problem: aligning
OEP with reward and recognition incentives.

The process is the point: transforming practice

Our reflective practice through our `retrospective' workshops has organically grounded our open education
program in a concept we keep returning to: `process as pedagogy'. For us, this refers to how OEP acts as
a learning experience in itself that transforms practitioners and changes how they relate to their teaching
practices and students.

Influenced by our exposure to Indigenous Australian thinkers and worldviews (Yunkaporta, 2019), we
started to question our traditional focus on the outputs, and examine the richness of the creative process
itself (see Table 3). Most of the academics we collaborate with are transformed by the process of creating
open textbooks and other OERs. What if the process is the point?

Table 3: Two different process models, two different starting points, two different ends

Resource-centric model  Practice-centric model

Identify topic          Identify problem and possible solution

Write content           Find collaborators
                        Form community of practice

Publish content         Publish content

Measure usage           Evaluate impact of solution

                        Discuss and publish about intervention and impact

                        Adjust teaching in response to findings

We observed that the OER development process is enriched by progressively circulating new iterations
of content to find collaborators, attract feedback, and form a community of practice that orbits the
project. This insight drove us to revise our traditional approach to `book promotion' that was originally a
discrete post-publication launch phase. We replaced this with a cycle of continuous engagement that begins
disseminating an initiative as soon as a project proposal is formalised.

Here is a sketch of this new process to help prospective open practitioners understand where everything fits
in (see Figure 6):
37 | ALIGNING OPEN EDUCATION PROGRAMS WITH ACADEMIC REWARD AND RECOGNITION

 Figure 6: Different elements of an OE project overlap rather than being entirely sequential.
 Engagement continues through most of the life of the project by La Trobe University Library, licensed
 under CC BY [Go to image description]

But what happens after evaluation? If the evaluation finds that the resource needs to be amended or added
to, someone from the community we have created might want to amend it. The process is, in fact, a never-
ending cycle (see Figure 7):

                               Figure 7: The project timeline becomes circular, with
                               use and evaluation providing insights that fuel the next

                               CC BY [Go to image description]

What we learned

Bringing together all these elements, we believe we have resolved a number of challenges:
  · Time management: The best way to tackle time management challenges is to reframe the problem
      by focusing on practitioners' existing priorities and motivations. Open education projects are
                            ALIGNING OPEN EDUCATION PROGRAMS WITH ACADEMIC REWARD AND RECOGNITION | 38

      uniquely capable of aligning with both intrinsic and extrinsic motivation. However, this requires
      situating OER development as a means to achieving greater ends that are meaningful to practitioners
      for solving an existing identified problem, rather than being an end in itself isolated from bigger
      priorities.
  · Motivation: Most educators are intrinsically motivated to improve their experience of learning and
      teaching, both for themselves and their students. Empowering these practices is more effective than
      focusing on a `publishing output', especially when advocates connect the dots between OEP and
      learning and teaching reward criteria. If the purpose is clearly aligned with evaluation planning, this
      naturally generates scholarship of learning and teaching outputs, which comes full circle to feed
      extrinsic motivation by publishing research.
  · Impact: When practitioners frame their OER planning in a problem-focused way, evaluating the
      impact of the resource will follow naturally from this. Sharing evidence of impact will also drive
      adoption by other practitioners.
  · Engagement: The OER development process generates more than the primary OER output it
      publishes. The concept of `process as output' can continuously engage other educators and build an
      emerging community of practice. This group can collectively contribute and serve as enthusiastic
      early adopters rather than a new audience to whom we have to `cold sell' the resource.
  · Reward and recognition: OERs align poorly with criteria for research publication classification.
      By contrast, they are a natural fit with learning and teaching focused academic reward systems (when
      paired with synergistic teaching practices). Problem-focused OER design is more likely to create
      impact and enable evaluation, which in turn positions practitioners to fulfil recognition criteria
      related to evidencing scholarship of learning and teaching.

We started by thinking about how to attract authors and ended up in an unexpected place! The answer
was essentially to turn our assumptions on their head: Academic reward and recognition follows on from
addressing clear educational goals, engaging with educators in the field, and measuring the impact
of the project.

   In practice

     Our paradigm shift in thinking means we are now focused on overhauling our existing program
     and processes to ensure that we:

         1. Connect with the diverse existing priorities of academics by demonstrating how
             OEP can address these. Achieve this by promoting a multi-pronged spectrum of open
39 | ALIGNING OPEN EDUCATION PROGRAMS WITH ACADEMIC REWARD AND RECOGNITION

             education benefits and avoiding narrow advocacy strategies.
         2. Prioritise support for teaching-focused staff to develop themselves as holistic

             open practitioners. Systematically integrate reflexive practices into OER development
             (rather than a single-minded focus on quantitative OER production).
         3. Identify specific teaching problems and formulate measurable goals that will solve
             these problems. Use this to generate meaningful motivation and guiding principles to
             drive projects.
         4. Connect the dots to align OEP programs with criteria for learning and teaching
             grants, awards, and promotions, rather than research publication classification
             criteria.

     Inspired by Anna Rubinowski and Lauren Halcomb-Smith's workshop on rubrics at the 2024
     VALA conference, we are developing a rubric to guide how we critically assess new open
     education project proposals. In the spirit of OEP, we are sharing our current iteration - we
     encourage you to provide feedback or adapt it.

UOW LIBRARY: IN-STEP WITH OUR
ACADEMIC COMMUNITY

   University of Wollongong

   Samantha Hutchinson; Christina Salopek; and Susan Jones

Overview

This case study demonstrates how the University of Wollongong (UOW) librarians advocate for the
adoption of Open Educational Resources (OER) to the academic teaching and learning community. We
take a strengths-based approach to showcasing their value, impact, and benefits in enhancing accessibility
and enriching the broader suite of resources available to support teaching, learning and research needs.

In 2023, the UOW Library commenced a deep dive into the open scholarship supports and services
available to our academic community. UOW is committed to creating knowledge for a better world and
empowering students for their future as clearly articulated in the institution's 2020-2025 Strategic Plan.
The project is directly aligned with our goal of making it easy to find, use and create content, and UOW's
institutional commitment to the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals.

The UOW Library has 56.3 FTE (Full-Time Equivalent) staff and our Liaison Services team consists of the
following:

  · The Learning & Engagement (L&E) team, with 3.8 FTE staff, are focused on supporting the
      teaching & learning (T&L) endeavours of UOW academics.

  · The Research & Engagement (R&E) team, with 5.4 FTE staff, are focused on supporting researchers
      and the institution's research excellence goals.

As a Library, we have transitioned from a transactional relationship with academics and students, towards
one of deep understanding across the research and teaching and learning lifecycles. Integral to this work
is an evidence-based and user-centred approach, partnering with our academic and student community to
collaboratively advance open scholarship from all perspectives.
45 | UOW LIBRARY: IN-STEP WITH OUR ACADEMIC COMMUNITY

   Using this case study

     In this chapter, we examine:
          · How UOW Library is building awareness, interest, and appetite in partnership with our
             academic community while ensuring the sustainability of this work
          · Library advocacy to lift the profile of open educational resources (OER) benefits as part of
             the suite of resources clearly aligned to the teaching and learning agenda at UOW
          · Lessons learnt from the early adopters at other institutions
          · How to leverage existing relationships, and build new ones, across faculty and
             professional units at UOW.

Key stakeholders

Initially, the key stakeholders of the scoping project included the Library, the Research Services Office
(RSO), and the Graduate School of Research (GRS).
As the project progressed, it became evident that our stakeholders extended across three distinct cohorts:

  · Library staff, in particular the Learning and Engagement, Resource Sharing, and Collection
      Development teams, who interact directly with academics regarding resources used for teaching and
      research purposes;

  · Academic staff, particularly subject coordinators managing large student enrolments and essential
      textbooks and resources for their subjects;

  · UOW students who need access to essential library resources for their studies and who encounter
      issues, particularly with limited or restricted access to high-demand resources relevant to their
      subjects.

The success of the scoping project was driven by the active involvement of our academic community. Their
perspectives and insights were integral to shaping our collaborative approach to the adoption of OER for
teaching, learning and research purposes.
We recognised the importance of partnering with academics to achieve the best and most equitable
outcomes for students. Ensuring this approach was sustainable and scalable has been a central focus
throughout the project's development and implementation.

Background information

The Library-led initiative responded to a pressing need for equitable, accessible, open, and cost-neutral
learning experiences, as highlighted by feedback from academics and students facing difficulties in accessing
many of their subject's essential learning materials.

The scoping project emerged in response to concerns and frustrations expressed by UOW academics
and students especially during peak periods in the academic calendar. Staff and students continually
encountered barriers to information such as restrictive user license models for ebooks, limited availability
of required editions for essential texts, and challenges students faced in purchasing costly textbooks.
Data from the Library's Chat service (Ref Analytics) further underscored the need; revealing a consistent
demand for ebooks required by large undergraduate and postgraduate coursework cohorts for assessment
tasks and tutorial participation. These issues hinder effective learning and raise equity concerns, as the cost
and accessibility of textbooks disproportionately impacts students.

Academics, particularly those interested in exploring alternative and complementary resources, expressed
a growing curiosity and interest in the OER model to alleviate these access challenges and to enrich and
align with their subjects in an open and equitable manner. However, the distributed nature of the OER
landscape posed difficulties for faculty to navigate without adequate support. The Library recognised the
importance of engaging OER advocates or champions to guide their peers in adopting open resources, thus
addressing some of these challenges and fostering a more equitable and supportive learning environment.

Project description

The project aimed to elevate the profile of OER among UOW academics by encouraging the adoption of
existing OER, with the long-term goal of inspiring the UOW academic community to adapt or create their
own OER.

In 2022, the L&E team developed an introductory OER library guide as part of the Library's Services
for Teaching and Learning online supports. This guide introduced academics to the concept and benefits
of OER, how OER differs from open access resources as part of a holistic approach to developing and
understanding the application of open licensing and to highlight key OER discovery platforms. Academics
were also encouraged to seek further assistance from the team to identify suitable OER in their subject area.

A key element of the approach is our tactical communications strategy, to integrate the OER agenda and its
benefits into the annual communication channels of the L&E team. These communications were adapted
for different contexts and included:

  · Faculty Education Committee reports
  · Presentations to Schools and Faculty
  · Individual conversations with academics and subject coordinators.
47 | UOW LIBRARY: IN-STEP WITH OUR ACADEMIC COMMUNITY

These conversations centred on partnering to identify suitable resources from both the Library's collections
and authoritative OER repositories to support new and existing subject reading lists.

Further, L&E librarians shared success stories of assisting academics across various disciplines in searching
for and curating potential OER for their specific subject needs back into our academic community. Our
work as part of a broader open research project actively asked about use of open resources in both the T&L
and research contexts, and throughout the project, the team actively pursued identifying OER champions
to foster ongoing collaboration with us and to connect them with resources of interest within a sector-wide
OER landscape.

Key outcomes

While our progress in identifying OER champions took longer than anticipated, we are pleased to
acknowledge and celebrate the successes we have achieved so far. One recent example is a first year History
subject featuring a World History OER textbook chapter as a key reading. We share these examples of Open
Pedagogy within, and beyond, the Library to raise awareness and support for Open Educational Practice
(OEP) across the institution.

Looking forward, we aim to enhance the visibility of OER within the Library's SEARCH (UOW Library's
main catalogue) results. We are adding openly available resource lists to our discipline-based library guides
and investigating the creation of distinct collections within our catalogue to highlight these materials to our
staff and student communities. This work will better position these resources alongside our subscription-
based and licensed resources. This integration will further support our goal of making OER, and other
openly available content, a more prominent and accessible option for academics. This work aligns with
Goal 1 of UOW's 2020-2025 Strategic Plan of empowering students for their future (University of
Wollongong 2023), a Library goal of making it easy to find, use and create content, and Goal 4 of the
United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) Quality Education, which fundamentally focuses
on the provision of more inclusive and equitable access to educational materials.

To strengthen our communication efforts and support for academics, the L&E team plans to leverage our
information literacy expertise in threshold concepts and scaffolded learning. We aim to refresh and improve
the current OER library guide (as of August 2024) alongside the section on ordering new resources and
how we clarify issues, concepts and relationships surrounding the often confusing world of copyright,
Public Domain, open access, and OER. By incorporating a range of communication methodologies,
we hope to clarify and better illustrate key concepts to aid our end-users' understanding of options
for navigating resource issues, such as the complexity and limitations of commercially licensed ebooks
compared to the openness and flexibility of OER and other materials available using Creative Commons
licenses. These enhancements will better equip the team in our one-on-one consultations with academics,
particularly as they prepare for new teaching sessions. Additionally, we will continue to seek opportunities
to engage and support the growing pool of dedicated OER champions.
                                                                     UOW LIBRARY: IN-STEP WITH OUR ACADEMIC COMMUNITY | 48

Learnings and recommendations

As a small team, relative to other University libraries in Australia, we took an approach of capacity building,
awareness raising and tactical communication strategies as our first position. Coupled with our exceptional
relationship building expertise, a reputation for positivity, enthusiasm, and a solutions-focused approach,
we have taken an incremental approach. This approach is situated in pragmatism - it is essential that we
develop a sustainable and scalable approach for both the UOW Library and our academic community.

This work underscores the importance of being consistently aware and empathetic toward how academics
perceive resource issues in their discipline and how they might respond to our well-intentioned approaches.
Academics appreciate access to our expertise and guidance; but for many academics initially navigating and
making headway in the OER environment this can still be an `on top of' versus `instead of' way of curating
learning resources. We have learned that they will expect and value practical measures of support.

Champions statements

       This project underscored the value of collaboration and communication towards building
       strong partnerships and maintaining clear communication with key stakeholders.
       Developing cross-institutional partnerships was particularly valuable, as it enabled us to
       connect with other academic libraries to address central concerns and have a forum to
       discuss our questions regarding planning and strategising best-practices for OER adoption
       and implementation. These partnerships allowed us to explore both successes and
       challenges, gaining a deeper understanding of the complexities involved in advocating for
       OER. Fostering collaborative internal and external partnerships was pivotal in shaping our
       advocacy strategies for OER within the academic community. This included enhancing the
       visibility and understanding of OER across various communication platforms, such as Faculty
       Education Committees and more informal faculty-based newsletters, where the concept,
       value, and benefits of OER were shared.
       The role of the L&E Librarian is uniquely positioned to engage directly with our academic
       staff, facilitating meaningful, solution-driven conversations that listen to and act on
       addressing needs while offering realistic Library informed perspectives. We recognise and
       emphasise that OER should not be promoted in isolation, but rather within the broader
       context of licensed library resources and open access materials available to support
       academics with curating or developing relevant learning content and making it accessible to
       their students. This approach assists academics in understanding how OER can complement
       their teaching and their students' learning needs. We carefully consider the language and
49 | UOW LIBRARY: IN-STEP WITH OUR ACADEMIC COMMUNITY

       imagery we use when discussing OER, especially when helping to guide academics new to
       teaching, for example:

            · What language and phrases might an early career academic use when discussing
                these types of resources?

            · What images come to their mind when we as librarians mention terms such as `OER'?
       This ensures that our conversations are supportive and align with the academics in their
       understanding, rather than projecting our own knowledge as librarians navigating the
       digital information environment.

   In practice

     Advice to share:
          · Implementing OEP requires a tactical and collaborative approach. Drawing from our
             experience, we recommend beginning with professional development opportunities, such
             as the CAUL (Council of Australian University Librarians) OER Professional Development
             Program. Professional development initiatives are invaluable for building foundational
             knowledge and skills central to building awareness and advocacy towards a
             transformational and equitable model of learning. Do not underestimate how your
             learnings can influence colleagues in your library and help them to develop and deepen
             their own understanding. Reciprocity is essential, and we embrace this principle at UOW
             Library.
          · Engaging the academic community early is essential to build an appetite of awareness
             and interest for the benefits, value, and impact of OER on teaching, learning and
             research. Advocacy through a community of library OER champions ensures academics
             understand our role in leading and supporting OER initiatives and are supported by UOW
             librarians' expertise. It is important to consider the student experience and student voice
             and use evidence of persistent access issues to build a compelling case for OEP. Aligning
             the library's approach in building awareness for OER with the institution's strategic goals,
             particularly around equity and the principles of the Australian Universities Accord,
                                                                     UOW LIBRARY: IN-STEP WITH OUR ACADEMIC COMMUNITY | 50

             strengthens advocacy efforts.
          · Practical support is highly valued by academic staff, for example assisting with locating

             existing OER, often more than access to expertise alone. Therefore, it is important to be
             realistic about the scale of what can be achieved and maintained. Providing tangible
             assistance that addresses immediate needs fosters stronger engagement with OEP
             initiatives. Additionally, utilising the library's digital environment to drive evidence-based
             decision-making is crucial. Analysing data on textbook inaccessibility and publisher
             restrictions helps inform OEP strategies and builds broader support within the institution.
          · Finally, never underestimate the value of reward and recognition, both within your
             institution and the sector. In 2023 the Library initiated an Open Access Week Award, and
             as OER adoption and creation increase we will consider the initiation of an OER Award.

SUPPORTING OER ADOPTION THROUGH
A GRANT PROGRAM

   Deakin University

   Angie Williamson

Overview

The use of Open Educational Resources (OER) in teaching and learning in higher education can benefit
both students and academic staff. Just as there are many places to find OER, there are just as many ways
in which OER can be incorporated into teaching and learning activities. The Deakin University OER
grant program enables academics to explore OER available in their discipline or to develop new resources,
and to use these in their practice. Although the program also supports academics to develop new OER,
the purpose of this case study is to demonstrate the various ways in which academics can be supported
by a centralised program to incorporate adopted OER into teaching and learning. While developing a
new resource can be rewarding, reusing and adapting resources can be similarly rewarding as these open
practices can deliver significant cost savings for students with a lesser time commitment.

   Using this case study

     While the examples included in this chapter have been supported by a grant program, this case
     study aims to provide ideas for the adoption of OER in practice. These ideas can be actioned
     with or without the support of a centralised program. Librarians, academics and learning
     designers could use this case study to formulate ideas for their own practice for the adoption of
     OER and as examples that could be used in advocating for the adoption of OER.

Key stakeholders

An OER Grant Program requires collaboration from key stakeholders across the institution. The
successful delivery of high quality projects results from collaborative partnerships between faculty staff,
library staff including the Open Education Librarian and the Copyright Team, and other third space
55 | SUPPORTING OER ADOPTION THROUGH A GRANT PROGRAM

practitioners such as learning designers. While the staff are main collaborators in the OER program, the
key stakeholder group at the centre of the OER adoption projects are the students. Students can benefit
greatly from an OER adoption projects. Research has shown in addition to decreases costs for students
in purchasing textbooks, moving to an open textbook improves access to resources increasing student
retention (Bol 2021) and success (Colvard 2018).

The grant program

The Deakin OER grant program commenced in 2021 to support staff to develop capability in open
practices that remove barriers for diverse learners (Hamilton and Hansen, 2024). OER can be used in units
and courses in many ways from including an individual resource such as a section of text or an image
into learning resources, to converting all resources in a unit or course to OER. Moving to open resources
can require substantial amounts of time and work. Locating suitable resources and including these in the
learning environment to achieve the required pedagogical outcome can require time, as well as learning
design expertise and technical skill. Providing support to academics and professional staff to complete
this work can increase the movement towards greater OER usage while supporting the skills development
required for open practice and increasing positive experiences for students.

At the commencement of the program, the library team had a steep learning curve in program
development. At the time, in the library there was minimal understanding of the Australian open
educational environment. Identifying this need, environmental scanning of other institutional programs
was conducted and numerous resources were consulted to understand the process of establishing and
conducting a program. Of particular relevance was the OER Adoption Pyramid (Trotter & Cox, 2016)
that demonstrated the complexity of implementing an OER program at an institutional level. As the
program proceeded, individuals' awareness and capacity levels increased as anticipated in the OER
Adoption Pyramid but as an Institution, multiple infrastructure questions and development needed to be
addressed. These were resolved through collaborations and internal development.

Adoption examples from the grant program

Through the grant program, Deakin has supported academics in locating, adopting and adapting OER for
use in units, in addition to OER creation projects. This case study focuses on adoption with three exemplar
projects to showcase the considerations for these practices. Adopted resources may need to be altered to fit
the teaching need and so also included here are some additional ideas involving adaptation of OER.

Example 1 - Moving from a commercial textbook to an open
textbook

A common project type supported by the grant program involves assisting an academic to move from
a commercial text to an open textbook. Drivers typically associated with these projects include saving
students' money, limited library access to commercially published texts and the suitability of commercial
texts to the teaching need. Commercial texts may be too complex or too simple for the unit content
or may contain too much content to cover in a unit. With OER texts, the resource can be adapted to
suit the needs. While making the change from one textbook to another may sound easy, modern higher
education learning management systems and educational practices can influence the complexity of change.
Additionally, commercial publishers often provide ancillary resources to accompany a textbook such as
57 | SUPPORTING OER ADOPTION THROUGH A GRANT PROGRAM

slides, videos or question banks. These may need to be created when changing from a commercial to an
open textbook, expanding the scope of the project.

Through the grant program, academics were supported to locate an open text (if they did not have one in
mind already), make changes to unit sites and develop supporting resources. Often the grant was used to
fund academic hours or learning designer participation in projects to complete the work. Library support
provided as part of the program for these projects has included capability building in searching for OER
and providing copyright advice.

Example 2 - Including content from an open textbook into a unit
site

With similar motivational drivers to example 1, another type of adoption project supported by the grant
program includes the incorporation of OER content into a learning management system. These projects
can benefit from aligning an OER conversion project with a subject review or upgrade. As an alternative to
setting an OER as a textbook for a unit, the content is included directly into the unit site as permitted by
the Creative Commons licences with appropriate attributions. This integrates all of the learning content in
the one location, removing the need for students to move between different resources.

Through the grant program, academics are supported to locate suitable resources and map these to the
topics and learning outcomes, identifying where the sections of the OER can be used in the unit site.
Similar to the example 1, library support for these projects includes training on searching for OER, reusing
content, developing attributions and copyright advice.

Example 3 - Remixing open texts for a large science unit

An extension of the adoption of OER involves the adoption and subsequent adaptation of OER. In cases
where there may be more than one relevant text or where the unit involves cross-disciplinary learning, a
single text may not fit the needs of a unit. Projects of this type can include the assembly of chapters into a
resource or the more granular incorporation of OER content such as images or paragraphs into a resource.
These projects can be complicated and involve the tracking of where content has come from, and reworking
to assemble content into a coherent resource. Different OER have different writing styles and original
content is also required to provide linkages between the adopted content. Projects of this type may be more
time intensive and through the grant program, funds are commonly used for additional academic time.

As part of the grant program, these projects require extensive copyright advice alongside additional library
support with training on searching and reusing content.

Other project types

The grant program has also supported additional adoption projects including the sourcing of resources
                                                                   SUPPORTING OER ADOPTION THROUGH A GRANT PROGRAM | 58

other than textbooks for inclusion in a unit site. Library support for these projects involves searching
advice, training and copyright advice.

Increasing OER usage through an institutional program

If an institutional program supports adoption projects, an awareness of project types and flexibility in
program processes can contribute to a successful program. Adoption projects can be smaller projects such
as reusing learning activities requiring a lesser time commitment or larger projects such as adopting an OER
textbook. For academics considering the conversion of an entire unit or course to using OER resources,
this can be strategically included as part of a subject review, course review or initiation of a new course.
Understanding the unit and course review cycle at the institution can inform program coordinators of
suitable times to seek grant or project applications.

From our grant program experience, some techniques for encouraging the move to OER can be:

  · When searching for resources at any time in the unit lifecycle, check out the OER repositories and
      search engines first - you may find the perfect resources, saving the time and effort of developing the
      resource. Existing OER may also provide additional ideas for activities or learning experiences from a
      different perspective that may increase the inclusiveness in the course.

  · Focus on a particular section or problem. By breaking it down into smaller sections, the task doesn't
      seem as overwhelming. Using a mapping document for the course and curating a list of OER that
      may suit your need.

  · Get help! Approach your librarians, learning designers or learning support team for help. Librarians
      are expert searchers for resources and can assist in locating suitable resources.

Grant program support services

Adoption of OER can save academic time and students money, but there are barriers to OER adoption
including:

  · Awareness of OER - OER advocacy and awareness raising activities can be incorporated into grant
      program objectives

  · Unavailability of time in work allocation of academic staff - a grant program may support the hire of
      additional staff to enable an academic to focus on OER project work

  · Skills required to incorporate or adapt OER - the grant program may facilitate collaborations
      between areas of the institution, developing connections between those that can help with projects.

As part of the Deakin OER grant program, services provided by the library to address these barriers
included:
59 | SUPPORTING OER ADOPTION THROUGH A GRANT PROGRAM

  · Training on OER basics and OER searching
  · Format and platform advice
  · Accessibility information and advice
  · Checking the copyright and Creative Commons licence compliance
  · Specialist skills required for project work including video and image editing or the development of

      interactive content.

The library also conducted a Community of Practice (CoP) for staff on grant teams. The CoP enabled
connections to be made between practitioners, provided an avenue to ask questions of the group and to
receive advice on any issues, or just to talk through what they were doing to get feedback from the group.
The Community of practice was attended by the grant teams and representatives from the library including
librarians, learning designers and the copyright team. As the grant program progressed, some of these
sessions were open to past years' grant recipients. By introducing the voice of experience, issues similar to
those previously experienced and questions such as impact measurement could be discussed.

Measuring program impact

As with any program, the impact needs to be measurable to ensure the program's sustainability. OER
adoptions can provide numerous data points to develop a narrative on the impact of the program
including:

  · Student cost savings if moving from commercial text
  · Student feedback
  · Student surveys
  · Academic testimonials.

   In practice

     Questions to consider in your practice from this case study include:
          · Is my institution/library leadership ready to consider establishing a grant program? Who
             is best positioned to establish a program? Where will the funds come from?
          · What support could the library provide to encourage the adoption of OER? Is there
             capacity available to do this?

AN EXHILARATING EVOLUTION

   University of Southern Queensland

   Dr Wendy Hargreaves

Overview

Open Education Resources (OER) are celebrated for sharing knowledge further than ever before across
the digital world. Remixed OER have the bonus of being quick to produce. With our eyes captivated on
Open Education Resources (OER)moving far and fast, we may overlook another remarkable motion
spinning within OER themselves: the same technology and licensing that enables easy dissemination also
accelerates the potential rate of revision. The switch from fixed, hard-copy textbooks to author-controlled,
publishing platforms produces exciting opportunities for writers to refine their work across multiple,
frequent iterations. Such potential for rapid change invites the question, if remixed OER can evolve
quickly, what measures can creators take at conception to enable a positive, long-term development?
To answer this question, I trace my experiences as leader of a team who produced four iterations of the
remixed open textbook Academic Success (Hargreaves et al., 2021) over four years. I share pragmatically
my learnings about growth, change and time when I switched from regarding Academic Success as a single,
fixed publication to a living, continually-evolving, educational resource. I present six recommendations
that future creative teams may incorporate in their own resources to smooth development.

   Using this case study

     This case study demonstrates how the benefits of team-created remixed OER can be increased
     by incorporating the following six recommendations to facilitate the long-term development of
     resources:

          · Create a Writing Guidelines document
          · Create an Authorship Policy for contributors
          · Create an Editorial Board
          · Include a version history in the resource
65 | AN EXHILARATING EVOLUTION

          · Decide whether to retain or change URLs for resource revisions
          · Create a spreadsheet for storing and mapping the resource's possible futures.

Background information and stakeholders

In 2020, the University of Southern Queensland (UniSQ) offered an internal grant to encourage staff to
produce open textbooks. From this funding, I was contracted for nine weeks as Project Lead of a team
of learning advisors to remix Baldwin's (2021) text College Success into a textbook on academic skills for
Australian tertiary students. My responsibilities involved reconceptualising the aim and structure of College
Success; making editorial decisions on existing content; overseeing new content created by our team; and
managing a short production timeline. For a detailed description of production, please see Hargreaves and
Howarth (2022).

Academic Success began as a short, time-limited project, however I soon realised it need not be viewed
with the finality of conventional publications. Ideas that I discarded due to time constraints could be
resurrected only weeks after publication. A combination of instant, digital self-publishing and the speed of
incorporating remixed content, altered my perception of the book as a single project to an ongoing iterative
series. Our team could benefit from the ease and speed of revising, while students could benefit from a
continually improving book.

Project description

Once I re-envisaged Academic Success as a living publication, previous work was renamed Iteration 1. The
book has undergone a further two iterations since, and a fourth is in progress. (See Table 1 for an overview.)
Each iteration begins inviting authors to revise old or pitch new content. Authors then work offline on
their chapters, undertake a review process and incorporate changes. New chapters are inputted and released
publicly on a nominated date while revisions are inputted progressively over several days.

Key outcomes

Iteration 1 of Academic Success met the brief for an Australian remixed textbook on academic skills. From
February 2023 to August 2024 alone, the book received over 154 900 unique page views. Referrals to
the book grew across iterations from a handful of academics recommending it to students, to it being
embedded automatically as a recommended reading in all our university courses via the Learning
Management System. The book is also utilised daily by learning advisors in student consultations and
workshops.

Iteration 4 of Academic Success is currently in production. This release will extend student input in two
ways. First, a new chapter will present student stories drawn from a student experience survey, expanding
67 | AN EXHILARATING EVOLUTION

on the quotes previously interspersed through the book. Secondly, five open content video skits written by
students will be embedded in the book to illustrate concepts.

The relevant key outcome in this case study, however, is not the book's future direction nor its positive
reception, but the implementation of systems and structures that I will describe that have enabled fluid
evolution.

Learnings and recommendations

My observations of Academic Success since conception offer insights on how to facilitate the development
of remixed OER in three areas: growth, change and time.

Growth

The number of UniSQ contributors to Academic Success increased from 16 to 38 over four years.
Maintaining a consistent writing style and format with a sizeable team required effort. The Writing
Guidelines document I created in Iteration 1 circumvented repetitive conversations with new contributors
in subsequent iterations. In hindsight, the guidelines could have also included an explanation of Creative
Commons licence levels; instructions on writing attributions; and links for finding remixable resources.

Next, I created an Authorship Policy to address the order of authors' names in a chapter. A conventional
"level of contribution" rule is unworkable in remixed OER when valuing one author's small input of new
text against another author's large input of edited, remixed text. The policy stated that co-authors would
choose their order jointly and use alphabetical order if conflicted. More importantly, the policy explained
that the altruistic and collaborative spirit of OER should flavour negotiations.

Across four years, the book's content grew from 18 chapters to a startling 28. The restrictions of
production costs that normally curtail length in conventional publishing were absent. "Adding more" was
simple, fast and cheap. The new challenge became retaining a clear vision of the book's scope. For example,
for Iteration 4, a potential contributor proposed a chapter on one specific student cohort. The editorial
board declined it because it would open the gates for chapters on every student cohort, ultimately shifting
the emphasis from the book's primary purpose. I was reminded, however, that OER, by nature, unlock
possibilities. The author could produce their own derivative of Academic Success that remixes the entire
book for the cohort and includes the proposed chapter.

Change

The expedited growth of Academic Success sparked administrative changes. From Iteration 3, my
designation as Project Lead of co-contributors changed to Lead Editor of a three-member editorial board.
                                                                                                              AN EXHILARATING EVOLUTION | 68

In application, I performed the same duties, however I appreciated the recognition and valued accessing the
combined wisdom of a board.

With an editorial board, Academic Success' future as an ongoing publication seemed more assured than
depending on one person's employment. Indeed, employment changes prompted challenges in author
attribution too. Iteration 3 brought a new contributor who wanted to heavily revise a chapter from an
author who departed. Theoretically, as Baldwin was clearly acknowledged as the original source, we could
have replaced our old author's name with the new. In practice, it felt disloyal, particularly knowing that the
departing member cited his chapter in his publications list for his new job. The situation was resolved by
including both members as co-authors of the chapter. Admittedly, endlessly extending the list of authors
is not an elegant solution for iterative publishing. Consequently, from Iteration 3, we incorporated a
version history in the back matter of Academic Success to acknowledge all authors and their contributions.
Retrospectively, it would have been ideal to have included a version history from Iteration 1 and state
clearly in the Authorship Policy how we would acknowledge departing authors' work.

Changing chapters created other challenges for the book. New chapters were prepared privately then
released publicly on specified dates, while revisions were inputted live across several days. For Iteration
2, I considered briefly duplicating chapters, revising them offline then releasing them publicly, but that
required using new Uniform Resource Locators (URL), which would break the hyperlinks embedded
throughout the university. Consequently, I opted for live editing on nominated dates with sufficient staff
assigned to assist. Strategically, Academic Success was released in iterations rather than editions specifically
to retain the same URL. Not only were the hyperlinks secured but data on book usage was accumulative,
which looked more convincing when leveraging support and building recognition.

Time

When I changed from viewing Academic Success as a mortal book to an infinite publication, I discovered
interim strategies for enabling long-term ideas. For example, when the chapter Working with Information
expanded, the content on academic integrity was moved to its own, temporarily-short chapter in Iteration
2. For Iteration 3, it was expanded to full length and included a new, timely discussion on artificial
intelligence.

My experiences with Academic Success taught me to consider immediate and distant timelines
simultaneously. I managed the deadlines of each iteration while also using a mapping spreadsheet to plan
for the future. For example, the idea of a glossary was conceived after Iteration 1 but not implemented until
Iteration 3. Forward thinking also included contemplating remixed derivatives. For example, the authors
of the chapter Maths Foundations wrote their chapter while discussing reusing its content for a dedicated
maths textbook. Currently, I cannot predict when or if Academic Success will finish evolving. The structures
I incorporated support its continuing development, and ideas for new content and revisions keep flowing.
69 | AN EXHILARATING EVOLUTION

6 Recommendations

Creating resources with a long game maximises the natural advantages of team-produced OER. Here are
six recommendations for enabling a smooth development:

 1. Create a Writing Guidelines document to instruct contributors on the resource's style, writing voice
      and Creative Commons licence type. Include an explanation of licences, instructions for writing
      attributions, and links for searching for reusable materials.

 2. Create an Authorship Policy for contributors. Include a discussion of the order of authors and how
      content is acknowledged when team members leave.

 3. Create an editorial board to share so that the longevity of the book is not dependent on a single
      person's presence.

 4. Include a version history in the resource to acknowledge all authors and their contributions.
 5. Decide whether to retain or change URLs for resource revisions. Consider the impact on data

      collection and sustaining hyperlinks.
 6. Create a spreadsheet for storing and mapping the resource's possible futures.

   In practice

     The change to regarding Academic Success as a living, ongoing publication was rewarding and
                                                                                                              AN EXHILARATING EVOLUTION | 70

     unleashed an exhilarating evolution at a speed foreign in academic publishing. It is a force worth
     harnessing.
     Reflect on this case study by considering the following in relation to your own practice:

          · Creators of remixed OER have an opportunity to maximise the advantages of digital
             publishing with remixing for greater impact.

          · Consider taking a long-term view of your resource at conception and implement the
             relevant recommendations even if your initial intent is for a single-issue resource.

TRANSFORMING OER: REPURPOSING
MOOCS TO MICROLEARNING USING
PRESSBOOKS

   Charles Darwin University

   Alison Lockley

Overview

Open education and sharing of Open Education Resources (OER) continues to evolve and adapt to
the changing educational technology landscape and learner expectations. This chapter explores a case
study documenting the transformation of two Charles Darwin University (CDU) Massive Open Online
Courses (MOOCs) into a series of open textbooks hosted on the Pressbooks publishing platform. These
open textbooks offer easy access to the OER materials in a variety of microlearning formats. No longer
constrained by course requirements, learners bypass the need to enrol or register to view learning materials,
which can be accessed at any time, and can complete as much or as little as they need. The ebook format
also offers flexibility and accessibility through a range of download formats, multimedia, and print options.

MOOCs and open textbooks share much in common, making the transformation a relatively
straightforward process. Both formats are fully online, open to anyone, and potentially reach a large
audience. MOOC materials are already attributed with Creative Commons licensing where appropriate,
and the existing course structure was key in informing the design and format of the ebook. A point
of difference, however, is MOOCs are designed with scaffolded activities and a form of recognition for
completion, which is not the case for open textbooks. Open textbooks provide organised information
around topics and act as a reference or just-in-time learning, rather than a course. While there are
opportunities to complete formative activities in open textbooks, these are not tracked but still provide
valuable review and reflection of learning. The ability to create a microlearning format in an open textbook,
including interactives and multimedia, allows for bite-sized learning around specific topics that can be
completed quickly in 5-15 minutes.

For CDU, OER ebooks provide an effective and efficient way to share valuable resources from
MOOCs that are no longer being formally offered. This case study illustrates how these MOOCs have been
reimagined to provide free microlearning opportunities and contribute to self-directed learning.

   Using this case study

     This chapter offers a way to preserve and share valuable resources from MOOCs that can be
     digested in a bite-sized format and support just-in-time learning.

Key stakeholders

The stakeholders directly involved with this project were a small team within the Education Strategy
portfolio at CDU. There was strategic support from the Pro Vice-Chancellor, Education Strategy, and
some liaison with subject matter experts who were involved in the original MOOCs, where possible.
The small project team consisted of three people:

  · Project Lead/Learning Designer, Alison Lockley (case study author)
  · Learning Designer, Karin Pfister
  · Learning Resource Developer, Erin Lawson.

Background

CDU strives to be both a user and contributor of OER through approaches to education and sharing
of information, with "openness" supported by strategic values and principles. CDU joined the early
MOOC movement with three courses developed and offered to the public between 2013 and 2017.
Like other MOOCs, they offered high-quality, accessible learning opportunities to a global audience (Lee
et. al, 2023), and provided spaces to explore innovative approaches and emerging technologies without
being constrained by accreditation requirements. With over 5000 students participating, the MOOCs also
provided a powerful means to enhance outreach and visibility of CDU, and an opportunity for learners to
get a taster for courses offered by the university.
In 2018, the external MOOC platform used by CDU was being decommissioned, prompting a need to
rehouse the existing material. Much effort and resourcing had gone into the MOOCs, they had received
great feedback and won a number of awards. Additionally, several CDU courses were leveraging parts of
the MOOCs, and there had been requests to continue to access materials. This prompted an exploration
of ways to continue to share the materials openly and cost-free to learners.
                             TRANSFORMING OER: REPURPOSING MOOCS TO MICROLEARNING USING PRESSBOOKS | 74

Several alternate MOOC platforms were initially explored, as was a pilot project to distribute the MOOCs
via Raspberry Pi for remote learners. Around the same time, CDU was investigating ebook platforms as
part of their OER strategy, and soon became the first university in Australia to sign an enterprise agreement
with the digital publishing platform Pressbooks. Looking closer at learner requirements, and considering
the overall value proposition for the university, Pressbooks emerged as the most suitable option for the
adaption of two of CDU's MOOCs.

About the two MOOCs

"Charles Darwin, Evolution and Tropical Australia" was CDU's first MOOC. Initially developed in
2013 and hosted by the great-great-grandson of Charles Darwin, Chris Darwin, this MOOC capitalised
on the research and expertise from the School of the Environment at CDU. This MOOC introduces
Charles Darwin, the theory of evolution, the esteemed naturalist Alfred Russel Wallace, biogeography,
and an overview of adaptation of tropical organisms in the Northern Territory of Australia. The MOOC
ran several times until 2016, notably supported by guest appearances from biannually appointed Charles
Darwin Scholars: Harvard University's Professor Janet Browne, in 2014; and Professors Peter and
Rosemary Grant from Princeton University in 2016.

        Figure 1: Banner image for the "Charles Darwin, Evolution and Tropical Australia" MOOC

"Who's Counting: An Interactive Introduction to Accounting" was developed by CDU and its
Chinese partner university, Anhui Normal University. Offered partially in Mandarin Chinese and fully in
English, the course was directed at students with little or no knowledge of accounting and incorporated
a wide variety of engaging and interactive resources, including practical activities to introduce everyday
accounting concepts. The MOOC used actors to embody different accounting roles, and presented an
engaging storytelling approach with practical activities.

Value proposition

Adapting MOOCs into open texts with Pressbooks offered a range of benefits to CDU including:

  · Easy access for learners: Open textbooks can be accessed and shared via a public link, without the
      requirement for a login or being restricted by course duration windows.

  · Learner preferences: Adults tend to prefer shorter, more informal educational activities rather than
      traditional, longer format courses (Bannister et al., 2020) as seen in the popularity of social media for
      curating and sharing information. A microlearning format for MOOC resources, housed in
      Pressbooks, addresses these preferences while still openly sharing the valuable MOOC resources

  · Just-in-time learning: Open texts support the many learners who only aim to build a certain
      knowledge base or upskill (Wang 2023) and are not motivated to complete an entire course.
      Microlearning can present significant benefits for learners in terms of improving engagement and
      attainment (Shatte & Teague, 2020) and for contributing to lifelong learning (Olivier, 2021).

  · Enhanced flexibility: Open texts in Pressbooks can contain a range of interactives and embedded
      multimedia, and can be downloaded in a range of digital formats for viewing at any time. Each page
      has a unique URL making it easy to reference or link for existing CDU users.

  · Sustainable educational resources: Open texts provide long-lasting digital resources that can be
      easily updated with new content. They can be used and shared with minimal support demands while
      reducing the need for physical printing.

  · Wider reach: The audience for the adapted MOOC resources can extend beyond course
      participants to a wider global audience.

  · Cost effective: CDU can leverage the Pressbooks system for creating the open texts as part of their
      annual subscription, without the need for additional hosting costs or support resources.

Project description

The project to adapt the two MOOCs had a relatively short timeframe of 3 months, set by the imminent
decommissioning of the current hosting platform. The project used a multi-stage approach based on the
commonly used ADDIE instructional design model (ISFET, 2024), with stages visualised in Figure 3 and
detailed in Table 1.

             Identify materials suitable to be adapted to ebook formats

2. Design    Select topics to be covered in each ebook. Topics were then distilled into focused sub-topics
             that could be easily digested in short periods, and independently accessed and completed

             Design each ebook structure, including chapters and sections

             Decide on content to be included and if changes need to be made to format to
             contextualise for ebook

             Plan the visual elements of each ebook

             Create ebook shells with basic structure

3. Develop   Copy content into ebooks and add/customise content as needed

             Adapt interactives and self-marking activities e.g. Articulate Storyline activities rebuilt in
             H5P

             Integrate visual elements, such as image, videos and theming

             Ensure media is optimised for ebook delivery and includes alternative text and attributions
             for multimedia

             Review and gather feedback from a sample of stakeholders (e.g. library, subject matter
             experts from MOOCs, learners) and make final amendments

Key outcomes

The project resulted in the development of four ebooks from the two MOOCs (Figure 4), all openly
licensed with the Creative Commons license CC BY SA.

 Figure 4: Book covers

Three ebooks were developed from the "Charles Darwin, Evolution and Tropical Australia" MOOC,
drawing content from all four modules of the course. The final resulting titles included:

 1. The Life of Charles Darwin
 2. Wallacea and Biogeography
 3. Evolution and Adaptation in the Monsoon Tropics
The most popular of these ebooks at the time of writing is "Evolution and Adaptation in the Monsoon
Tropics", which includes much of the video content created with CDU lecturers, and has been used by
several of the Environment Science courses at CDU.
One ebook was created from the "Who's Counting: An Interactive Introduction to Accounting" MOOC,
drawing content from only the first module of the course. The decision to just create one ebook was based
on the popularity and majority use of the first module, and the ownership of content to be freely shared as
OER by CDU in an open textbook.
All four ebooks contain microlearning activities, including multimedia and interactive quiz content (Figure
5).
79 | TRANSFORMING OER: REPURPOSING MOOCS TO MICROLEARNING USING PRESSBOOKS

 Figure 5: Sample ebook activities

The ebooks continue to be accessed by learners both within CDU and around the world, and undergo
regular review for usage analytics and link integrity (annually). The intended future direction is to look at
possible improvements for content, layout updates and new activities.

Project champion reflections

       "It was important to keep the learner experience in mind when taking something so large
       and re-imagining it as bite-sized chunks of learning. It was necessary to re-evaluate
       wording and context as it was no longer this long journey you were taking the learners on,
       but rather a brief experience that would engage them but also "close the loop" so to speak
       on some type of measurable learning outcome. The re-creating of interactives using H5P
       (originally created in Storyline) was an integral part of the process and such a great way to
       revisit what had been done originally and evaluate the usefulness or necessity of each
       component."

                -- Karin Pfister, Learning Designer
                      TRANSFORMING OER: REPURPOSING MOOCS TO MICROLEARNING USING PRESSBOOKS | 80

  "I remember the transfer process being fairly straightforward, given that most of the video
  content was already hosted on YouTube. However, I do remember the images being a pain
  to download and re-upload individually, because when we initially just copy-pasted over,
  they were linking back to where they were originally hosted on the Blackboard Open
  Education site. And then adding all the details for media attributions...! Obviously,
  Pressbooks is not designed to have all the same functionality as an LMS, so we also had to
  remove any of the activities that relied on discussion boards or actual facilitation/
  moderation by lecturers."

          -- Erin Lawson, Learning Resource Developer

In practice

Learnings and recommendations:
     · Open textbooks: Pressbooks is a highly recommended way to preserve and share
        valuable resources from MOOCs that are no longer being offered. Ebooks can be digested
        in a bite-sized format and better support just-in-time learning.
     · Structure: Consider how the MOOC materials will be scaffolded in the ebook publishing
        platform, and take time to plan the structure before starting to build. Maybe the content
        is distributed across several ebooks, not just one. Consider audience needs carefully,
        including accessibility, and ensure that there is a logical flow and presentation of
        materials.
     · Multimedia and learning activities: Interactivity in the digital environment is a key
        part of online learning. You may need to adapt or redesign original MOOC content to
        ensure there is multimedia and activities to support deeper learning. H5P enables the
        creation of interactive content within Pressbooks, allowing for the incorporation of
        quizzes, interactive timelines, and other engaging elements.
     · Discoverability: Think about how your audience will find and access the ebooks. Work
        with your library to ensure they are discoverable and included in applicable catalogues.
        You can also increase reach through public search engine indexing, sharing on open
        educational resource platforms, and promoting via accessible online channels.
81 | TRANSFORMING OER: REPURPOSING MOOCS TO MICROLEARNING USING PRESSBOOKS

          · Project resourcing: Allocate a realistic, flexible project timeline and draw on the
             strengths of a co-design team. You should also assess funding requirements and budget
             breakdowns before you start, to ensure the project is viable.

          · Licensing: Carefully consider the licensing and intellectual property rights associated
             with the MOOC content and ensure all the materials to be adapted are suitable to be
             offered as OER, and that correct attribution is applied.

Adaptable Resources for Teaching with
Technology

Overview

UTS academics, like their counterparts elsewhere, create their own learning activities and assessments
(aka teacher-generated pedagogies) that undergo continuous refinement over years of teaching. Despite
the substantial number of academics across all universities, certain activities/assessments gain significant
value through iterative improvements. Unfortunately, these valuable resources often go underutilised.
The project highlighted in this case study endeavors to tap into these teaching ideas, restructuring them
in a manner that others can derive value from. By doing so, we enable fellow academics to seamlessly
incorporate these teaching activities into new educational contexts. This approach ensures that teacher-
generated activities and assessments have an extended life, benefiting a broader spectrum of students.

Interestingly, teaching practice varies widely, encompassing both formally trained educators and those
drawing on their practical experiences, navigating through trial and error, intuition, and engaging in social
interaction and co-creation (Echempati, 2023; Lund, 2016; Rodríguez-Triana et al., 2020).

As professional staff, we acknowledge the wealth of teaching activities and assessments generated by
academics. The central question is: How can we effectively harness this surplus of academic-created
resources?

This case study proposes that the methodology and design principles applied to ARTT can be adapted by
the wide range of academics in higher educational institutions into different learning contexts. The primary
benefit of this work is enhancing the clarity and shareability of learning and teaching approaches among
academics and learning designers at UTS and beyond.
          ADAPTABLE RESOURCES FOR TEACHING WITH TECHNOLOGY | 86

Abstract

This case study highlights the enhancement of shareability in teaching approaches, fostering
collaboration among academics and learning designers in higher education through The
Adaptable Resources for Teaching with Technology (ARTT).

The ARTT project is an initiative led by the Learner Experience (LX) Design team at the
University of Technology Sydney (UTS). This project aims to create a collection of adaptable
learning activities and assessments that can be shared and adapted across various learning
environments in higher education. ARTT tackles the issue of underutilised teacher-generated
pedagogies that have been developed and trialled, providing evidence-based practices that
significantly enhance the student learning experience. For example, the collection offers
activities that engages students at different stages of the academic session (e.g. academic
semester), considers the size of the cohort and provide reusable digital assets that can be
imported directly into learning management systems (LMSs).

The ARTT collection consists of two main sections: Learning Activities and Assessments. These
resources are developed using a standardised template, peer-reviewed, and published on the
UTS website as open educational resources (OER) under Creative Commons licenses. This
approach ensures quality, consistency, and open access for users. As OER, the collection not
only benefits UTS academics but also extends its reach to the broader higher education
community. The project also engages academics in open educational practices (OEP) through
meaningful contribution to the developing complete guides on implementing leaning activities
and assessments for others. By enhancing the clarity and shareability of learning and teaching
approaches through OEP, ARTT also contributes to the professional development of academics
and learning designers, fostering innovation in pedagogical practices.
87 | ADAPTABLE RESOURCES FOR TEACHING WITH TECHNOLOGY

   Using this case study

     This case study proposes that the methodology and design principles applied to ARTT can be
     adapted by the wide range of academics in higher educational institutions into different
     learning contexts. The primary benefit of this work is enhancing the clarity and shareability of
     learning and teaching approaches among academics and learning designers at UTS and beyond.

Understanding the context: Why ARTTs?

In higher education, academics comprise both formally trained educators and those who rely on their own
teaching practice. The latter often navigate through their experiences, relying on trial and error, intuition,
and muddling through situations to articulate and justify their teaching choices (Echempati, 2023; Lund,
2016). While the teaching practices honed by experienced academics through years are highly valuable, they
often remain overlooked and underutilised.

The ARTT project tackles several critical challenges in the educational landscape:

 1. Underutilised Teacher-Generated Pedagogies: despite years of refinement, many effective
      teaching methods remain isolated with individual teachers, leading to a missed opportunity for
      sharing valuable experiential knowledge. The project aims to capture and disseminate these
      pedagogies, ensuring they benefit a wider audience.

 2. Sustainable Support for Learning Designers and Technology Integration: As the demand for
      rapidly developing online courses within tight timeframes continues to grow, faculties require
      ongoing, scalable support. This increasing demand places significant pressure on learning designers,
      who are tasked with creating engaging and effective learning experiences under challenging
      conditions. The ARTT project directly addresses these challenges by offering robust resources and
      frameworks designed to empower learning designers, enabling them to quickly and efficiently
      develop technology-enhanced courses that meet the evolving needs of education.

 3. Accessible and Adaptable Teaching Resources: There's a significant need for a centralised
      repository of easily accessible and adaptable resources that leverage technology for teaching.
      Academics frequently reach out to learning designers or curriculum developers for assistance in
      developing educational activities or assessments. While these requests originate from various
      faculties, they often share similar themes and demonstrate consistent needs in how technology can
      be utilised to facilitate learning. Usually, efforts spent supporting individual academics are often
      tailored to a specific subject, addressing the needs of just that one academic. When another academic
                                                                  ADAPTABLE RESOURCES FOR TEACHING WITH TECHNOLOGY | 88

      reaches out with a similar request, a different member of the central support team repeats a similar
      process, resulting in duplicated efforts. In essence, the same kind of support could have served
      multiple academics simultaneously, streamlining the workload and maximising impact. More
      importantly, the current approach means that the effort benefits only the specific subjects involved in
      each request, despite the fact that many other subjects across the institution could equally benefit
      from the solutions being developed. The project seeks to fill this gap by creating a comprehensive
      collection of resources derived from real-world experiences, making it easier for educators to
      integrate technology into their teaching practices, while at the same time maximising the benefits of
      these resources for other academics to adapt into their own teaching.

The ARTT project aims to provide a solution to these challenges by creating a centralised, open repository
of adaptable teaching resources. This platform seeks to address the void by providing a way to share
practices and resources in a collaborative and accessible manner. By doing so, it aims to improve the quality
and efficiency of technology-enhanced teaching across various learning contexts in higher education, while
also validating and utilising the valuable experiential knowledge of academics.

     Similar projects

       Many higher educational institutions initiated instructional design resources for teaching
       with technology. For example, the Center for Distributed Learning at the University of
       Central Florida in the US, established the Teaching Online Pedagogical Repository for faculty
       and instructional designers interested in developing online and blended learning
       environments. Their resources are open for public access and they also offer the opportunity
       for contributors from anywhere in the world to share online learning pedagogies.
       OneHE is an initiative that is committed to fostering a culture of sharing and accessibility in
       education, particularly through the creation and dissemination of OER. As part of this
       commitment, OneHE offers a variety of free courses, activities, and resources designed to
       support faculty in enhancing their teaching practices.
       Another local example is the Flexible Learning project, funded by the Australian Universities
       Teaching Committee (AUTC). The "Flexible Learning project" is a collection of reusable
       learning design resources to assist academics to create high quality and flexible student
       learning experiences (Agostinho et. al, 2002).

Key stakeholders

The ARTT project involves a diverse group of stakeholders, each playing a vital role in its progress.
From project leaders to end-users, these participants collaborate to create, maintain, and utilise the ARTT
collection.

 1. LX Design team are the primary drivers of the ARTT project. Their responsibilities include: a)
      Leading the overall project b) Developing resources for the ARTT collection c) Creating and
      maintaining the template for resource development d) Peer reviewing resources and provide feedback
      to authors and e) Coordinating with other stakeholders.

 2. Editorial team works closely with the LX Design team. Their main role is to ensure the quality of
      content in the ARTT collection. They build resources in the LX website, and maintain content
      standards.

 3. Contributors includes a diverse range of professionals: a) Academics: University professors and
      lecturers b) Learning designers: Specialists in creating effective learning experiences c) Curriculum
      developers: Experts in designing educational programs. Contributors come from both UTS and
      other universities by providing the actual content for the ARTT collection, sharing their teaching
      activities and assessments.

 4. UTS faculties are the various academic departments within UTS. They are the primary beneficiaries
      of the support provided by the LX Design team. Faculty members can use the ARTT resources to
      enhance their teaching practices.

 5. Wider academic community of academics and educational professionals beyond UTS. They are
      potential users of the ARTT resources, as the collection is openly accessible. They can also become
      contributors, adding their own resources to the collection.

ARTT promotes diverse perspectives and innovative approaches to learning, fostering openness and
empowerment among contributors. The complexities of education, particularly in the assessment sphere,
have increased, emphasising the need to partner intentionally with students, academics, faculties, external
industries, and communities to broaden the scope of these resources (Krause, 2023). This collaborative

The ARTT development process

The working group of this project consists of three learning designers and technology specialists and two
curriculum designers. The members of the project team have significant experience in teaching, educational
technologies, and research. These three domains of knowledge are crucial to sustaining the project and
improving quality of outcomes.

The project team's expertise in teaching, educational technologies, and research is indeed fundamental to
                                                                  ADAPTABLE RESOURCES FOR TEACHING WITH TECHNOLOGY | 90

the ARTT project's success and sustainability. The three domains contribute to the project's development
and quality improvement:

 1. Teaching expertise: Experience in teaching enables the team to design resources that align with
      pedagogical practices. It involves anticipating potential gaps or challenges in the learning sequence
      and verifying the practical application of the resources with actual teaching scenarios. Teaching
      expertise helps ensure that the developed instructions are not only logically structured but also
      pedagogically sound and effective in real classroom settings.

 2. Educational technological skills: Understanding the affordances and limitations of various
      educational technologies is essential for creating resources that are adaptable and functional across
      different platforms. This includes testing for interoperability and ensuring that artefacts attached to
      an ARTT resource work seamlessly within the UTS Digital Learning Ecosystem (DLE). Familiarity
      with alternative technologies supported by UTS allows the team to design resources that remain
      maintainable and scalable, with the university's support infrastructure able to assist academics in
      adapting these resources effectively.

 3. Research competence: Research skills allow the team to engage deeply with the academics,
      understanding the theoretical and pedagogical foundations underlying the ARTT resources. This
      enables the triangulation of evidence from both research literature and teaching practices, enhancing
      the credibility and depth of the resources. Moreover, research skills help identify indirect benefits of
      the developed activities, such as their impact on different learning environments or on student
      engagement and learning outcomes.

Combining these skill sets ensures that the ARTT resources are not only well-designed and technically
robust but also theoretically grounded and capable of evolving with future educational needs and
technological advancements.

In order to maintain consistency of developing the resources, the team has developed a special template
that allows for step by step instructional design and technical implementation of the resource. Currently,
there are two collections that have been established in this project: (1) Designing Learning Activities and
(2) Designing Assessments.

Each resource is designed based on a set of attributes that describe its content as described in the ARTT
template box. The set of attributes provide academics with an easy way to make quick decisions of
suitability of the resource to their context. The instructions in each resource also cover in detail the
learning design steps and the technical implementation of the activity or assessment that identify suitable
technologies.
91 | ADAPTABLE RESOURCES FOR TEACHING WITH TECHNOLOGY

   ARTT template

     The template consists of the following attributes:

          · Short blurb: Includes a brief summary outlining the key activities described in each
             resource.

          · Why do this: Outlines the objective of creating the activity and how it contributes to
             active learning.

          · How to do this: A set of clear instructions that academics can follow to implement
             these activities or assessments into their own subjects.

          · What tools you could use: This element includes a list of UTS-supported technologies
             required to implement the activity. It also features non-UTS-supported technologies that
             are well-known to academics.

          · When and where to use: Provides recommendations on the optimal time to introduce
             the activity to students and suggestions for suitable discipline areas. It also specifies
             whether the activity is designed for fully online or blended learning approaches.

          · How long will It take: Includes three time estimates: Build (the time for an instructor to
             build the activity), Teach (the time to deliver the activity), and Learn (the time a student
             will spend engaging with the activity).

          · What research tells us: This important element highlights research findings on the
             benefits of the activity or the learning theory that explains how learning occurs within
             the activity.

          · Artefacts and examples: Attached resources, such as learning objects, rubrics for
             assessments, or templates for specific activities, are provided to assist in resource
             development.

          · License and Attribution: All resources are associated with a Creative Commons license,
             and authors are properly attributed. This also provides a platform for academics with a
             teaching-focused role to share their approaches.

The team works in an agile approach and meets every two weeks (i.e. sprint). As a core concept in agile
project management, a "sprint" refers to a short, fixed period during which the project team focuses on
completing a set amount of work. At the end of a sprint, each member presents progress with resource
development to the rest of the team and receives constructive feedback to improve the clarity of
instructions and the usability of the resource. On average, a resource is developed every two sprints giving
two to three weeks for building the content and one week for the peer review process.

   ARTT learning design principles

     The opportunity to present the project in different platforms (e.g. UTS Learning and Teaching
     forum 2019, Open Access Week 2020, CAUL conference 2022, ASCILITE 2023) gave the
     opportunity to reflect on our learning design practices by seeking feedback from the diverse
     audience, benchmark against best practices and distilled key principles that continue to guide
     resource development. These principles include:

         1. Integration of digital pedagogy: Emphasising the use of digital tools and approaches
             to enhance learning experiences.

         2. Active learning focus: Crafted specifically for environments that promote active
             student engagement.

         3. Alignment with learning futures: Embedded within the learning futures framework
             and LMS guiding principles to ensure consistency and effectiveness.

         4. Evidence-based methodology: Grounded in a thorough review of literature, teaching
             practices, and the affordances of technology.

         5. Rigorous quality control: Continuously refined through a robust quality assurance
             process.

         6. Targeted support: Focused on providing tailored learning design support for high-
             impact activities and assessments.

         7. Designed for UTS technologies: Optimised for use with UTS-supported technologies
             and commonly used tools.

As an academic or learning designer, the ARTT collection offers valuable support for curriculum
development. Whether you follow your own learning design approach or utilise an existing model, the
ARTT resources empower you to make informed decisions and enhance your content with proven
strategies and insights. In the following example I used Gilly Salmon's "Five Stage Model" (Ruzmetova,
2018) as a foundational framework to develop an online subject. I integrated the ARTT collection at
each stage of the model to design targeted activities for learners, ensuring a cohesive and engaging learning
experience.

Champions: Insights and reflections from project
contributors

       The collection provides a valuable resource for academics, enabling them to make quick and
       informed decisions in their teaching practice. It draws from the real-world experiences of
       educators, with contributors generously sharing their insights and strategies. For instance,
       in her video, Amara Atif a Scholarly Teaching Fellow at the School of Computer Science,
       discusses her use of scaffolding as a teaching strategy while instructing the course
       "Enabling Enterprise Information Systems" in Autumn 2022. She notes that this approach
       significantly boosted class engagement, enhanced students' understanding of the material,
       and increased their motivation as they became more proficient.
       Learning designers at a UTS expressed enthusiasm for the project, with one senior learning
       designer stating, "This is exactly what the faculty needs." Another learning designer
       commented, "You guys speak the language that we need between learning designers"
       indicating that the project successfully bridges gaps in communication and understanding.

Moving forward

In 2024, ACCORD report stated that "Since the cessation of the Office for Learning and Teaching (OLT)
in 2016, Australia has not had sufficient national focus on system-wide improvements in these areas. As a
result, while there are many examples of high-quality teaching and educational research within Australian
universities, the benefits of this work are not shared and systematised." (Accord, 2024). Although there are
pockets of high-quality teaching across Australian universities, the lack of a national framework for sharing
and systematising these practices limits their broader impact. The ARTT project serves as a crucial initiative
in addressing the gap identified by the ACCORD report.

Another challenge that we are currently facing is that the higher education sector has become increasingly
reliant on technology, particularly with the proliferation of Generative AI. However, technology that
is moving and changing in unpredictable ways. With resources such as ARTT, academics can make
connections between what they want to teach with how it can be reimagined with a technological focus.
Assuming that technologies are changing more rapidly than many educational concepts, each of these
resources can be reused and updated commensurate with such changes. Open access and visibility of these
resources, together with considering their currency, will ensure their usefulness and useability into the
future.

In practice

Final advice for future projects:

     · As learning designers, we have the power to significantly enhance teaching and learning
        by creating resources that are both accessible and adaptable. However, to ensure the
        success and sustainability of such projects, a strategic approach is essential. Here are
        three key pieces of advice to guide you in building an impactful and enduring ARTT
        collection.

              Start small with a clear vision: Building a community takes time and patience.
                Begin by focusing on a limited set of learning activities to establish a foundation,
                and gradually expand your community to attract more contributors. It is also
                essential to clearly define your project's purpose and ensure it aligns with your
                institution's strategic plans. This alignment not only reinforces the project's
                relevance but also garners institutional support and integrates seamlessly with
                broader educational goals.

              Collaboration: The collective intelligence of a group can achieve far greater impact
                than individual efforts. Engage with your institution's community to gather diverse
                ideas and support, work across teams to harness varied expertise, and expand
                your network of contributors through professional platforms. This collaborative
                approach amplifies the reach and effectiveness of your project.

              Embrace agile development and sustainability: Use an agile approach to iterate
                quickly, collect feedback, and plan for the long-term maintenance and promotion
                of your resources.

Overview

How do you console an upset colleague? How do you assist a colleague who is struggling with work-life
balance? How do you negotiate a salary? How do you mediate a dysfunctional work-related relationship
between colleagues? These typical workplace situations require learned skills that can take time to master.
So, how do you create an interactive learning environment that motivates and inspires learners to develop
and enhance their skills spanning navigating difficult conversations, negotiation, and mediation? It was a
question that sparked an idea and led to the creation of an OER: Workplace Role-Play Scenarios: Practice
Navigating Difficult Conversations, Negotiation and Mediation. Fifteen role-plays were created, inspired
by real-life situations, and drawn on experience from industry-relevant stakeholders, to develop workplace
scenarios that were realistic, giving learners an authentic learning experience.
However, the creation of the OER was not without its challenges, as pursuing the OER idea required
navigating an unfamiliar process that took persistence and resulted in many key lessons learned along the
way. Challenges such as how do you create a high-quality user-friendly resource that will be applicable,
inclusive, and work for different cohorts of learners to enable the OER to reach its full potential of being
utilised, shared, and modified when users have different needs and curriculum requirements? How do you
collaborate with others to create the OER? What are the licencing guidelines? How do you navigate the
software to create the OER? How long does the process take from an idea to published OER? How do you
then integrate and adopt the OER into your subject?

Key stakeholders - "Your support lifeline"

The journey from idea to completion was a challenging yet rewarding one. At the beginning, I was entering
an unknown territory and knew I needed to embrace the learning curve I was about to embark on. I had
never heard of an OER before, did not know what it was and remember quite vividly being overwhelmed
during the first OER information session after hearing several unfamiliar terms: OER, creative coms (or
was it called creative commons?), attributions, MOM, DRM-free resource. What did it all mean? Google
became my best friend, and I became more confident and aware of the untapped wonderful world of Open
Educational Resources.
An OER grant provided me with a supportive environment to create my OER. A wonderful Deakin
Open Education Librarian Angie, the OER community and the Copyright Team provided ongoing
encouragement, expertise, and support during the creation of my OER. I was fortunate to also lean on a
trusted colleague who collaborated with me on a small portion of the OER. I knew she was the right person
to work with after my initial call with her: "so I have this idea..." She was equally passionate, got the vision
and knew how valuable the OER would be for students.

Background information - "The idea and so what... Let
the journey begin".

It was a few years ago and I had just been allocated unit MMH250 Workplace Conflict Resolution
to facilitate as unit chair. The unit was promoted as a skills-based unit with theoretical and practical
learning outcomes designed to enhance and/or develop students' skills in navigating difficult conversations,
negotiation, and mediation. The second-year unit was designed to have a weekly 50-minute lecture, with
weekly two-hour hands-on seminars.
I was very excited for the opportunity to deliver the unit as it was unique and required high engagement
levels, which also meant the unit was challenging to convene. My excitement levels quickly plummeted
after seeing the state of the unit. The unit had shuffled between unit chairs, and no one had really given
it the love and attention it desperately needed. The weekly seminars involved scenarios that were not very
realistic, there was limited scaffolding to support students learning and limited reflection questions post
role-plays for students to reflect on and learn from their experiences. Due to the expansive content areas,
students needed access to several textbooks.
With all this in mind, one afternoon with a coffee in hand, I brainstormed what I envisaged the unit to
look like - what was its purpose? What kind of learning environment did I want to create? What support
103 | FROM BLANK PAGES TO COMPLETION: NAVIGATING THE PROCESS AND RESOLVING THE CHALLENGES OF
CREATING A NEW OER FOR UNIVERSITY STUDENTS

did students need? What critical skills did I want students to learn in the unit? What assessment would be
appropriate? Around this time, OER grant applications had opened and I jumped at the chance to develop
an OER for this unit. I was successful at obtaining the grant and had planned to develop an OER that was
a textbook covering all the skills-based content topics.

With a blank page, I started to map out the curriculum that I wanted students to learn around the key areas
of navigating difficult conversations, negotiation, and mediation. However, I soon began to realise that
writing my own textbook encapsulating the key learning areas was not the best decision for several reasons.
When I started writing the textbook, I felt I was reinventing something that already existed. It would
limit the applicability and usability of the book in other higher education institutions due to differing
curriculum requirements and it would be very, very time consuming. So, it was back to the drawing board!

I revisited my core question - what was the purpose of the unit? It was to develop and enhance skills which
students would require to confront the challenges in the real world. As a skills-based unit, whilst the theory
is important, its application and practice are even more important. It was this point that sparked an idea
to create an OER with role-play scenarios which covered navigating difficult conversations, negotiation,
and mediation. The unit desperately needed better-quality, real-life scenarios that would be applicable to
future work (who does not want to practise developing better negotiation skills to get that salary increase or
promotion!), that provided students with the opportunity to apply what they were learning in the weekly
lectures. The plan was to make the OER non content-specific, so that any educational provider could use
the resource and make it applicable to their specific curriculum.

Aside from addressing the need surrounding the scenarios, there were other drivers that led to the creation
of the OER. As higher education has become more accessible and inclusive to all learners, the weekly
scenarios needed to cater to all learning needs, particularly for students who use assisted technology. The
outdated scenarios were often provided as scanned copies, images etc. which limited their ability to be
accessed and utilised in different software programs.

Project description and Key outcome - "The end
product"

Students who enrol in the unit come from many different courses, and as such may have limited experiences
in HR and workplace experiences. For many students, it is a steep learning curve as they work on
developing skills in navigating difficult conversations, negotiation, and mediation as emphasised in the
following quote from a past student: "the unit as a whole was certainly challenging ... [but it] prepared
[us] for conflict resolution scenarios in the workplace". Therefore, it was essential that students learning
experience was carefully planned out. The fifteen scenarios provide learners with the opportunity to engage
in different role-plays providing students with the opportunity to apply theoretical concepts and ideas into
real-life scenarios and provide learners with the opportunity to reflect on their experience with reflective
questions. It is not content specific, so any educational providers can easily use the scenarios alongside
their specific course curriculum. For example, educational providers could utilise one of the negotiation
scenarios and ask students to apply the negotiation process and/or negotiation skills as taught in their
course curriculum to role-play the scenario. Reflection questions could then be tailored to prompt students
105 | FROM BLANK PAGES TO COMPLETION: NAVIGATING THE PROCESS AND RESOLVING THE CHALLENGES OF
CREATING A NEW OER FOR UNIVERSITY STUDENTS

to reflect on and evaluate how they did in the negotiation scenario or even what was noticed by the
observer.

Feedback

The journey was long, but the end product and the value it adds to students learning was worth it. Here
is a snapshot of some feedback from students: "I have learnt some extremely valuable skills ... [which] has
been reflected in my new role I have recently started as a HR Associate", "it is great to see a unit really apply
content and knowledge to the `real world' which I believe lacks a lot in university studies. This unit was
truly engaging. The practical activities are highly engaging and allow for students to experience what we are
learning first-hand" and "I have thoroughly enjoyed this subject. Its content has been so practical to both
work and life, and I've been able to practice and implement learnings and strengthen my own capabilities
in my professional life throughout the trimester- with really positive results."

The OER has also been selected by MERLOT (Multimedia Educational Resources for Learning and
Online Teaching) to undergo a peer review by the business editorial board as it was identified as having
high potential as a web-based teaching and learning resource and was awarded 4.5/5 stars for overall rating:
"The content approach is excellent for learning and teaching, the structure and presentation effectively
support the learning and application of strategies for navigating difficult conversations, negotiation, and
mediation, it is easy to integrate into the curriculum and has very clear instructions on the role-play process
and scenarios are engaging".

So, what's next?

I am exploring the integration of videos for instructional purposes and to role model certain skills for
students learning.

Learnings and recommendations - "Navigating
roadblocks"

The process from idea to completed OER was not a smooth journey, but I was not expecting it to be. It
was a learning curve, and I learned many valuable lessons along the way.

The why

I found it was really important to have a very clear understanding of why my resource was needed - what
was its purpose? I knew I wanted a resource in the unit that could address the need for students to have
one resource to refer to and initially, this was in the form of an OER textbook, which later changed to
workplace scenarios. So, I needed to be ok and accept pivoting from my initial idea and start over. This
was a time-consuming decision but ultimately proved to be the right one. Before cementing the idea, I
also researched OERs to see if I could adapt an established OER or if I needed to create a new one. Once
the why and the idea were formed, I ensured I was clear about who the audience was, their needs and
107 | FROM BLANK PAGES TO COMPLETION: NAVIGATING THE PROCESS AND RESOLVING THE CHALLENGES OF
CREATING A NEW OER FOR UNIVERSITY STUDENTS

considered how I could make the OER relevant to a broader audience. I had a clear understanding of the
type of student who undertakes the unit, some with limited working experience and some with specific
learning needs. This assisted in making sure the resource would suit a range of learners. By not making the
resource content specific, the resource can be easily applied by any educational providers.

Developing the OER: Collaborating with others

For a small portion of the OER, I collaborated with a trusted colleague who had the expertise to assist with
the development of some scenario role-plays. I emphasise the word trust, because when collaborating with
others you need to ensure you are on the same page with the vision and can ultimately work well together.
The collaboration required regular check ins to ensure that they were on track, so I would recommend
setting deadlines with clear expectations.

It's ok to take a break

It was a long journey and took longer than I anticipated (grant was obtained in 2021, and OER launched
in 2023, COVID and its implications in higher education significantly contributed to the delay). There
were times where I needed to step away from the resource and have a break from it. Even though I felt
guilty putting it aside, it was important to help with refocusing on it later. Sometimes this was caused by
the intensive academic workload and other times because I was just tired of working on it.

Seeking feedback

As an academic, I know the importance of feedback and so, I sought feedback on the OER from trusted
colleagues and students when I trialled the scenarios in seminars. Most feedback resulted in valuable
changes and other feedback was considered but ultimately, couldn't be implemented as it didn't fit within
the scope of the OER's purpose (but could be considered for a potential future OER). I was recently
a guest speaker on the August's OER Collective Community of Practice by the Council of Australian
University Librarians (CAUL) on the topic of Peer Review: Two Approaches Shared by Colleagues from
Monash and Deakin and I picked up a great tip. That is, in your OER include a feedback option at the end
of your OER so users can directly give you feedback to improve the resource. I also asked many questions
from the OER support team on licencing, copyright etc. which greatly assisted my understanding.

When embedding the resource in the unit, I ensure I communicate to students the purpose of the OER,
why it was created and the benefit for them as students. I also seek their feedback on the OER during each
teaching period as ultimately the OER needs to work for them!

Pressbooks

As I was collaborating with others to create part of the OER and to seek feedback, I wrote the OER in
         FROM BLANK PAGES TO COMPLETION: NAVIGATING THE PROCESS AND RESOLVING THE CHALLENGES OF
                                                                               CREATING A NEW OER FOR UNIVERSITY STUDENTS | 108

a MS Word document. Once the OER was in its final version, I imported the content into Pressbooks.
Pressbooks was the content management system that my university utilised to enable me to publish my
OER to the public. To start a new shell (OER) in Pressbooks, the title had to be locked in. So inevitably, I
took a little longer to get the shell set up as I pondered the OER title.

The transfer of content from MS Word to Pressbooks was not entirely smooth due to being unfamiliar
with Pressbook's editing and formatting tools. I did find several helpful how to videos for Pressbooks which
assisted in understanding how to use it. At the time, I found it difficult to copy and paste the content to
replicate how it was in my MS Word document. I found it was better to create new tables in Pressbooks,
rather than copying and pasting from MS Word. Also, when checking the formatting be sure to download
a PDF version to see how it appears in PDF which helped me for example see where I needed to add a few
lines, so a new paragraph started on a new page.

Celebrate the end product

I took a moment to celebrate the achievement. I was proud of what I had created and welcomed the
opportunity to officially launch the book at a celebratory OER launch event. I looked for avenues to
actively share my creation and promote it - whether that was through the OER community, on LinkedIn
or through my department. I have the front cover of my OER in a frame proudly displayed in my office
which sometimes acts as a great talking point when colleagues/students drop by my office.

   In practice

     "So, you want to implement a similar OEP?" You have made a great decision!
     A few tips:

          · Know your why, the audience and its value which will help keep you on track.
          · Lean into your surrounding OER support teams or create your own supportive team to

             cheer you on!
          · Seek feedback and be open to making changes from others' suggestions during the

             development of the OER and after.
          · Be prepared to pivot from your original idea.
          · It will take longer than you think (trust me).
          · Use the read aloud feature in MS word to proofread.
          · Create the right writing environment for you. Schedule writing blocks at your optimum

             writing window (mine was in the afternoons/evening listening to rain music).
     All the very best with your OER!

   Overview
113 | ENVIROCARE: A COLLABORATIVE APPROACH TO INTEGRATING INDIGENOUS WAYS OF KNOWING, BEING
AND DOING INTO CURRICULA WITH A DIGITAL LEARNING SPACE

     There is a persistent gap in the understanding of Australia's First Nations peoples' culture and
     histories across Australia. This chapter presents the development of Envirocare, a digital
     learning space developed to support the integration of cultural intelligence and the appreciation
     of First Nations science into science curricula across Australian universities using the lens of
     Caring for Country. We present the design process of an equitable open access and sustainable
     space that provides choice to study at any time and at any pace, while meaningfully supporting
     culturally appropriate content.
     The journey developing Envirocare brings together third space professionals and academics, a
     teaching academic, a dean's council, young First Nations scientists, a First Nations advisory
     board, and 9 members of Community. We aimed to fill a resource gap at the classroom level
     where many educators feel unable to build their own resources either because they are
     resource and time poor, or they feel ill-prepared. Together, these groups and individuals have
     been able to meet the overarching goal of producing a resource for developing capabilities in
     cultural intelligence and Indigenous science, including a nascent understanding of First Nations
     ways of knowing, being and doing. We privilege representation from Aboriginal and Torres
     Strait Islanders through stakeholder consultations with the advisory committee of First Nations
     rangers and educators, video interviews with the Community members, and content generation
     by First Nations scientists and educators.
     The following is a case study that highlights the capability of embedding First Nations
     perspectives, through the lens of third space professionals and academics, to emphasise the
     opportunity for using open access to promote cultural intelligence in higher education with
     digital learning spaces. We acknowledge that there will never be enough space to tell all stories,
     but we hope that through the bringing together of these shared stories we can foster a desire
     for learners and educators to continue to grow.

Key stakeholders

The development of Envirocare relied on the establishment of an interdisciplinary partnership. This was
initiated by the Australian Council of Environmental Deans and Directors (ACEDD) and hosted by
Deakin University, with a co-design approach to incorporate many voices of Aboriginal and/or Torres
Strait Islanders.

Background

To enhance social justice and address inequalities there is a growing emphasis on ensuring graduates
have the capabilities to work with and for First Nations peoples (Page, Trudgett and Bodkin-Andrews,
2019; Brinkmann, 2014). As such, Universities Australia supports higher education curricula to have
Indigenous science embedded as an important step towards decolonisation of the curriculum (Universities
Australia, 2022). This chapter suggests how this might be achieved in the current context: 1) where First
Nations Australians are underrepresented in higher education, and 2) where non-First Nations educators
are involved in respectfully designing and delivering Indigenous science curricula (Cooper et al., 2024).

First Nations science and knowledges are intimately linked to place/location, the science and knowledge
is generated at that location to understand and to respectfully live in that location. Those designing First
Nations curricula should generally ensure that the importance of place-based knowledge and knowledge
systems is recognised and incorporated into learning (Ens et al., 2015). Therefore, here is a potential for
tension to arise where a national resource is attempted. A nationwide approach, may automatically conflict
with recognising that knowledge is place-based. However, the utility of a national resource delivering basic
introductory content and skills was enough for the developers to attempt to walk this fine line between
scalability and place-based learning.

Envirocare was deliberately designed to find a balance in respecting place-based knowledge and scalability.
Envirocare does this by embracing the diversity of peoples in Australia and their shared value of Caring
for Country to showcase Indigenous science and support cultural intelligence through reflective activities.
Envirocare consciously avoids teaching deeper content which should generally be place-based. The role of
teaching specific place-based knowledge is left to the local academics. We aim for Envirocare to be a solid
introductory resource so that those local academics can focus on adding learning that does vary with place,
degree and student learning level.

Reflections from third space workers

From the lens of working in the third space we share our reflections on developing Envirocare and the
impact that this had on our personal and professional development. For example,

"Some instances of things...I didn't know at all." - project team member.

This collaboration allowed us to share experiences and reflect on how our involvement impacted our own
115 | ENVIROCARE: A COLLABORATIVE APPROACH TO INTEGRATING INDIGENOUS WAYS OF KNOWING, BEING
AND DOING INTO CURRICULA WITH A DIGITAL LEARNING SPACE

cultural intelligence. Being part of the project, gave us the opportunity to engage in and with First Nations
culture.

         "...there are a lot of things that I didn't know, and that I'm learning... it is an interesting experience
         and exciting, there's not that many other opportunities to meet it, and to interact with the culture and
         to interact with First Nation's people directly." - project team member.

We were developing a space for learning, and with that space, we developed, learning about the diversity of
First Nations groups and the richness of that diversity.

         "We thought some plants were native when they were not, or we gathered image of a sacred dance
         which we learned that it's actually not okay to share, because a sacred dance is meant for certain eyes
         only and not to be shared widely." - project team member.

The reflections on our own realities moved our identities, our perceptions of the world and perceptions of
what students could be learning through completing the modules.

       "...and it's a beautiful experience." - project team member.

Our experience of learning about culture was through being involved in a collaborative project, which
fostered relationships that encouraged interaction and though feedback, helped build our confidence in
building First Nations learning material for students. This development of the resource allowed us to feel
as if we gained a level of expertise in producing resources which privilege representations of First Nations
peoples.

         "...getting that guidance from them is very rich and fairly unique." - project team member.

Guidance from First Nations peoples gave us confidence in what we were creating. By the end of the
project, we developed a sense that we were a vessel for what they wanted, and needed to be created, to
spread their messages. This was not just through multiple levels of collaboration, but it was through shared
respect, and our natural inquiry to understand and learn.

How was Envirocare developed?

The creation of Envirocare brought complex dialogue and decisions about inclusion, representation, access
and learning design (see Figure 1). These were approached with implicit openness from the project team,
leading to enrichment of the digital learning space as well as personal development. The methodology for
this collaborative process is described below.

                                                                    DOING INTO CURRICULA WITH A DIGITAL LEARNING SPACE | 116

Developing a framework for the digital learning space

The project team at Deakin University, with some experience in developing Indigenous knowledge learning
resources with First Nations peoples in the university setting, recognised the broader pedagogical value
of collaborating broadly to produce a national open access digital learning space. The team at Deakin
University identified how to host a digital learning space that could allow sharing of knowledge through
open access, a key challenge in the project. This platform could offer a safe learning space that featured
interactive self-assessments, self-reflections and ability for students to evidence learning.
The development of the digital learning space was supported by weekly project team discussions, which
brough opportunities to reflect on the projects aims and the content of Envirocare. These meetings allowed
the team to assess how existing infrastructure, and systems enable these types of projects or hindered their
development. Regular discussions enabled the team to evaluate the impact of this work, refine the narrative
being conveyed, and explore opportunities to deepen the knowledge of the project team members.

Strategy for designing learning

The learning was designed through a collaboration between a teaching academic, the Academic Lead,
Learning Designers and Indigenous Strategy and Engagement team from Deakin University and external
First Nations experts. The learning design approach aimed to:

  · Help student understand how their own culture and experiences influences their life and beliefs,
  · Teach about the impact of colonisation including the continuing impacts,
  · Introduce a large range of First Nations voices to the students,
  · Ensure the resource was culturally safe for First Nation's students,
  · Teach about Indigenous science concepts that are relevant to all science students in Australia,
  · Be majority written and spoken by First Nations peoples.

AND DOING INTO CURRICULA WITH A DIGITAL LEARNING SPACE

Techniques for visualisation

The graphical design for Envirocare considered how to capture diverse representation from across Australia
in the visual appearance of the learning space. In doing so, the designers took inspiration from going onto
Country and exploring the native flora and fauna (see Figure 2).

Figure 2: "The creation of visual assets for the digital learning space", by Deakin University, used under a
CC BY licence [Go to image description]

The visual assets that evolved demonstrate a holistic interdependence between the First Nations peoples
and the environment, serving as a reminder of the deep cultural connections and responsibilities that First
Nations peoples have with Country, set against the backdrop of diverse Australian landscapes.

Key outcomes

Figure 3: "The students' learning journey through Envirocare", by Deakin University, used under a CC BY
licence [Go to image description]

The key outcome for the project was the development of a national open access digital learning space,
Envirocare, that could be accessed by students from universities across Australia to learn about Caring for
Country (Figure 3). The digital learning space hosts four asynchronous modules that educators can use
to support learning already happening in their class, to help students prepare for on-Country experiences,
    ENVIROCARE: A COLLABORATIVE APPROACH TO INTEGRATING INDIGENOUS WAYS OF KNOWING, BEING AND
                                                                    DOING INTO CURRICULA WITH A DIGITAL LEARNING SPACE | 118

to add an element of Indigenous science which they use for assessment, or to offer students additional
optional learning.
To be inclusive, modules can be completed at any time, any place, in any sequence and from anywhere
with internet connection (Ciasullo, 2018). Once the modules are completed a certificate of completion is
produced, per module or for the entire Envirocare content. The certificate can be submitted as evidence
of attainment of the learning outcomes provided by Envirocare. This is being piloted with environmental
science students and following national access the next stages are to understand how this can be embedded
within curriculums and to understand the impact of such a resource.

   In practice

     Initially, the project seemed quite challenging, and to overcome this we brought together a
     strong team with a varied experience to create something that was unique. The project team
     focused on the quality of the product, rather than meeting short turnaround times, to ensure
     that what was produced gave voice and representation to First Nations peoples participants.
     This required utilising existing networks and building relationships over three years.
     The project team aimed to create content, graphics, videos and text through an inclusive
     process to ensure that diversity was brought into the final product and represented examples of
     diversity (Edgar et al., 2024). This concerted effort towards creating engaging and informative
     content was aimed to accurately reflect Caring for Country.
     The challenges that the project team faces were overcome by the interdisciplinary approach.
     This enabled collaborative discussions that touched on the technical and creative challenges
     faced during the website's development, including language use, content accuracy, and
     interface design. It also ensured specific roles were defined with an emphasis on ensuring that
     team members contributed effectively to their areas of expertise, highlighting a structured
     approach to project management.

PEDAGOGICAL PROBLEMS

   Using this case study

     A key intended benefit of this case study is to share insights into the creation of an OER with a
     view to improving access and affordability for students, among other potential advantages.

Overview

This case study highlights some of the benefits of creating and using an OER for teaching Australian
corporate insolvency law instead of relying on a physical textbook. The benefits include: (1) the cost
savings for students because they do not need to purchase an expensive learning resource; (2) the greater
chance that students will have a copy of the resource because OERs can be easily downloaded for free;
(3) the ability to tailor the content to avoid overloading students with unnecessary information; (4) the
promotion of student engagement with other important resources if external links are included; (5) the
greater convenience for students of navigating within the resource if internal links are included; and (6) the
ability to promptly update the resource as necessary and share the up-to-date version with students.
However, this case study also recognises that challenges may be encountered, and mistakes may made be
made, in the process of creating an OER for teaching in higher education. The greatest challenge discussed
in this case study is the tremendous time commitment required to create an OER that is sufficiently
extensive and detailed to replace a conventional textbook. The biggest mistake that is discussed is the failure
to consult students, or form student partnerships, in creating the OER--which may result in an OER that
is less accessible and/or comprehensible than it could be. The case study also foreshadows potential next
steps, which include subjecting the OER to peer review, developing and publishing an improved version of
it, and creating a similar OER for corporate law.

Reasons for creating this OER

The problems of expense and excess

In early 2023, soon after I commenced working as a Lecturer (Corporate Law) at Deakin University, I was
offered the chance to develop two units focusing on corporate insolvency law. It had been taught previously
at the Deakin Law School--last time in Trimester 3 of 2021. Back then, the prescribed textbook was
Michael Murray and Jason Harris, Keay's Insolvency: Personal and Corporate Law and Practice (Thomson
Reuters, 10th ed, 2018). The 11th edition of that book was published in 2022. I gave serious consideration
to prescribing that new edition, as well as another wonderful textbook in the field: Christopher Symes,
David Brown and Sulette Lombard, Australian Insolvency Law (LexisNexis Butterworths, 5th ed, 2023).
However, both books are concerned with personal insolvency law as well as corporate insolvency law.

Meanwhile, I remembered how relatively expensive textbooks had seemed to me when I was a law student.
Indeed, I sometimes opted not to buy prescribed texts due to their cost, and tried to borrow them from
a library instead. Now as an academic, I did not want other students to face the same dilemma: either
to spend a significant sum on purchasing a prescribed textbook or to have only limited access to such an
important learning resource through a library. It further occurred to me that students might be especially
disinclined to purchase a textbook with a substantial amount of content that might not be relevant to their
studies (namely, personal insolvency law). However, my search for an up-to-date textbook that was solely
focused on corporate insolvency law in Australia proved fruitless.

The appeal of OER lecture slides

My deliberations led me to settle upon three chief wishes: first, for all students of corporate insolvency
law to have unlimited access to the prescribed learning resource; second, for them to obtain and use it for
free; and third, for that learning resource to only contain content that is relevant to their studies. I was
also highly aware "that insolvency law is statutory and primacy must be given to the relevant statutory
text" (International Air Transport Association v Ansett Australia Holdings Ltd (Subject to Deed of Company
Arrangement) (2008) 234 CLR 151; [2008] HCA 3, [78] (Gummow, Hayne, Heydon, Crennan and
Kiefel JJ) (citations omitted)). Therefore, I wanted students to construe relevant legislative provisions for
themselves, aided by pertinent case law--rather than merely adopt the interpretations of textbook authors.
                                                                        SOLVING INSOLVENCY LAW'S PEDAGOGICAL PROBLEMS | 128

This, then, was the impetus for me to create an OER regarding Australian corporate insolvency law in
the form of extensive lecture slides. The final product, CILIA, was published on 1 February 2024. Being
an OER, CILIA satisfies my three chief wishes set out above. In addition, being a set of lecture slides,
CILIA may seem attractive to students because it entails less reading than a typical textbook. But from my
perspective as an educator, I hope that the dearth of exposition in CILIA will prompt students to develop
their own interpretations of the relevant legislative provisions (see, eg, John Biggs, Catherine Tang and
Gregor Kennedy, Teaching for Quality Learning at University (Open University Press, 5th ed, 2022) 134).

How this OER was created

I created CILIA in Microsoft PowerPoint. Regarding its structure, I mostly followed Chapter 5 of the
Corporations Act 2001 (Cth), which is the main source of corporate insolvency law in Australia. A typical
CILIA lecture slide quotes and/or summarises one or more sections from that Chapter or other part of
that Act. However, Australian corporate insolvency law is also contained in Corporations Regulations 2001
(Cth) and Insolvency Practice Rules (Corporations) 2016 (Cth), for example, so some of their provisions are
also covered in CILIA. In addition, mentioned throughout CILIA are over 50 cases that I selected because
of the light they shed on key legislative provisions. Regarding the visual presentation of information, I
generally inserted text into various colourful shapes and liberally used the SmartArt tool in PowerPoint.

I welcomed the ability to incorporate links into CILIA. Key legislation, court judgments, and other
germane resources (such as the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Corporations and Financial Services,
Corporate Insolvency in Australia (Report, July 2023)) are linked. Thus, students will be able to access
freely available information pertaining to corporate insolvency law with a mere click. I believe that this will
encourage them to directly engage with the primary and secondary sources of corporate insolvency law,
which would only benefit their learning. CILIA also contains internal links: for instance, a `home' button
that takes students back to the contents page and a `rewind' button that takes students to the start of any
given chapter. This should make CILIA easier to navigate than a physical textbook.

The current state, and future, of this OER

CILIA is a PowerPoint document that comprises an extensive set of lecture slides--specifically, 363 slides.
It is intended to provide a detailed introduction to Australian corporate insolvency law. Like a typical
textbook, it is divided into chapters (10 in total). The structure and content of CILIA have been briefly
discussed above. Recently, in Trimester 2 of 2024, I taught MLL318 Corporate Insolvency Law
(`MLL318') to undergraduate law students and MLJ735 Corporate Insolvency Law and Policy (`MLJ735')
to Juris Doctor students. For both units, I made CILIA a prescribed reading (instead of any textbook) and
used modified portions of it during my lectures. Modification was necessary because corporate insolvency
law is a dynamic field. CILIA is current to September 2023, yet it is already outdated to some extent due to
legislative changes that have occurred since then.
129 | SOLVING INSOLVENCY LAW'S PEDAGOGICAL PROBLEMS

For example, CILIA still refers to the definition of `officer of a corporation' that was previously contained
in s 9, but is now found in the newly created s 9AD of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth). This was one
of the changes implemented by item 48 of Schedule 2 to the Treasury Laws Amendment (2023 Law
Improvement Package No 1) Act 2023 (Cth), which came into operation on 20 October 2023--less than
two months after the substance of CILIA was settled. If a physical textbook had been prescribed, I would
need to inform students of the recent changes, and hope that they would not be confused by the differences
between their textbook and the lectures. But another advantage of using an OER is that I was able to easily
provide updated portions of CILIA for students to read and for me to use in my teaching.

Going forward, I wish for CILIA to undergo peer review. One of the reasons why peer review was
postponed concerns timing. CILIA was not finalised until it was published on 1 February 2024. Yet it
might take many months for two or more independent experts to provide feedback on extensive lecture
slides containing dense corporate insolvency law content. Depending on the feedback I receive, and on my
other commitments, it might then take me a further few months to make the necessary changes (possibly
with others' involvement). However, CILIA needed to be ready for teaching by the start of Trimester 2 on
8 July 2024. My hope is that CILIA will be peer reviewed in the coming months, and an improved version
published thereafter.

Lessons from using this OER thus far

While teaching MLP331 Corporate Law earlier this year, certain aspects of corporate insolvency law came
up. Whenever I perceived an overlap, I used CILIA's slides in my teaching of corporate law. Afterwards, I
asked students to vote on a show of hands in favour of their preferred slides: those from CILIA or my usual
(plainer) ones. A marked majority favoured the latter. After that vote, I invited further feedback. I learned
that students generally found the many shapes and colours in CILIA to be confusing or distracting. Some
wished for colours to be reserved for fonts, and even then, to be used sparingly (such as for headings and key
phrases). Others added that visually striking slides are useful, but only when a topic is being summarised.
I subsequently received similar feedback on CILIA in Trimester 2. In light of this constructive feedback, I
plan to consult with students in the process of creating any improved version of CILIA in the future.

Experience of working on this OER

Having written a PhD thesis in corporate insolvency law, I was delighted to have the opportunity to
develop MLL318 and MLJ735. However, the amount of time that was allocated for me to develop these
units assumed that I would be using a conventional textbook for my teaching. Working on CILIA took up a
tremendous number of hours--far more than I had anticipated. Accordingly, much of it was created in my
leisure time, including on weekends and during the last Christmas break. I was fortunate to be supported
in my endeavour by the receipt of a 2023 OER Library Grant of $5,000. I considered hiring an assistant,
                                                                        SOLVING INSOLVENCY LAW'S PEDAGOGICAL PROBLEMS | 130

but ultimately spent the $5,000 on marking relief in order to free up some time in my workday. Although
the process of creating CILIA was not without frustrations and drudgery, it was a labour of love overall.

Creating a similar OER in the future

Some of the main possible advantages of creating an extensive OER and using it to teach in higher
education instead of a conventional textbook have been canvassed above. To continue reducing barriers
to learning, in the future I aspire to create another OER that is akin to CILIA but focuses on Australian
corporate law. However, now that I better appreciate the necessary time commitment, I would need to
negotiate a sufficient allocation of hours in my academic workload for this project. In addition, I would
consult students or work in partnership with them on such a project to ensure that the content is presented
in an optimal way. These are also my two key recommendations for any other academic who is considering
creating an OER like CILIA.

CATALYSING CLIMATE CONSCIOUS LEGAL
EDUCATION THROUGH OPEN EDUCATION
RESOURCES

   La Trobe University

   Dr Julia Dehm; Zoe Nay; Dr Nicole Graham; and Steven Chang

Overview

This case study outlines an integrated project called Climate Conscious Lawyers that aims to transform
legal education. It uses Open Education Resources (OER) to address climate change challenges in the legal
profession. The project's vision is to ensure the next generation of legal professionals are equipped with the
expertise to deliver legal services and promote justice in a world transformed by climate change.

The main project outputs are:

  · a core content open-access textbook Becoming a Climate Conscious Lawyer: Climate Change and
      the Australian Legal System

  · a forthcoming Educators' Companion to support integration of the core text into curriculum.

In this case study, we seek to demonstrate the power of using OER to create "living" resources and build
communities of practice around those resources. This case study also illustrates the benefits of a staged
system of progressively publishing chapters in three "tranches" from mid-2024 to mid-2025.

We conclude by making recommendations to other open practitioners and educators on planning OER
projects in a holistic way that are highly integrated with:

  · curriculum change initiatives
  · professional practice
  · community-building.
133 | CATALYSING CLIMATE CONSCIOUS LEGAL EDUCATION THROUGH OPEN EDUCATION RESOURCES

   How to use this case study

     Academic teaching staff can learn how to:
          · use OER as a deliberate catalyst for changing education in your discipline
          · formulate diverse strategies for OER implementation
          · create a `living open textbook' that responds to practise
          · grow an OER team by attracting authors
          · manage larger edited volumes
          · establish the foundations of a community of practice linked to an OER
          · plan OER promotion in a targeted way.

     Open education staff/librarians/learning designers can learn how to:
          · embed OER development within broader academic projects & practices
          · use staged OER development models to minimise workload challenges
          · identify grant applications and funding opportunities that align with OER projects.

                     Why was this resource needed?

                                    The publication of the OER was a central part of a broader project

                                    to transform the curriculum of professionally accredited Australian

                                    law programs to produce more "climate conscious" lawyers who have

                                    the skills and knowledge necessary to be thoughtful, strategic and

                                    successful legal advisors and advocates in a world grappling with

                                    intersecting and complex climate impacts. Climate change impacts

                                    and the transition to a low-carbon society are already posing

                                    fundamental challenges to key legal doctrines and principles and

   at the university or faculty level through curriculum review/creation processes.

Drivers of change

For all of these pathways, similar prerequisites are needed:
  · awareness of the reasons for climate mainstreaming
  · educational resources to be used by educators in climate mainstreaming
  · networks of peer support to encourage each other in the practice of climate mainstreaming.

Intersecting project components

Our project to transform Australian legal education has three interrelated objectives. These are:
 1. Mapping curricular and pedagogical change: A survey of Australian legal educators (Sept-Oct
      23) revealed that although climate change is considered and discussed in many core law units of
      study, several barriers to mainstreaming climate change in legal education were encountered
      including a lack of: resources, knowledge about climate change related legal practice, and best
      practice climate mainstreaming pedagogies.
             CATALYSING CLIMATE CONSCIOUS LEGAL EDUCATION THROUGH OPEN EDUCATION RESOURCES | 136

 2. Developing educational resources: including this world-first open access textbook showing how
      climate change impacts are relevant to all areas of law and proposed Educators' Companion.

 3. Building a community of practice (CoP): to promote the resources and support the shift towards
      `climate conscious' legal education, including hosting national and international workshops and
      conferences, developing a website to centralise resources and share best practices, and raising
      awareness through conference presentations.

 legal education through the mainstreaming of climate change considerations", by Dehm, J., Nay, Z.,
 Graham, N., & Chang, S; licensed under CC-BY-4.0. [Go to image description]

As illustrated in Figure 3, progressing these three separate objectives mutually reinforces each other. The
survey provided the editors with the opportunity to listen and learn from legal educators about their
experiences and needs, which enabled them to design the OER in a way that was responsive to those
needs. Their process adopts the `Listen, Link, and Lead' approach outlined by Scott and Fullan (2009)
for leading change to higher education. The inter-related functions of these objectives encouraged many
survey respondents to deepen their engagement by taking up project roles themselves, as authors and peer
reviewers who contributed to developing the OER.

Why OER?

From the initial stages of conceptualising this project it was clear that a conventional legal textbook would
137 | CATALYSING CLIMATE CONSCIOUS LEGAL EDUCATION THROUGH OPEN EDUCATION RESOURCES

be inadequate to the task. Given the rapidly changing legal and policy landscapes related to climate change,
and the changing demands of users (both educators and students), it was necessary to create a book that
was more dynamic and interactive than conventional publishing models could produce. Open licensing
technologies made it possible to create an equitable, adaptive, interactive and dynamic resource. Using an
OER enabled:

  · open access at no cost, reducing the cost of education and financial barriers and burdens for law
      students

  · scalable impact through rapid uptake across multiple institutions and organisations
  · flexible localisation of content - enabling adaptation for jurisdictional contexts or other specific

      organisational purposes
  · long-term sustainable impact as a "living text" that enables fast and decentralised online updates to

      keep content current, accurate, and relevant
  · a strong exemplar for ethical use of learning technologies for social good
  · reader interaction via digital affordances and the possibility of student and teacher collaborations.

Building a community around the OER

Through the process of developing OER resources for climate conscious lawyering, we have built a rapidly
growing community of practice around the text with 45 individual contributors from 15 Australian law
schools contributing to 26 chapters, as well as legal practitioners and jurists. The community of practice
also includes many of the survey respondents, who became key members of the community of practice,
who would promote the resource to their colleagues and drive take up, as well as librarians and academics
staff from Australian universities. In this sense, the project can be understood as a Third Space project
(Whitchurch, 2012), given how it operated as an interface between academic and professional practice,
both within and outside of the university context. (See Figure 4.)

The initial team

The project was initiated and driven by the editors of the OER. The editors were a team of legal academics,
each passionate about climate change, each at different stages of their careers (an associate dean of
education, a mid-career researcher, and a PhD Candidate).

Growing the OER team and attracting authors

The editors identified and approached multiple subject-area specialists, inviting them to participate in the
project by authoring or co-authoring a chapter on their area of research and/or teaching expertise. As
the editors publicised the project at various conferences and other events, they were often approached by
colleagues asking if there was already a chapter on a specific subject-area, and if not, whether they might
contribute such a chapter to the book. The staged publication model (see Figure 5) made it possible to
incorporate new chapters in a later tranche of the OER.

Peer reviewers to ensure quality

Each chapter was double peer reviewed to provide feedback to authors on the quality, reliability,
139 | CATALYSING CLIMATE CONSCIOUS LEGAL EDUCATION THROUGH OPEN EDUCATION RESOURCES

comprehensiveness and relevance of the submission. For most chapters, the editors solicited both academic
and practitioner reviews to assure both the academic rigour and practical relevance of chapters to equip
students for the subject-related challenges of legal professional practice. This allowed the editors to develop
a stronger relationship with lawyers at the forefront of climate law and litigation.

Champions of the projects

The editors invited prominent jurists (including the Chief Justice of the New South Wales Land and
Environment Court) to lend their support for the book by writing the Foreword - raising its profile and
standing.

Close collaboration with OER experts

This project was developed through close collaboration and partnership with open education experts at
the La Trobe eBureau. Operating in the Third Space prompted deeper methodological reflections on
the practice of developing OERs; how to utilise technological capacities to promote accessibility and
engagement; and how to create "living resources" that remain up to date in light of the changing legal
and policy environment. The close collaboration with the eBureau fostered new ambitious branches of the
project, such as the development of an Educators' Companion to the core text (more details below).

How was the project designed and implemented?

This project was designed to support the integration and mainstreaming of climate change-related legal
developments and considerations into the curriculum of professionally accredited law programs across
Australia. The project was funded by the Victorian Legal Services Board Grants Program and a small grant
from La Trobe Law School. These grants made it possible to hire a Research Assistant/Project Manager to
coordinate the project, to pay peer reviewers and to cover additional costs associated with the project.

One early priority was to ensure as much consistency in tone and style throughout the textbook
notwithstanding multiple authorship. We developed our Guidelines for Authors to define the book's
purpose and objectives; its pedagogical approach; provided stylistics and formatting guidance; proposed
sample structure to each chapter; and provided information about the copyright considerations of
technological capabilities of open digital publishing and accessibility considerations.

We held several initial online workshops with invited authors where the editors and members of the
publishing team discussed the book, its purpose and the Guidelines. These workshops also allowed
numerous members of the team from across Australia to meet one another and build a sense of community
and shared purpose.

Later in the writing process, the editors held a further round of online workshops at which authors could
             CATALYSING CLIMATE CONSCIOUS LEGAL EDUCATION THROUGH OPEN EDUCATION RESOURCES | 140

share their works-in-progress and receive feedback from the authors of other chapters, and the editors. The
workshops helped the editors and authors to identify various points of intersection between the chapters,
as well as shared themes and concerns across various chapters. This will increase the coherence of the book
as a whole.

A staged publication model

Early on a decision was made to publish the OER over time through sequential "tranches". This staged
publication model enabled chapters to be published and available for education use as soon as possible.
The first tranche of three chapters was published in mid-2024, and the subsequent two tranches will
be published in early and mid-2025. The staged publication timeline also helped manage the editorial
workload involved, especially around peer review, copy editing and layout design. An unexpected benefit
of this staged publication model was that it made it possible to recruit and/or accept new authors of new
chapters that were not included in the original plan, and enabled staged incorporation of feedback to
improve the author guidelines.

chapters", by Dehm, J., Nay, Z., Graham, N., & Chang, S; licensed under CC-BY-4.0. [Go to image

Planning for impact by flipping the script on
dissemination

Many OER projects plan book promotion as a discrete post-publication phase. We successfully
experimented with a different promotion model that is a continuous cycle and begins at the outset of
OER development. This was a decisive approach that created powerful feedback synergies with our staged
tranche-based model (see Figure 6). The momentum generated from this led to community feedback
and an ongoing recruitment flow of new co-authors whose new chapters will form Tranches 2 and 3.
A key ingredient for this was situating the OER within a greater project of changing Australian legal
education. This mobilised pre-existing framing and resources (e.g. the survey phase) to attract co-authors
and accelerate OER development from an early stage.

phases", by Dehm, J., Nay, Z., Graham, N., & Chang, S; licensed under CC-BY-4.0. [Go to image
description]

We developed a project website, Climate Conscious Lawyers, to provide resources to help legal educators
embed climate change considerations in different units of study in both the core and elective curricula. It
also provides users with updates on cutting-edge research about climate considerations in legal education in
Australia, as well as relevant bibliographies and policy documents that highlight the need for a more climate
conscious legal practice.
We established a mailing list (using MailChimp) to build upon the community created by the initial project
survey, and used it to share important news - such as the book launch and publication of new chapters
- with interested academics, librarians and legal professionals. We also created a LinkedIn page to reach a
wider and potentially international audience.
             CATALYSING CLIMATE CONSCIOUS LEGAL EDUCATION THROUGH OPEN EDUCATION RESOURCES | 142

We prepared a publicity pack (including template PowerPoint slides, flyers and other materials) that could
be used by the editors, the eBureau team and chapters authors when speaking at conferences. Collecting
these expanding project materials in one place created unexpected benefits, such as repurposing them to
write grant applications more efficiently.

We circulated information about the publication of the first Tranche to the national network of Law
Associate Deans (Education) and Legal Librarians, as well as to our mailing list and on social media.

Reflections from project participants

Some of the project participants reflected that they found it meaningful to work on a project that was
focused on empowering law students to understand how they can use their legal education and subsequent
professional careers to respond effectively to diverse and complex disputes relating to climate change.
Participants contrasted this to their scholarly work, which may be less accessible and engaging for students,
and which may have a more limited audience.

Some of the authors shared with editors accounts of tensions between contributors about whether the
content should be focused on gradual and incremental changes to the legal system to promote greater
climate consciousness, or whether much more radical critiques of the legal system and radical reimagining
of legal possibilities were needed. These tensions - between incremental reform or more radical
transformation - foregrounded the need for a new generation of flexible, adaptable lawyers and judges who
can adapt readily to change.

Authors were also excited about how the OER can be used to drive further changes in legal education and
how it can support initiatives to embed sustainability across different units at any given Law School.

   In practice

     This project has grown and expanded far beyond what was initially envisioned. What we
     initially planned as a 12-chapter edited book, has grown to more than 25 chapters. The book has
     become the `principal' text, soon to be accompanied by an Educators' Companion. In addition,
     we have given numerous presentations about our work and have been invited to write
     academic articles about the project.
     From our experiences, we share the following recommendations and resources:
143 | CATALYSING CLIMATE CONSCIOUS LEGAL EDUCATION THROUGH OPEN EDUCATION RESOURCES

     Commit time and resources to project coordination: One of the key challenges in such a
     large (and growing) project is administration and coordination. We were fortunate to have been
     awarded a grant which allowed us to employ a Research Assistant/Project Manager. Having a
     Project Manager has been essential to co-ordinate and manage numerous aspects of this
     project.
     For OER edited volumes, plan how to support editorial teams: The editors worked with
     the eBureau to promote consistency across the core text by developing dedicated author
     support resources, such as our guidelines for authors and chapter templates. We also held live
     workshops where the authors could share work in progress and receive feedback from their
     peers and editors. However, there remained significant editorial work to ensure consistency
     across the chapters.
     Situate OER within a greater shared project: One of the key lessons from this project was
     that the development of OER is most successful when it is part of a broader project that
     generates both interest in and an audience for the resource. There is ongoing work needed to
     drive take-up of this resource, both by individual legal educators as well as through institutional
     centering of climate change considerations in Australian law degrees. The OER model is
     particularly attractive in the context of growing concerns and questions concerning the
     relationship between large commercial publishers and the producers of LLMs.
     Disseminate works in progress early and often: Our project was successful in promoting
     `living' ideas, resources, and publishing an "in progress" open textbook without sacrificing
     quality of scholarship. We found that sharing iterative work led to better feedback, more co-
     authors, and significant project growth. In the spirit of this, we have shared an open repository
     collection of reusable artefacts from our project.

Next steps

There are several next steps for this project:

  · Developing an Educator's Companion - the first volume internationally to provide learning
      resources for climate conscious legal education. It will:
          Provide learning activities, case studies and assessment tasks that require students to apply,
            analyse and evaluate "climate conscious" knowledge
          Provide learning activities and assessment tasks to cultivate and develop "climate conscious"
            skills, attributes and competencies
          Guide ways of formulating unit and course level learning outcomes which articulate relevant
            climate change-related content and competencies to support the institutional embedding of
            these objectives.
             CATALYSING CLIMATE CONSCIOUS LEGAL EDUCATION THROUGH OPEN EDUCATION RESOURCES | 144

  · Evaluating and learning from what we have done to date: we are in the process of receiving
      evaluations by the editors, publishers and authors of the process of publishing Tranche 1.

  · Forthcoming Tranches 2 and 3 are in progress: many chapters have been finalised and are
      currently at peer review, the further tranches will be published in 2025.

  · Hosting a national conference later this year on mainstreaming climate change in legal education
      at which we will promote the resources and educators can share their experiences and learning with
      their peers.

  · Expanding the community of practice of legal educators who are engaged with mainstreaming
      climate change in their teaching practice and educational leadership. We hope to host local
      gatherings in different states to bring people together as well as subject-specific events (whether
      online or in-person).

  · Tracking change: we hope to conduct a further survey of Australian law academics in 2025 or 2026
      to track progress on mainstreaming climate change in Australian legal education.

Overview

This chapter presents some of the multimedia `student' authored open educational resources (OER) from
multi-organisation research collaboration in the Northern Territory of Australia. The 2014-2016 portion
of the project created OER within an `opened' training model which aimed to better meet the expectations
of remote Indigenous communities of coastal Northern Australia who were developing ongoing fisheries
and aquaculture businesses.

Existing units offered in the usual training only partially addressed the needs of regions we were working
in. The units selected for this project were more suited to local business development in coastal remote
Northern Territory communities. The framework provided a way to support negotiated workforce
training that effectively addresses issues of distance, access to sustainable training, language diversity and
recognition of collaboration between industry, community, and existing knowledges. The resources we
created were mapped to a consolidation of relevant units of competency in trades and further education,
otherwise known as vocational education and training (TAFE/VET). This chapter explores a key element
of the framework; video resources that could be developed locally.

Remote training delivery can be complemented by open educational practices (OEP). These practices
enabled the local staff of Aboriginal Corporations (the `students') in fisheries training programs to
contextualise and author work-based learning resources. The goal of this project was to develop resources
as example recognition of prior learning (RPL) which could recognise and contextualise competencies
for meaningful employment (Lambert, et al., 2022). The final result of the process was a series of videos
made in simple technology, reproducible in other communities for more culturally responsible ownership
of local work-based learning. The resources were narrated in local languages, in situ, and bear Creative
Commons licenses the authors chose themselves.

My project contribution as a research associate included facilitating the OER creation with staff to
demonstrate competencies in training packages covering fisheries and aquaculture enterprise development.

   Using this case study

          This case study is useful for teaching academics, learning designers, library staff,
          government and industry professionals. This chapter is aimed at showcasing the
          process involved in developing resources as examples of author work-based learning
          resources. This chapter also includes information related to remote training delivery
          that addresses issues of distance, language diversity and recognition of collaboration
          between industry and community.

Key stakeholders

The project involved a range of government, industry, community, and training stakeholders. Local staff
who were completing the training to grow their business authored the OER used in promotion, training,
and as RPL learning records to illustrate the potential of this approach.
Local staff, their situated practices, knowledges, and languages were centred in the process.

Background issues

A main issue with nationally accredited TAFE/VET sector training packages is that they can tend to
be generic in nature despite being practical and competency based. Engineered pathways and de-
contextualised workforce programs have been shown to be less effective for participants and TAFE/VET
sector completion and employment rates in remote communities are problematic (Guenther, et al., 2014).
Certificate completion rates also don't always reflect learning that will be authentically useful locally. (ABS,
2009, 2011; Gray, Hunter & Howlett 2013; Jordan & Mavec, 2010; Wallace, et al., 2011).
Measurement of an externally defined notion of success, inconsistently delivered through decontextualised
delivery that take no account of local realities has resulted in repeated failures of programs (Ellanna, et al.

Fowkes, 2016). This repeated failure adds to a lack of morale, investment and credibility for any sustainable,
locally relevant, or emergent culturally responsive programs, and increases inconsistency of experience for
those undertaking the training.

Another related issue in the Northern Territory is low employment rates and availability of meaningful
work on Country. The local authorship of resources allowed us to contextualise the units of competency
that were relevant to some of the site-specific training and economic goals of the Aboriginal corporation
with which we were working.

What became clear early in the project's development were the challenges for current training provision
(Fisheries Research and Development Corporation, 2016):

 1. Participants were in small groups, making delivery on Country financially unviable.
 2. Model enterprises represented in training materials may not align with local business models in other

      parts of the country, possibly making enterprises culturally unviable.
 3. Existing qualifications addressed parts of the potential roles of enterprises, but no one course, or

      training package would provide all the competencies required; new and context-specific skills needed
      to be included in training frameworks.

Measurement benchmarks for workforce development initiatives include key success indicators for full
completion of training package certificates as they are written (Australian Bureau of Statistics, n.d.). These
metrics rarely consider some of the complexities involved:

      the learners' own knowledge authority and management, how they would prefer to use or adapt the training
      materials (whole or in part) to their local contexts, and the ways they want to run their businesses.

Adhering to local practices could refine definitions of program success informed by and for local authority
(Foley, 2006; Ivory, 1999). Respecting knowledge authority of decision makers in remote communities
and the orientation they decide for their community's training needs shows a respect for how community
members want to learn and add to their knowledge, for their own purposes.

Project description

Exemplar videos were created by the Aboriginal Corporation staff (`students') to meet learning objectives
from different units of competency in fisheries and aquaculture training. For example, `how to take a
water sample for quality testing' is featured here. The resources were narrated in local dialects with English
subtitles. The researcher edited resources with locally produced music provided by Community, added
English subtitles as directed by the authors, and historical content about business and trade in the region at
the suggestion of community elders (Manmurulu, 2016).

As the researcher on the project, I played the part of camera holder, editing video and processing raw
footage at the direction of the authors in iMovie and simple slideshow software as we sat under mango trees
and in the community art centre. In this form of `training,' the trainees `teach' the researcher, who then
compiles footage demonstrating competence in the order the staff select.

Creative Commons licences were discussed with the resource authors, and they chose the CC-BY-NC-SA
                                               OER DOWN UNDER: OEP IN REMOTE AUSTRALIAN INDIGENOUS FISHERIES | 152

license. The resources were shared on the Aboriginal Corporation's social media before it was shared on the
research organisation's `Vimeo' website (with permission).

Key outcomes

The OEP in this project distinguishes `training content' that is freely available and adaptable (one OEP
feature), and the ongoing relational practices involved in defining the purposes, use, and creation of
resources within a larger adaptation of training packages and approaches.

The value of OEP involved within program and resource creation can be determined by context, enabling
collaborative participation in layers of knowledge management rather than only access to free content
which was authored by someone else. The multi-organisation collaboration supported these resources,
which met requirements for the Indigenous fisheries training framework as well as supported meaningful
knowledge creation in remote communities. We pushed for this model of collaborative OEP which met
mainstream knowledge needs, but also contextualised competences by those authoring the learning,
provoking a shift in training- `student' relationships in culturally distinct instances.

Open practices with leadership from local knowledge authority can increase community ownership over
enterprise development; a reason people want training in the first place. Continuing to innovate on OEP
can improve learning quality and `open' training up to local realities.

In this way, OEP can transform `training delivery' into `community led development.' Increased ownership
can lead to increased engagement and authority over knowledge handling practices. Resource creations
became less about content and more about human centred authoring and interaction in application of
competence.

It could follow that the power in resources, programs and subsequent practices is determined by the
openness with which they are created. Following community leadership in consolidating the training
illustrates a placed, connected, and authentic practice, acknowledging complex realities rather than forcing
outcomes that would result in further ontological and economic disenfranchisement. Prior emphasis on
resource management has distracted attention from the practices which underpin resource creation, use
and interaction (Geser, 2007). OEP and learning can be `open' in different ways. Taking pause to examine
and define openness for this project helped us to step back from only focussing on content production and
ground a definition of OEP for the process concerned.

Learnings and recommendations

OEP is underpinned by authentic, place-based learning communities

The use of authentic, placed knowledge that respects knowledge authority and informs development can
complement and deepen workforce training through engagement with local realities. Learning is connected
153 | OER DOWN UNDER: OEP IN REMOTE AUSTRALIAN INDIGENOUS FISHERIES

to the place where it happens. Guthadjaka describes a joining of tributaries; that learning comes from a
series of sources (Guthadjaka, 2010). This directs OEP to be informed by a range of views and `re-present'
(Freire, 1970) the knowledge in a way that collaborates with a range of learning approaches, including the
learner's knowledge system. This also accommodates the tensions (Bannerjee & Tedmanson, 2010; Gould,
2015) between levels of life in knowledge and learning communities.

Emphasising relationships of people to their environment

Learning on Country (LOC) includes those that are doing the learning in situ and therefore aligns with
Freirean authentic education and is legitimate and lawful via local authority structures. Contextualising
OEP in a training framework designed to meet the expectations of Aboriginal people offers opportunities
for improved learning outcomes, design that aligns with participants' lives, and increased community
ownership. This `opens up' community-led development of workforce program knowledge. The
community leadership, authorship, and ownership of pedagogy - respects those whose learning it is, and
their authority in that context.

      It does the education design work ahead of meeting communities where they want to do and apply their
      learning.

More than just competence

Participants demonstrated having `know-where' and not just `know how and what'. Knowing the land on
which they work on multiple levels - due to it being clan-owned estates, childhood playgrounds, family
ceremonial places, historical trading sites with Makassar, and traditional hunting and fishing grounds; one
can see how the connected nature of the situated knowledge come to bear on learners' demonstration of
connected knowledge in the resources, in addition to workforce competence.

     Champions - what was the experience of those worked
     on the project? What did they say? Any reflections they
     have?

       Community Leaders would rather shape local employment programs under their authority.
       Training can represent a de-contextualised development agenda which doesn't
       acknowledge local authority structures' impact on how that would shape such employment
       program delivery (Klein, 2014; Manmurulu, 2016). Moving towards more localised training
       collaborations is a positive move.
       Trust and collaboration rather than power over `students'
                                        OER DOWN UNDER: OEP IN REMOTE AUSTRALIAN INDIGENOUS FISHERIES | 154

  Learning as participation and shared authority challenges the roles in training- `student'-
  relationships. The resources were filmed by the researchers and the staff `taught' the
  researchers. The community shaped the innovation of a situated training design.

In practice

Develop a partnership, build trust and demonstrate humility
Make sure the project meets the needs of the community first. Work to transform power
dynamics and innovate with the educational and cultural context - in this case, TAFE/VET
training sector and communities which it attempts to serve but is too distanced from.
Of particular- and still current- significance is the historical and ongoing colonial violence within
education systems. This influence has shaped the ongoing unsatisfactory experience Aboriginal
peoples continue to endure. Taking responsibility for dismantling the oppressive structures we
are complicit in is a starting point for all educators.
Educational institutions generally prioritise management of learning resources and compliance
systems. This can overshadow the potential for openness to be considered a collective right and
responsibility. The required power shift to engage learners in their own learning management
requires the subtle, contextualised use of OEP that would lead to more empowered learning
and competence in workforces. Learner-created resources are examples of the openness that
allows this shift, also presented in the Continuum for OER Adoption and Practice (Stagg, 2014).
Practical skill development and application required in the TAFE/VET sector demands that
work-related learning is the priority, not content creation. In the context of qualification
structures which help trainees, however, openness and authority in gaining and demonstrating
skills might retain trainees at a higher level than currently exists.
Acknowledgement of local knowledge authority presents an opportunity to imagine how to
further engage learners with culturally distinct concepts of learning in a more functional
relationship with learning and workforce participation.

Overview

Wikis provide a rich, but surprisingly underutilised digital environment for collaborative development of
open educational resources (OERs). Open wiki platforms, such as hosted by the Wikimedia Foundation
(WMF), can be used to engage in renewable (Grey, 2023) learning and assessment exercises with higher
education students.
To demonstrate the educational potential of open wiki platforms, this chapter presents a case study of an
ongoing project which has developed over 1,500 online, interactive, editable book chapters authored by
students about the psychological science of motivation and emotion.

                  Visit the book Motivation and Emotion book (Wikiversity)

Each student develops an online book chapter about a unique topic as a learning and assessment exercise.
This is an innovative alternative to traditional, disposable (Wiley, 2013) essay writing.
The project's OER-enabled andragogical philosophical and educational principles, and its approach to
scaffolding and student support, can be readily adapted across disciplines and levels of higher education
(Neill, 2024).
Engaging students and educators in collaborative authoring via open wikis contributes maximally flexible
and sustainable OERs to the knowledge commons and develop students' 21st century digital literacy
and communication skills (Neill, 2024). Open wikis offer ideal platforms for open andragogy and open

licensing allows re-use for any purpose.

   Using this case study

     This chapter provides an overview of how renewable assignments can be published openly
     using wikis. After reading this chapter:

          · Academic staff will: Develop awareness of the benefits and processes for facilitating
             quality student authentic assessments published as OERs

          · Library staff will: Learn strategies and techniques for working with students and
             academics to innovate and publish high quality student created content.

Key stakeholders

Key stakeholders for the Motivation and Emotion online book project are shown in an onion model (see

  · At the core is an inspired academic educator with values rooted in open andragogy (Clinton-Lisell,
      2021).

  · Second, there are cohorts of students enrolled in a specific university coursework unit (in this case,
      7124 Motivation and Emotion at the University of Canberra).

  · Third, there is a broader community of people who voluntarily edit Wikiversity and its WMF sister
      projects (see Figure 2) and who contribute by responding to student questions, editing, and
      providing feedback.

  · Finally, the broadest stakeholder group consists of all future users of the knowledge commons; these
      are people, but increasingly also bots that search for, access, and use free content on the internet.

This human-digital ecosystem provides a rich, holistic environment with dynamic nutrients (e.g., editable,
flexible, sustainable, reliable) for facilitating immersive learning experiences for students and developing
OERs.

Background information

The student-authored motivation and emotion book project was a response to some fundamental
problems with widespread use of traditional, disposable essays in higher education. The project
demonstrates how educators can guide student cohorts through simultaneous mass development of
individually unique works in a publicly editable, wiki-based, online platform.

                                    Figure 3. Universities mass-produce traditional,
                                    disposable student essays like sausages in a
                                    factory. Alternatively, students can learn to
                                    create unique, gourmet, handmade sausages.

Use of disposable (Wiley, 2013) essays for assessment in higher education is problematic for several reasons:
163 | WIKIS PROVIDE A RICH ENVIRONMENT FOR COLLABORATIVE OPEN EDUCATIONAL PRACTICES:
MOTIVATION AND EMOTION CASE STUDY

  · Traditional essays are typically hidden during the drafting process, limiting potential for formative
      feedback and peer-to-peer learning.

  · Traditional essays usually involve an educator setting a single or small number of permissible topics,
      leading to repetition across students and over time, pumping out student essays like a sausage factory
      (see Figure 3). Cookie-cutter approaches to education can be demotivating for students as they lack
      authenticity and heighten the risk of academic integrity violations such as plagiarism and contract
      cheating.

  · Traditional essays typically never see the light of day, even though their publication could potentially
      offer many benefits (Fatayer & Tualaulelei, 2023; Weller, 2011).

  · Traditional essays are usually written individually, whereas much professional writing in the real
      world is collaborative and involves version tracking, commenting, and interactive discussion.

  · Traditional essays usually consist of plain text which does not use the rich, interactive potential of
      the internet (e.g., hyperlinks, images, multimedia, comments). Furthermore, a general skill that
      students arguably should learn during higher education is how to contribute to the knowledge
      commons.

Use of traditional essay writing in higher education is increasingly problematic and is arguably an outdated
approach. With the advent of the internet, writing skills can be developed, and much other learning can be
facilitated, by engaging students in making unique contributions to the knowledge commons. Open wikis
offer an ideal tool for collaborative online development of OERs.

Project description

The motivation and emotion student-authored book project started in 2010, with approximately 100 to
150 students participating each year since. Each cohort of students author online book chapters about
specific motivation and emotion topics as a major part of the assessment for a third-year undergraduate
psychology unit, motivation and emotion.

The unit's learning outcomes are to:

  · Identify the major principles of motivation and emotion,
  · Integrate theories and current research towards explaining the role of motivation and emotions in

      human behaviour, and
  · Critically apply knowledge of motivation or emotion to an in-depth understanding of a specific

      topic in this field.

The project is scaffolded (see Table 1) to support students' editing skills, enhance their confidence, and
develop content (Neill, 2024):

  · Lectures introduce the rationale for a capstone-style, major project curated in a public space in order
   WIKIS PROVIDE A RICH ENVIRONMENT FOR COLLABORATIVE OPEN EDUCATIONAL PRACTICES: MOTIVATION
                                                                                                             AND EMOTION CASE STUDY | 164

   to develop and showcase students' writing and publishing skills and disciplinary knowledge.
· Tutorials teach useful skills such as creating a Wikiversity account, signing up to or negotiating a

   topic, basic wiki editing, and importing a template to help scaffold a chapter.

After selecting or negotiating a topic, students develop a chapter plan which is submitted as an early
assessment. This helps students to develop their wiki editing skills by presenting headings and sub-
headings, key points, and initial citations about the topic. Students are also taught how to contribute to
other chapters by editing and commenting. These social contributions are logged on their user page and
used as part of the marking criteria for the book chapter (Neill, 2024).

All book chapters have unique titles and sub-titles in the form of a question (e.g., Music and study:
What effect does music have on motivation to study?). Approved topics are listed in the volume's table
of contents. All volumes can be searched and browsed via the book's home page. The book theme is
"Understanding and improving our motivational and emotional lives using psychological science".

In addition to written text, each chapter includes interactive "learning features" (e.g., internal and external
hyperlinks, figures, tables, and quizzes). These features help to bring chapters to life and further distinguish
the work from traditional essays.

Once the final book chapter is submitted, students develop a three-minute multimedia overview of the
chapter, a link to which is featured underneath the chapter's title and sub-title.

The next steps for the project are to:

  · continue developing annual volumes about new motivation and emotion topics
  · promote the model's philosophy and practice to encourage wider adoption
  · support educators who are interested to adapt the model
  · continue refining the model to respond to student feedback and institutional policy changes.

Learning and recommendations

Getting started with developing open wiki-based OER projects is straightforward. WMF wikis are free,
stable, and open for anyone to edit. Content on these wikis is maximally editable and reusable, satisfying
the criteria for free cultural works (Creative Commons, n.d.). Wikiversity is dedicated to teaching, learning,
and research. Other WMF sister projects can also be used for specific educational projects,
including Wikibooks, Wikimedia Commons, Wikidata, and Wikipedia.

The main challenges to be navigated include:

  · developing educators' open andragogical teaching philosophies and rationales for open wiki projects
  · developing educators' wiki editing skills and confidence that they can support students
  · considering intellectual property rights and copyright policies of higher education institutions and

      how they apply to staff and students
  · willingness to step off the well-worn treadmill of students submitting disposable assignments

      through learning management systems.

     Champion statements

       Student feedback about the motivation and emotion unit and its OER book chapter project
       is publicly available. In 2023, 95% of students who responded to the official end-of-semester
       survey indicated that they were satisfied with:

            · the quality of the unit
            · how the staff in the unit supported their learning
            · the unit helping them with their work-related goals.
167 | WIKIS PROVIDE A RICH ENVIRONMENT FOR COLLABORATIVE OPEN EDUCATIONAL PRACTICES:
MOTIVATION AND EMOTION CASE STUDY

       A typical comment about the book chapter exercise was:

              "The book chapter is one of the most interesting assessment items in the psychology degree.
              It tests our knowledge of psychology theories and our ability to write for a different audience
              while allowing some exploration." (Anonymous, Q5T3 end-of-semester survey)

   In practice

     Based on experiences guiding over 1,500 students in building wiki-based OERs as part of their
     learning and assessment, the following advice/tips are offered to educators:

          · Teaching philosophy: Develop a personal teaching philosophy which is explicit about
             your values. Include why you do (or don't) contribute OERs and engage students in
             renewable, OER-based assignments.

          · Start small. Create a free WMF user account, then have a go at editing and asking
             questions. Start small, tinker, build your skills and confidence, iterate, reflect, and scale up
             over time.

          · Community engagement Engage with the wiki editing community on the hosting
             platform via discussion, collaborative editing, and mentoring.

          · Share actively: Share about the OERs you are involved in developing via social media,
             seminars, teaching and learning journals, etcetera. They will also be discoverable via
             internet search.

          · Scaffolded agency: Allow students as much control and decision-making as possible,
             whilst also providing scaffolding and feedback.

          · Foster community: Communicate care and micro-encouragements towards students
             through helpful actions (e.g., likes, editing, and feedback). It is natural for students to be
             hesitant to engage at first, because of previous experiences of controlled, constrained
             forms of learning and assessment.

          · Learning curve: Developing open educational practice skills with open wikis may seem
             daunting and time-consuming at first, but wiki editing skills lead to many efficiencies and
             benefits in teaching, research, and social impact that pay off in the longer-term.

EXPLORING "WHAT IF . . .?" WITH
RENEWABLE ASSIGNMENTS

   University of Southern Queensland

   Dr Eseta Tualaulelei

Overview

What if university assignments contributed to the greater good? What if students had a genuine audience
for their assignment work rather than just a faculty member or two? What if our students could contribute
to their future professions while at university developing their professional knowledge? This chapter
describes an open educational practice called `renewable assignments' (Wiley, 2016) and how it was used
to explore these three questions. I am a senior lecturer in the School of Education at a mid-sized regional
university in Australia. From 2019 to 2023, I and my colleague Dr Yosheen Pillay conducted and researched
renewable assignments in projects that led to 91 students contributing to 4 online books of open
educational resources (OER). In this chapter, I explain the ins and outs of the project and provide some
advice from my experiences. The chapter begins by outlining the different groups of people involved in the
project - including open education support staff, pre-service teachers, in-service teachers, and university
educators - before explaining the project's rationale. This is followed by a detailed explanation of how
renewable assignments were implemented across undergraduate and postgraduate courses in Education at a
mid-sized regional university in Queensland, Australia. The explanation includes details about how action
research was built around the activities to ensure that data about specific impacts were captured. In this
case, the action research focused on student engagement for two cycles and on graduate employability for
another two cycles, and it produced a range of insights into how renewable assignments impact on student
experiences. The chapter ends with some recommendations for those interested in running renewable
assignments in their own courses and reflections from people who were involved.

   Using this case study

     Renewable assignments are a type of authentic assessment that can engage students with
     online learning and enhance their graduate employability. After reading this chapter:
173 | EXPLORING "WHAT IF . . .?" WITH RENEWABLE ASSIGNMENTS

          · Academic staff will: Develop awareness of the benefits and processes for facilitating
             quality student renewable assignments to be published as an OER.

          · Library staff will: Learn strategies and techniques for working with students and
             academics to publish high quality student created content.

Key stakeholders

Open education support staff: My university is lucky to have a unit solely devoted to open education
initiatives. The two staff members of this unit at the time, Dr Adrian Stagg and Ms Nikki Andersen, were
integral to conceptualising, supporting and promoting the project. Adrian is an open education expert and
Nikki is a librarian specialising in inclusion and copyright so they were able to answer any questions we had
about open publishing.

Our students: 91 students (pre-service and in-service teachers studying the Bachelor of Education, Master
of Learning and Teaching and Master of Education - Guidance and Counselling) took the leap of faith to
publish their university assignments openly.

In-service teachers: Teachers who are currently teaching in early childhood centres, primary schools and
secondary schools contributed to the conceptualisation and review of the OER.

University educators: I teach early childhood and primary courses in intercultural education and literacy
teaching and Yosheen teaches Educational Guidance and Counselling. I ran three cycles of the project in
my courses and Yosheen ran one cycle in her course.

Background information

Several different needs were addressed with renewable assignments. Figure 1 shows the juncture at which
the renewable assignment was located and how it responded to various stakeholder needs, including:

Pre-service educators: In every course, we hear from students how they feel about their learning and their
university experiences. One of the top areas of complaint are university assignments, their expectations,
their relevance to the real world and the skills and knowledge students are meant to learn from them.
University assignments are often designed with professional expectations and university standards in mind,
but often they disregard students' perspectives. Renewable assignments offered an authentic assessment
task, linked directly to contemporary practice, that developed research and presentation skills students
would use when they became teachers.

University educators: We are constantly looking for improved ways to support and encourage student
                                                                  EXPLORING "WHAT IF . . .?" WITH RENEWABLE ASSIGNMENTS | 174

learning. The first iteration of this project came about in part because of my dissatisfaction with an
assignment I had inherited that I thought was not conveying key concepts and ideas in a meaningful way.
Renewable assignments offered an avenue for thinking outside the box about how I could improve this
particular assignment for students and strengthen the links between what we were doing at university and
the teaching profession.
In-service teachers: In professional development sessions I have run over the years, teachers have expressed
their need for resources. While the internet provides an endless array of resources, their quality and
relevance varies. In an area such as intercultural education, place-based and local resources are more
valuable than generic ones. Similarly, in literacy teaching, techniques, ideas and methods are constantly
being updated and explored. The busy literacy teacher does not have time to keep on top of all these
developments but me and my students do. I saw an opportunity to infuse this knowledge into resources
that could be shared with the profession.

                       Figure 1. How renewable assignments responded to stakeholder
                       needs.

Project description

Renewable assignments are those that "both support an individual student's learning and result in new or
improved open educational resources that provide a lasting benefit to the broader community of learners"
(Wiley & Hilton, 2018, p. 137). They are a type of authentic assessment that is shared publicly with
an open license. Mindful that there are different approaches to renewable assignments, I will explain my
specific project through three different processes: running a renewable assignment, involving professionals
and how to research your project.
175 | EXPLORING "WHAT IF . . .?" WITH RENEWABLE ASSIGNMENTS

Running a renewable assignment

Learn and prepare: I was a complete novice to open education but the academic literature is accessible and
high quality. I tried to learn as much about open education and open educational resources as I could.
Support staff were invaluable as they provided insights into a range of matters (digital platforms to host the
OER, open licenses, technological advice, copyright requirements for multimedia etc.). What I learned in
this stage helped me to design and visualise the OER that my students would produce. When preparing the
assignment instructions for students, I mentioned the possibility of their work being openly published. As
I didn't know whether a student would pass the assignment or the course overall, open publishing was only
mentioned as a possibility and resources were shared for their educative value.

Implement the renewable assignment: I ran the assignment as I usually would in a course. In later iterations,
I integrated resources into the course about open education; the United Nations (2019) actually
recommends that this knowledge is incorporated in all initial teacher education courses. After the course
had finished and grades were finalised, I invited students who has passed both the assignment and the
course to contribute to the open publication. I was not concerned with whether the students achieved a
low or high grade; so long as they passed, they were invited to contribute a chapter to the online book.

Create the OER: Those who accepted the invitation were given guidance with the purpose of the book
and who the audience was (in-service teachers). They could publish their assignment artefact exactly as they
had submitted it or they could modify it as they wished. Students were advised, however, that all chapters
would be edited for accuracy and readability. With later books, students were given a template for their
chapter so that the OER would present as a cohesive collection. Before these projects, I had never published
and edited a collection of anything so this was a useful training ground for that whole process. For each
book I worked with a co-editor and the open education support staff.
                                                                  EXPLORING "WHAT IF . . .?" WITH RENEWABLE ASSIGNMENTS | 176

       Figure 2. Summary of steps for running a renewable assignment.

Involving in-service educators or professionals

Learn and prepare: We offered professional development to early years educators and guidance counsellors
to share ideas about the OER project and gather their insights. For instance, we learned that educators
were drawing from Department of Health resources because the Department of Education did not have
what they needed. We learned about the types of day-to-day concerns that guidance and counselling
professionals wanted guidance with. In particular, we learned about the profession's resource needs,
particularly because we wanted to create OER that would be useful and contribute positively to
professions.
Implement the renewable assignment: There was no active role for professionals in this stage as
implementation was an internal course activity.
Create the OER: Quality is often a concern about student-generated OER (Wiley et al., 2017), so we
invited professionals to review the chapters. They were asked to comment on the currency, quality and
relevance of the work and in two of our books, we openly published excerpts from these reviews. The OER
were shared back with the professionals who helped conceptualise our projects and they have been shared
more widely across the teaching profession as well.

177 | EXPLORING "WHAT IF . . .?" WITH RENEWABLE ASSIGNMENTS

       Figure 3. Summary of steps for involving in-service educators or professionals

Researching renewable assignments

Learn and prepare: I designed my project with the intention of researching it from the outset because
this was a new teaching practice for me and I wanted to know what impacts, if any, it would have for
my students. Utilising the pragmatic approach of action research, I designed tools to collect data through
surveys, semi-structured interviews and researcher reflections. We gained ethics approval and then invited
students to participate. In the early cycles of the project, students were invited to participate while they
were creating the OER, but in later cycles, we were interested in knowing what students knew about open
education so we invited them earlier in the process.
Implement the renewable assignment: While the assignment was being implemented we collected data as
teacher educators, reflecting on the process of integrating knowledge about open education in our courses.
Create the OER: Surveys and semi-structured interviews were conducted after the OER were published.
Once data were analysed, we shared our learnings at various conferences and our students presented
alongside us at some of these (see next section).
                                                                  EXPLORING "WHAT IF . . .?" WITH RENEWABLE ASSIGNMENTS | 178

Key outcomes

A total of 91 students published four online books:
  · Gems and nuggets: Multicultural education for young children (Tualaulelei & Hawkins, 2020)
  · Hidden Treasures: Intercultural resources for early years educators (Tualaulelei & Macdonald, 2021)
  · Hearts and minds: Mental health support for schools (Pillay & Tualaulelei, 2022)
  · Co-creating multimodal texts with young children (Tualaulelei & Pillay, 2023)

Student-authors Katelyn Jackson, Kim Rohde, Sophie Woodward and Jillian Stansfield presented with
Yosheen and I at our university's 2022 Open Week to celebrate open education. I also presented with
Sophie at the Australian Literacy Educators Association Digital Energy Symposium 2023 and again in
2023 for that association's Teacher Education Special Interest Group.
I found evidence that renewable assignments increased student engagement (Tualaulelei, 2020) and
enhanced some graduate attributes (Tualaulelei & Pillay, 2022). Our findings have also been shared
through university events, teaching and learning blogs and professional development.
In 2021, OEGlobal gave me a UNESCO OER Implementation Award for collective impact and for
demonstrating exemplary leadership in advancing the UNESCO Open Education Resource
Recommendation in our own practices (there were 294 global recipients for this award). In 2022, the
Special Issue for the Journal of Multicultural Education edited by Stacy Katz and Jennifer Van Allen that
included our article Tualaulelei and Green (2022) won an OEGlobal Open Research Award.
179 | EXPLORING "WHAT IF . . .?" WITH RENEWABLE ASSIGNMENTS

What's next for this project is more dissemination of the practice of renewable assignments and of the
project's findings.

Learnings and recommendations

Work in teams: I did the first two cycles of this project as an individual and this was difficult. Working in a
team of two or more people is recommended to help manage time and effort. I collaborated with two early
years experts, Karen Hawkins and Jacqueline Macdonald, to help me edit the first two volumes of OER and
later worked with Yosheen Pillay. This helped lighten the load because there was a lot of decision-making
involved in each project.

Use available support: Academics are usually quite busy with a range of work. To keep your project
moving forward, draw upon the expertise of others, particularly open education support staff, librarians
and anyone else who can help you. For example, Yosheen had the university photographer assist her creating
the cover of Mental Health for which she had a specific idea in mind (those are her hands that are artfully
arranged on the cover).

Work ethically: There are times when open publication is appropriate and times when it is not (Orozco,
2020) and it helps to be aware of these. Try to think about your students and their best interests so that
they do not produce OER that may impact them negatively.

Share your project and learnings: In looking for guidance, the only academic source I could find several
years ago was a thesis by Dr Mais Fatayer that described something similar to what I wanted to do. There
are far more resources available now but more are always welcome. Sharing your work helps others.

     Champions

       Student feedback:

            · I was very excited to be published. It is an honour to be recognised for our research
                and expertise.

            · It was very exciting to contribute to a profession which I will soon be a part of as well
                as sharing with family and friends the work which I have been doing (you do not get
                this opportunity often as an adult).

            · Amazing idea! Amazing to be a part of . . . Most importantly, it is an excellent
                collaborative action and a great resource. I have never seen this done before.

       Early years educator feedback: "I like that there is a variety of information available. I feel
                                                                  EXPLORING "WHAT IF . . .?" WITH RENEWABLE ASSIGNMENTS | 180

       that the information given is informative and valued. I also like that other educators can
       share their knowledge also." (Elena Weatherall, Swallow Street Child Care Association)

In this promotion video for Hidden Treasures, you'll hear Liza Corrie (former pre-service teacher) talk
about her experiences with our project.

   In practice

     Advice for future projects: Do it! This chapter has only scratched the surface of the benefits
     this project had for everyone involved. As a teacher educator, I'm more aware of the immense
     experience our students bring with them to our courses; our students feel validated and
     accomplished; and early years educators and teachers can access our resources that respond
     specifically to their concerns.

CREATING BURNING ISSUES IN CLASSICS

   La Trobe University

   Nicole Gammie and Dr Rhiannon Evans

Overview

Creating Burning Issues in Classics allowed the involved staff to develop a process for curating quality
content that can be readily replicated for future iterations and by others to create ebooks containing
student assessment projects. It considered ways to limit power imbalances with the staff involved while
publishing the high quality student created content as an ebook that can be used by staff with future
cohorts in the subject and other interested parties. The key to the project's success was the type of
assessment task that provided students with the chance to demonstrate skills in research and presentation
and readily allowed the content to be published where the criteria were met and peer review undertaken.

   Using this case study

     Burning Issues outlines a process on how quality student assessments can be openly published
     as an ebook. After reading this chapter:

               · Academic staff will: Develop awareness of the benefits and process for
                   facilitating quality student assessments to be published as an OER and how
                   library staff can assist.

               · Library staff will: Learn strategies and techniques for working with students and
                   academics to publish high quality student created content.

Key stakeholders

The key staff stakeholders for the project involved a collaboration between academic and professional staff.
185 | CREATING BURNING ISSUES IN CLASSICS

They included the Subject Coordinator (SC), Senior Learning Librarian (SLL) and La Trobe eBureau
Coordinator. Students from the 2023 student cohort of a third-year Classics - Digital Humanities subject
were also involved.

Background information

The project started with the identification of the publishing opportunity within the subject's various
assessment tasks. 1 assessment task required students were asked to develop a digital project written in plain
English about a current ideological debate in Ancient Greek and Roman studies, considering what led to
this conflict, any assumptions being made and what is at stake. This might be a familiar political or cultural
scenario, such as the debate over returning museum exhibits to their country of origin; or the use of ancient
mottoes and images in alt-right propaganda. The task had several outcomes requiring students to research
a controversial issue and present their findings in plain English. This would also allow non-specialists to
become involved in the discourse in this space, as potentially complex issues would be explained in a way
that all could understand. Experience indicates that it takes time to create this type of authentic content
and it would be good to share what the students are learning. With this in mind, the suggestion was made
by the SLL to SC, to gauge interest in the possibility of a proposed co-created publishing opportunity with
students before talking over the idea possibility with the La Trobe eBureau to make it happen, see Figure
1 for the process.

In the past, such assessment tasks rarely got past the learning management system where they were
submitted. Openly publishing these projects as an ebook has allowed the public to see what students have
developed and for the students to add to the discipline's discourse in this space in the broader community.
The format allows for potential content from subsequent years to be added and acts as a model for future
students.

Project description

The proposal led to the publishing of 6 digital projects developed by students with an introduction written
by SC and a closing chapter on research and copyright by SLL and others in mid-2024. Students were able
to choose the topic within the parameters of the subject leading to a range of subject matter included in the
ebook.
                                                                                              CREATING BURNING ISSUES IN CLASSICS | 186

Figure 1: Overview of the full process used to develop the Burning Issues in Classics ebook [Go to image
description]

An application to consider publishing the content was submitted to the La Trobe eBureau for
consideration as they are responsible for managing the publishing of OER textbooks. With some
clarification around peer review processes to be used and the gap which the publication would fill, the idea
was accepted.
To help explain the opportunity to all students in the subject as being enrolled was the only criteria to being
able to be involved, a short (3min) video was developed and included in the Learning Management System
(LMS) along with a class presentation to encourage participation. Copyright considerations around
images, music etc were also discussed so students were aware this may need to be checked if they were
successful.
To avoid power imbalances and publishing low quality assessments, interested students were asked to
submit an expression of interest and their project had to receive a mark of 75 or greater to be considered
when the assessment was finalised. Expressions of interest were collected by the SLL who had no role in
marking the assessment tasks, with names provided to the SC once the marking was finalised. Students were
notified about being accepted. They were asked to incorporate the feedback provided on their assessment
tasks and write a biography and reflection piece on why they chose that topic. These were then passed
on for a second round of review by another academic expert, who provided further feedback for students
to consider. Students retained the copyright to their projects and were asked to sign a standard author
agreement with the La Trobe eBureau to allow publication, and they were asked to select an appropriate
Creative Commons Licence for their work. Once the content was finalised, copyright compliance checks
were undertaken, and copyediting and checking were managed by the La Trobe eBureau.
187 | CREATING BURNING ISSUES IN CLASSICS

Key outcomes

So far, the team has achieved a published ebook on the La Trobe eBureau website.

Publicity for the book will be undertaken to encourage its use beyond the subject into the broader
community. The ebook was launched online in late October 2024 with an open invitation as part of Open
Access Week 2024 activities. Further communications will be made to other potential interested parties
Presentations are also being made in various open education resource spaces as opportunities arose.

Learnings and recommendations

This is a highly replicable project. The key is to identify a suitable project where there are links to the
broader community and add to the discussion around these topics. Also consider the timeframes around
publishing, this may need to occur beyond the semester timeframe as peer review takes time, but is an
important component of a quality product. If the contributors are likely to leave the organisation before
publication (as in this case, most third years graduated shortly after completing the assessment task), non-
institutional contact information needs to be gathered.

A challenge can be to `sell' the idea to the students, as without them there is no book, while being honest
about the commitment involved. Students should be made aware that the publication can be leveraged
as proof of their skills in communication and digital technologies, and used as part of a portfolio when
applying for work or further study. Having an example of another subject which had published student
projects helped show the students what the end product could look like. There are a number of examples,
although care should be taken to consider their purpose. The content within Burning Issues was not
designed to meet specific course outcomes for high school students for example.

There is the potential for negative comments on social media around what the students have presented as
there can be some strongly held views around aspects of disciplines. To counter this, the chapter written by
SLL contains some information around possible strategies to minimise personal impact should this arise.

There were plans to undertake some research on the process to assist with refining how it was
implemented. This did not occur due to not being able to get ethics approval in time. The idea is to ask
students questions about their experiences, and these would be used in publications.

     Champion statement

       Student feedback:
                                                                                              CREATING BURNING ISSUES IN CLASSICS | 188

       Feedback from the students indicated it was a smooth process to be involved with, and only
       required responding to questions around copyright, content and some copy editing
       clarifications.

   In practice

          · Carefully consider the assessment tasks: could sharing them add to the discourse for that
             discipline?

          · Copyright of any content included in the projects - can it be shared? Submitting material
             for an assessment task can be different to publishing.

          · If the subject matter is sensitive for either the contributors or potential readers, what
             steps are to be put in place to limit the impact? For example, is a warning notice
             regarding content relevant to consider?

          · Getting feedback on the process - do you need ethics approval and what is the lead time
             needed to get the application approved?

          · Value of having a handover plan or process should staffing changes occur.
          · Interactive or digital project to be undertaken for the assessment task.
          · Students to write a bio so we learn a bit about them and a reflective piece to provide

             insight into why that topic was chosen (where there is a choice) within the parameters of
             the subject.

with the SLL identifying a potential assessment that could be published as an OER. Next, a discussion
is held with the SC about this possibility. Where agreement is reached, the project proposal is discussed
189 | CREATING BURNING ISSUES IN CLASSICS

with the La Trobe eBureau for approval. The approval form is completed including defining criteria for
acceptable student contributions (expression of interest and a mark of 75+). A decision is made whether to
accept the proposal and if successful, consideration of undertaking research along with the development of
class materials to explain the opportunity is undertaken. If research is to occur, then an ethics application
is needed as students will be surveyed. Content is delivered to the class explaining the opportunity and
what students need to do. Once marks are finalised, results are checked against the list of expressions of
interest received to determine who is involved and the publishing process continues from here including
peer review.

GUIDING THE GUIDANCE COUNSELLORS:
A CASE STUDY OF NEW DIRECTIONS IN
GUIDANCE AND COUNSELLING

   James Cook University

   Ben Archer

Overview

The Open Educational Resource (OER) New Directions in Guidance and Counselling (Archer, 2023)
emerged as an innovative response to the challenges posed by COVID-19 lockdowns. Originally, students
in the Masters of Guidance and Counselling program were to undertake original research during
placements for their capstone unit. However, pandemic restrictions necessitated a rapid pivot in assessment
design.

This shift led to the development of a major work centered on comprehensive literature reviews. Students
received explicit training in advanced literature review techniques, ensuring their contributions maintained
high academic standards despite the inability to conduct field research. This adaptation not only addressed
immediate assessment needs but also equipped students with valuable skills in synthesizing and critically
analyzing existing research.

The assessment required students to develop their major research literature reviews , showcasing the ability
to engage deeply with current scholarship in guidance and counselling. The collection spans various topics,
reflecting contemporary trends and emerging areas of focus in the field. Each piece underwent rigorous
evaluation for academic merit, relevance to current practice, and potential impact.

Compiling these works into an OER served multiple purposes:

  · It provided a meaningful culmination of students' studies despite pandemic disruptions.
  · It offered a platform for showcasing student research in a time of limited opportunities.
  · It created a valuable resource for practitioners and fellow students navigating similar challenges.

The project highlighted the potential of student-generated content in creating substantive educational
resources, even under restrictive circumstances. It demonstrated the adaptability of both students and
educators in the face of unprecedented challenges.

Ultimately, this COVID-19-induced pivot resulted in a unique learning experience. Students engaged with
                      GUIDING THE GUIDANCE COUNSELLORS: A CASE STUDY OF NEW DIRECTIONS IN GUIDANCE AND
                                                                                                                                    COUNSELLING | 192

the scholarly publication process from literature review to peer review, while educators gained insights
into facilitating collaborative academic work in a remote environment. The resulting product stands as a
testament to the resilience and creativity of the guidance and counselling student community during the
pandemic.

   Using this case study

     This case study demonstrates how an innovative response to COVID-19 restrictions
     transformed a traditional research assessment into an authentic publishing opportunity,
     fostering meaningful collaboration between academics and counselling students while creating
     an enduring professional resource that bridges academic learning with industry practice.

Key stakeholders

The key stakeholders in this project were the Master of Guidance and Counselling students at James Cook
University who contributed their work to the OER. Securing their enthusiastic participation was crucial
to the project's success. Students were initially presented with the prospect of contributing to a published
academic book as part of their assessment, with the understanding that only work achieving a grade of 85%
or higher would be considered for inclusion; this selective approach was demonstrated through examples of
existing academic compilations in counselling, where individual research chapters were brought together
into comprehensive volumes.

To foster student engagement, the importance of counsellors creating practice-based evidence was
emphasised. This approach was presented as a critical form of professional development, enabling
counsellors to inform their evidence-based practice and utilise best practices in their work (Hatchett, 2021).
By framing the project in this context, students could see the direct relevance to their future careers and the
potential impact of their contributions.

Maintaining high academic standards was paramount, given that the final product would be a university-
published resource. This necessitated rigorous quality control measures throughout the process, from
initial drafting to final editing.

The James Cook University Open Educational Resources team, comprising Alice Luetchford, Deborah
King, and Sherre Roy, played a pivotal role in this regard. Their expertise was instrumental in managing
the quality of work and overseeing the publication process. Their involvement ensured that the students'
193 | GUIDING THE GUIDANCE COUNSELLORS: A CASE STUDY OF NEW DIRECTIONS IN GUIDANCE AND
COUNSELLING

contributions met the requisite standards for academic publishing, thereby enhancing the credibility and
utility of the final resource.

Background

The capstone unit for the Masters of Guidance and Counselling, was initially designed to provide students
with an opportunity to conduct primary research during their professional placements. This approach
aimed to integrate academic learning with practical experience, allowing students to apply research skills in
real-world settings.

However, the onset of COVID-19 lockdowns in 2021 significantly disrupted this plan. Face-to-face
placements became untenable, and many internship hosts and supervisors expressed discomfort with
students conducting research in their organisations during this uncertain period.

This sudden shift created an urgent need for an alternative assessment that would maintain academic
rigour whilst providing students with an authentic, meaningful culmination to their degree. The challenge
was to devise an assessment that would adequately prepare students for professional practice without the
originally planned field experience.

Project description

The project centred on students producing substantial literature reviews of 2,500-4,000 words, each
addressing a clear research question relevant to their local context. The methodology I employed aligns
with the approach detailed in Chapter 7 of Alele & Malau-Aduli's (2023) OER on health research design,
ensuring a rigorous academic framework for the students' work. This resource is recommended for future
OER's that incorporate student work.

To maintain the high quality of the final OER, only submissions graded as High Distinctions (85%+) were
considered for inclusion. This selective approach ensured that the published work represented exemplary
student scholarship.

Students were tasked with several responsibilities beyond the initial writing. They were required to
proofread their own work meticulously, enhancing their editing skills. Additionally, they needed to secure
permissions for any images used or create original visual content, introducing them to copyright
considerations in academic publishing.

The editing process involved peer review feedback from both myself and the JCU OER team, providing
students with valuable insight into the academic publishing process. However, due to time constraints
attached to taking on additional classes and marking at the conclusion of the semester, I was not always
able to review the revised work before submission. Consequently, some contributions required further
refinement prior to publication, illustrating the iterative nature of academic publishing.
                      GUIDING THE GUIDANCE COUNSELLORS: A CASE STUDY OF NEW DIRECTIONS IN GUIDANCE AND
                                                                                                                                    COUNSELLING | 194

The technical aspect of the project presented its own challenges. Student work was uploaded directly
from Microsoft Word to the Pressbooks platform, a process that proved problematic. Significant time was
invested in adjusting formatting and conducting additional proofreading to ensure the final product met
professional standards. This experience highlighted the importance of considering technical compatibility
and not being time-pressured in ensuring the publishing process progresses smoothly.

Key Outcomes

The project culminated in a 14-chapter book, including an introductory chapter written by the academic
lead that framed the theoretical context for the collection. Students enhanced their chapters with self-
generated charts and tables to illustrate their findings, while library staff supported the work by sourcing
and incorporating Creative Commons-licensed images. Following a soft launch in May 2024, the book is
now being utilised as an exemplar within the Master of Guidance and Counselling programme, providing
current students with a concrete model of scholarly excellence and demonstrating the potential for their
own academic contributions.

Initially, there were aspirations to replicate this project with future cohorts, building upon its success
and creating a series of student-authored resources. However, these plans were ultimately curtailed due
to a confluence of several factors. Workload pressures on academic staff combined with institutional
restructures both had a significant impact on the time and resources required to replicate such a project in
the future. Furthermore, shifts in university policy regarding student-academic collaboration necessitated
the abandonment of the project in future years. This highlights the ongoing nature of the Australian
university system - that good work and initiatives are often changeable at the whim of policy and executive
decision making.

Learnings and recommendations

The development of the New Directions in Guidance and Counselling OER yielded valuable insights that
can inform future endeavours in student-led academic publishing. Three key areas emerged as important
to the success of such initiatives.

Firstly, securing student buy-in early in the process proved to be paramount. Only 14 students ended up
contributing to the book, when the potential size was as high as 20. The availability of exemplars was
identified as a crucial element in this regard. Students, unfamiliar with OER's, often struggled to envision
the final outcome of their efforts. Providing concrete examples of completed works similar to the intended
book allows students to grasp the scope and potential of their contributions, setting clear expectations and
inspiring higher-quality work. Future projects should prioritise the creation or curation of such exemplars
to facilitate student engagement and understanding from the outset.

Secondly, the time-intensive nature of developing an OER from student assessments cannot be overstated.
195 | GUIDING THE GUIDANCE COUNSELLORS: A CASE STUDY OF NEW DIRECTIONS IN GUIDANCE AND
COUNSELLING

Despite advancements in artificial intelligence and some misconceptions regarding the efficiency of creating
such comprehensive academic resources (Carter & Santiago, 2023), adequate time allocation remains
crucial. A potential solution could involve formally integrating the development of OER's into academic
workload models. While this may present challenges in implementation, it is essential for enhancing the
student learning experience and ensuring the sustainability of such projects. Recognising the development
of OER's, such as student-authored academic resources as a significant academic endeavour could lead to
more robust support structures and improved outcomes.

Thirdly, maintaining rigorous quality standards is essential for the credibility and utility of student-
authored works like New Directions in Guidance and Counselling. This involved adopting a discerning
approach to content selection, acknowledging that not all student work may meet publication standards.
Experienced academics must be prepared to engage in challenging conversations with students whose work
lacked novelty or rigour, culminating in them missing out on being invited to contribute despite their
marks being borderline Distinction/High Distinction. These discussions should be approached with the
same level of constructive criticism and guidance typically afforded to Higher Degree by Research students.
Providing practical, forward-looking feedback can help students understand the requirements of academic
publishing and potentially improve their work for future consideration.

These recommendations require significant investment from the individual or team responsible for
developing student-authored OER's. The process demands not only subject expertise but also skills in
mentoring, editing, and project management. However, the potential benefits--including enhanced
student learning outcomes, the creation of valuable academic resources, and the cultivation of research
skills among students--justify this investment.

Implementing these recommendations could lead to more sustainable and impactful academic publishing
projects, bridging the gap between student coursework and professional academic publishing. By
addressing these key areas, institutions can create more meaningful learning experiences and contribute
valuable resources to their respective fields of study.

Furthermore, projects like New Directions in Guidance and Counselling serve as a unique opportunity for
students to engage with the academic publishing process firsthand. This experience can be invaluable for
those considering further research or academic careers. It also provides a tangible outcome that students
can reference in their professional portfolios, potentially enhancing their employability and academic
profiles.

 Champion statements

  Student feedback on the New Directions in Guidance and Counselling project revealed a
  mixture of enthusiasm and frustration. While students were eager to see their work
  published, they expressed dissatisfaction with the extended timeline from submission to
  publication, which stretched to 18 months.
  This delay was primarily attributed to the need for additional proof-reading and quality
  assurance measures implemented after student submissions. The unforeseen extent of
  these post-submission refinements highlighted the importance of establishing robust
  editing processes from the outset.
  Despite the delays, students appreciated the opportunity to contribute to a published work.
  However, their feedback underscored the need for clearer communication about timelines
  and potential delays in future projects, as well as the importance of front-loading quality
  control measures to streamline the publication process.

In practice

Advice and Tips:
For future endeavours like New Directions in Guidance and Counselling, three key factors are
crucial for success. Firstly, securing student buy-in early in the process is essential. This can be
achieved by clearly communicating the project's benefits and potential impact on their academic
and professional development.
Secondly, having exemplars is vital. These provide students with tangible models of the
expected quality and format, helping to align their work with publication standards from the
outset.
Lastly, allocating ample time for peer review, and copyediting student submissions is
paramount. This ensures the final product meets high academic standards. A well-planned
timeline that accounts for multiple rounds of revision will contribute significantly to producing a
high-quality publication that reflects well on both the students and the institution.

Overview

This case study reflects on an open education practices (OEP) pilot project situated in a third-year history
capstone course at La Trobe University: Making History: Communicating the Past (HIS3MHI). The
project unites the voices of students and academics in showcasing Australian history for a general audience
by using OER to publish multimodal student assessments. This generated a collection of historical writing
that bridges the divide between the academic world and public history. We were inspired by projects
implementing renewable assignments through student-generated OER (Fatayer & Tualaulelei, 2023).

An initial selection of student works were transformed into OER content, culminating in the first version
of the open textbook Making Public Histories: Australian History Beyond the University (2023). We used
an iterative publishing model to generate a second version combining chapters from professional historians
(published 2024) with student work (published 2025) (See Table 1 for details).

We designed this "living textbook" to explore diverse digital mediums, uphold the high ethical standards
expected of professional historians, and to recognise the importance of reflection for learning. The OER
acts as a first step towards truly renewable assignments, as exemplified by the Motivation and Emotion text

featuring 1500 student works published in Wikiversity (Neill, 2024). Our pilot project models important
principles: these include reflective practices on the ethical dimensions of historical inquiry, collaborative
methodologies, inclusive historical narratives, and engaging a broad audience.
Looking ahead, we outline how our project has unlocked possibilities for deepening integration between
OER development and authentic assessment, forging partnerships with history associations and
community heritage organisations, enhancing student employability, and strengthening student
engagement. We conclude with recommendations for fellow open practitioners who want to create
student-generated OER and living texts.

   Using this case study

     This chapter provides an overview of how renewable assignments can be openly published as a
     `living textbook'. After reading this chapter:

          · Academic staff will: Develop awareness of the benefits and process for facilitating quality
             student authentic assessments to be published as an OER.

          · Library staff will: Learn strategies and techniques for working with students and
             academics to publish high quality student created content.

Origins

In 2021, the Open Education Program of La Trobe eBureau (an in-house online publishing initiative)
sought expressions of interest in trialling student-generated OER initiatives. Dr Nikita Vanderbyl, Lecturer
in History, and Clare O'Hanlon, Senior Learning Librarian, shared an enthusiasm for open education and
public history. This sparked the idea for an OER to be created in collaboration with students in Nikita's
third-year undergraduate subject, HIS3MHI, and to be published iteratively with subsequent cohorts.
Students would be both co-creators and the intended users of the text.

Why OER?

This student-generated OER model complements the focus of HIS3MHI on preparing students for
professional, ethical practice as historians. Students undertake a large independent research project on a
topic of their choice and communicate their findings to a public audience using digital media, for example
podcasts. Open pedagogy approaches were a natural fit for the subject's focus on communicating to the
public.
The work students generate for assessment often leads to the creation of sophisticated artefacts of
Australian history. These are potentially valuable to public communities beyond the university, but largely
remain "disposable assignments" unless converted into renewable ones in the form of OERs (Wiley and
Hilton, 2018). Renewable assignments are student works that "won't be discarded at the end of the process
but will instead add value to the world in some way" (Wiley, 2016). This gives these works meaning

beyond the university: in the words of one student co-author Thomas Amos, "it breathed new life into my
assignment".

This OER project gave undergraduate students the opportunity to experience real-life publishing and
engage in feedback literacies involved in responding to peer review. Diverse chapters were generated
covering many themes within Australian history. This open content is relevant to several diverse audiences:
future cohorts studying the subject, postgraduate history students, schoolteachers, the public, and
professional historians.

Forming a collaborative network beyond traditional
boundaries

Our ongoing project-based collaboration shares features with the Third Space framework (Whitchurch,
2012) in modelling integrated ways of working that go beyond traditional university department
boundaries.
We created a small academic-professional staff ecosystem (illustrated by Figure 4) of mutual learning
processes, enabling students to engage with a variety of practitioners from inside the subject, adjacent
to it, and beyond the university. The role of external practitioners as peer reviewers in our collaborative
network represents a modest step towards the adapted OER development model articulated by Fatayer and
Tualaulelei (2023) (illustrated by Figure 5).

Working in a team across departments was rewarding and generated cross-disciplinary knowledge needed
for Third Space projects like ours to flourish. For example, library staff (O'Hanlon) connected academic
staff (Vanderbyl) with timely Council of Australian University Librarians (CAUL) OER Collective
initiatives. Clare and Nikita enrolled together in the 2022 CAUL OER Professional Development program
and fed their newly acquired practical skills back into the project. Similarly, academic staff highlighted grant
and award opportunities from the History and Heritage sector. This informed a broader La Trobe eBureau
paradigm shift to better align its open education program with academic reward and recognition systems.

Roles, responsibilities, and processes

As the original designers of HIS3MHI, historians Kat Ellinghaus and Emma Robertson joined Vanderbyl
to form the academic editorial team, to curate and review student content for version 1. They were
         LINKING UP STUDENT AND ACADEMIC VOICES: REUNITING HIGHER EDUCATION AND THE PUBLIC SPHERE
                                                                                                                                   THROUGH OER | 206

supported by Steven Chang and Sebastian Kainey, La Trobe eBureau staff with expertise in open pedagogy
and OER development.

The first cohort of students in 2021 were self-nominating. Subsequently this has been refined with an
Expression of Interest (EOI) process implemented by Nicole Gammie (Library Learning Service). Students
continue to choose their own topics and utilise one of four formats: podcast, exhibition display, Wikipedia
page, or illustrated essay.

In version 1, Library Learning Services staff provided scaffolded support and wrote a dedicated chapter in
the OER to help students navigate open licensing, copyright, accessibility, and attribution. The University
Copyright Advisor added expertise to the project by conducting final copyright compliance reviews. The
open education team placed nominated assessment works into a web-ready format using an open book
publishing tool (Pressbooks) and liaised with practising professionals outside the university to involve them
as peer reviewers.

Work on version 2 began in 2023, adding the voices of professional historians for the first time. A call
for new chapters was circulated to public history networks and specified certain criteria to ensure strong
alignment between this new content and the subject's weekly topics. This phase of the project also invited
a second cycle of students-as-authors.

Project outcomes

The first version, Making Public Histories: Australian History Beyond the University, edited by Vanderbyl,
Ellinghaus, and O'Hanlon, was published by the La Trobe eBureau in February 2023.

Developing this OER has met student need for resources that act as both inspiration and exemplars
demonstrating HIS3MHI's assessment requirements. Current and future students can see a research
project path to follow from those who have gone before. These artefacts can be used to develop future
students' evaluative judgement, an increasingly valuable capability to make decisions about the quality of
work of oneself and others, as outlined by Tai et al (2017).

This body of work expresses the voices of current and future historians. An important outcome from
the chapters authored by professional historians is to strengthen the connection between history practiced
in Australian universities and public history more broadly. The reflective pieces written by each student
(appending their research projects) discuss how their historical research impacts the world outside the
university. Students reap the benefits of this modelling as they develop their own identities as emerging
practitioners.

A local outcome is that this project was spotlighted as part of La Trobe University's Learning and Teaching
Keynote on the theme of Students as Partners in October 2023. Reception outside La Trobe University
has also been positive. Since publication of version 1 (October 2023), the textbook has been accessed over
207 | LINKING UP STUDENT AND ACADEMIC VOICES: REUNITING HIGHER EDUCATION AND THE PUBLIC SPHERE
THROUGH OER

4,000 times by 954 visitors. Version 2 was published in December 2024, accessible through the version 1
link.

Reflections on our project

Open practices cultivate professional identities

The core idea of this capstone subject has always been to encourage students to think about themselves
as historians, instead of being a student writing about history. This includes inhabiting the role of the
historian through different genres and media used to create their research project. The ethical questions
students face in the process are captured in reflective writing accompanying each research project.
Publishing these as part of the OER publicly demonstrates students' metacognitive capabilities to engage
in reflective practices and model this approach for future cohorts.

We ask students to think about what embodying the identity of `historian' means. We encourage them
to reflect on their positionality: who are they in relation to their topic? This emphasis is reflected in peer
review feedback which indicated more could be done to put the text's claims about diversity and inclusion
into practice. We responded to this by publishing student biographies to better recognise their positionality
as authors.

Open publishing enables questions like: what does it mean to write for an open audience, and not just for
teaching staff? This is a weighty question for our students who chose topical areas like histories of previous
attempts to set up a Voice to Parliament.

This example, by 2021 student Madeleine Gome, demonstrates the kind of reflections on both medium
and accessibility, enabled by open publishing practices:

      "...I knew there is a relative scarcity of academic writing on First Nations' activism in the early 20th Century,
      and what has been written is often kept behind a paywall. I chose to write a Wikipedia-style article because
      this format is synonymous with succinct, easily understandable information. 1

Capstone research projects provide students an opportunity to put into practice the skills gathered across
their whole degree, as they transition to the workplace. Real world authentic practices, such as engaging
with copyright, peer review, and other aspects related to the rigour of academic publishing, introduces
stakes for students while remaining safe. This OER is a publication students can show future employers as
part of an e-portfolio demonstrating these accumulated professional capabilities. Table 2 demonstrates the
diverse ways that OER development practices align with common graduate capabilities.

Key challenges: students as co-creators

Publishing student work alongside that of professional historians, as we did in version 2, is an opportunity
to break down hierarchies and demonstrate the potential of teaching approaches that recognise students as
partners in learning and co-creators of meaning/knowledge (Fedoruk et al. 2021).

Aligning OER development models for student authors

This dynamic posed unusual dilemmas for the La Trobe eBureau, an open textbook program founded on
the assumption that all authors are teaching academics. Given that its OER production infrastructure is
designed with "conventional" academic-authored OERs in mind, this generated many questions like:

      Are conventional academic peer review processes the right fit, given that academics and students aren't formally
      peers?

It is a seemingly complex `can of worms' question at first glance. However, engaging in reflective practices
reminded us of our guiding principles of authentic learning, which led us to a surprisingly simple answer:

      If the goal is to cultivate students' identities as emerging scholars through authentic practice, then the most
      authentic approach is to not treat them differently than from academics." (e.g., full peer review process)
209 | LINKING UP STUDENT AND ACADEMIC VOICES: REUNITING HIGHER EDUCATION AND THE PUBLIC SPHERE
THROUGH OER

Nevertheless, scaffolding is still important to develop students as open practitioners in the same way that
OER PD supports academics. To support this, we created dedicated resources to explain the benefits and
considerations involved in OER development to students.
Another significant challenge is that highly structured conventional OER production workflows are
designed primarily for robust quality assurance and do not lend themselves to short turnarounds inside the
bounds of a semester. This means a significant portion of student participation in OER development is
extracurricular, with challenges of staying in contact with students after they have graduated or completed
the subject. It also makes it difficult to holistically integrate the OER development model with assessment
design, which is a key goal moving forward (see Figure 6 for our future directions).

Figure 6: "Three-stage plan for closer integration of OER development into assessment design", by
Steven Chang, licensed under CC-BY-4.0. [Go to image description]

Furthermore, in terms of evaluating the OER, indicators of success are quite different from conventional
open textbook publishing projects where the focus is on the number of adoptions, web engagement
analytics, and student confidence in understanding content. Approaches for evaluating student-generated
OER projects are more likely to incorporate assessment-related indicators such as increased student
engagement with assessment and a higher standard of assessment work.
This has been a valuable lesson in the importance of matching open pedagogies with fit-for-purpose open
technologies. Open Journal Systems is currently being investigated as an alternative option to create a
"student journal" OER model that is light, fast, flexible, and gives subject coordinators direct control of the
publishing system.
This is a brief summation of complex deliberations, but one of the main lessons here was to keep the
spotlight on learning and teaching goals as a guiding principle. Other elements such as OER development
and associated technologies should follow from this. It is easy to lose sight of this when thinking that OER
production is the end goal, rather than a means to a greater end (namely, learning and teaching priorities).

   In practice

     Concluding recommendations for practitioners:
          · Create collaborative Third Spaces for cultivating cross-disciplinary OEP teams that work
             across conventional professional-academic silos to foster mutual learning.
          · Identify capstone subjects as spaces for piloting student-generated OER projects, as
             there is strong synergy with priorities such as authentic assessment, professional identity
             development, public communication, stakeholder engagement, research project artefacts,
             and evaluative judgement.
          · For sustained OER projects over time, prioritise governance - such as establishing clear
             project roles, responsibilities, lines of communication, and expectations.
          · Create significant time and space for planning how student-generated OER models might
             be integrated with assessment design.
          · Provide scaffolding resources to develop students as open practitioners
          · Continuously ask whether the relationship between your open pedagogies and open
             technologies is fit-for-purpose - of the two elements, learning and teaching goals should
             almost always take precedence as the guiding principle.

USING SKILL TREE TEMPLATES TO
GAMIFY LEARNING

   University of Southern Queensland

Overview

Gamification can be a powerful tool for motivating learners, providing feedback and rewarding progress
(Sailer, 2020). Skill Tree templates are based on this idea and explore the idea of using video game skill tree
design to track real-life skills. When you play a video game, you can see your skill progress, see what's next
and know how to level up your skills to get to the next stage. What if you could do this with real-life skills?
This simple paper template format includes a spectrum of hexagonal skill tiles, from basics at the base to
advanced skills at the top. Get an idea of your skill progress, skill gaps and get inspired to try new things.
Pick a skill you're interested in and colour in anything you've already completed on the printable template.

Skill Trees Project is a repository of these skill tree templates across a huge range 60 + skill areas, from
electronics to gardening and woodworking to leadership. The Skill Trees project is licenced with the
Creative Commons CC-BY-NC-SA licence, which allows the project to make resources available freely
while allowing select commercial usage to keep the project sustainable.

This accessible and learning centred approach delivers a reflective experience where users can find their
current skill levels and set goals for future progress. Skill trees bring together multiple concepts into a single
template, incorporating gamification, goal setting, flexibility, self-grading rubrics, and portfolio building
to create an off-screen experience for upskilling and self-reflection to reduce distractions. Often, as self-
guided, informal learners without structured guidance, we often aren't aware of our own skill gaps and may
become stagnant in our skill sets. These skill trees aim to be a catalyst for improvement, where users can be
motivated to try new things and pursue new skills.

Currently, the project has an active community of contributors who submit new skill areas, peer review
current skills, and translate skill trees into other languages. The internationally published Skill Seeker book
series has emerged from this project and includes maker skill trees, plus a dashboard to show skill levels and
achievement badges to unlock.

   Using this case study

     This case study provides models of gamification in authentic assessment. Readers will:
          · Understand the theory of skill tree templates and their role in open-access teaching.
          · Learn about the Skill Trees project and how it has grown an active community of users.
          · Learn more about the future of the Skill Trees Project and how to contribute.

Key stakeholders

The Skill Trees Project originated as an independent initiative by creative technologist Steph Piper.
Templates are often used within her role as the Makerspace Coordinator at the University of Southern
Queensland as part of orientation and workshop activities. The `How to use the Library' and `Makerspace'
skill tree templates incentivise students to participate in non-compulsory learning, often with prizes. Since
the repository was placed online, the Skill Trees Project has grown a community of 30-50 active visitors per
                                                                            USING SKILL TREE TEMPLATES TO GAMIFY LEARNING | 218

day, and an active community of GitHub contributors who share completed skill areas and submit their
own skill trees to grow the repository. Others have created code-based solutions for the project, including
a skill trees generator app and various converters that can switch between `machine-readable' and `human
usable' versions of skill trees. This has increased the usability and accessibility of the project.

Background

In educational settings, gamification can be used to improve engagement, motivation and educational
outcomes (Sailer, 2020). Elements of video games that can enhance learning include badging,
leaderboards, challenges, points and progress bars. Badging, points and progress bars provide learners with
immediate feedback, rewarding progress and incentivising further growth. Gamified learning apps such as
Duolingo use these elements, where users can view their progress and see what's next.

Self-determination theory is a theory of motivation which emphasises the satisfaction of learners' needs for
competence, autonomy and social relatedness, and plays a part in gamification. Including personal choice
and agency, a sense of relevance and shared goals make a more powerful impact on learning outcomes
(Rigby & Ryan, 2011).

Skill Tree templates lean into these motivational factors, providing the user with feedback at their skill
level after they use the template and colour in tiles they've already completed. Users may feel a sense
of accomplishment for their progress so far, combining motivational badging feedback and a sense of
relevance. Furthermore, after the skill tree is fully coloured in, there's an opportunity for self-reflection and
goal setting. Users may highlight tiles that are interesting goals to work towards and can interpret those
goals in a way that is interesting and relevant to their current ability and journey. This provides choice and
agency in skill progression, rather than a standardised learning approach that removes self-ownership and
creativity.

This is also part of the constructivist approach to teaching, where the student is at the centre of their
own learning, building on what they already know rather than repetition. Vygotsky's seminal work "Zone
of Proximal Development" describes three levels of capability: the inner zone, where a student can act
independently; the next zone, where tasks can be completed with assistance; and the outer zone, which
represents what the student cannot yet do (McLeod, 2024). Using Skill Tree templates, we can identify
these different zones efficiently in a skill area, allowing more student-centred learning at their individualised
skill level.

Furthermore, using the templates can act as a catalyst for growth, allowing users to identify skill gaps and
find areas where they may be growing `stagnant'. It's easy to grow comfortable with current tools and ways
of working, without putting in the extra effort into learning new technologies and different ideas. Learners
may not be aware of missing skills until prompted by structured tools like skill trees.
219 | USING SKILL TREE TEMPLATES TO GAMIFY LEARNING

Design choices

The titles of the skill templates are designed to capture the essence of each skill and its relevance, while
allowing flexibility for interpretation. Rather than `Make a clock' under the woodworking skill area, it
might be `add electronics to a project', which can include a rich variety of things and allow the user to
interpret the goal based on their own interests and available materials.

Tiles start with foundational skills at the base of the template. For example, in woodworking, `Learn how
to use hand tools safely' and in robotics, `Assemble a robot from a kit' are the starter tiles. Progressing
up the skill tree, tiles include safety considerations to learn about, and materials, tools and techniques.
Types of projects are also included, for example `Make something for the home', `Make something artistic'
and `Make something practical'. One or two failure tiles are included, like `Have a print failure' in the 3D
printing skill tree, and `Get something wrong and try again'. Failure tiles reinforce the idea of failure as part
of normal progress. Plus, social and community building tiles include gifting something you've made to a
friend, teaching a friend a skill, visiting a local community space, releasing a tutorial or guide and teaching
a class on the skill area. The social dimension ensures peer-to-peer support and knowledge sharing across
learners.
                                                                            USING SKILL TREE TEMPLATES TO GAMIFY LEARNING | 220

              Figure 2: Example skill tree for 3D printing, by Steph Piper, licensed under CC
              BY-NC-SA 4.0 [Go to image description]

Not every tile in a skill tree needs to be completed, and a skill tree can be used as a base for goal setting, where
you might swap tiles that don't suit personal goals for added flexibility. The aim is for users to interpret the
template as a `custom goal setting tool', where tiles can be swapped as needed to suit the individual's ability,
as well as financial and time constraints.
Video game skill trees are most often built from connected nodes, restricting progress along skill tree
branches and locking progress. Original draft template ideas attempted to include this feature, but this
221 | USING SKILL TREE TEMPLATES TO GAMIFY LEARNING

proved difficult to implement and less relevant for real-life skills. Often, self-directed learning is guided
by the time, motivation, equipment and teachers available. Learning pathways in this space are not all
followed in the same order with the same path, and learners may progress non-linearly and complete skills
out of order. This is why a spectrum of difficulty was chosen in the template design rather than the classic
`connected node' video game skill tree design.

This project is also intentionally paper-based, allowing users to complete skill trees in an off-screen,
distraction-free environment if desired. It is most effective when combined with reflective journaling
practice for a meditative, self-reflective experience. Future use of the skill trees project will likely include
online versions, which may enhance the user experience by linking resources and providing a skill
dashboard for users.

Learnings and recommendations

Skill trees have multiple applications for self-directed learning, including portfolio building, workshops and
teaching and skills mapping, explored below.

Portfolio building

If you need to show a skill set without certifications, a portfolio of skill trees can help show a potential
employer the breadth of your skill set in a comprehensive but easily interpreted way. This supports
recognition of informal or community-based learning.

Workshops and teaching

Using skill trees can serve as a starting point for teaching a skills workshop. Find out the skill levels of
workshop participants and identify higher-level participants who may be able to assist others. Point out the
tiles that will be covered in the session and invite participants back for more advanced sessions that build
on the skills covered previously.

Furthermore, if you're a teacher with a STEM club, home-schooled students or looking for holiday
activities, using skill tree templates can help keep activities engaging and varied while letting the students
choose what they'd like to cover next.

In a makerspace environment, skill trees make it easy for new and experienced members to find appropriate
entry points and go at their own pace while creating their desired projects.

Skills mapping

Teams in the workplace may use skill trees to create skill maps of their employees, showing expertise and
                                                                            USING SKILL TREE TEMPLATES TO GAMIFY LEARNING | 222

skill gaps that can be mapped on spreadsheets. This is helpful to identify internal expertise and plan
professional development to fill skill gaps. Furthermore, they are useful for training new staff members on
desired skill areas.

Champion statements

       "This is amazing, what a brilliant idea and implementation. I especially like that there is
       flexibility in the way to reach each goal and it is up to the person to determine that they
       have gained a skill or not."

                -Myrthos@techhub.social
       "This is an amazing idea. I can see so many opportunities for use in training, personal
       growth, and education. It shows the goal and a path. It's rare to find something that opens
       up so many new possibilities."

                -docquinn@mas.to
223 | USING SKILL TREE TEMPLATES TO GAMIFY LEARNING

       "Wow, this is a great idea. Finding inspiration for something you are already doing a little or
       a lot. But it is also a fun way to peek into fields/disciplines you are not familiar with to get a
       sense of what they are about through their achievement milestones."

                -Docdoo@hachyderm.io

       "I'm a teacher-turned instructional designer, and it just resonates. I would like one for
       teaching, design, language, cooking, and basically every single thing that has a skillset."

                -Hawkmoon@mastodon.social

Key outcomes

The Skill Trees Project continues to expand, now adopting a more structured submission process that uses
tables to highlight where new contributions are needed and where past contributions require peer review.
Translators are also invited to contribute when a skill tree is fully peer-reviewed and complete, allowing
more accessibility for diverse users. Community incentives are available to encourage engagement (e.g.
badges, merchandise), and the main GitHub repository page receives 30-50 unique visitors on average per
day. The project is licenced under CC-BY-NC-SA, and is free to use for teaching, schools and commercial
workshops. However, users are not permitted to create books with the Skill Trees project, and software
development usage is possible after sponsoring the project.

   In practice

     Educators and learners can explore the templates on the Skill Trees Repository Github Page:
     https://github.com/sjpiper145/MakerSkillTree/

          · Pick a skill that you're interested in.
          · Colour in the boxes of anything you've already done.
          · Highlight tiles you'd like to set as goals.
          · Reflect on your current journey and plan for the future.

LIBRARY-LED INITIATIVES:
COLLABORATIONS TO INTEGRATE OER IN
NEW VETERINARY SCIENCE COURSES

   Southern Cross University

   Melissa Cuschieri and Jenny Luethi

Overview

This chapter delves into the collaborative efforts of two academic librarians at Southern Cross University
(SCU) to integrate Open Educational Resources (OER) and other freely accessible materials into new
veterinary medicine and technology courses. Drawing inspiration from the success of OER adoption in
SCU's Bachelor of Psychological Science program, we embarked on a proactive advocacy journey. We
explored the significance of OERs and Zero Textbook Cost (ZTC) courses in ensuring inclusive access,
particularly within SCU's innovative education framework: the Southern Cross Model. With SCU's
`Teaching and Learning Procedures' and the `Library Collection Policy' both endorsing open access
content, specifically OERs, this chapter underscores the fundamental role of library advocacy in promoting
equitable access to educational resources and fostering collaborative learning environments.

The announcement of two new courses in veterinary science opened the door to explore new avenues
and actively advocate for OERs and other open resources before the courses were launched. Instead of
the usual approach of retrospectively replacing traditional textbooks, we proactively began compiling a
list of OERs and alternative resources even before the courses were developed or written. This initiative
led to collaboration with the course design, planning, and writing team. With the Bachelor of Veterinary
Technology (BVetTech) expected to commence in 2025 and the Bachelor of Veterinary Medicine
(BVetMed) planned for 2026, this ongoing collaboration has provided valuable insights and experiences.

Since June 2023, when the new courses were first announced, our journey has been marked by a mixture
of ups and downs, highlights and challenges, excitement and worries. These experiences are all integral to
this case study and the project's outcome. They highlight areas for improvement along with our successes.
Most importantly, our journey has the potential to serve as a beacon for future library collaborations in
selecting student resources, paving the way for a local repository filled with high-quality OERs mapped to
subject areas and learning outcomes.
229 | LIBRARY-LED INITIATIVES: COLLABORATIONS TO INTEGRATE OER IN NEW VETERINARY SCIENCE COURSES

   Using this case study

     This case study is useful to explore how proactive collaboration between librarians and course
     designers can drive the successful integration of OERs into new university courses. By mapping
     OERs to course units before their development, this case highlights the challenges in resource
     gaps and stakeholder identification. It also illustrates the benefits of cost savings for students
     and the university, as well as refined curriculum design. These insights can guide future
     initiatives in creating equitable access to educational materials, fostering a collaborative and
     forward-thinking academic environment.

Key stakeholders

The journey began as an idea in the entrepreneurial minds of two SCU librarians, Melissa and Jenny,
inspired by the ZTC story detailed this book: Pioneering Disruptive Change to Create a Zero Textbook
Cost (ZTC) Course. While many universities place veterinary science courses within their health portfolio,
the new courses at SCU were assigned to the Faculty of Science and Engineering (FSE). This decision was
largely influenced by the expertise and experience of the newly appointed Executive Dean of FSE, Professor
Jon Hill.

At the start of our journey, we had no stakeholders to contact or collaborate with, or at least we didn't yet
know about them. It took several attempts to identify the people involved in designing the curriculum and
writing unit content. Initially, all we had to go by was a proposed list of units for each course. This provided
just enough information to get started and begin our search for resources.

At this early stage of course development, only three people had been appointed to the curriculum design
team. Fortunately, they were very receptive to our idea and welcomed collaboration. Monthly meetings
were scheduled, where everyone provided updates and asked questions. Granular curriculum documents
were shared with us, including Course Learning Outcomes and 40 learning themes, detailing how each
theme aligns with each module, unit, and the entire course. Once it became clear that the BVetTech would
be rolled out before the BVetMed, our focus shifted to working with the planner and unit writer for the
BVetTech course and we began mapping resources in more detail to individual units and modules.

It soon became evident that there were gaps and that OERs and other openly accessible resources would
not cover all themes and learning objectives. This realisation led to internal collaboration with the library
LIBRARY-LED INITIATIVES: COLLABORATIONS TO INTEGRATE OER IN NEW VETERINARY SCIENCE COURSES | 230

subscriptions team to set up database trials. We also purchased print copies of two primary textbooks used
for veterinary science education. Scanned excerpts of these textbooks can be provided in student reading
lists (in compliance with usual copyright laws).
We have mentioned several stakeholders in this section, however, the core stakeholders of this project are
the future students, and our main consideration is the financial relief this initiative could bring to them.
An example list of Veterinary Science themes is presented in Figure 1 below.

Project description

At SCU, the teaching model is based on 6-week terms, called the Southern Cross Model. Research
indicates that the high cost of textbooks is financially crippling for students (Correa & Bozarth, 2023;
Jenkins et al., 2020); especially for in shorter academic terms. Additionally, restrictive licensing conditions
placed on digital textbooks by publishers make it difficult for the library to acquire prescribed textbooks for
231 | LIBRARY-LED INITIATIVES: COLLABORATIONS TO INTEGRATE OER IN NEW VETERINARY SCIENCE COURSES

students to access ethically and fairly. Recognising these obstacles and seeing an opportunity to advocate for
the inclusion of OERs in a new course, we began mapping potential OERs to include in the new Veterinary
Sciences courses.

This extensive mapping workbook began as a broad framework which simply aligned titles of existing
OERs to the corresponding unit titles. As we received more detailed curriculum documents from the
course developers, we were able to refine the mapping process and identify further resources. During the
mapping process, the SCU Open Resources library guide was our go-to resource to locate platforms and
curated collections to search for potential OERs.

The mapping workbook contains:

  · Library guides from Australian universities that offer a veterinary science course
  · A list of OER textbooks mapped to unit titles
  · A curated A-Z list of OER textbooks
  · A list of free or Creative Commons (CC) licensed videos
  · A list of free or CC licensed images
  · A list of free or CC licensed interactive content
  · A list of recommended websites where relevant content can be freely obtained for educational

      purposes.

We also mapped subscription databases used by other universities offering veterinary science courses and
used this information to collaborate with the curriculum team when determining which database trials
SCU would undertake. While the workbook contains plenty of information relevant to the new courses, it
is still very much a work in progress, as it will be developed further during the unit writing process.

Outcomes

We have created a comprehensive list of OERs and other inclusive or open materials, which we will
continue to update. The aim is to make it as easy as possible for teaching staff to collate a list of suitable
readings for their unit from this list. We also aim to fill OER gaps with resources which are of no cost to
students.
We will continue to map content and update our mapping workbook. We will also keep advocating and
collaborating with internal and external stakeholders about this project to hopefully achieve our desired
outcome - SCU's second ZTC course.
Our ultimate plan is ideally to develop an Australian digital repository containing mapped resources to
support many more ZTC courses and units nationwide. The repository would contain freely accessible
resources from local authors, mapped lists of OERs including not only textbooks but other open and
inclusive resources, such as videos, images, articles, databases, online learning and anything else with a
creative commons license.

Learnings, challenges and recommendations

The hopeful integration of OERs into the veterinary science courses at SCU has highlighted key learnings
and challenges. We discovered that faculty collaboration is essential for successful OER adoption, as
is ongoing support and training for library staff to enhance capability to meet the unique challenges
233 | LIBRARY-LED INITIATIVES: COLLABORATIONS TO INTEGRATE OER IN NEW VETERINARY SCIENCE COURSES

integrating OER in university learning can bring. A significant challenge was the need for quality checking
and assurance of freely accessible materials to ensure that they meet academic standards.

Learnings

  · Ongoing support and training
  · Keep in regular contact with the key stakeholders (e.g. unit writers and course coordinators) and

      schedule regular meetings
  · Utilise your network to locate other possible freely accessible resources. Contact other libraries, as we

      all know that librarians are always willing to help!
  · The OER discussion has shifted from Why to How and What.

Challenges

  · Finding suitable OERs
  · OERs lacking Australian content
  · Identifying other suitable freely available resources
  · Identifying the right stakeholders to engage in discussions
  · Managing meetings and communications among busy work schedules and time pressures
  · Encouraging and motivating unit writers and academic staff to invest time in OERs instead of

      opting for the `easier' traditional textbook path (which will possibly remain an ongoing challenge)

Recommendations

  · Start your project as early in the course planning process as you possibly can
  · Use and share the same document from the beginning in a shared local drive to prevent losing work

      and wasting time
  · Do your best to gain insight into the course curriculum development process
  · Encourage the academics to write or adapt an OER if there are little or no suitable OERs to match

      the course content
  · Get out there, approach people and don't give up.

Useful resources

  · The authors gave a presentation at ALIA National 2024 titled Unlocking Knowledge:
      Promoting Open Educational Resources. The presentation and resources are
      available in Southern Cross Universities Cross Connect research platform.

  · The SCU Open Resources library guide provides advice and information on Open Educational
      Resources and Open Access.

Champion Statement

              "Beginning a new undergraduate degree program is no small exploit on its own, let alone
              designing one where the primary source of educational reference material is open source.
              The time one can spend searching for up to date and fit for purpose open source resources is
              immense. Couple that with the already onerous task of designing a whole new curriculum it
              is almost unsustainable over the modest time frames we're given.
              To be able to have a library team take on the responsibility for identifying suitable open
              source reference materials makes the process much less stressful and manageable across the
              development phase of a new program. Being able to efficiently review resources that have
              already been filtered through specific criteria dramatically reduces the workload and assists
              in the selection of higher quality resources that are more likely to be fit for purpose. The
              assistance such a team provides is invaluable to academics who may be unfamiliar with the
              breadth of current data base licenses, volume of publications, and general level of access
              available to the university."
              -Brett Smith, Program Co-ordinator: Veterinary Technology, and Senior Lecturer at
              Southern Cross University

   In practice

     Our main tip is to be brave and approach people. Reducing textbook costs for students should
     make sense to everyone. However, the current employment climate at universities has
     increased pressure on academics. At SCU, the transition to shorter terms in the Southern Cross
     model has further impacted already high workloads. Adopting an OER often requires re-writing
     or adapting parts of a unit to suit the new text. It's therefore important to use an empathetic
     approach while still delivering a clear message about the benefits of accessibility and equity. For
     new courses, advocating for OERs at the beginning of the planning and writing stages of new
     units is advantageous, as unit content can then be written with the open resources in mind.
     Another issue to consider is that academics can be sceptical about the quality of `free' resources.
     It's highly recommended you use a checklist to evaluate OERs and other open resources. Many
235 | LIBRARY-LED INITIATIVES: COLLABORATIONS TO INTEGRATE OER IN NEW VETERINARY SCIENCE COURSES

     CC licensed OER checklists are available online. The University of Queensland has a great
     example in their OER library guide. Engaging with critics by addressing common misconceptions
     is also effective. The OER myth busting document created by SCU librarians is an excellent
     resource for this.
     Finally, having a library policy that reinforces a preference for OERs and other accessible and
     equitable resources is very powerful. Internal organisational policies and procedures that clearly
     signal the importance of open resources provide valuable assistance when advocating outside
     the library

PIONEERING DISRUPTIVE CHANGE TO
CREATE A ZERO TEXTBOOK COST
(ZTC) COURSE

   Southern Cross University

   Dr Desirée Kozlowski and Carlie Daley

A warts-and-all account of what drove Southern Cross University to deliver Australia's first ZTC
psychology course.

Overview

The Bachelor of Psychological Science at Southern Cross University (SCU) is Australia's first zero textbook
cost (ZTC) undergraduate psychology degree. This bold and disruptive initiative is a perfect case study of
how an aspirational idea can progress to full adoption.

The ZTC degree was achieved by weaving together the threads of a zeitgeist, harnessing a passion for equity
and access, bottom-up and top-down collaboration, and maximising the opportunities of an institution-
wide academic model transformation.

The seeds for our initiative were planted in 2020 when a brand-new course coordinator, Dr Desirée
Kozlowski, encountered a graduate who admitted they had never been able to afford a single textbook
during their course. On the spot, Desirée decided to try to make a difference for all psychology students at
Southern Cross University by removing paid textbooks from every undergraduate psychology unit.

Of course, the decision was the easy part; execution took almost three years, lots of persuasion, cajoling,
determination, and diplomacy. After presenting the advantages, almost all academic staff supported the
initiative, but many felt their unit should be the exception and be allowed to retain a commercial text.

Luckily, the transition aligned with the SCU librarians' move to promote OERs and the University's move
toward encouraging their use institution-wide. A wonderful librarian champion, Ms Carlie Daley, offered
intensive support to academics, unit by unit, until, from 2023, all undergraduate psychology units at SCU
became fully ZTC. In this sense, the achievement was one of intense institutional collaboration.

Our social justice initiative will save 2024's commencing psychology students almost half a million dollars
across their degree while also increasing the representation of diverse voices they encounter within the
course material.
241 | PIONEERING DISRUPTIVE CHANGE TO CREATE A ZERO TEXTBOOK COST (ZTC) COURSE

The innovation will be of particular benefit to SCU's regional student cohort, as regional students are
known to be disproportionately affected by financial pressures.

   Using this case study

     The ZTC degree initiative at Southern Cross University is attracting attention from other courses
     and institutions wishing to pursue this very innovative approach to equity and excellence. As
     such, this case study will be useful for any institution looking for practical tips to implement
     similar initiatives.
     Let the revolution commence!

Key stakeholders

Desirée's initial idea came 3-weeks into her new role as course coordinator of the Bachelor of Psychological
Science at Southern Cross University. Desirée's social justice alarm bells went wild, and the idea of an entire
ZTC degree was born.
Carlie, an SCU Liaison Librarian, very quickly emerged as an OER advocate to help make the vision a
reality.
Carlie said Open Educational Resources (OERs) had been on the Library's radar for some time as it
wrangled financial barriers created by academic publishers and sought to enable student access to free
learning resources in a post-COVID world.
Library representatives, including Carlie, attended the QULOC OER Summer Institute event in 2020.
This was a deep dive into the global OER advocacy movement with OER guru and US founder of the
world's largest repository of OER texts, the Open Textbook Library, David Ernst.
At this event, Desirée immediately sprung to mind as a potential OER champion and, in a sense, the rest
was history in terms of Library involvement. Desirée had already been working to eliminate paid textbooks
across the BPS undergraduate program, and the Library helped realise that vision by mapping OER texts
to BPS units, using the Library's special collection of OERs, and chatting with Unit Assessors one-on-one.
A move like this can't happen from the efforts of two people alone. Each unit must be adjusted, which also
                             PIONEERING DISRUPTIVE CHANGE TO CREATE A ZERO TEXTBOOK COST (ZTC) COURSE | 242

involves reviewing or rewriting assessments in many cases. Thus, every unit assessor/convener needs to join
the effort.

Luckily, the world was beginning to turn its mind to free, open educational resources at this time. As we
worked our way through the project, more and more resources were coming on line.

In our case, the University was also completely transforming its teaching calendar and transitioning to a
brand-new delivery model: The Southern Cross Model. Part of that transition was ensuring contemporary
curricula and authentic assessment, which included changes to the Assessment, Teaching and Learning
Procedures listing OERs as the preferred option in the new academic model.

So, our move from expensive prescribed textbooks to more flexible, accessible options fitted that vision well,
and our bold goal of achieving a ZTC course also gained support at the institutional level. We managed to
hit upon the "...sweet-spot of bottom-up practice and momentum as well as some high-level policy statements
to provide an overriding narrative of what the particular institution wanted to do with OER texts." (Lambert
& Fadel, p. 38, 2022). In this way, we wove together the threads of a zeitgeist.

Background

Australian university students experience severe financial difficulties, and regional students suffer
disproportionately. Over 64% of regional students are worried about their finances, and almost 1 in 5 go
without food or necessities because they cannot afford them.

For caring educators, challenges like these can feel so enormous as to render us powerless. Desirée had
certainly felt that frustration. She realised that the cost of traditional textbooks represented a particular
burden on students already struggling and wanted to make a real difference to these students, to make
academic success more achievable for those with the fewest advantages. Not by changing a unit or two -
but in all the units in the undergraduate psychology degree.

Project description

The ZTC project replaced traditional assigned textbooks in all 16 undergraduate psychology units at
Southern Cross University with a range of contemporary resources accessible at no cost to students.

As course coordinator, Desirée first pitched the vision to the psychology academic team in April 2020 to
garner support for the idea. The target roll-out date was January 2023. Carlie worked with academic staff
to support them in sourcing suitable learning resources.

The goal was to replace every commercially published textbook. Although the aim was universal, each unit
involved unique challenges, so committed creativity from the liaison librarian was essential to eventually fill
all the gaps.
243 | PIONEERING DISRUPTIVE CHANGE TO CREATE A ZERO TEXTBOOK COST (ZTC) COURSE

Key outcomes

From 2023, the Bachelor of Psychological Science (BPS) at SCU has been ZTC to students. All core
psychology units and those in the recommended major use a combination of OERs, freely available web
resources, bespoke unit content, and online textbooks to which the University library subscribes.

This year's commencing students will save between $2000 and $4000 across their 3-year degree,
representing a combined saving to students of hundreds of thousands of dollars.

Along the way, we discovered that this transformation not only addresses equity concerns but brings a
range of other social justice benefits - because increasing the diversity of teaching resources can also amplify
the representation of minority and traditionally disadvantaged groups.

The ZTC initiative is now enshrined as the default option in Southern Cross University policy and
procedures so that even more students are benefitting from a reduced financial burden and more
contemporary learning resources. Across the University, the use of prescribed textbooks has dropped by
more than 50%, and the trend continues.

Learnings and recommendations

Aiming for a complete ZTC course was an audacious move and may not be achievable in every case. For us,
we did it (Yay!!!), but it was neither simple nor quick.

We learned that academic staff can simultaneously support the broad initiative and resist shedding the
much-loved textbook for their own unit. We also learned that respectful, collegial leadership can keep an
initiative moving forward despite resistance and challenges.

Our recommendations for others wanting to move on a project toward ZTC units and degrees:

  · It needs an OER champion - someone who will keep the vision and re-enthuse the team when
      needed.

  · It needs an OER advocate and takes collaboration - Carlie worked individually with each academic
      staff member to identify suitable resources for their subject and level.

  · It is not one-for-one - our solutions often involved curating a collection of resources to replace a
      monolithic textbook.

Champion statements

       "I want to be open about the challenges of making this kind of bold move, but all those
       headaches meant nothing once we rolled out a completely ZTC degree to a cohort of
       regional students who will each save literally thousands of dollars. Perhaps the most
       exciting thing is that other courses and institutions are noticing. Asking for tips to do the
       same thing. It feels like starting a tiny social justice rebellion. And I'm all for that."

                -- Dr Desirée Kozlowski, Academic champion

       "This achievement has been the result of passion for knowledge access, values alignment,
       and lots of blatant opportunism (at least on my part). If you are a librarian, I recommend
       that you begin thinking of academic OER champions whose values click with yours, like
       Desirée, and you seek to exploit moments of change (e.g., COVID and the switch to a new
       academic model) in the best possible way to enact broader change. Being involved in
       supporting the BPS program to become ZTC has been one of the most satisfying
       achievements of my career as an academic librarian. Another key reflection is to understand
       that it's a long game, and you need to keep planting seeds and water them over time."

                -- Ms Carlie Daley, Library champion

   In practice

     Key tips for academic staff: Stay strong. Keep the goal in mind. You're fighting the good
     fight.
     Key tips as a librarian, get very familiar with the OER texts that exist and keep abreast of
     new OER texts being published. You can do this by signing up for the OEP Digest Monthly to
     discover new Australian content that is being published each month. This will help you manage
245 | PIONEERING DISRUPTIVE CHANGE TO CREATE A ZERO TEXTBOOK COST (ZTC) COURSE

     expectations when you speak with academic staff about the potential for programs to go ZTC.
     For instance, there were OER options in psychology, but in some discipline areas, the OER
     content, particularly Australian content, is still very lean.

Overview

This case study outlines our experience of discovering several unanticipated benefits of Open Educational
Practices (OEP) to solve learning & teaching problems, attract grant funding, and cultivate academic career
recognition. Our collaboration involved a cross-disciplinary team:

  · 1 x biochemistry teaching academic
  · 1 x open education specialist librarian (La Trobe eBureau)
  · 1 x open education project officer (La Trobe eBureau).

Our project aimed to solve persistent difficulties that undergraduate students face for learning key concepts
in biomedicine, biochemistry and related life sciences disciplines. Traditional textbooks have focused on
comprehensiveness of content rather than tackling the root causes of learning and teaching problems.
By contrast, the main idea driving our OE philosophy was to sharply focus on cultivating students'
metacognitive thinking for confronting known learning barriers, including quantitative literacy and key
threshold concepts.
Our journey began as a modest open education resource (OER) development project focused specifically

on subjects taught at La Trobe University (LTU). Through experimentation, our reflective practices led us
to encounters with a broader range of OEP benefits than we anticipated. We used these to transition away
from a traditional didactic STEM education towards OER-enabled pedagogy, which included:

  · cultivating students' emerging identities as practitioners
  · designing authentic assessment
  · enhancing teacher presence
  · making difficult concepts accessible
  · empowering student voice and representation.

We also demonstrate how academics and professional staff can collaborate as an integrated `Third Space'
team to not only generate impactful OERs but create new shared ways of working in higher education that
go beyond traditional university binary roles.

   Using this case study

     This case study supports both academics and professionals (e.g. librarians/learning designers)
     and highlights how they can work together for mutual gains.
     Academics can learn how to use OEP for:

          · achieving career recognition, grants, and awards
          · making difficult concepts accessible for students
          · enhancing educator "presence"
          · reducing student anxiety about learning barriers
          · enabling students to `see themselves' in learning materials as emerging professionals
          · supporting the development of students' emerging professional identities
          · broadening local impact into global solutions
          · collaborating with professional staff to create new ways of working in the "Third

             Space".
     Librarians and learning designers can learn how to:

          · Advocate for OEP to raise the visibility of benefits to outweigh costs/time commitments
          · Partner with academics to develop their open practitioner identity and capabilities
          · Understand their professional role as `critical friend' to drive shared reflective practice
          · Recognise the power of their unique "Third Space" perspective for connecting the dots

             between disparate disciplines and university silos through open education projects.

Core method: Planning OER as problem-focused
interventions

Our project has generated two "primary" OERs in the form of open textbooks, targeting biomedicine and
biochemistry students, published by the La Trobe eBureau:
Foundations of Biomedical Science: Quantitative Literacy
Threshold Concepts in Biochemistry

            Figure 1: The two front covers of the primary OER outputs of this case study [Go to
            image description]

Both open textbooks are designed to act as educational interventions, meaning that they are designed to
help support struggling students to navigate specific barriers. In designing these it was necessary to adopt
a problem-focused approach informed by "backwards design" where outcomes are the starting point of
OER ideation (Elder, 2019). Lived teaching experience acted as a driver for us to reflect and systematically
define, explore, and research the problem before rushing into OER development. This process identified
that students struggled with both quantitative literacy (maths) and were falling behind in biochemistry
because they never properly grasped the fundamental concepts.
                                                          DEVELOPING OER AS IMPACTFUL EDUCATIONAL INTERVENTIONS | 250

Building strong foundations through clear purpose (Example 1)

For planning our first OER, Foundations of Biomedical Science, we used the following methods to
understand the problem systematically:

  · practical classroom observation
  · analysis of common student errors (known as diagnostic testing)
  · an extensive literature review on quantitative literacy education
  · consulting learning & teaching stakeholders in the discipline
  · development of a first-year subject focused on quantitative literacy (Foundations of Biomedical

      Science)

These efforts paid off, as the value of identifying the nature and scope of the problem later ended up
outweighing the time invested. This demonstrated that patient planning leads to developing a strong
purpose for the OER project.

Our extensive diagnostic testing (Pakay et al., 2019) informed us that many students:

  · suffer from maths anxiety, often connected to early learning experiences.
  · exhibit avoidance behaviour towards subjects with a maths component.
  · lose marks associated with any maths-related assessment because of avoidance.
  · can perform abstract maths problems but struggle with applied, worded problems requiring the

      same operations.

It was clear that a traditional maths textbook was insufficient for solving this problem. Instead, we needed a
text that provided problems in a discipline-specific context. We hypothesised that if we explicitly provided
meaningful authentic context for maths, this would decrease maths avoidance as students would recognise
these skills as integral to future professional practice.

Our ideation led us to another key purpose for the OER: broadening how educators can support
quantitative literacy across biological disciplines that share conceptual overlap. By widening the target
audience, we increased the utility of the OER to support both commencing students and students at any
level requiring a remedial resource. Consequently, the text is now used to support diverse teaching across
disciplines, including both a generalist first-year biology subject and biochemistry students from second-
year through to Masters.

Building strong foundations through clear purpose (Example 2)

In the case of our second open textbook, Threshold Concepts in Biochemistry, it was again fruitful to plan
the OER project based on careful scoping of the problem.
251 | DEVELOPING OER AS IMPACTFUL EDUCATIONAL INTERVENTIONS

Our methods for scoping the problem included:

  · reflecting on practical problems identified in classroom teaching
  · searching the biochemistry education literature (Wright et al., 2009, Tansey et al., 2013)
  · consulting guidelines/recommendations by professional discipline organisations
  · recognising the large-scale nature of this problem (beyond our university)
  · mapping practical classroom reflections against barriers identified by literature search

From this, we learnt that many students struggle with a series of fundamental barriers:

  · the initial abstract nature of biochemistry
  · ideas that seem disconnected but only coalesce when introductory courses conclude
  · information overload from traditional textbooks that are information-dense and intimidating to

      read (average of 900 pages, weighing close to 3 kg!)
  · didactic approaches that dominate many introductory biochemistry courses

The widespread nature of this problem made an open textbook the ideal solution due to its permissive
licensing for use by all institutions across the globe. Recommendations made by the American Society
for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology (Loertscher et al., 2014) suggested a switch to concepts-driven
instruction and skills. They provided an inventory of key "threshold concepts" for the discipline, which are
defined as concepts that often present a major barrier to learning and progressing in biochemistry, but once
mastered allow a transformative shift in a student's understanding and allow connection of prior and new
knowledge in more sophisticated ways.

Scoping the problem this way created a clear project goal for us: create an accessibly compact OER that
provides a concept-driven overview of biochemistry by focusing on the identified threshold concepts and
how they relate to one another.

Getting started: finding time is about motivation

Academics are often aware of teaching resource gaps but are under immense time pressures from
competing priorities. Ultimately, passion alone is not enough and weighing up costs-to-benefits is often
needed to proceed. Decisions about time commitments are usually determined by motivation and
priorities. This is often driven by a mix of intrinsic personal motivations and incentive-based extrinsic
motivation (Herbert et al, 2023; Nagashima and Harch, 2021). In a time-scarce environment, this
motivation must come from a judgement that the future benefits of an open education project idea will
outweigh the costs in that given situation (see Figure 2).
                                                          DEVELOPING OER AS IMPACTFUL EDUCATIONAL INTERVENTIONS | 252

Figure 2. A representation of a cost-benefit consideration that can drive the impetus for OER
development [Go to image description]

In our situation, the motivation came from taking a broader view that identified OER benefits beyond
access & equity. Learning about OER-enabled pedagogy (Wiley & Hilton, 2018) opened up the full range
of OER capabilities to us, and we realised that open textbooks in STEM can be more ambitious than just
being free of cost. Making this connection changed the equation for us: the benefits began to outweigh the
barriers (see Figure 2). An important part of this was recognising that OER projects are not necessarily a
new burden on workloads, as long as they are designed in a way that purposefully enriches and maximises
the impact of work already being done by educators.
The problem of scarce time, effort, and OEP expertise was drastically minimised through collaboration
with the La Trobe eBureau, who provided open education expertise. We worked together to explore OER-
powered creative solutions, which then leveraged significant post-publication benefits.
253 | DEVELOPING OER AS IMPACTFUL EDUCATIONAL INTERVENTIONS

Importance of professional staff for `critical friend' roles

Our collaboration highlighted how professional open education experts can play a key role as "critical
friend" who can integrate different ideas, connect theory and practice, and challenge assumptions about
how OERs work. This framing can help professional staff to understand they can make decisive
contributions with connective, communicative, and capability-building value.

We achieved this by cultivating a sustained `Third Space' way of working where academic expertise merged
with professional experience, driving the project throughout its lifecycle (Whitchurch, 2012). Who better
to play the role of "critical friend" than a professional librarian with experience overseeing and collaborating
on open projects?

Key elements of this role were:

  · providing critical appraisal of project ideation
  · connecting the dots between learning & teaching priorities and OEP
  · guiding academics through key considerations for OEP projects
  · reducing overwhelm by simplifying technical and copyright matters
  · drawing expertise from the broader Australasian OEP community into the project
  · driving continuous shared reflective practice.

An example of this is our successful application for a 2022 Council of Australian University Librarians
(CAUL) grant, which made Threshold Concepts in Biochemistry possible. Professional staff experience
helped us harness the grant criteria (such as inclusion of AU / NZ content) as an ideation tool, rather than
treating them only as formal requirements to be fulfilled. This combined with academic knowledge of real-
world Australian case studies in STEM to create locally relevant examples so students could relate to the
OER better.

A `live' adaptive OEP model

From our experience the best outcomes come from highly iterative OER development. In this process, new
teaching knowledge and interventions are flexibly implemented, evaluated, and fed back `live' into the open
textbook (see Figure 3). This also enables rapid responses to student feedback.

Our approach is non-linear in nature, which begins with teaching experience, iterates, and returns full
circle as the driving force of OER development. This is a significant departure from a common (but self-
limiting) object-centric production output approach where publishing the OER is a static endpoint and
little consideration is given to continuously integrating teaching practices.

Our adaptive OEP model supports more sustained work over time, as it fluidly interacts with the broader
scholarly environment. This enables outcomes such as winning grant applications, awards, and publishing
                                                          DEVELOPING OER AS IMPACTFUL EDUCATIONAL INTERVENTIONS | 254

secondary open artefact outputs. All these things generate further motivation for developing and
expanding the project and its impacts.

Figure 3. Our adaptive model for OER development begins and ends with teaching experience. All
project stages are highly iterative and powered by regular reflective practices [Go to image description]

Embedding diverse pedagogies

The most powerful OER feature we leveraged is the ability to incorporate and concentrate diverse
pedagogies in one resource. We used this flexibility to tackle an issue we had identified, which is that
students in biomedicine often fail to connect the relevance of abstract mathematical concepts to their
intended vocation, which adversely affects their motivation (Dyrberg & Holmegaard, 2019).

Connecting concepts to professional practice

Our Foundations of Biomedical Science project aimed to support contextual learning, after we identified
that existing maths textbooks lack biomedical context and were therefore too abstract for biomedical
students to be meaningful. Our solution was to embed video interviews with a diverse range of
practitioners about how important maths is for their professional practice (see Figure 4). Including these
practitioner perspectives helps students to see their future selves in the text and meaningfully link their
current learning to their future careers.
This encourages students to reflect on their identities as emerging professionals, which is known to be
important for retention and influences career trajectories (Huffmyer et al., 2022). Students can now see
255 | DEVELOPING OER AS IMPACTFUL EDUCATIONAL INTERVENTIONS

their future selves reflected in the text, identify how the discipline contributes to Australian society, and
recognise the contribution of women to modern biology. This inclusive approach is a contribution to
representational and recognitive justice as outlined by Lambert and Fadel (2018).

             Figure 4: An example of how we used rich multimedia to connect abstract concepts
             with professional practice in Foundations of Biomedical Science [Go to image
             description]

Similarly, Threshold Concepts in Biochemistry embedded pedagogies for making concepts accessible, rather
than overwhelming students with detail like traditional textbooks do (White, 1996). For example, we used
creative metaphors and analogies to explain difficult concepts (see Figure 5). In this way it would also aid
students in cognate majors to help with common misconceptions and guide their transition from early to
later applied study.
                                                          DEVELOPING OER AS IMPACTFUL EDUCATIONAL INTERVENTIONS | 256

           Figure 5: Teaching information flow in biological systems using analogy. An analogy of
           the cell as a factory is used in Threshold Concepts in Biochemistry [Go to image
           description]

Once again, it was our combined academic-professional Third Space perspective that highlighted these
avenues for embedding diverse pedagogies through digitally engaging multimedia. This distinguishes our
OER from AI tools, which cannot use lived teaching experience to generate such content. Our use of OER-
enabled pedagogy also provided an advantage over dense traditional texts that are too content-heavy and
formal to engage students effectively. Recognising these powerful capabilities tilted the "do I have time for
this?" equation in favour of benefits over costs and generated more motivation for the project.

Enabling online teacher presence

Strong teacher presence is known to be important for engagement in asynchronous learning environments
(Watson et al., 2023). We responded to students' requests for screencasts by directly embedding the OER
author's voice to guide students through practice problems.
Importantly, we designed teacher presence into the OER in a way that engaged students' motivation and
self-belief by recognising, validating, and gently guiding them through their maths anxiety. This could
be considered a form of "breaking the fourth wall": meaningful teacher presence that can mitigate the
challenges of online learning (Prestridge et al., 2024).

Empowering students as OER co-creators

Our OEP soon began to influence our assessment approach. We designed an oral presentation assignment
where students extend basic threshold concepts from the OER to answer more complex problems. We are
now using our CAUL grant funding to incorporate students' voices by publishing these oral presentations
into the next iteration of the OER. A large body of work emphasises the importance of peer assisted
learning in higher education, particularly for learning key skills (Stigmar, 2016). We hope that embedding
257 | DEVELOPING OER AS IMPACTFUL EDUCATIONAL INTERVENTIONS

student-generated OER will encourage intrinsic forms of student motivation beyond just their immediate
academic results.

Impact and outcomes

Our OERs were originally designed as local interventions, but have created a much wider impact. Planning
for impact creates a tension between addressing a broad audience and embedding local teacher presence
in an Australian context. We addressed this by combining the discipline-wide scope of our intervention
with a permissive open license (CC-BY-NC-SA). This enabled us to encourage both global engagement
and context-specific localisation.

Global engagement

OER analytics have been a powerful tool for demonstrating engagement. We discovered that downloads
from unique users greatly surpass local enrolments. Over 50% of web engagement is from the United States.
We are cautious about what conclusions to draw from analytics alone, but these indicators (and direct
feedback from overseas academics) suggest engagement beyond both LTU and Australian institutions.

      Midwifery in Australia)
  · Invited award speaker (on OER) for Biomolecular Horizons conference
  · Accepted as speakers at OE Global 2024 conference
  · Analytics-enhanced promotion application (result pending)

Open artefacts as secondary OER outputs

We have discovered that effective open practices generate new open artefacts in the form of reflections,
tools, and practices created by `process as pedagogy' (e.g. this very case study). These are all outputs in their
own right which can be shared via institutional open repositories (see Figure 6). In the spirit of this, we are
sharing an open collection of `secondary' OER outputs - these were originally generated by our project but
can be repurposed by other practitioners.

Thinking about process differently as a form of output (via these open artefacts) is a way to raise the
visibility of learning & teaching achievements that would otherwise remain hidden (particularly if they are
non-quantitative in nature). It also builds a shared commons to support the growth of the Australasian
OEP community.
259 | DEVELOPING OER AS IMPACTFUL EDUCATIONAL INTERVENTIONS

Where to from here?

We plan to further cultivate the "living link" between the OERs and classroom educator-learner practices
through a virtuous loop of feedback and evaluation, as depicted in Figure 3.

Developing evaluative judgement

We intend to use our OER Threshold Concepts in Biochemistry to pilot the integration of student-generated
open videos into subject learning activities. The goal will be to enhance students' evaluative judgement,
using principles from Deakin University's CRADLE resources to inform our approach (Tai et al., 2018).
This could look like workshops or assessments that involve:

 1. asking students to appraise the recorded student presentations and use shared peer feedback to
      identify limitations (including reasons why they think these are limitations)

 2. discussing the implications of these insights for how they can engage in metacognitive reflective
      practice for improving their own assessment work.

OER-enabled scholarship of learning & teaching

Our adaptive OEP model depicted in Figure 3 appears to have strong synergy with the `practice-led
research' OEP model suggested by Australian researchers Hamilton and Hansen (2024). We look forward
to delving into these connections to engage in OER research and evaluation.

   In practice

     For OER to be impactful educational interventions, development requires:
          · Address time management concerns: align OER projects as purpose-focused
             enhancements to existing teaching priorities, rather than new `outside' projects adding to
             workload burdens.
          · Begin with outcomes in mind: plan your OER using a problem-focused approach that
             incorporates backward design.
          · Reflect, iterate and practice: create a feedback loop between teaching experience and
             OER development (use this template for reflective practice in open education projects)
          · Find a critical friend: cultivate cross-discipline Third Space environments for sustained
             academic-professional collaboration.
          · Think beyond access and equity: leverage the full spectrum of OER capabilities at
             your disposal.
          · Plan how you will maximise impact: consider how to balance broad OER uptake with
             meaningful ways to address local needs and context.

benefits move beyond access and equity to transform pedagogy, generating student engagement and
classroom impact as well increasing academic reward and recognition for the developer through tangible

landscape and competing resources as well as by considering barriers to delivery, the incorporation of
pedagogical innovations and the potential scope of the OER. Drafting is also an iterative process governed
by peer-review, live testing and critical editing. How the final OER is used will be governed by user
feedback, publicity and connecting users and provides an opportunity for professional recognition and the
generation of secondary outputs.

STUDENT-STAFF PARTNERSHIP
PROJECTS

   University of Queensland

   Thomas Palmer

Overview

This case study describes a Student-Staff Partnership (SSP) project undertaken by the University of
Queensland (UQ) and discusses how the project raised the profile of open textbooks at UQ through
collaboration between students, Library staff, Learning Designers, and teaching staff. The SSP was a co-
designed project that helped build an evidence base about the use and importance of open textbooks at
UQ and explored our students' feelings and experiences with prescribed commercial and open textbooks.
The project culminated in a successful presentation delivered to teaching staff around the University about
open textbooks and generated several grant applications for open textbook projects.
This case study describes the process, challenges, and benefits of engaging with Students as Partners, for
open educational resource advocacy within a university. It discusses the importance of incorporating the
students' voice in service design, communication, engagement and advocacy.

   Using this case study

          This case study is useful for teaching academics and library staff. After reading this
          chapter:

267 | STUDENT-STAFF PARTNERSHIP PROJECTS

                   across all stakeholders and gain an insight into a successful workflow with a
                   view to leverage opportunities for assisting academics who are undertaking OER
                   projects with students as partners.

Background

Prior to the project, which ran in Semester 2 of 2022, UQ's open textbook service (Open Textbooks @ UQ)
had produced 10 books across a range of disciplines after operation in 2019. Just over 1,107 students were
actively being prescribed open textbooks by Course Coordinators in 2022 as compared to 7,661 students
in 2024:

  · Social Cost Benefit Analysis & Economic Evaluation (approx. 547 students)
  · Public Interest Communication (approx. 114 students)
  · JUNTXS Introductory Spanish (approx. 164 students)
  · +JUNTXS Intermediate Spanish (approx. 89 students)
  · Exercise Delivery (approx. 119 students)
  · Dentistry Environment Essentials (approx. 74) (UQ Library, 2024, August 29)

Even though the service had been running for some time, there was limited insight into UQ students'
perspectives about textbooks. It was difficult to gauge how many students were expected to purchase
commercial textbooks, at what cost, and how they felt about this.
The Library communicated a range of benefits to teaching staff about open textbook adoption, including:

  · cost savings to students
  · improved online experiences (no access or download restrictions)
  · increased student engagement via interactivity and rich multimedia
  · ability to easily incorporate local and/or diverse perspectives in content.

While some courses prescribed open textbooks, the Library had limited insight into students' experiences
with these open textbooks. The project wanted to use the data and insight gathered from students to
address perceived reluctance by academic staff to prescribe (either by adopting or creating) open textbooks.

Student-Staff Partnership projects

Students as Partners

Student partnerships have emerged in higher education as a means of centering the student in specific
projects, educational services, and curriculum design. At UQ, the Students as Partners program (SaP)
"creates space for students and staff to work together toward shared educational goals" (Institute for
Teaching and Learning Innovation, n.d.).

These projects are time-limited and characterised by inclusivity, reciprocity, and mutually decided goals.
UQ's Careers and Employability Unit coordinates Student-Staff Partnerships and offers any enrolled
student the opportunity to work with academic or professional staff" on projects designed to enhance
student experience, improve teaching and learning, and transform governance systems" (Careers and
Employability, n.d.-a). Before this project, the Library's Digital Learning team had been involved in several
student-staff projects to help create and update our core suite of information and digital literacy modules,
Digital Essentials.

Four SSP rounds are offered each year at UQ. For this project, a project application was submitted by
the Library to Careers and Employability in May of 2022, Student Partners applied and were selected by
late July. The project phase of the project ran for twenty weeks from August to November (Careers and
Employability, n.d.-b). Students receive a $1,500 grant, with the expectation that roughly 75 hours are
committed to the project (Careers and Employability, n.d.-c).

The open textbook SSP project

Project aims

"Access to required learning resources is fundamental to positive learning experiences and educational
success. We believe that a student's education should not be hindered by financial, geographical, or socio-
economic barriers. Promoting open-access textbooks at UQ is a key way to reduce these barriers and to
create equal educational opportunities for all students!" (Student Partners, 2022, September 7).

The primary aim of the project was to gather and analyse data in order to improve Library communications
about open textbooks, as well as incorporate into advocacy and outreach opportunities. We wanted to
understand:

  · our students' experiences with online textbooks, including any barriers to use
  · our students' experiences in using a prescribed open textbook, and
  · if prescribing commercial textbooks disadvantaged our students, and, if so, how.
269 | STUDENT-STAFF PARTNERSHIP PROJECTS

A secondary aim was for students to contribute to a communications plan to help disseminate the findings
of their project and to enhance open textbook advocacy efforts more generally.

The team

The project team included four Library staff members:

  · 1 x Manager, Digital Learning
  · 2 x Digital Learning Specialists, Digital Learning
  · 1 x Learning and Research Services Librarian, Faculty Services Library team.

Three students participated from the following disciplines:

  · Criminology & Criminal Justice
  · Speech Pathology
  · Psychology.

Methodology

The project team used several complementary methods to gather insight into student experiences with
commercial and open textbooks.

  · Literature review -- conducted a survey of literature on open textbook usage in higher education.
      This work informed survey and interview design.

  · Survey -- developed and promoted a survey using Qualtrics software aimed at UQ students. The
      survey was promoted through the Library website and promoted on social media. The Student
      Partners were also encouraged to share the survey within their courses and through their personal
      networks. Respondents went into the draw to win one of two $50 vouchers.

  · Survey analysis -- analysed survey responses to identify common themes and extract useful
      information/data.

  · Interviews -- conducted follow-up interviews with a small number of students that had submitted
      a survey response, and that had consented to being contacted by the project.

A range of project templates (Microsoft Office) were used to plan and track project outcomes. Additionally,
a private Microsoft Teams channel was set up for the project and was highly used to communicate and store
project files.

Project tasks were decided on by the group and largely completed by Student Partners. Library staff
contributed their expertise and knowledge of textbook publishing. They were also available to provide
students with training on systems, answer questions, and guide the project where needed.

Project outcomes

The main project outcome related to improving the overall engagement around open textbooks with
teaching staff. A major component of this was the design, deployment, promotion and analysis of a survey
aimed at UQ students. The survey responses, together with the information gathered from the literature
review and interviews, were valuable in helping the Digital Learning team engage with teaching staff and
the University and advocate for greater use of open textbooks.

Survey

The survey received 1242 responses, however, the project team identified that a substantial number of these
were bot initiated. Bot-initiated responses were identified based on discrepancies between supplied contact
details and University records, survey time-stamp irregularities (e.g. many responses were recorded between
12am and 4am, for instance), or free-text field containing answers unrelated to the survey subject matter.
A subset of 60 responses were selected for further analysis. Analysis allowed the project team to better
understand:

· textbook purchasing behaviour (what proportion of those surveyed purchased a textbook)
· the cost of purchased textbook
· usage of online textbooks
· awareness of open textbooks
· what they felt was most and least important about open textbooks (free, lack of access restrictions,

   interactivity, ability to include diverse perspectives).

A survey preview on Qualtrics providing details of the survey design and questions is available. The Student
Partners also created an infographic to help communicate some of the survey findings.

In Semester 2, a minority of student respondents (36%) were required to purchase a textbook and of
those, roughly half indicated that the purchase did not represent good value for money. A surprisingly
large number of students (46%) had used open textbooks in their courses. Of these students, 83% reported
positive attitude to open textbooks as learning resources. When asked to rank possible factors for why they
liked open textbooks, cost savings was most highly valued by students, followed by the ability to easily
print and download without restrictions, the absence of access restrictions (e.g. limited number of licenses),
followed by accessibility, and ability to read on multiple devices (Student Partners, 2022, November 16).
The importance of cost savings for students as emphasised in the survey results is consistent with other
international surveys. Ozdemir and Hendricks (2017) when surveying for instructor and student attitudes
towards open textbooks found that "students appreciated most the financial aspects of open textbooks".

Using survey responses

The survey responses helped the Open Textbooks @ UQ service to create impactful messaging about the
                                                                                            STUDENT-STAFF PARTNERSHIP PROJECTS | 272

value of open textbooks to students. Information from the survey was used by the Library and Librarians
in presentations, website and social media posts, as testimonials about open textbooks.

Several students noted the importance of having a free learning resource, with Survey Participant 1 writing
"because I don't have to stress about purchasing and it is more accessible and easier to use and learn through
multiple devices. It is way more engaging and makes learning easy!"

In addition to cost savings, however, students seemed to appreciate the learning experience offered by
open textbooks, including the importance of interactivity. Survey Participant 2 points out the impact of
interactivity on engagement, "downloadable exercises as well as interactive MCQ [multiple choice questions]
makes learning more intuitive and fun." This comment was mirrored by Survey Participant 3, "the
interactive textbooks are the most helpful to aid learning.".

Library staff also found it useful to refer to survey findings in conversations with potential authors. These
findings could be used to respond to questions from teaching staff or prompt discussions with specific
examples of what aspects of open textbooks UQ students valued - whether it is no-cost, interactivity, or
accessibility.

Information relating to the cost of purchased textbooks also improved the Library's ability to communicate
about the value of the Open Textbooks @ UQ service. For example, the Library was able to use the average
cost to students of commercial textbooks to help formulate a proxy dollar amount of money saved by
open textbooks and frame the Library's efforts as a direct intervention in addressing student cost-of-living
concerns.

Advocacy opportunities

The project team was able to leverage the SSP project and survey findings into presentations at various
teaching and learning forums. For instance, project team members coordinated an event for Ready to
Teach Week (R2T Week), a program of events coordinated by UQ's Institute of Teaching and Learning,
designed to help teaching staff prepare for Semester.

In the lead-up to Semester 1, 2023, UQ Library coordinated a session called: Open up your textbook!
Designing, creating and using open-source textbooks (YouTube, 50m30s) with contributions from the
learning design community, open textbooks authors, and student partners.

The student partners also presented to over 50 Learning Designers and eLearning staff about their project
findings. Learning Designers are an important stakeholder group in open textbook advocacy, so this
represented a valuable opportunity for our project team and the Library.
273 | STUDENT-STAFF PARTNERSHIP PROJECTS

Reflections

The Student Partners were able to reflect on their project findings via a blog post on the Library website
titled Textbooks today: The case for open online textbooks. They were able to report the survey findings
to the UQ academic community and "challenge UQ lecturers to consider using open textbooks in their
courses and to lead the UQ community into the future of open-access academia." (Student Partners, 2022,
November 16).

Library staff were really gratified to see the student partners advocate so effectively for open textbooks:

      "At the outset of the project, it seemed that the students had limited awareness of open textbooks. However,
      as the project advanced, it was gratifying to observe their growing comprehension of the potential benefits
      of incorporating open textbooks into courses. By the project's conclusion, I am confident that all student
      partners had become strong advocates for the use of open textbooks." (M. Sato, personal communication,
      September 19, 2024).

   In practice

     Learning and recommendations to share from this project:

    Recommendation 1: Incorporate students into advocacy initiatives

     There are tangible benefits to involving students in OER and open textbook advocacy efforts.
     As a group, students are the most affected by teaching staff choices when it comes to learning
     resources; students can help teaching staff and Librarians understand in real terms the
     importance of providing no-cost, accessible textbooks.
     Students benefit by having the opportunity to work on real-world projects that impact their
     education. Hopefully, by collaborating with the University on shared projects, students build
     their professional skills and capabilities and enhance their employability.

    Recommendation 2: Consider the timing and security configurations of
    online surveys

     The project team had limited experience in setting up surveys, and in particular, in configuring
     the security settings that contribute to high-quality responses. Not requiring respondents to
     authenticate led to a high number of fake responses, which needed to be filtered out manually.
     The project team would have benefited from more training on our chosen survey tool, Qualtrics.
                                                                                            STUDENT-STAFF PARTNERSHIP PROJECTS | 274

     The timing of the survey potentially led to fewer responses. This is likely because students are
     more likely to purchase textbooks for 1st year Semester 1 courses. Running the survey in
     Semester 2, meant that the survey received fewer responses than it might have otherwise.

VALUES BASED APPROACHES TO
EVIDENCE FOR OER ADVOCACY

   University of Southern Queensland

Overview

Data collection to support open education is often viewed as a stage of institutional maturity, and
concentrates on evidence aligned with student success and equity (Colvard, Watson, & Park, 2018). Cost
savings versus traditional commercial textbooks, number of student users, and downloads are all used
by advocates to demonstrate the value of open education initiatives, usually in forms of advocacy (such
as securing resources to continue programs). Increasingly, student achievement data is collected, linking
the access and authenticity of open educational resources (OER) access and authenticity to improvement
in academic performance (Tlili et al., 2023). However, in most cases, the platforms and infrastructure
supporting data collection and presentation are determined without including those whose experience the
data represents, or purportedly benefits.

At the University of Southern Queensland (UniSQ) Library, open educational practice (OEP) is built on
a community of practitioners who contribute and feel empowered to share their practice. `Practitioner'
refers to "any staff member engaged with OEP (whether enacting OEP in teaching and learning directly
with students, or providing direct support for OEP such as that provided by academic librarians, learning
designers, and Copyright officers)" (Stagg, 2023, p. 3). This community-based approach aligns with the
values-based approach that the Library's Evidence Based Practice team takes to encourage agency in open
narratives (Bell et al., 2023a). The UniSQ Library's use of data and dashboards to demonstrate the value
of OER and support ongoing evaluation empowers open textbook authors, giving agency to advocate for
open education and share practices.

Dashboards and institutional reporting do not often provide space for relational approaches; however,
UniSQ Library achieves this through intentional data practices that centers and elevates people. Such a
relational approach situates the university in its community and helps to position open education advocacy
in its greater social context, recognising relationships and interdependencies that are dynamic and impact
how our practices evolve (Lackovi & Olteanu, 2024). In taking a relational approach, shared community
values are realised and highlight the 'why' of being open and evidence-based (Bell et al., 2023b). Being
both evidence- and values-based places evidence and values as complementary - they exist in partnership
(Fulford, 2008; Stoyanov et al., 2020). Values-based practice emphasises that decision-making needs to
consider "preferences, needs, hopes, [and] expectations" (Fulford, 2008, p. 10) alongside evidence.

   Using this case study

     This case study is beneficial for library staff, academics, and open education practitioners.
     Readers will:

          · Develop their understanding of how evidence-based and values-based practice can
             support value and impact assessment and continuous improvement for open textbooks.

          · Gain practical insight into the development of a data dashboard and the importance of
             community-building to situate data in its social context.

          · Learn how questions can guide intentional data practices to elevate people and
             community needs in decision-making and reporting.

Key stakeholders

At UniSQ, the Library's Open Educational Practice team has adopted the slogan `open is everyone's
business.' This means they look for ways to build a community that encourages sharing. It is also an
invitation for every team at UniSQ to consider what they can contribute to open education or the extent to
which open education can help achieve existing goals or meet specific challenges that closed systems cannot.
This has led to a long-standing relationship with the Library's Evidence Based Practice team, prompting
collaborations that support continuous improvement, value and impact, and decision-making for open
education. This cross-team library collaboration and the shared values that underlie it support practitioner
engagement with open practices.
Practitioner engagement with OEP is `complex, personal, contextual, and continually negotiated' (Cronin,
2017, p. 28) and needs to be framed at the individual level. The lived experience, or `lifeworld,' of each
practitioner is mediated by complex, nuanced relationships between the individual, the institution, and
society, creating an ecology of practice: a lens through which broader practice can be understood (Stagg,
2017). As such, the centrality of practitioner values is critical to an understanding of OEP, and to support
communities of practitioners at the institutional level.
279 | VALUES BASED APPROACHES TO EVIDENCE FOR OER ADVOCACY

Background

Practitioners - and educational activities - are driven by values and a belief in ideals (whether expressed
explicitly or implicitly) such as social responsibility, social justice, and empowerment (Warren, 2000).
Constructing a culture in which open education is a viable and supported learning and teaching approach
requires deliberate and purposeful community-building predicated on shared values and trust. In
supporting OEP, trust builds social capital among participants and extends to all aspirations, interactions
and outcomes of practice - both individually, and as a community (Stagg & Partridge, 2019). Coleman
(1990, p. 4) asserts "a group whose members manifest trustworthiness and place extensive trust in one
another will be able to accomplish much more than a comparable group lacking that trustworthiness and
trust." Therefore, supporting open practitioners is predicated on engaging with practitioner values and
beliefs. The framework for this engagement at UniSQ is Fullan and Stiegelbauer's Theory of Educational
Change (1991). The framework situates change in practice as deeply personal and dependent on a
supportive community for success, and expressly privileges agency and autonomy within the process.
Predicated on positioning OEP as educational change, community formation recognises that change
requires scaffolding, ownership by those enacting change, and sufficient time and (safe) space to
experiment. Sustainable change of practice, ownership of the new, and a commitment to continual
experimentation in learning and teaching is reliant on engaging deeply with practitioners - a process
underscored by recognising the role of individual and professional values, aligning practice with values, and
building a cadre of practitioners who explicitly explore and respect community values.

To realise the full benefits of community-building and partnership, OER requires a functional alignment
and integration of OEP and evidence-based practices. Evidence-based library and information practice (or
EBLIP) is a process that involves collecting, interpreting and applying evidence, including research, to
support decision-making and continuous service improvement (Howlett & Thorpe, 2018). This extends
to assessing or evaluating the value and impact of library services and resources. Evidence-based practice
overlaps with the concept of `library assessment,' and it is the term typically used in Australian libraries.
This familiar concept can be applied to evidence-based OER advocacy.

A data dashboard

To tell these stories about the reach of OER or students' access requires asking the right questions to
collect the right evidence. Questions drive the evidence-based practice process and are the starting point
to help us define the problem or decision to be addressed. At UniSQ, our questions resulted in a data
dashboard that academic authors and library staff could access. In the lead-up to creating a data dashboard,
initial discussions and reflection between the Library's Open Educational Practice team and Evidence
Based Practice took place to assess the `right' evidence to be collected and its feasibility. Reflections were
supported by an OPEN (Objective, Purpose, Evidence, and Narrative) approach that helped to articulate
what needed to be known, collected, and communicated from evidence for library staff and academic
authors (Bell et al. 2023a). The discussions were expanded to include consultation and drop-in session with
                                                           VALUES BASED APPROACHES TO EVIDENCE FOR OER ADVOCACY | 280

academics which further helped to determine which specific metrics were important and why the data was
relevant to practice.

This discussion process started by considering the overarching values around openness, helping to
understand the wider social and cultural context driving our questions. From this, UniSQ Library teams
drilled down to questions that could be answered with the data initially available, exploring how the data
could inform decisions around creating and publishing the text itself. Authors were asked what data was
important to them and why.

  · Was it relevant to their research, learning, or teaching?
  · Would it help with academic promotion?
  · Was there any data already being collected that was not relevant or needed?

This enabled us to achieve a dashboard that situates evidence and data within its social context.
Community partnerships and relationships informed what UniSQ Library did or did not choose to collect.

The Power BI report produced has a dedicated page for each of UniSQ's open texts and can be accessed
by individual authors. The data dashboard predominantly uses web analytics data to demonstrate the
attention and reach of open texts as an initial proxy for impact. It is designed for our open textbook authors
to track the use and reach of their work and highlight how it contributes to the overall success of open
education at UniSQ. The main feature of the data dashboard is access. Authors have immediate access to
the data. Community input was vital to ensuring a good understanding of what evidence the library and
authors needed, but also understanding the purpose behind this data in relation to OEP values and the
community that uses the dashboard.

Key outcomes

The dashboard has highlighted the attention open texts receive and has been a new way to promote OER
output. The dashboard is split into four tabs for authors to navigate:

  · Traffic and downloads (see Figure 1)
  · Sources of traffic
  · Browsers and devices
  · Geographic reach

The process of EBP can help to facilitate critical reflection on practice, driving its continuous improvement
and the potential to change. Where reflective practice provides a link between theory and practice, EBP
can support the application of knowledge gained from reflection into decision-making. This may include
decisions on accessibility, the form of openness, platforms used, or how practice fosters values of openness
and facilitates learning.
One of our most popular open texts, Fundamentals of Anatomy and Physiology is read by a diverse cohort,
with many UniSQ students unable to access the online version due to connectivity issues in rural and
remote regions. Hence, it was important to use an evidence-based approach to discover students' reading
strategies and educational reality. UniSQ found that PDF versions of the text and reading on mobile
phones were popular for these students. Here, the data dashboard helps to facilitate an evidence-based
approach to understanding these educational realities and what access might look like for students in their
local context. As a direct result, the team sought to ensure Pressbooks tools for readability were adopted
(e.g., that all tables used the TablePress plugin in lieu of HTML coding, thus improving the mobile device
experience) and responded to feedback asking for more H5P activities to support self-assessment and
revision. The PDF versions contained links to online content, allowing students to revise core content, and
use their internet connection time more strategically to focus on specific learning content. Additionally,
this evidence has provided a foundation for discussions with other authors to encourage the extension of
practice into more interactivity, enhancing the learning design of their content.
Not only is evidence being used for decision-making and continuous improvement, but also for advocacy
of the value of OER. By starting with questions, UniSQ is intentional in choosing what to collect and
                                                           VALUES BASED APPROACHES TO EVIDENCE FOR OER ADVOCACY | 282

supported acknowledging the values and social justice orientation of open education. When thinking
about the value of OERs (e.g., economic, social, equitable), it meant also thinking about values (e.g.,
social justice, accessibility). The Library needed to incorporate the trust that was built into open education
communities into the choices made when collecting, analysing, or sharing evidence. It was important to go
beyond focusing on the processes and structure of evidence-based practice and instead to understand the
relational aspects of it that can elevate people. Since its inception in September 2021, the open textbook
data dashboard has been positively received by all authors, and the data has supported research (conference
papers and journal articles), teaching and learning practice (identifying key areas for continuous
improvement or evaluation of changed practice), and professional endeavours (the data has been included
in performance reviews, applications for external funding, and promotions documentation).

Learnings and recommendations

A challenge in using web analytics data is its ease of access. It can be easily measured and appear overly
promising, creating appeal for its use. This reinforces the importance of collecting meaningful and accurate
data and ensuring transparency in communicating data limitations and its use. It is where asking the
right questions matters (Drabinski & Walter, 2016) and where evidence-based practice extends into open
practices. Asking questions helps us to recognise the broader context, motivations, and needs that drive
why UniSQ Library was collecting evidence in the first place. Questions can ensure evidence aligns with the
contributions that OER make to social justice and promote ongoing reflection into why and how UniSQ
engages in open practice.

In being intentional and purposeful in what UniSQ chooses to collect, critical reflection on whose voices,
values, and perspectives are contributing to our evidence is key. A person-centred approach is taken
that relates evidence back to individuals. The evidence collected is recognised as existing in partnership
with underlying values and a wider social context and can contribute positively to the communities that
open education partners with. There is potential to see evidence-based practice (or library assessment)
as a relational process. Douglas (2020, p. 47) describes "assessment as care," a concept that prioritises
connection and people over reporting and products. It can, however, be uncomfortable work, as it
complicates the process of data collection and visualisation that makes up dashboards, as such outputs do
not usually create space for concepts like care or connection (2020, p. 6). Community partnerships and
user experience, which require greater time and connection, are easily neglected as evidence as their human
nuance and complexity cannot seamlessly be displayed in a quantitative data dashboard.
283 | VALUES BASED APPROACHES TO EVIDENCE FOR OER ADVOCACY

   In practice

     The authors offer the following advice for others wanting to create a dashboard to track open
     textbook analytics:

          · Prioritise people and connection over analytics and reporting - engage open textbook
             authors in developing a dashboard and give them agency over their data.

          · Be intentional and purposeful in the data you collect - start by asking the right questions
             to collect the right evidence.

          · Be transparent about data limitations and their use. UniSQ Library approached this by
             providing examples of appropriate data use-cases, adding disclaimers to the dashboard
             for data limitations, and providing drop-in sessions that invited data literacy questions and
             education.

COLLABORATIVE PATHWAYS IN SPORTS
MANAGEMENT: A JOURNEY THROUGH
PARTNERSHIP PEDAGOGY IN AN OPEN
ACCESS TEXTBOOK

   Western Sydney University

   Dr Jessica Richards; Paul Jewell; and Dr Daniela Spanjaard

Overview

This chapter explores the application of partnership pedagogy to develop an open-access textbook tailored
for sports management students at Western Sydney University. It underscores the benefits of partnership-
driven teaching methods and traces its evolution through the collaborative creation of an open-access
textbook in conjunction with industry stakeholders. In the realm of sports management, where North
American and British literature often holds sway, creating an open-access textbook paved the way for
students to gain a more comprehensive understanding of the Australian sports industry.

By closely collaborating with sports codes and organisations, academics have actively co-created and co-
designed curricula, captured local insights, and dismantled geographical barriers to sharing knowledge
about the flourishing Australian sports market--an aspect typically overlooked in conventional sports
management textbooks. The collaborative efforts with sports organisations have not only provided a
platform for representing typically marginalised sectors, such as women's sports, but also for exploring
niche activities, such as surfing and skateboarding. This inclusive approach, facilitated by the open-access
platform, elevates and delves into these previously underexplored areas within the course content.

   Using this case study

    After reading this chapter, academics, librarians, and learning designers will:

          · Be inspired to learn how academic authors can use open textbooks to fill gaps in the local
             market and tailor learning material to student needs and success
289 | COLLABORATIVE PATHWAYS IN SPORTS MANAGEMENT: A JOURNEY THROUGH PARTNERSHIP PEDAGOGY
IN AN OPEN ACCESS TEXTBOOK

         · Learn the benefits of collaborating together and with industry stakeholders in
            the creation of OER

          · Discover how a collaborative approach fosters a dynamic learning experience, which is
             both responsive to current industry trends and global perspectives, while also addressing
             gaps and underrepresentation in traditional textbooks

          · Understand the importance of ongoing collaboration to support the iterative nature of
             open textbooks

          · Recognise the unique skill sets that librarians bring in supporting academics throughout
             the development process and ensuring high-quality, impactful educational materials

Key stakeholders

The key stakeholders involved in the creation of this open access textbook were sport management
academic staff, the library staff, the university legal staff and industry leaders working in the sports sector.
The case studies included in the open textbook reflect those sourced from local sporting organisations in
the region and range from grassroots sports examples to national sporting teams.

Background information

The creation of an open-access textbook for a sports marketing unit stemmed from two primary challenges
encountered by the subject coordinator during the initial design of the subject.

Firstly, she observed that conventional sports marketing textbooks often inadequately address the unique
characteristics of Australian sports culture, given that most of these books focus on North American and
British contexts (Chen & Mason, 2018). This created challenges for students who had difficulty relating to
and understanding the core concepts of the course content. As one student reflected in a focus group after
the semester had finished.

"I think I liked the fact that the reading was sometimes based on our local teams here. It made it easier to
understand the case study, and when we were asked about the, like, tribal aspect of fandom, I could really
contribute as it's my team. I found it a lot easier to understand the theory this way, usually I am pretty
confused because I don't know anything about American football and like the fans there".

Secondly, it became clear that mainstream sports management textbooks largely emphasise male-
dominated sports and professional leagues, overlooking the growth of the Australian professional women's
sports industry (Hardin et al., 2006). Furthermore, emerging professional sports such as e-sports, surfing,
and skateboarding were notably underrepresented in the existing sports marketing curriculum.

                                                                                                                   OPEN ACCESS TEXTBOOK | 290

With the guidance of the Western Open Books Library team this initiative offered a cost-effective solution
for students to access all course content in a single location via a website link. (Western Sydney University
Library, 2024) This ensured that students had free access to all required materials for the course and allowed
those experiencing enrolment or access issues could stay engaged with the course content without falling
behind in their studies.

It has always been seen as problematic and detrimental to student well-being to charge for resources
and textbooks on top of expensive tuition fees. In a cost-of-living crisis, open-access textbooks are a way
for academics to provide some equity for students and society. As noted by Stagg & Partridge (2019)
`The affordances of open texts provide an alternative to commercially published and often exclusionary
access practices; and empower educators and students in co-creation and open sharing of information and
knowledge.'

Project description

The project was centred around the sport management staff's commitment to promoting partnership
pedagogy (see Barrie & Pizzica, 2019) across all subjects within their revised major. Partnership pedagogy
refers to an environment where academics, students, library staff and external industry partners collaborate
on meaningful projects, effectively bridging the gap between academic theory and real-world practice.

As part of this process, the subject coordinator undertook an industry internship at a national sports
organisation to gain a deeper understanding of the needs and requirements of working in marketing within
this specialist field. From her observations and interviews with this and other sport businesses in the region,
she developed case studies that reflect real industry challenges faced by the sports sector. This process of
content co-creation enabled the development of authentic learning experiences, which were embedded into
the open textbook.

As academics transition into new teaching and learning approaches brought on by the evolution of
technology, university curriculum must be dynamic and responsive to change. Textbooks and resources
supporting course learning objectives and outcomes also must be agile, offering innovative ways to engage
students flexibly.

Open textbooks, particularly the Pressbooks platform used by Western Open Books service at Western
Sydney University, provide interactive elements and enable academic authors to adapt and develop learning
materials for a localised curriculum, whilst also connecting students with the global industry of sport.
Additionally, the platform's inbuilt quizzes, fill-in- the-blank and other interactive `knowledge checks'
allow students to test their understanding asynchronously, without the pressure of formal assessment, thus
enhancing their learning experience.
291 | COLLABORATIVE PATHWAYS IN SPORTS MANAGEMENT: A JOURNEY THROUGH PARTNERSHIP PEDAGOGY
IN AN OPEN ACCESS TEXTBOOK

Key outcomes

The key outcomes for students and teaching staff using an open textbook on sports management are both
educationally enriching and practical.

For students, the main benefit is easy access to high-quality, current learning materials without the cost of
traditional textbooks. This ensures that all students can succeed in the course regardless of their financial
situation. The format also means students can access the content from anywhere, on any device (including
mobile phones, tablets and laptops), at any time, supporting different learning styles and needs. Including
real-world case studies and interactive elements, such as quizzes and videos, makes learning more engaging
and relevant. Students connect what they learn in theory with real-world examples, helping them prepare
for the challenges they may face throughout their careers in sports.

For teaching staff, Western Open Books offers flexibility in course design. Authors of the open textbook
can easily update the material each semester by swapping in different case studies or embedding YouTube
videos and social media content directly into the textbook. The ability to also include contributions
from academics in different countries adds valuable global perspectives to the course content, enriching
sports management education with diverse case studies. By incorporating case studies from various regions
(including the UK and USA), the open textbook helps students understand how sports management
operates worldwide.

Adopting an open education approach enhances learning both locally and internationally, and students
at universities worldwide can easily access the Australian case studies it contains, thereby enhancing their
educational experience. This global collaboration strengthens international teaching partnerships and
creates a shared educational resource that benefits everyone involved.

Overall, the flexibility and adaptability of the open textbook allows our sports marketing course to stay
aligned with current industry trends, ensuring that the content remains interesting, relatable, and relevant.
The collaborative process of developing these resources also strengthens the connection between local and
international academics and the sports industry, benefiting both educators and students. Furthermore, the
open-access model encourages ongoing feedback and continuous improvements, fostering a dynamic and
evolving learning environment.

Learnings and recommendations

It must be acknowledged that writing an open textbook is a substantial learning experience that demands a
significant investment of time and effort. The process of sourcing materials and case studies, in addition to
writing the open textbook, can be time-consuming, involving not only content creation but also becoming
proficient with the platform. Designing the structure and embedding interactive activities with multimedia
elements adds to the complexity of the task.
 COLLABORATIVE PATHWAYS IN SPORTS MANAGEMENT: A JOURNEY THROUGH PARTNERSHIP PEDAGOGY IN AN
                                                                                                                    OPEN ACCESS TEXTBOOK | 292

However, this is where collaboration between librarians and academics proves invaluable. Librarians can
support academics by sourcing relevant materials and offering their expertise in effectively using the
Pressbook platform. They also provide insights into innovative ways to enhance student learning through
interactive activities and other online resources. This collaboration ensures that the content is both
comprehensive and well-researched, while also being engaging and accessible, ultimately creating a more
enriching educational experiences for students.

     Champions statement - What was the experience of
     those worked on the project?

       Upon reflecting on the use of the sports management textbook over the past two
       semesters, the levels of student engagement with the course material have been
       significantly increased. Having all course materials in one easy-to-use, open-access platform
       ensures that students can readily access resources and feel empowered to do so.
       This increased engagement is also evidenced by the impressive readability metrics of the
       open textbook (Pressbooks), which has been viewed by over 35,000 people with over
       55,000 page views. These numbers not only demonstrate the significant impact of the open
       textbook but also show that it is reaching a global audience far beyond our student cohort,
       supporting sports management students around the world. This broad reach is a testament
       to the effectiveness of the open textbooks as a free and valuable educational resource.

   In practice

     To ensure the creation of an engaging open textbook, we strongly encourage academic authors
     to consult regularly with library staff and allow sufficient lead time for its development.
     Additionally, academics should view the open textbook as a living document--one that can be
     adapted and updated over time. The first edition can serve as a foundation that can be
     expanded upon, as we plan to do with our own open text. Next year, it will feature international
     collaborations and new case studies to reflect changes in the sports economy over the past
     three years.
293 | COLLABORATIVE PATHWAYS IN SPORTS MANAGEMENT: A JOURNEY THROUGH PARTNERSHIP PEDAGOGY
IN AN OPEN ACCESS TEXTBOOK

     Overall, open textbooks and other open-access resources offer a free, fun, and engaging way
     for academics to be more creative with the content they teach. It is strongly recommended that
     academics have their open text peer-reviewed by colleagues, either within their department or
     externally, to ensure academic rigour and quality.

Overview

This case study describes our project to transform an undergraduate open textbook at La Trobe University.
At the time of writing this case study the revised version of the text is forthcoming. Here we share one of
our key outcomes: the collaborative process we are using to make the transformative revisions.

We reflect on a First Nations-led cultural safety review process that is enabling health science academics
and library staff to jointly reconstitute this Open Education Resource (OER) as a culturally responsive text
that is inclusive and accessible for diverse learners. We highlight the role of First Nations staff in leading
a decolonising agenda and how non-Indigenous practitioners are supporting them through culturally
responsive practices.

We focus on how the project embodies First Nations ways of knowing, being, and doing through Third
Spaces that foster power equity and mutually beneficial two-way learning. These ways of working provide
an active alternative to the emotionally based paralysis that commonly affects non-Indigenous people,
stemming from a fear of "doing the wrong thing". This often demobilises their capacity to transform
beyond allyship on an individual level (which can be tokenistic or performative and a way to stay
comfortable) into `accomplices' striving for wider systemic change, regardless of personal or professional
discomfort (Finlay, 2020; Rix et al., 2023).

Our approach is part of a broader paradigm shift to integrate First Nations knowledges into higher
education curriculum in a meaningful way that is holistic rather than tokenistically additive. This paradigm
shift reflects a decolonising approach which requires de-centreing dominant Western perspectives by
challenging deeply rooted conventional norms and principles, and re-positioning colonial power in
collaborative relationships (Smith, et al., 2018).

We conclude our case study with some final reflections as prompts for practitioners to use for normalising
culturally responsive practices in the Australian open education movement. We invite open education
practitioners to join us on this shared journey.

Beginnings and new ways of thinking

Our project started as an initiative to update an open textbook but took us on a greater journey of growth
where we created new ways of thinking and working. Enhancing our team's capacity to work in culturally
responsive ways took time and cultivation by overcoming knowledge gaps that our non-Indigenous project
members had. We recognise this is an ongoing learning process.

First Nations knowledges not on the radar

The idea of integrating First Nations knowledges was quite peripheral to our initial plan. Our priority had
been to create a new edition of the OER Research and Evidence in Practice, the prescribed text for a core
research methods subject across undergraduate health disciplines. The 1st edition was published in 2018
and needed major updates to stay current, including enhanced interactivity and accessibility. We assembled
an initial team of one health sciences academic and two open education staff from the La Trobe eBureau
(all non-Indigenous).

Since the publication of the original edition, First Nations content was included in the health science
subject, and as part of that an appraisal of the OER textbook was also arranged. The insights of a First
Nations academic led us to recognise that the 1st edition of the text was not culturally responsive in its
perspective and content. This in itself was an important lesson; OERs enable powerful potential for social
justice (Lambert, 2018), but it does not follow that all OERs are therefore automatically culturally safe
(Nusbaum, 2020). It quickly became clear that a cultural safety review was needed.

Understanding cultural safety

We increasingly drew on the perspective of the First Nations team member, which was decisive for
identifying a greater range of limitations than we had first understood. We first focused on minimising
limitations, but we soon reached a tipping point where we recognised the need to solve more fundamental
problems. As a result, this collaboration has become increasingly reflexive as we reassessed our purpose.

A key lesson was to understand the distinction between culturally responsive practices and creating actual
cultural safety. We learnt that the rapid proliferation and differing interpretations of terminology in this
space means deliberate clarity is essential for authentic practice. Based on First Nations-led understandings
and appreciating there are shared features, here is how we understand this pair of concepts:

299 | REIMAGINING OPEN TEXTBOOKS THROUGH A DECOLONISING LENS: NON-LINEAR PRACTICES FOR
HOLISTICALLY INTEGRATING FIRST NATIONS KNOWLEDGES INTO CURRICULUM

This distinction enabled us to be clearer about the expanded purpose of our project. It also meant we
grasped how we would judge whether our work achieves our goals. For example, recognising the definition
of cultural safety meant we used the term more judiciously. As part of this, we understand that the primary
criteria for determining whether our open textbook is culturally safe or not for First Nations educators and
learners can only be judged by First Nations peoples.

Tangible resourcing for First Nations engagement

During the initial planning stage, we had advanced our awareness, but our non-Indigenous project
members had no lived experience of a cultural safety review. We recognised the need for such reviews and
saw it as a high priority because of both informal and institutional leadership in our work environments
(within the University and the OER community) about embedding First Nations knowledges. Despite our
enthusiasm, our inexperience and biases led to our naïve assumption that including a cultural safety review
in the project would be as simple as inviting a First Nations expert to provide one as a separate process to
the main work.

Through reflective shared practice, we soon recognised that the work involved in undertaking a cultural
safety review is demanding and time-consuming. First Nations people make up a small proportion of
university staff, and these practitioners are often over-burdened with requests like these in addition to their
regular duties. Tangible support is therefore a key enabler of cultural safety projects to mitigate the risks of
burnout for First Nations staff. Ideally, this support provides direct funding for the labour, expertise, and
experience required.

In July 2023 the University Library was pursuing diverse avenues to sustainably fund open education
projects at the La Trobe eBureau. We successfully identified a funding opportunity through collaboration
with the Alumni and Advancement Office. These funds were donated by the family of an international
student who tragically passed away during his studies at the University. The family's wish was to fund a
project with lasting impact for as many learners as possible (as opposed to a short-term single scholarship).

Several candidate open education projects needed funding, but our proposal was successful because of
the advocacy by non-Indigenous professional staff in communicating the project's alignment with both
the donor family's wishes and Library management priorities. This advocacy was driven by our fresh
recognition of how important it is to tangibly support First Nations contributions, rather than just rely on
goodwill and passion.

Moving forward with new ways of working

Successfully funding the project was a major outcome that laid the foundation for committing to sustained
ways of working together cross-culturally and across the traditional academic and professional divide.

The Third Space: Lateral collaboration across conventional
boundaries

We organically created collaborative practices that resemble the `Third Space'. Features of this Third Space
include lateral collaboration across departments to bring together different expertise and experiences, non-
conventional project roles and shared responsibilities, and co-leadership with joint navigation of paradoxes
and dilemmas (Whitchurch, 2012, 2015). The non-hierarchical nature of our work within this Third Space
enables a two-way, critically reflective process of knowledge sharing and decision making.

      departmental project team and for examples of how our practices aligned with the features of a Third Space.

The Cultural Third Space (a cultural interpretation of the academic-professional Third Space nexus) is
another helpful way of explaining how we work. It is a cultural interface where respectful co-leadership
can create overlapping spaces to join up synergies between both First Nations and Western knowledges
(Nakata, 2002; Dudgeon & Fielder, 2006).

For example, in reimagining our revised OER we do not discard the teaching of Western scientific methods
simply because it is Western in origin. Instead, we use First Nations perspectives to critically expose the
ways these conventional methods exclude First Nations ways of creating knowledge, including storytelling,
as research tools and First Nations worldviews and lived realities which provide important context for
quantitative statistics, and how this all adds up to cause significant harm in health sciences research
and practice. Combining the benefits of Western scientific methods with knowledge creation based on
millennia of First Nations ways of knowing, being and doing supports a decolonising approach that
facilitates epistemic equity and justice (Dudgeon & Gray, 2023). Working within this space also shifts
the sole responsibility for explaining and justifying the inclusion of First Nations perspectives from First
Nations peoples to shared positioning across the team.

Inclusion of First Nations knowledges

Our approach to creating an authentic Cultural Third Space was powerful for planning how to integrate
First Nations knowledges into the adapted OER. A "butcher's paper" approach of ideating, reflecting, and
reconfiguring different schemas helped us to transition from an additive approach to a holistic approach.

Limitations of the default "additive" approach

We initially set out to include First Nations knowledges through a cultural safety review of the book and
adding a new separate section or chapters to what existed. What we call the "additive" approach here is
a common method used by default where First Nations perspectives are added to fill a gap with minimal
changes to existing core content.

The leadership of our First Nations project member enabled us to recognise that simplistically adding
content in this way tends to generate problematic outcomes.

Solution - an integrated holistic approach

We consciously decided to not treat First Nations knowledges as separate to the OER's main content, so
we are developing a holistic approach that involves:

  · Distinguishing between Indigenisation (adding First Nations content as optionally relevant) and
      Decolonisation (integrating First Nations content as equally valid)

  · Interweaving First Nations knowledges within our explanations, examples, and objectives in every
      chapter

  · A paradigm shift in ways of thinking and working
  · Self-determined input from First Nations academic with shared responsibility and ownership of

      outcomes across the team

This integrative approach makes the final product everyone's responsibility and leads to more authentic
inclusivity. The paradigm shift in ways of thinking and working can provide a leading example of how to
integrate First Nations knowledges into the higher education curriculum more broadly. It is valuable as a
respectful approach that is culturally responsive and holistic rather than tokenistic.

Recognising process as an output

A theme that arose many times is the value of process, not solely as a means to an end, but as a powerful
way of transforming our fundamental ways of thinking and working. When expressed clearly and aligned
with certain purposes, these ways of working are outputs in their own right that can model effective
collaboration for others. This is especially useful in the open education movement, as projects driven by
open educational practices (OEP) naturally encourage open ways of working. By sharing these practices as
openly licensed artefacts (e.g. this case study), we can extend the "five Rs" of OER to cover not just content
but also practices for benefiting the whole OEP community.

We have developed and continue to refine strong collaborative processes in carving out spaces for generating
culturally responsive ways of working together that cultivate mutually beneficial two-way learning.
Through critical engagement with the process, our understanding of the project has changed in an organic
way, and the final product will be better as a result.

Non-linear "process as pedagogy"

A powerful aspect we want to highlight is the non-linear nature of how we arrived at where we are. We
often found ourselves diverging from "the meeting agenda" into conversations that would conventionally
be labelled "tangents". Normally this might seem like a waste of precious time. On the contrary, it turned
out to be the key to reaching our most important lessons and decisions like choosing a holistic way to
integrate First Nations knowledges into the OER.

If this involves significant mutual learning, a way to frame this might be "process as pedagogy".

Barriers and Enablers

Through critically reflexive practice we were able to identify barriers and enablers for transformative ways
of thinking and working to achieve our intended outcomes. These are represented in Figures 7 and 8.

Navigating open licensing

We encountered and resolved a series of complex open licensing challenges during our journey. Major OER
adaptation projects are relatively new to Australian learning & teaching practices. So here we outline these
barriers and how we resolved them as our contribution to suggesting norms around these practices.
305 | REIMAGINING OPEN TEXTBOOKS THROUGH A DECOLONISING LENS: NON-LINEAR PRACTICES FOR
HOLISTICALLY INTEGRATING FIRST NATIONS KNOWLEDGES INTO CURRICULUM

The first challenge we needed to resolve was the restrictive ND (No Derivatives) license that applied to the
original edition of the OER we set out to revise.

        https://oercollective.caul.edu.au/openedaustralasia/?p=1298#h5p-14

Secondly we needed to reflect on norms for transformative adaptations of open content and consider
how best to respect the integrity of the original authors' work while not limiting the changes we feel are
necessary.

A third challenge we encountered was navigating the importance of protecting the sovereignty and
integrity of First Nations intellectual property in open licensing contexts which allow for not only access
to information but also the freedom to reuse, potentially inappropriately.

Final Reflections

Reflecting on our involvement in the project, we've identified key principles that can guide open education
practitioners in fostering culturally responsive practices, especially in decolonising knowledge. These
principles emphasise the need for intentionality, incorporating diverse perspectives, collaborating with
First Nations peoples, and actively challenging existing power structures in education. By adopting these
approaches, practitioners can create a more equitable and culturally rich educational environment,
ensuring that open educational resources (OERs) not only share knowledge but also respect and reflect
diverse ways of knowing.
                    REIMAGINING OPEN TEXTBOOKS THROUGH A DECOLONISING LENS: NON-LINEAR PRACTICES FOR
                                      HOLISTICALLY INTEGRATING FIRST NATIONS KNOWLEDGES INTO CURRICULUM | 306

Our experience highlights key lessons that can be adapted by the Australasian OEP community:

OERs do not inherently promote social justice. While they have the potential to increase access to
knowledge and enable culturally responsive adaptations of content, achieving true equity depends on the
open practitioner's agency to support thoughtful planning, intentional effort, and advocate for funding
diverse expertise. Practitioners must go beyond merely creating or sharing resources; they need to address
imbalances in representation, accessibility, and cultural relevance to make a meaningful impact on systemic
inequalities.

Gently navigating complexity is critical when generating new knowledge or driving cultural
change. It's not just about working with different methods side by side but embracing the challenges
and nuances that arise in creating something new. This complexity demands flexibility, patience, and
openness to different perspectives, often leading to more innovative and transformative thinking. Practical
steps can support these approaches, such as proactively creating agenda time to accommodate non-linear
thinking and scheduling dedicated debrief workshops to mark project milestones. For example, we used
this reflective debrief template designed for open education projects, and this getting started guide can help
with early ideation.

Effective project planning involves more than just adhering to deadlines. It requires prioritising
relationship-building, fostering safe connections, and allowing space for tangents that lead to deeper
insights. Balancing timelines with an organic, flexible process is essential for genuine collaboration. Regular
meetings and clear communication ensured the team stayed aligned, allowing us to adapt goals and evolve
as the project progressed.

Lastly, while non-Indigenous individuals can engage in meaningful work independently,
authentic decolonisation and true progress occurs when the work is done in collaboration and
shared leadership with First Nations partners. Working together, with co-leadership, fosters respect,
shared knowledge, and a culturally informed process. This collaborative approach enhances the quality
of the work and has the potential to drive sustainable, transformative change at both the individual and
institutional levels, benefiting educational communities as a whole.

Conclusion

We set out to achieve a standard, strict-to-timeline, efficient output of an updated undergraduate open
textbook. Our cultural safety review of the 1st edition acted as a catalyst to create a whole new range of
practices and artefacts. We needed to re-examine what we were trying to achieve and critically reflect on
how to produce something that is truly culturally responsive, inclusive, engaging and accessible. We didn't
take the easy route or step back from challenging conversations.

Both the text and our processes engage with First Nations ways of knowing, being and doing and are a
step towards normalising holistic and integrated approaches to incorporating First Nations knowledges
307 | REIMAGINING OPEN TEXTBOOKS THROUGH A DECOLONISING LENS: NON-LINEAR PRACTICES FOR
HOLISTICALLY INTEGRATING FIRST NATIONS KNOWLEDGES INTO CURRICULUM

in education resources. Our case study demonstrates how respectful, reciprocal collaborative partnerships
between First Nations and non-Indigenous team members can provide a decolonising lens to challenge
entrenched conventional ways of working and reimagine OERs as culturally safe resources designed for
universal accessibility.
In creating and working within an authentic Cultural Third Space we have identified future directions
for expanding culturally responsive practices in the growing Australian OER movement and invite open
practitioners to use the story of our journey as a catalyst for wider change.

   In practice

     By adopting these approaches, practitioners can create a more equitable and culturally rich
     educational environment, ensuring that open educational resources (OERs) not only share
     knowledge but also respect and reflect diverse ways of knowing.
     The following key lessons can be adapted by the Australasian OEP community:

          · OERs do not inherently promote social justice
          · Gently navigating complexity is critical when generating new knowledge or driving

             cultural change
          · Effective project planning involves more than just adhering to deadlines
          · While non-Indigenous individuals can engage in meaningful work independently,

             authentic decolonisation and true progress occurs when the work is done in collaboration
             and shared leadership with First Nations partners. Working together, with co-leadership,
             fosters respect, shared knowledge, and a culturally informed process.

BUILDING A COMMUNITY OF OPEN
PRACTITIONERS

   University of Southern Queensland

   Dr Adrian Stagg

Overview

The use of competitive institutional and external grants to support both educational transformation,
and the scholarship of teaching and learning (SOTL) is a mainstay of the university sector. The use of
funding, and research frameworks provide both time and conceptual spaces for deeper exploration, and the
renewal of curriculum practices to better align with not only the needs of learners, and emerging discipline
narratives and assessment, but the institution's mission, and wider society.
Superficially, grants are uncritically accepted within the university sector as vehicles for change, yet
outcomes are often isolated, and disconnected beyond the immediate context. Furthermore, the challenge
is to sustain and strategically integrate change, rather than rely on successful outcomes `through the heroic
efforts of a dedicated team, rather than repeating proven methods of an organization with a mature... process'
(Paulk et al., 1993, p. 18).
Open educational practices (OEP) are positioned at the University of Southern Queensland (UniSQ)
as a form of practice- and values-led change, requiring a community approach that privileges personal,
professional, and conceptual connections throughout the institution and to a wider community of external
practitioners and advocates. This chapter describes the theoretical underpinnings of an OEP grant
program, that is translated into practice, and thence to transferable, reproducible practices for
organisations seeking similar outcomes.

   Using this case study

     This case study is useful for organisations seeking to implement an open educational practice
     (OEP) grant program that:
                                                                               BUILDING A COMMUNITY OF OPEN PRACTITIONERS | 314

          · Builds effective community ownership of change
          · Contributes to successful academic promotion applications
          · Saves students thousands of dollars in textbook costs

Key stakeholders

Ultimately, successfully translating institutional strengths, isolated good practice, and strategic directions
into actual educational change at the course level is contingent on engaging with, and securing
commitment from, those affected by the intended change. Whilst UniSQ could identify pockets of existing
OEP and individual champions, no systemic adoption of open education had occurred beyond the UniSQ
College (a section of the institution dedicated to non-traditional pathways into degree study). The internal
OEP Grants, deliberately designed to engage staff in owning educational change, were offered, and refined
across several iterations between 2016-2022. Communications with Faculty L&T leaders, librarians,
learning designers, and media producers were backed by information sessions, and grant writing workshops
that raised awareness of OEP, supported prospective applicants to shape their ideas and align with OEP
principles and processes, and connect them with potential ongoing partners across the institution.

Background

Whilst the initial grant offering was positioned as a trial, the intent was - budget willing - to refine the
offering over subsequent years to ensure the longevity of OEP, and recruit additional faculty staff based
on the communication of successful outcomes by their peers. The program required a robust, empirical
foundation serving the dual basis for staff engagement, and potential for research dissemination.

Conceptually, Fullan and Stieglebauer's theory of educational change (1991), was paired with Wenger's
Communities of Practice (2010) to guide the program design. The theory of educational change comprised
four environmental triggers, namely (i) staff need to actively participate in change seeking behavior usually
starting in small groups and building in scope, (ii) that pressure exists to change and that support exists to
facilitate and navigate change, (iii) that successful change requires attitudinal and behavioral change, and
(iv) that participants take ownership of the process as their confidence increases.

The core aspects of Communities of Practice defined the space as one focused on a specific `domain'
of knowledge, that learning is contextual and collaborative, and driven by participants who designate
the community as a `safe space' for discussion, experimentation, success, and failure. Furthermore, the
centrality of member agency and autonomy was supported by placing the program coordinator (the
Manager, OEP) as a facilitator who responded to community needs, often as an intermediary between the
315 | BUILDING A COMMUNITY OF OPEN PRACTITIONERS

community and the wider university or open education community - enacting a form of servant leadership
(Greenleaf, 1998).

Project description

Operationalising the conceptual framework required steady, authentic reinforcement within the
community to co-create behavioural and social norms. Communities require time to grow organically, and
within the constraints of comfort and engagement of the membership. The grants initially covered twelve
months and were later extended to eighteen months based on participant feedback. The longer period also
provided more space for community building, and establishing a trust-based environment.

In practice, successful applicants were invited to an orientation session, where the grant principles and
processes were reiterated. Each applicant (or team of applicants) was asked to bring a precis of their project
and outcomes to share with the community, and to field questions. The orientation concluded with the
grant awardees collaboratively setting a time for their monthly community gathering (the term `gathering'
rather than `meeting' was always used to distance the expectations for action away from any administrative
function, and toward a term that evoked fellowship and sharing). Their `homework' from this session was
to consider a set question and return in a month with answers for discussion. The initial question was
always `if you could ask this community to make you three promises, what would they be?'.

Commonality of responses was discovered across the years of offer, namely asking the community to
promise (i) to be present at the gatherings and engage to the best of their ability, (ii) that the community
space be `judgment-free' and seek to build practice and support members, (iii) that the community space
be a place for the free but respectful exchange of ideas and opinions, and that said discussion remain
confidential within the community, and (iv) that anyone can ask for help, and that community members
would endeavor to share generously. The `promises' were collated, and became a `community charter' and
shared with all members as an internal document. Some examples of the promises included asking everyone
in the community to be actively present during community time, to be professional and kind when offering
feedback or suggestions for improvement, and to respect that members may arrive with differing levels of
energy to offer. In future sessions, activities were explicitly linked back to the charter whenever possible, to
ensure it was a part of the lived community, rather than a single `ice-breaker-style' question. Additionally,
the first fifteen minutes (not timed, but rather gauged by the group) were for `fellowship' (Wenger, 2010).
This was an opportunity for community members to enter the space, enjoy refreshment, mingle, and ease
into the community mindset. Fellowship time became a successful liminal or transitional space between
day-to-day tasks, and the community activities.

Each gathering began with the question `what is one grant-related activity you would like to celebrate?',
serving the dual purpose of peer validation for success (no matter how small), and a progress report. As
the members became more comfortable within the grant lifecycle (usually about three to four months into
the program), they would also use this as an opportunity to ask for feedback on next steps, or to ask for
                                                                               BUILDING A COMMUNITY OF OPEN PRACTITIONERS | 316

support. Members would often meet outside of the community gatherings to pursue outcomes, or share
expertise.

Facets of the knowledge domain were identified by the community, and guest speakers from across the
university (and sometime the sector) were invited to the space (actioned by the grant coordinator as
facilitator for the community). New domain knowledge (such as Creative Commons licencing, or open
assessment) would always be followed by reflective time to consider how this knowledge fit within
disciplinary norms, personal teaching philosophies, and the reality of learning and teaching in the
university. By explicitly providing time to integrate new knowledge with existing practices, members could
glean individual value, and engage in focused discussion that could lead to changed practice. Often, new
topics for exploration would emerge, and the cycle would begin anew at next month's gathering.

As the gathering concluded, awardees would commit to outcomes for the following month, against which
they would report. The format for every gathering can be summarised as:

 1. Fellowship time - building community, providing transitional/liminal space.
 2. What do you have to celebrate? - peer validation and accountability, opportunity to seek assistance
 3. What will we learn today? - expanding and contextualising the knowledge domain, identifying

      future avenues for building knowledge
 4. What will you do in the following month? - goal setting, enacting new knowledge

Key outcomes

Interviews were conducted by a third-party research assistant after the first six months, twelve months,
and then at the program conclusion (eighteen months). Overwhelmingly, awardees spoke positively of the
experience, describing the community as critical to their learning, sense of belonging, and a key contributor
to their individual success. Most interviewees specifically mentioned the monthly meeting frequency as
integral to generating and refining ideas into practice, as well as a strong motivator for progress and
accountability. In every case, interviewees stated the ongoing community aspect as absolutely essential for
future offerings of the program. Interviewee statements included:

On contextualising learning as lived practice:

         And so I go out there like, you know, like Little Red Riding Hood in the woods,
         with all my ideas in the basket and then suddenly come across the big bad wolf.
         What happened was, I had to really struggle to understand what creative commons
         licensing meant in practice. And I'm not very good with abstract figures and
         concepts unless they're embedded in a real experience that makes sense to me.

On collaboration:

         There are other people there to help you see and just knowing that is really
317 | BUILDING A COMMUNITY OF OPEN PRACTITIONERS

         important. So that's another thing that it has changed for me with the openness, is
         knowing how many people are involved and sorts of things that they can help with,
         here at the uni particularly. But beyond the uni as well, you know through USQ's
         involvement with other organizations around openness, that all helps. I kind of feel
         like, if I wanted to do other stuff, I have more knowledge about who to go and ask.

On sharing project updates

         I think working with a team has been really good. Listening to other people, when
         we go to meetings...there are other people doing their own projects and the way
         they were doing them was a real eye-opener. It was something that gave me ideas,
         things to aspire to.

From a purely quantitative perspective, grant program outcomes included:

  · Engaging fifty-seven staff across sixteen subject areas
  · Providing benefit to 9,665 students with a total student savings of AUD352,615.00
  · Generating a further AUD43,500 in subsequent external grants
  · Producing fifty-four published outcomes including journal articles, book chapters, conference

      papers and presentations, internal invited L&T presentations, and invited speaker opportunities
      from other universities, and
  · Anecdotal evidence showed the outcomes from the grant program contributed to successful
      academic promotion applications.

   In practice

     The UniSQ OEP Grants Program is a transferable, repeatable program that supports education
     change, and successful completion and integration of open educational practices by individuals
     and teams across the institution. The rationale - change-focused bounded communities of
     practice - and format have been discussed in this chapter, and further investigation of the
     references in this chapter provides conceptual guidance.
     The final recommendation concerns community as a place to `lift up' practice and seek
     opportunities to disseminate outcomes both institutional and within the sector. Grant awardees
     were provided ample opportunity to highlight, celebrate, and disseminate their work by:
                                                                               BUILDING A COMMUNITY OF OPEN PRACTITIONERS | 318

          · Including grant awardees in Open Access Week webinars
          · Guiding grant awardees toward open education conferences and events
          · Connecting with other communities (such as the ASCILITE OEP Special Interest Group).
     This chapter shows that community ownership of change is effective, but effective community
     building stems from being deliberate and purposeful.

Overview

The Digital Skills GitBook project was initiated in 2021 by the Council of Australian University Librarians
(CAUL) in collaboration with Australia's Academic Research Network (AARNet). Supported by
CAUL's Digital Dexterity Program, the project brought together a diverse, virtual team of librarians from
across Australia and New Zealand as part of the Digital Dexterity Champions Community of Practice
(DigiDex CoP).

This initiative was developed in response to a growing need across the academic and research community
for accessible, practical guidance on foundational digital skills--skills that are essential for modern research
and teaching but are often assumed or unsupported in formal training.

The goal was for a working group of university library professionals to develop a community-driven book
on digital skills and information literacies for the broader academic community. The process of creating the
book was used as professional development for the group as they developed skills such as using Git, GitHub
and GitBook, editing with Markdown, creating an open source, crowd-sourced educational resource, and
a shared space for peer learning and community engagement.

The team successfully created a platform for collaboration, learning, sharing and empowerment amongst
academic librarians and research support staff. The project also encountered several barriers and challenges,
some within the team's influence and some beyond their control, that impacted on its development and
ongoing sustainability. However, it was a highly valuable experience, marked by unanticipated, yet positive
outcomes and meaningful connections.

This chapter presents a case study on the development, growth, challenges and key learnings from the
project. It provides commentary on why some community-led projects grow, expand and gain a large
community following. It also questions why some projects, like this one, struggle to truly fulfil their

potential. Throughout the chapter are quotes from members of the team and their thoughts on the project
and the process.

   Using this case study

     After reading this chapter, audiences should gain a better understanding of:
          · The key stages involved in the development, growth, and ongoing sustainability of a
             community-driven OER project.
          · Barriers and common challenges that can prevent these projects from reaching their full
             potential and factors that can lead to stagnation or decline.
          · Strategies for strengthening community-led OER projects.

Background

Inspired by global, open science and research skills communities such as The Carpentries and The Turing
Way (2022), the project aimed to create a living, open-source online guide to `not-quite-technical' digital
skills such as file naming, Git and GitHub basics, README files, and screen casting. Built using the
GitBook platform with GitHub for collaborative contributions, the guide was designed to evolve with its
community of users and contributors and was targeted at librarians and academic library communities.
There were two goals: a project for professional development for academic librarians and the creation of a
resource for the library community.

Project description

In 2021, after some experimentation and an initial introductory Git and GitHub workshop via the
Australian Research Data Commons (ARDC), the group created the structure of the book in GitHub,
wrote a Code of Conduct, a copyright statement, instructions on how to use GitHub, and guidelines on
how to make chapter contributions.
The chapter outline was assembled based on the skills and capabilities identified in the CAUL Digital
Dexterity Framework (CAUL, 2019). The team wrote some suggested articles, and a process for topic
suggestions by contributors. Pages were created and suggestions of difficulty levels were provided.

SKILLS GITBOOK PROJECT

Subsequently, training and skills development were largely self-led using open or free online guides,
including the extensive guidance provided by GitHub (Github, n.d.) and The Markdown Guide (n.d.).

Team members promoted the project to library communities through CAUL's DigiDex CoP, advertised
to library groups, presented at various conferences, held GitHub training and hosted collaborative writing
sessions to garner interest and gain both new project team members and contributors. Growth was slow
but steady through 2021-2022 and the team acquired a peak of 18 total contributors.

Table 1 above shows the active number of people who contributed to the book, and contributions through
additions and deletions by GitHub `lines of code written' for each half year period ending July 2024 after
the VALA presentation.

As the project progressed through to 2023, most team members had either changed jobs, had less time to
dedicate to the project or moved on. People with key skills had left the team, resulting in gaps in the book
development workflow. The number of article submissions stagnated in 2022, and there was a steady drop
in members from 12 in 2023 to just 6 in 2024.

Membership

Table 2 above shows the members of the GitBook team over time.

In 2024, the remaining project team members began a period of critical reflection by revisiting the original
project goals and seeking feedback from stakeholders in the library community. Constructive feedback
received from attendees at a poster presentation session (Khoo, 2024) revealed a higher amount of interest
in the use of GitHub rather than the broader range of digital skills and literacies within the scope of the
          CREATING A COLLABORATIVE OPEN SOURCE, CROWD-SOURCED EDUCATIONAL RESOURCE: THE DIGITAL
                                                                                                                   SKILLS GITBOOK PROJECT | 324

project. The audience agreed that the purpose and viability of the book needed to be reconsidered, and this
ultimately led to the decision to discontinue the book in its current form.

Key outcomes

Over the course of the project, 21 topics from 18 contributors were added to the book on topics ranging
from installing and accessing browsers to pedagogy and andragogy in an online environment. All these
contributors navigated new skills such as forking a GitHub repository, creating and editing a markdown
file and committing changes to a master branch to add their topics.

             project (2021-2024), used under CC BY [Go to image description]

The project shifted focus a year or two after implementation as a result of community engagement. As the
feedback from the poster presentation indicated, there was more interest in the process than the product.
Based on this outcome, the team implemented a new approach of attending conferences and tech camps
to provide introductory GitHub workshops, using the book as a teaching tool rather than promoting the
book as a resource and seeking contributors.
The project provided many opportunities for professional development and several contributions to the
community. These were often the first chance for the team members to deliver conference presentations,
facilitate workshops and create OER content.
However, by far the greatest outcome of the project was the development of an international cross-
institutional network of librarians who collaborated on the project. Through peer learning,
experimentation, and regular collaboration, the team not only developed a shared resource but also built a
new professional learning community. Member comments included:
325 | CREATING A COLLABORATIVE OPEN SOURCE, CROWD-SOURCED EDUCATIONAL RESOURCE: THE DIGITAL
SKILLS GITBOOK PROJECT

              "I've really appreciated the collegiality of the group. I've loved working with everyone from across
              Australia and New Zealand and it is so clear that libraries are full of amazing people!"

                                                                - Bryony Hawthorn, Librarian

              "This project is a wonderful example of problem-based, experiential learning in action,
              demonstrating the way in which learning occurs through the act of creating something tangible.
              The ingredients for creativity are all in the mix, including a safe, supportive environment for
              experimentation and a diversity of skills/capabilities. Being part of the group is like having a window
              into a `living lab' of creative process - it is a truly collaborative space."

                                                               - Dr Karen Miller, Librarian

Ultimately, several factors impacted the ongoing sustainability and momentum of the book. These include
dwindling project team membership and the dissolution of the overarching CAUL DigiDex CoP. As a
result, the project is ending in its current form.

However, the book will remain open as a workspace for the foreseeable future. It will provide a no-pressure
environment for community members to copy the GitBook, experiment with GitHub functions, and see
how GitBook/GitHub can be used with real content, and for future OER projects to adapt and build on
the documentation and learnings.

Learnings and recommendations

The following recommendations are a result of the team's learning and experiences throughout the
GitBook project. They are provided for the benefit of other teams embarking on the creation of their own
community-led OER projects in order to help them navigate potential challenges and ensure their project
can meet its full potential.

Be prepared to pivot

The COVID-19 pandemic and its aftermath saw a significant impact on libraries and higher education,
with restructures and redundancies resulting in greater workloads and reduced capacity for members of
the project team. While participation declined, the DigiDex CoP was concurrently undergoing a period
of strategic review, which ultimately led to its dissolution and left the GitBook without the institutional
support or governance framework necessary to sustain the collaborative effort.

Post-pandemic workplace changes may explain much of the drop in contributions. The closure of the
DigiDex CoP may also reflect broader issues around capacity and commitment to digital skills training.
These challenges were further influenced by the pervasive emergence of Generative AI, raising new
questions around how digital literacy would take shape amidst this transformational technological change.
          CREATING A COLLABORATIVE OPEN SOURCE, CROWD-SOURCED EDUCATIONAL RESOURCE: THE DIGITAL
                                                                                                                   SKILLS GITBOOK PROJECT | 326

Start with a `minimum viable product'

The CAUL Digital Dexterity Framework was a useful reference for the GitBook's initial chapters and
topics, however, on reflection it may have been too expansive, allowing for a proliferation of subtopics
depending on contributors' interests or interpretations. Additionally, the chapter difficulty levels may have
deterred contributors by requiring more content uncertainty around what each level should include.

Consequently, initially constraining the scope of similar OER projects with a `minimum viable product'
(Jansen, 2024) can provide a firm foundation and prevent confusion and disengagement. When
experiencing declining involvement as occurred with the GitBook in 2022-2023, the scope of chapters and
topics could have been further reduced and reorganised to make it more appealing and less overwhelming
for potential contributors.

Define and maintain core roles - but allow for flexibility

A stable core team and a rigorous governance structure are critical for sustaining engagement in open-
source projects (Crowston & Shamshurin, 2017; Ehls, 2017). This project retained the same lead, but core
team membership declined due to competing workplace demands. Defining key roles and filling them as
vacancies arise is advisable.

Clear roles are important, given that open-source projects are often undertaken externally to regular
work duties. Transparent leadership, experienced and accountable team members, and pre-established
governance structures ensure continuity and provide essential support to current and potential
contributors.

Establish a reliable, effective communication channel for
everyone

It is well worth carrying out an audit of project management and/or communication tools to establish a
reliable, accessible and effective approach for everyone. According to Jansen (2024), this is a crucial step for
meaningful interaction and feedback when it comes to open-source projects.

The team experimented with Slack however it was not a tool that most members in the group used and was
not suitable for file sharing. The group eventually used a Teams site dedicated to the DigiDex CoP, hosted
by Deakin University. Unfortunately, this was not workable for all team members due to some institutional
IT barriers.

Create a safe space for learning

This project provided a space for people to talk about not understanding or not having the experience
327 | CREATING A COLLABORATIVE OPEN SOURCE, CROWD-SOURCED EDUCATIONAL RESOURCE: THE DIGITAL
SKILLS GITBOOK PROJECT

on the platforms that was required in developing this book. It allowed for members to ask questions and
fostered a mutually supportive, non-judgmental environment to develop new skills.
Feeling psychologically safe to participate enhances learning and knowledge creation (Lim & Choy, 2023).
Knowing this was a safe space meant it was a great space for learning through experimentation, making
mistakes and asking for help. Project member comments included:

              "That "aha" moment when I decided I could no longer pretend that I knew what everyone was
              talking about and I needed a refresher and felt safe to admit this to the group."

                      - Nica Tsakmakis, Senior Librarian
              "I have noticed that the group helps me to feel brave enough to try something - and I have such a
              great sense of achievement afterwards!"

                      - Emma Chapman, Librarian

   In practice

          · Do you have structural and/or financial support and a contingency plan if that support is
             removed?

          · Can you define a `minimum viable product' so you can create a manageable project plan
             and achievable milestones to be able to review your project early on?

          · Do you have a clear set of roles that need to be filled throughout the project's lifetime, in
             case project members leave the team?

          · What communication channels are you using with your group? Do they work well for
             everyone? Is it seamless for new members to join your project?

          · What makes your team and project special? What techniques are you adopting to create
             a safe environment for learning and creativity for your group?

Conclusion

Looking back at the original project goals, the team did successfully create a great professional development
environment for librarians. It did not manage to create the kind of comprehensive resource that the
community would co-create and use.
Nonetheless, this project proved to be a highly valuable professional development experience, providing

                                                                                                                   SKILLS GITBOOK PROJECT | 328

substantial learning opportunities, insights and outcomes. Let this story not be one of deterrence but an
encouragement for others to take on unorthodox projects and see what skills you learn along the way.

The authors fully endorse and encourage others to either continue this project or implement a similar
project, with the hope that these recommendations will contribute to the success of future iterations.

In conclusion, engage fully with the process; the experiential learning gained through active participation
is of greater significance than a preoccupation with procedural details or an end product.

Further reading and resources

A proliferation of books, guides and case studies has been published since the 2020 rush to move to wholly
online communities and projects. These are some that we are aware of; however, it is worth regularly
checking the literature as these communities and resources mature.

Overview

This case study documents the implementation of a Centaur approach to developing Open Education
Resources (OER) at James Cook University (JCU), where artificial intelligence (AI) assistance was
integrated into academic textbook authoring whilst maintaining rigorous human oversight and quality
control.

JCU's transition from semester to trimester delivery created an urgent need for new learning materials
supporting mandatory internship components in postgraduate science degrees. Traditional textbook
development timelines were incompatible with the compressed implementation schedule. Existing career
development resources inadequately addressed the specific challenges faced by international students
navigating Australian workplace cultures and professional expectations.

The Centaur approach enabled completion of The STEM Advantage: Career Planning and Internship
Strategies (Archer, 2025) within five months (October 2024-February 2025). The systematic workflow
incorporated AI-assisted content generation, colour-coded review processes, iterative revision cycles, and
multi-phase quality assurance protocols. The textbook achieved over 700 views within six weeks of
publication and was adopted across five subjects in five different degree programmes. Enhanced
accessibility features, including Google Translate integration for Mandarin and Hindi, addressed the
international student demographic.

The Centaur approach delivered productivity improvements of approximately 40-60% while maintaining
comprehensive human oversight. Success depended on substantial upfront investment in AI training,
robust quality control frameworks, and recognition that AI enhances rather than replaces human expertise.
The approach proved particularly effective for addressing urgent institutional needs while creating

   Using this case study

     This case study is aimed at academics looking to utilise AI to assist with the development of
     their own OER. After reading this case study, readers should be able to:

          · Design and implement a systematic AI-assisted authoring workflow by adapting the
             colour-coded review system and multi-phase quality assurance protocols to their own
             disciplinary context, enabling them to accelerate OER development whilst maintaining
             academic rigour and institutional standards.

          · Establish effective AI training protocols and session management strategies by creating
             dedicated AI projects with comprehensive instructions, managing platform usage
             limitations, and developing sustainable feedback mechanisms that maximise productivity
             gains while ensuring content quality and consistency.

          · Develop institutional capacity for AI-assisted OER creation by identifying prerequisite
             competencies, securing appropriate time allocations and technical resources, and building
             quality control frameworks that address the specific risks and opportunities associated
             with AI-generated academic content in their educational context.

Background

The development of The STEM Advantage: Career Planning and Internship Strategies for Science,
Technology, Engineering and Mathematics Postgraduate Students emerged from a critical need to support
international postgraduate science students at JCU undertaking internships within their degrees. This
textbook project, initiated in 2024, addressed significant gaps in career development support for a
predominantly international student cohort pursuing Masters degrees within the College of Science and
Engineering.

The student demographic presented unique challenges: the majority were international students with
limited or no Australian workplace experience within their respective industries, and most were English
as Second or Other Language (ESOL) speakers. These factors created substantial barriers to successful
internship engagement and career development, particularly given research indicating that students often
struggle with career capability development and self-efficacy in professional contexts (Fish et al., 2025).

Recent scholarship highlights the complexity of internship motivation and outcomes. Popov (2025)
demonstrates that while internships serve as occupational tasters enabling students to crystallise vocational
337 | HALF-HUMAN, HALF-AI, FULL STEM ADVANTAGE: A CENTAUR APPROACH TO OPEN TEXTBOOK
DEVELOPMENT

goals, they can also delay workforce entry when students lack clear career direction. This phenomenon
was particularly relevant for JCU's international postgraduate cohort, who faced additional challenges
navigating Australian workplace cultures and professional expectations.

Furthermore, Fish et al. (2025) identify that student disengagement with employability development
represents a persistent challenge across higher education, with career services often accessed too late in
students' academic journey. At JCU, organisational restructures had resulted in significant waitlists for
career service appointments, meaning that postgraduates were engaging with career support services at the
point of near-graduation when intervention opportunities were severely limited.

The textbook creation coincided with the comprehensive redevelopment of learning materials within
LearnJCU, the university's learning management system (LMS). This synchronicity provided an
opportunity to integrate AI-assisted authoring processes whilst developing culturally responsive,
academically rigorous OER that could address the identified gaps in internship preparation and career
development support for this specific student population.

Project description

The context

JCU was transitioning from semester to trimester delivery, which created both opportunity and urgency
for updating learning materials across postgraduate science programs. This institutional change provided
dedicated time for comprehensive content redevelopment.

Choosing an AI approach

To speed up this intensive content creation process, I decided to integrate AI assistance into the writing
workflow. I selected Claude as the primary AI tool based on recommendations from colleagues who had
successfully used similar approaches, notably Inger Mewburn and Narelle Lemon's book Rich Academic,
Poor Academic (Mewburn, 2024).

The "Centaur" method

The methodology adopted what Ethan Mollick (2024) calls a "centaur approach"--using AI to enhance
existing human capabilities rather than replace them. This collaborative framework positioned AI as a
writing enhancement tool rather than an autonomous content generator. This ensured that human
expertise influenced each sentence in the book, meeting academic integrity and quality guidelines.
                         HALF-HUMAN, HALF-AI, FULL STEM ADVANTAGE: A CENTAUR APPROACH TO OPEN TEXTBOOK
                                                                                                                                   DEVELOPMENT | 338

Tool-to-principle reference

To ensure this approach works with evolving technologies, Table 1 maps the specific tools used to their
underlying principles, enabling readers to adapt the workflow to their available platforms:

Current Tool Core Principle                         Alternative Examples

Claude     Human-in-the-loop content generation     ChatGPT, Gemini, future AI platforms
Grammarly  Multi-phase automated quality assurance  ProWritingAid, institutional editing tools
LearnJCU   LMS-aligned content structure            Moodle, Canvas, Blackboard formats

How the workflow worked

Step 1: Setting up the AI workspace
I developed a dedicated AI project workspace with detailed instructions that mirrored my institutional
LMS requirements.

Step 2: Content input and generation
The workflow followed a systematic pattern:

  · Research materials were fed into the AI platform
  · Basic story frameworks illustrated key concepts
  · Clear learning outcomes were defined for each chapter
  · The AI system generated initial content drafts using human-in-the-loop methodology
  · Drafts were transferred to standard word processing software for human revision

The colour-coded quality control system

Why I needed visual tracking
A critical feature was implementing a colour-coded review system in word processing software to ensure
human oversight of AI content. This approach was based on Dell'Acqua et al.'s (2023) research showing
that workers using AI without verification achieved only 60-70% accuracy, while those who critically
reviewed AI outputs gained up to 43% productivity while maintaining accuracy.

How the colour system worked
The system used three different colour highlights:

  · Yellow highlights: AI-generated content needing review and potential rewriting
  · Red highlights: Human-authored sections requiring substantial revision
339 | HALF-HUMAN, HALF-AI, FULL STEM ADVANTAGE: A CENTAUR APPROACH TO OPEN TEXTBOOK
DEVELOPMENT

  · Green highlights: Content needing grammar checking using automated tools
  · No highlighting: Completed, publication-ready material
Figure 1 shows this visual tracking system in practice, demonstrating how AI content was systematically
processed through different review stages.

              Figure 1: "Colour-coded quality control system", by Ben Archer, licensed under CC
              BY-NC-SA 4.0 [Go to image description]

Key takeaway: The colour-coded approach ensured comprehensive quality control while clearly
separating AI-generated from human-authored content throughout the revision process.

Managing platform limits

Even with premium AI platform subscriptions, usage limitations created workflow constraints. Most
conversational AI platforms restrict interaction volume within specific timeframes, creating boundaries
around productivity.
                         HALF-HUMAN, HALF-AI, FULL STEM ADVANTAGE: A CENTAUR APPROACH TO OPEN TEXTBOOK
                                                                                                                                  DEVELOPMENT | 340

The quality vs. quantity challenge

This limitation was particularly problematic when using Mollick's approach of "bringing AI to the table"
(2024, p. 47) through detailed feedback. The process involved:

  · Communicating preferences about AI outputs
  · Identifying what worked well and what needed improvement
  · Providing enhanced guidance for subsequent iterations

Planning the sessions

This feedback approach significantly improved content quality. AI systems can adapt to specific writing
preferences, institutional requirements, and teaching approaches. However, detailed feedback used
substantial platform capacity, creating a trade-off between quality improvement and content volume.

The workflow required careful session management and strategic planning to balance quality benefits with
quantity requirements. Platform limitations meant spreading the writing process across multiple sessions
and days, disrupting creative flow and requiring time to re-establish context.

Why human error still happened

Despite rigorous review processes and two comprehensive proofreading rounds, human error remained an
ongoing problem. AI platform disclaimers about potential errors were sometimes overlooked, and mistakes
weren't identified until the institutional publishing team conducted their review.

The reality of human-AI collaboration

These oversights show a critical limitation: while human-AI collaboration enhances productivity and
quality compared to unverified AI use, it remains fallible and dependent on human vigilance.

This aligns with Dell'Acqua et al.'s (2023) findings, where no participant achieved 100% accuracy,
regardless of verification processes. Errors persisted despite systematic review protocols, showing that
human-AI collaboration is valuable but not perfect.

Multiple safety nets required

Figure 2 illustrates the systematic approach, showing how multiple verification stages create overlapping
safety nets throughout the development process. The workflow incorporated multiple verification
stages--from initial visual tracking through peer review and institutional proofreading--yet human errors
still occurred until the final publishing review.

              licensed under CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 [Go to image description]

Bottom line: Multiple quality checks remain essential for acceptable accuracy, even with well-structured
human-AI collaboration.

Copyright and intellectual property considerations

Using AI to create educational content raises important questions about who owns the work and how it
fits with open education principles. This project addressed these considerations in several ways:
                         HALF-HUMAN, HALF-AI, FULL STEM ADVANTAGE: A CENTAUR APPROACH TO OPEN TEXTBOOK
                                                                                                                                   DEVELOPMENT | 342

Who owns AI-generated content?

Under Claude's current terms of service, users keep rights to their inputs and any outputs generated, as
long as the content doesn't violate usage policies. However, institutions should check their specific AI
platform agreements since terms vary across providers and may change over time.

Maintaining human authorship

This project kept clear records of the collaborative process, with substantial human input in planning,
reviewing, and revising all content. The Centaur approach ensures significant human intellectual
contribution throughout, supporting traditional academic authorship principles.

Open content licensing

All materials developed through this AI-assisted process were published under a Creative Commons
Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International license, aligning with institutional commitments to OER.
The collaborative methodology supports rather than undermines open content principles by making
content creation tools accessible to more educators.

Institutional policy alignment

JCU treated AI-generated content similarly to other research and writing tools, with the human author
maintaining responsibility for accuracy, appropriateness, and compliance with academic integrity
standards.

Key point: Clear documentation of the human-AI collaborative process supports traditional authorship
principles while embracing new technology capabilities.

Key outcomes

The implementation of the human-AI collaborative approach to textbook development yielded several
significant achievements that demonstrate both the efficiency and effectiveness of AI-assisted academic
authoring for OER.

Accelerated development timeline

The textbook was successfully completed within a five-month development period from October 2024 to
February 2025. This compressed timeline was made possible through the systematic workflow illustrated
in Figure 2, where AI assistance accelerated the initial content generation phase while maintaining quality
343 | HALF-HUMAN, HALF-AI, FULL STEM ADVANTAGE: A CENTAUR APPROACH TO OPEN TEXTBOOK
DEVELOPMENT

assurance processes. The timing perfectly aligned with academic calendar requirements, enabling
immediate deployment at the commencement of Trimester 2, 2025.

Timeline achievement: Five months from blank page to publication-ready content, compared to my
previous 13-month experience with traditional OER development.

Strong initial engagement

Within the first six weeks of publication, the textbook achieved over 700 views, indicating strong initial
engagement from the target audience of postgraduate science, technology, engineering, and mathematics
(STEM) students. This early adoption rate suggests that the collaborative approach successfully produced
content that resonated with student needs and academic expectations.

Institutional adoption

In the months following publication, two other institutions adopted sections of the book as course
materials in similar subjects, demonstrating the broader appeal and quality of the AI-assisted content.

Student feedback

Initial student feedback demonstrates strong engagement with the AI-assisted textbook. Student
evaluation surveys showed marked improvement in ratings for online learning materials quality, increasing
from an average of 3.76/5.00 in 2023-2024 to 5.00/5.00 in early 2025. However, this represents a limited
sample as the textbook was published in May 2025, meaning comprehensive cohort feedback remains
unavailable for this case study.

Cross-program integration and sustainability

The textbook's adoption across five subjects within five different degree programs demonstrates how AI-
assisted OER development can create sustainable, reusable educational resources that serve diverse learning
contexts--a core principle of open educational practice (OEP). This broad implementation validates
the effectiveness of the collaborative development process in creating adaptable, high-quality educational
resources.

Enhanced accessibility and inclusive design

Language support

To address the predominantly international student demographic, a Google Translate widget was
integrated into the platform, enabling automatic translation into Mandarin and Hindi. This accessibility
                         HALF-HUMAN, HALF-AI, FULL STEM ADVANTAGE: A CENTAUR APPROACH TO OPEN TEXTBOOK
                                                                                                                                   DEVELOPMENT | 344

feature acknowledges the linguistic diversity of the target audience while expanding the resource's potential
reach and utility for ESOL learners.

Culturally responsive content

The textbook examples and case studies were deliberately drawn from real student experiences during
professional placements, with particular attention to cross-cultural workplace navigation and challenges.
This approach ensures that content reflects the lived experiences of the diverse international cohort,
providing culturally relevant scenarios that resonate with students from various cultural backgrounds.

Multiple learning approaches

The multi-modal design--combining structured text, visual workflow diagrams, practical examples, and
step-by-step processes--accommodates different learning preferences and cognitive processing styles. The
clear heading structure and navigation support students who rely on assistive technologies or prefer
systematic information processing.

Socioeconomic accessibility

The open licensing and free access model removes financial barriers that might prevent students from
accessing quality learning materials, supporting equity principles central to open education. This approach
particularly benefits international students who may face additional financial pressures.

Areas for future development

This case study acknowledges that while linguistic and cultural diversity were addressed through
translation features and culturally relevant examples, broader inclusivity frameworks could be strengthened
in future iterations. This includes incorporating input from accessibility experts and diverse student voices
from the design phase, rather than retrofitting inclusive features.

Open access benefits

The AI-assisted development approach supports OEP principles by:

  · Democratizing content creation: Making sophisticated authoring tools accessible to individual
      educators

  · Accelerating resource sharing: Faster development enables broader distribution
  · Enhancing sustainability: Reduced development costs support long-term resource availability
345 | HALF-HUMAN, HALF-AI, FULL STEM ADVANTAGE: A CENTAUR APPROACH TO OPEN TEXTBOOK
DEVELOPMENT

Bottom line: The collaborative approach delivered a high-quality textbook in significantly less time while
maintaining academic standards and achieving strong student engagement across multiple programs.

Learnings and recommendations

Recommendation 1: Choose your platform wisely

Principle/Context: Strategic AI platform selection and institutional preparation are crucial for
successful OER development projects.

Application/Example: Evaluate AI tools based on conversation limits, academic writing capabilities, and
institutional compatibility before committing resources. This project used Claude based on colleague
recommendations, avoiding costly trial-and-error phases. JCU's semester-to-trimester transition provided
dedicated development time essential for thorough implementation without compromising existing
teaching responsibilities. This approach supports OEP equity principles by enabling individual educators
and smaller institutions to develop high-quality OER materials without requiring large content
development teams or substantial financial resources.

Recommendation 2: Designing quality control workflows

Principle/Context: Robust quality control workflows are essential to maintain academic integrity when
using AI-assisted authoring.

Application/Example: This project implemented a colour-coded review system in Word documents:

  · Yellow = AI content requiring review
  · Red = human sections needing revision
  · Green = content needing grammar check
  · Unhighlighted = finalised content

This visual system allowed multiple reviewers to track progress and safeguard against overlooked errors,
while recognising that human oversight remains fallible, as demonstrated by Dell'Acqua et al.'s (2023)
research showing no participants achieved perfect accuracy despite comprehensive verification processes.

Beyond accuracy, quality control processes should address potential algorithmic bias in AI-generated
content, ensuring diverse perspectives and inclusive representation throughout educational materials.

                                                                                                                                   DEVELOPMENT | 346

Recommendation 3: Managing platform constraints

Principle/Context: AI platform limitations require strategic session management to balance output
quality with production volume.

Application/Example: Even premium subscriptions impose conversation limits that can disrupt
workflows. This project addressed Claude's usage constraints by:

  · Distributing content generation across multiple sessions
  · Maintaining conversation logs for context continuity
  · Creating template instructions for quick redeployment
  · Scheduling writing sessions to align with 24-hour platform reset cycles

The balance between meaningful AI dialogue and usage capacity requires realistic timeline projections and
additional time budgeting for multi-session workflows.

Recommendation 4: Foundation building through AI training

Principle/Context: Effective AI collaboration requires substantial upfront investment in system training
and configuration before content generation begins.

Application/Example: This project allocated 20-30% of the timeline to AI training, including:

  · Configuring Claude Projects with institutional content standards
  · Providing sample academic writing and citation formats
  · Establishing tone expectations for postgraduate audiences
  · Creating multiple examples until output consistently aligned with requirements

This foundational investment reduced revision cycles and improved initial output quality, embodying
Mollick's (2024) emphasis on productive human-AI partnerships through explicit guidance.

Recommendation 5: Prerequisite competencies

Principle/Context: AI assistance amplifies existing human capabilities rather than compensating for
absent skills or expertise.

Application/Example: Successful implementation requires educators to possess:

  · Proficiency in academic writing conventions
  · Deep disciplinary knowledge
  · Experience in curriculum design and pedagogical approaches
347 | HALF-HUMAN, HALF-AI, FULL STEM ADVANTAGE: A CENTAUR APPROACH TO OPEN TEXTBOOK
DEVELOPMENT

Without these foundational competencies, educators cannot effectively evaluate AI outputs for accuracy,
appropriateness, or alignment with learning objectives, rendering quality control processes ineffective
regardless of workflow sophistication.

Recommendation 6: Establishing realistic expectations

Principle/Context: AI-assisted development accelerates timelines while still requiring comprehensive
human oversight and traditional quality assurance protocols.
Application/Example: Expect significant but not revolutionary productivity gains. This project achieved
a five-month development timeline compared to my previous OER experience of 13 months, suggesting
potential improvements of 40-60% under similar conditions. However, variables such as scope, subject
matter, and institutional support affect direct comparisons.
Regardless of timeline acceleration, comprehensive quality assurance remains essential:

  · Extensive human input throughout all development phases
  · Multiple revision cycles for every AI-generated section
  · Peer review and institutional proofreading processes
  · Traditional verification protocols to address emerging risks of AI-generated errors

Successful implementation also requires transparency about AI assistance, clear attribution practices, and
acknowledgment that human oversight remains essential for identifying bias or inappropriate content.

   In practice

    1. Institutional readiness and resources

     How does your current institutional context support or constrain AI-assisted OER
     development? Consider available time allocations, technical infrastructure, quality assurance
     protocols, and administrative support for innovative pedagogical approaches. What specific
     resources or policy changes would you need to implement a Centaur approach effectively?
                         HALF-HUMAN, HALF-AI, FULL STEM ADVANTAGE: A CENTAUR APPROACH TO OPEN TEXTBOOK
                                                                                                                                   DEVELOPMENT | 348

    2. Personal competency assessment

     Evaluate your existing capabilities in relation to the prerequisite skills identified in this chapter.
     Do you possess sufficient subject matter expertise, academic writing proficiency, and
     pedagogical knowledge to effectively guide and evaluate AI-generated content? Where might
     you need additional skill development before attempting AI-assisted authoring?

    3. Quality control framework design

     How would you adapt the colour-coded review system and multi-phase quality assurance
     approach to fit your specific disciplinary requirements and institutional standards? What
     additional verification steps might be necessary for your subject area, and who would
     constitute your peer review network for content validation?

    4. Student-centred implementation

     Considering your specific student demographic and learning context, how would you modify
     the workflow to address their particular needs? What accessibility features, cultural
     considerations, or pedagogical approaches would you incorporate to ensure the AI-assisted
     content serves your students effectively while maintaining academic rigour?

Authentic assessment

      An evaluation method that asks learners to apply their knowledge and skills in real-world or realistic
      contexts, rather than through traditional tests or exams. It emphasises practical, meaningful tasks that
      allow learners to demonstrate critical thinking and problem solving abilities.

Centaur approach

      A collaborative methodology that uses artificial intelligence to enhance existing human capabilities
      rather than replace them, ensuring human expertise and decision-making remain central throughout
      the process.

Colour-coded Review

      A visual quality assurance workflow that uses different highlight colors in word processing software
      to identify content requiring different types of review (e.g., AI-generated content, human revisions,
      grammar checks).

Conversational AI Platform

      Software systems that use natural language processing to engage in dialogue with users, generating
      responses and content based on prompts and feedback.

Cultural responsiveness

      Cultural responsiveness is a transformative approach that describes the knowledge, attitudes,
      behaviours and actions required to appropriately respond to diverse cultural preferences, aspirations,
      and needs. It is what is needed to transform systems; how individuals work to deliver and maintain
      culturally safe and effective practice. It must incorporate knowledge (knowing), self-knowledge and
      behaviour (being) and action (doing), which makes it innately transformative.

Cultural safety

      Cultural safety for First Nations peoples requires an analysis of power relations to create an
      environment where Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples report that:

      · their experiences are believed and validated
      · their cultures are centred and valued in policy development, research, evaluation
      and service design and delivery
      · they feel welcomed and respected in policy, research, evaluation and service
      environments
      · they see other Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people working in the policy,
      research, evaluation or service context
      · they do not experience any form of racism in policy, research, evaluation and service
      contexts or processes

      (Mohamed et al 2024)

Cultural Third Space

      A cultural interface where respectful co-leadership can create overlapping spaces to join up synergies
      between both First Nations and Western knowledges. This space is not about the dominance of one
      system over the other but about the coexistence and negotiation between them in a safe and inclusive
      space.

      Nakata (2002)

      Dudgeon and Fielder (2006)

Derivative

      A derivative work is one which has been adapted from an original work or remixed from many works.
      It may also be a derivative of a derivative work. The term "derivative" signals that this work is not the
