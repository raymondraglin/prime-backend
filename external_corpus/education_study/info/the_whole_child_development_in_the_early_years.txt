Lecture slides and transcripts - The Whole Child  173
Thank you for choosing: The Whole Child for your textbook needs! This book was written specifically for the
emerging child psychology student or early childhood educator in mind. The authors have taught both Child
Psychology and Child Growth and Development throughout their careers as community college professors.
They have also raised a total of six children, worked with children and schools internationally, and serve as
educational consultants in a variety of settings.

   Deirdre and Doris desired a textbook that was both comprehensive and concise. Students do not need a
lengthy volume to digest, but they do need a strong understanding of how a young child develops. Only with
this understanding can developmentally appropriate practice emerge in the classroom and in other places that
are loving and caring spaces for young children. We are so grateful for the many contributors to this textbook
that have also brought their knowledge and expertise in working with children and teaching at the collegiate
level. With the rising cost of textbooks, we are also committed to finding quality, accessible materials for our
students.

   This text gives an overview of development, beginning in the mother's womb through about the age of eight.
It starts with a look at perspectives of early childhood, including how children have been viewed historically
as well as cross-culturally. Following this chapter, there is a complete overview of the important theorists that
have helped to deepen and bring clarity to how children develop. These theories include psychodynamic,
behavioral, social cognitive theory, cognitive theory, humanistic, multiple intelligence, growth mindset, and
Bloom's taxonomy. Understanding the implications of each theory is important foundational knowledge for the
study of development.

   Chapters Three and Four give an overview of the domains of development, followed by an overview of the
developing brain. Chapter Five takes a look at the prenatal period, including the birth and postpartum process.
Chapter Six describes development in infancy, and Chapter Seven describes the toddler years, including safety
considerations that are critical for this period. Chapter Eight looks at the preschool years, including the role of
peers, play, and television (and other electronics) in development.

   Chapter Nine concludes the text with a brief look at the start of what is known as the school-age years,
universally recognized as between the ages of five and eight.

       "If I had my child to raise over again:
       I'd build self-esteem first and the house later
       I'd finger paint more and point the finger less
       I would do less correcting and more connecting
       I'd take my eyes off my watch and watch with my eyes
       I would care to know less and know to care more
       I'd take more hikes and fly more kites
       I'd stop playing serious and seriously play
       I would run through more fields and gaze at more stars
       I'd do more hugging and less tugging
       I'd see the oak tree in the acorn more often
       I would be firm less often and affirm much more
       I'd model less about the love of power
       And more about the power of love."

The years of early childhood are indeed so very special. Any parent will report that despite the challenges that
often come with young children, the early years pass too quickly. It is our hope that you will gain valuable
knowledge within this resource but also a renewed sense of purpose in discovering the amazing development
of the whole child.

   With gratitude for all of the lessons young children continue to teach us,

                                                                                                                                                                    Introduction | 1

As part of the ROTEL Grant's mission to support the creation, management, and dissemination of culturally-
relevant textbooks, we must acknowledge Indigenous Peoples as the traditional stewards of the land, and
the enduring relationship that exists between them and their traditional territories. We acknowledge that the
boundaries that created Massachusetts were arbitrary and a product of the settlers. We honor the land on
which the Higher Education Institutions of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts are sited as the traditional
territory of tribal nations. We acknowledge the painful history of genocide and forced removal from their
territory and other atrocities connected with colonization. We honor and respect the many diverse indigenous
people connected to this land on which we gather, and our acknowledgment is one action we can take to
correct the stories and practices that erase Indigenous People's history and culture.

    · Describe historical views of child development
    · Define biological, cognitive and social and emotional processes
    · Outline the periods of development
    · Explain cross-cultural beliefs about child development
    · Describe how child development is studied
    · Define developmentally appropriate practice

          Two-and-a-half-year-old Santiago sits at a small table, arms stretched out, hands limp. His teacher
       places a small chunk of banana with the skin on it in front of him. Santiago looks up at the teachers,
       smiles, and then picks up the banana in his fist. Using his right hand, index finger, and thumb, he
       slowly peels the banana, and then with a flat hand, shoves the whole piece into his mouth.

          As six-year-old Chloe paints, she looks at the postcard she is copying, being very careful to use the
       same colors in her painting as on the postcard. As she paints, she says to Johanna, "I'm using gold
       first because that's my favorite, then the green". Johanna passes the red paint and laughs, "Red's
       last!" Chloe laughs, takes the pot of red paint, and begins to stir it vigorously.

          Three-month-old Zuri has a full head of darkest brown hair and thin, almost non-existent
       eyebrows. She has big brown eyes, full round cheeks, small ears, and a small nose. She has olive skin
       and a bald spot on the back of her head. Zuri does not yet have any teeth and seems to drool
       continuously. Her body is not proportional yet--her torso is full and round; she has tiny feet and long
       fingers. Zuri is twenty-two inches in length and weighs thirteen pounds.

What do all of these children have in common? They are all developing "normally." But what does that mean,
and how can we be sure? The field of developmental psychology has sought to explore exactly those questions.

   Developmental Psychology is the study of how and why humans change throughout their lifespan. By
studying sequences of typical development, we are able to make determinations about what might be
considered expected and healthy, and what may be a red flag of atypical development or development that
may be heading off track. In other words, it is only once we understand what typical, healthy development looks
like that we are able to recognize atypical or unhealthy development, and then can intervene.

                                                                                                                 Chapter One: Perspectives on Early Childhood | 5

Childhood Defined

Periods of Development

As children move from infancy to young adulthood, they go through key periods of development. Ages and
Stages is a term used to describe these periods of development. Although what defines these periods of
childhood has varied widely throughout history and across cultures, The American Academy of Pediatrics
defines these periods as follows:

   Prenatal Period which begins with conception and ends with birth
   Infancy which is marked by the months from birth through fifteen months
   Toddlerhood which encompasses sixteen months through a child's third birthday
   Early Childhood, spanning three to five years of age
   Middle Childhood, which spans the ages of five to twelve
   Adolescence, which includes the ages of twelve to eighteen
   Each age and stage is characterized by its own set of expected characteristics and changes. As we seek
to provide the best possible care and education for children, these distinct time periods provide a helpful
framework in which to study childhood (Bee & Boyd, 2009; Berk, 2017; Childhood defined, n.d.).

Domains of Development

Within these five time periods, we are then able to study primary areas in which change occurs, referred to
as the domains of development. We will examine child development across four major domains: Physical/
Biological, Cognitive (including intelligence), Social (relationships and self-awareness), and Emotional
(encompassing internal states such as temperament, emotional regulation, and understanding the emotions
of others).

          Growth vs. Development
          In talking about child development, it's important to keep in mind that growth and development
       do not refer to the same processes, although they are often used interchangeably.
          Development refers to overall changes that occur that result in improved functioning or
       achievement (for example, cognitive development, social development).
          Growth refers specifically to physical or biological changes that occur. Growth can be directly
       observed and measured.

In this chapter, we will explore

Historical Perspectives

History of Childhood

Throughout Ancient Times, the Middle Ages, and most of Early Modern History, the idea of childhood as we
understand it today didn't exist. In part because of the hardships of life in general, and in part because of
very high infant and child mortality rates (primarily due to malnutrition, disease, and general lack of access to
medical care), the way families viewed childhood was fundamentally different from the way it is viewed now.

   Before the 16th century, the focus of families was on survival. A child's value was in their ability to contribute
toward that goal. It wasn't until the late 1500's that the idea of a need for education of the common man
emerged. Until this point, it was primarily only those who intended to enter the clergy or become government
officials or physicians who received any kind of formal education. As societies developed and progressed, they
began to recognize the value of developing a skilled workforce. As a result, families began to need support in
providing an education for their children, and the first of what could be recognized as modern schools were
established.

   It had been widely believed that until modern times, children were primarily treated with indifference, dealt
with harshly, and regarded as miniature adults. This argument, which was famously made by French historian
Philippe Ariès (1914-1984) in his 1960 book titled, Centuries of Childhood, has since been disputed. Ariès came
to this conclusion after studying historical writings about childhood (or lack thereof) and paintings depicting
children through the Middle Ages. However, it is now understood that the depiction of children in pre-18th
century art as miniature adults was not at all due to any lack of regard or affection parents had for their
children. According to Alastair Sooke, in his article for the BBC, "How Childhood Came to Fascinate Artists",
Ariès' thinking was flawed for two key reasons:

                                     Painting by Lavinia Fontana depicting Bianca degli Utili Maselli, holding a
                                     dog and surrounded by six of her children (c. 1565-1614).

                                                                                                                                                    Historical Perspectives | 9
Pictures of children were surprisingly rare during the late Middle Ages and even into the 16th Century. In those
days, the infant Jesus was the principal image of childhood in art. For another, when artists finally started to
paint children with greater frequency during the 17th Century, they did so in a way that seems unnatural to
modern eyes, by presenting them as miniature adults. (Sooke, 2016)

                                     Painting by Pieter Bruegel the Elder called Children's Games (c. 1560).

He goes on to explain that paintings of the children of nobility (because they were the only ones who could
afford to have their portraits painted) served a different purpose than snapping a photo of a child today; it was
not meant to capture a moment in time. Rather, children were often dressed and posed as adults in an effort
to depict their parents' hopes for the person they would become. For royalty, these portraits became important
advertisements to potential suitors. It was, in reality, a very early form of the personal profile.

          Our current notions of childhood are primarily rooted in the works of 17th-century English
       philosopher John Locke and of 18th-century Swiss philosopher Jean Jacques Rousseau.

Locke (1632-1714) is probably most famous for his notion of children coming into the world as a tabula rasa, a
Latin term translated as "blank slate". He believed that infants were neither inherently good nor inherently evil
(as was commonly believed at the time--a reference to the church's teachings of original sin) but rather were
neutral or "blank". A child's nature and personality would develop over childhood, during which time he believed
a child was particularly impressionable and sensitive to new experiences. Because he believed that children
were born with no set predeterminations and since the child's mind was so malleable, an adult could mold him
or her with careful diligence. Many of his ideas about education endure today, most notably:

  · Each person develops according to his or her unique experiences, and thus the need for individualized
      education

  · Learning should be enjoyable, with many opportunities for play

10 | Historical Perspectives
  · Educators should focus on teaching critical thinking skills
  · Children learn best through sensory experiences

Rousseau's (1712-1778) philosophy of education emphasizes the development of a child's character and moral
sense. The goal was for the child to learn to remain principled and honorable, even in the unnatural and
imperfect society in which the child would have to live. He also believed that children should learn through
exploration and experiences carefully led by adults. This philosophy was predicated upon the idea that children
were born inherently good, not inherently wild or evil (or even neutral, as Locke believed). This was all very
radical thinking for the time.

   Some of Rousseau's ideas that continue to influence education today are:

  · Teaching should be flexible and responsive
  · Children learn best from hands-on experiences
  · Children's thinking is different from adults'
  · Children go through distinct phases of development

Locke and Rousseau helped to pave the way for what we consider our modern ideas about education. Many
other early educational pioneers used Locke's and Rousseau's groundbreaking work as the foundation for even
more progressive ideas about childhood and education. Examples include:

  · Integrated curriculum and the need for educating the whole child (the belief that all aspects of human
      growth and development are interrelated)--Johann Pestalozzi

  · Expansion of education to infants and toddlers--Robert Owen
  · Play as the most important construct for learning, and the importance of creating play experiences that

      reflect the natural world in which children live. These ideas became the foundations for kindergarten--
      Freidrich Froebel
  · Child-centered education and intentional teaching--John Dewey (Sooke, 2016)

Emerging Themes

Nature and Nurture

As we reflect on these ideas about childhood throughout Western history, we see that distinct themes of
development begin to emerge. Probably the most well-known is the theme of nature vs. nurture. This refers to
the debate within developmental psychology concerned with examining whether certain characteristics and
aspects of behavior are primarily the result of biological programming and inheritance (nature) or whether they
are learned and the product of experience (nurture). Proponents of the nature view of development believe that
humans develop based on a predetermined genetic plan that we inherit from our parents. Examples of this
thinking can be seen, perhaps most famously, in the work of Charles Darwin and his theories of evolution, but
also in later theorists such as Arnold Gesell (Bee & Boyd, 2009; Berk, 2017; Childhood defined, n.d.).

   Proponents of the nurture view of development believe that humans develop based on the influences and
experiences we collect over our lifetime, regardless of genetic makeup. Some of the most enduring theories of
the nurture view of development stem from the works of John Watson, B.F. Skinner and Albert Bandura, whom
we'll explore in chapter two.

                                                                                                                                                    Historical Perspectives | 11
As you will see throughout this text, it is the interplay among all these factors that ultimately results in who we become.

As Dr. David Rettew explains in his post "Nature Versus Nurture: Where We Are in 2017" for Psychology Today:
   Today, most scientists who carefully examine the ever-expanding research base have come to appreciate that

the nature and nurture domains are hopelessly interwoven with one another. Genes have an influence on the
environments we experience. At the same time, a person's environment and experience can directly change
the level at which certain genes are expressed (a rapidly evolving area of research called epigenetics), which in
turn alters both the physical structure and activity of the brain. (Rettew, 2017)

   Embedded in the debate over nature and nurture are notions of stability and change-- that is, ideas about
how changeable and/or prone to influence, development and behavior are--as well as notions of universal vs.
individual development. These debates seek to answer questions such as:

  · Can patterns of behavior change?
  · Can certain genetic and/or environmental influences be overcome?
  · What accounts for individual differences in development?
  · Why does human development seem to follow certain universal, predictable patterns?

Continuous and Discontinuous Development

Another debated controversy in the field of human development is the idea of continuous vs. discontinuous
sequences of development. Continuous development refers to the idea that development occurs as the result
of a continual maturation process--a steady unfolding of changes throughout the lifetime. This type of
development can be thought of as similar to that of a tree. The organism (in this case, a tree) gradually develops
and changes over time, but maintains the same primary characteristics and functions as it did before--just
larger and more complex.

   Discontinuous development refers to the idea that development occurs in distinct stages, each stage being
fundamentally different from the preceding or following stages. This type of development is similar to that of
a butterfly. At each stage of a butterfly's life (egg, caterpillar, chrysalis, adult), the butterfly is very different from
any other stage, and yet it is still a butterfly (Bee & Boyd, 2009; Berk, 2017; Childhood defined, n.d.).

   In Chapter Two, we will explore more deeply how theories of development can fall into these categories of
being either continuous or discontinuous.

12 | Historical Perspectives
Risk and Resilience

A more contemporary debate that has arisen around educating and caring for children has to do with how we
view risk and resilience. Conventional wisdom dictated that it was in children's best interests to try to limit (as
much as possible) their exposure to any form of adversity or loss. While most agree that it is, in fact, in children's
best interests to protect them from any kind of trauma, tragedy, threat, or significant stress, in recent decades,
it seems that the pendulum has swung too far in the direction of insulating children from any and all forms of
stress and loss. However, it is through this stress and loss that children learn to cope with future stress and loss,
thus becoming resilient. Rather than using the everyone-gets-a-trophy strategy of rewarding children, we have
come to understand that genuine and authentic praise serves children much better. It's important to keep in
mind that resilience is not a trait that people either have or do not have. It involves behaviors, thoughts, and
actions that can be learned and developed. When children experience adversity--whether it be the loss of a
parent or not making the team--helping them to frame the experience as one they can survive helps them
for the next encounter. It becomes a positive feedback loop; adversity helps children to learn resilience, which
then helps children to be more resilient in the face of future adversity. The key is in helping them learn effective
coping strategies and supporting them through the resilience process. The American Psychological Association
provides more information in their publication, "Resilience Guide for Teachers and Parents", which can be found
on their website (APA, 2012).

                                                                                                                                                   Historical Perspectives | 13

14 | Historical Perspectives
Cultural Perspectives

It's valuable to take into consideration that these themes are based upon what is commonly referred to as
"WEIRD" societies, that is societies which are Western, Educated, Industrialized, Rich and Democratic. American
society certainly falls within this description, but by no means do all societies. Childhood actually has different
meanings around the world. Depending on various cultures' shared patterns of behaviors, interactions and
understandings, we see different constructs of childhood emerge. The following articles: "Different Cultures,
Different Childhoods" (Montgomery, 2013) from The Open University, and "A Cross-Cultural Perspective on
Childhood" (2018) from Human Relations Area Files (HRAF) provide some eye-opening examples of these
differences in beliefs about childhood.

   Despite these differences, in 1989 the United Nations General Assembly adopted the first human rights treaty
which articulates basic universal civil, political, economic, social, health and cultural rights of children, known
as the Convention on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC). According to the United Nations International Children's
Emergency Fund (UNICEF), the Convention:

  · Defined childhood as a separate space from adulthood and recognized that what is appropriate for an
      adult may not be suitable for a child.

  · Called on governments to provide material assistance and support to families and to prevent children
      from being separated from their parents.

  · Recognized that children are the holders of their own rights and are therefore not passive recipients of
      charity but empowered actors in their own development.

          As a direct result of the policies that were able to be put in place in the years since the Convention
       was adopted, the world has seen significant improvement in the quality of life for children. Almost
       unbelievably, as of the writing of this text, the United States is the only member of the United
       Nations that has not ratified the treaty. It is believed that this is the case because of very powerful
       lobbying by special interest groups.

                                                                                                                                                     Cultural Perspectives | 15

Developmentally Appropriate Practice

How do these previously discussed perspectives shape the way we
raise and educate children?

In 1989, The National Association for the Education of Young Children (NAEYC) set out to answer just this
question. NAEYC published its first position statement related to Developmentally Appropriate Practice (DAP),
and while many other advocacy agencies have also sought to define developmentally appropriate practice,
NAEYC's position is considered the gold standard and most widely accepted. NAEYC has since updated its
position in order to remain current with and responsive to new research developments. According to NAEYC,

   Developmentally Appropriate Practice (DAP) is a framework designed to promote young children's optimal
learning and development. To make decisions that reflect best practices, educators take into consideration
what they know about:

  · child development and learning
  · each child as an individual
  · each child's social and cultural context
These three guiding principles are used in all high-quality early childhood programs and are reflected
throughout this text (NAEYC, 2022).

18 | Developmentally Appropriate Practice
How is Child Development Studied?

Researchers use three primary methods in studying development in order to draw their conclusions:

  · longitudinal studies
  · cross-sectional studies
  · case studies

Longitudinal Studies refer to studies in which a large group of children is studied over time in order to look
at specific changes that occur. Longitudinal studies may examine a single aspect of development or multiple
aspects at once. Data is collected at two or more different time intervals, but typically the study looks at
development multiple times over the course of several months or even over an entire lifetime. While some of
the most valuable data about development has been gained through the use of longitudinal studies, because
these studies are so comprehensive and lengthy, they tend to be very expensive to carry out and can take
decades to be able to draw any concrete conclusions. Ultimately, longitudinal studies aim to draw conclusions
that can be generalized over a population.

   Cross-Sectional Studies refer to studies in which comparisons are made in the abilities and behaviors of two
or more groups of children, each group being of a different age; for example, comparing the language skills of
two-year-olds to the language skills of five-year-olds in order to come to some conclusion about the changes
that occur between the ages of two and five. An advantage of this type of study is that it is typically less costly
to carry out because the studies can be held over a very short timeframe--researchers don't have to wait for
children to get older. A drawback to these studies is that researchers are comparing more apples to oranges,
rather than apples to apples.

   Case studies refer to investigations in which a single child or small group of children are studied. Case studies
are far more in-depth and detailed than longitudinal studies, include the related contextual conditions in which
development is observed, and draw upon data from multiple sources. Because case studies apply only to a
single or very small group of individuals, the results typically cannot be generalized to a larger population (Berk,
2017; Crain, 2011).

   When looking at data from various types of studies, it's essential to understand the difference between a
correlation and a causation. Notable market analyst, Ben Yaskovitz, describes the difference as, "Correlation
helps you predict the future, because it gives you an indication of what's going to happen. Causality lets you
change the future." (Yaskovitz, 2013)

   Correlation describes the relationship among two or more variables that appear to be related to one another,
but one does not necessarily cause the other to occur. For example, there is a correlation between ice cream
consumption and drowning (Yaskovitz, 2013). It seems that ice cream consumption rises and falls with the
rate of drownings. However, there is nothing about eating ice cream that causes people to drown. In this
case, it seems that there is another factor involved--weather. In certain climates and during certain seasons,
people tend to consume more ice cream. More people in those climates and during those seasons tend also
to be engaged in water -related activities, and the more people involved in water-related activities, the more
drownings that tend to occur. The two factors are related but one does not cause the other to happen.

   A more famous mistaken correlation was that between unpleasant odors and disease. Until the late 19th
century, before people fully understood microbiology and disease processes, it was believed that bad odors
actually caused disease--unpleasant-smelling air appeared to make people sick, so the two occurrences were
correlated. Of course, we now understand that it's not the odor that makes people sick, but rather the factors
leading to the odor that do. (ex. It's not the smell of spoiled milk that will make you sick, but the bacteria in the
milk that produces the smell that will.)

                                                                                                                               How is Child Development Studied? | 19
   Causation describes a relationship among two or more variables in which one occurs as the direct result of
another. One thing causes another. For example, the way that gravity causes things to fall toward the ground.

   Even in the field of child development, there have been many examples of occurrences in which a
correlational relationship was mistaken for a causational one; it's critical to recognize the difference between
the two when drawing conclusions about children's development and behavior (Santrock, 2013).

     Did you know...

        A little stress can actually be good for you? Studies show that with a little bit of stress, people actually
     have improved performance on various tasks. We seem to work better when we are under just the right
     amount of pressure to succeed. A little stress helps to keep us focused and motivated, but too much
     can tip the scales and we can find ourselves fatigued, anxious, or even burnt out. Keep this in mind as
     you progress throughout this course and also as you work with children--it's healthy to strive for
     success and to be slightly out of your comfort zone. The graph below helps to illustrate this
     phenomenon.

Theories of Development

The study of child growth and development is a rich and varied subject. Child development theories focus
on explaining how children grow and change from conception through childhood. Theories of development
provide a framework for thinking about child growth and learning.

   Why do children behave in certain ways? How can we as educators better understand and support children's
behavior? It is important to study how children develop. An understanding of child development allows us to
gain a deeper understanding of the physical, cognitive, social, and emotional growth that children experience.
This chapter will focus on psychosocial, behaviorist, social cognitive, cognitive, sociocultural, humanistic,
ecological, growth mindset, and multiple intelligence theories and their impact on a child's development, with
an emphasis on strengthening teaching and learning.

                                                                                                                                               Theories of Development | 23
Psychosocial Theory

Erik H. Erikson (1902-1994), was a German-born, world-renowned scholar of the behavioral sciences. Erikson is
one of the few theorists of his time to address development through the entire lifespan, not just childhood.
As our society as a whole is becoming increasingly older, and thus there is an increasing need to understand
individuals as they advance into old age, Erikson's views are even more valuable and relevant today than when
he first proposed them. Erikson is, perhaps, best known for his theory of psychosocial development. Having
studied psychoanalysis (the prevailing theory of personality development at the time) Erikson began to shift
from Freud's emphasis on psychosexual crises to one of psychosocial conflicts. Drawing upon Sigmund Freud's
basic psychosexual theories, Anna Freud's explorations in the psychological development of children, and his
own experience as an educator, he developed a theory which outlined eight distinct stages of development
over the lifespan.

   According to Erikson's theory, each of the eight stages of his psychosocial theory is characterized by a
different psychosocial crisis of two conflicting forces. Because each stage builds upon the successful completion
of earlier stages, any unresolved challenges of a particular stage will most likely resurface as problems later
in an individual's development. In this way, the outcomes of each stage are not permanent and can be
modified by later experiences as challenges are re-confronted. Although his stages seem to align with periods
of development, they are not necessarily perfectly sequential; it is possible to move from one stage up to
another, and then at some point, move back down to a previous stage. For example, imagine a scenario in which
you are an adult in the generativity vs. stagnation stage, having successfully resolved all the previous stages,
when you find out that your spouse has cheated on you, and you decide to get a divorce. In this case, it would be
perfectly expected that you would again be struggling with issues of trust, intimacy, and possibly even identity.
Your success or failure at resolving these struggles previously will, in part, determine your resilience during this
challenge.

   Beginning in infancy, his eight stages (from bottom to top) are:

24 | Psychosocial Theory
Trust vs. Mistrust (Infancy)

The first stage of Erik Erikson's theory centers around an infant's basic needs being met by its caregivers, and
this interaction leads to trust or mistrust. Trust, as defined by Erikson, is an essential belief in the reliability
of others, as well as a fundamental sense of one's own trustworthiness. The infant depends on its caregivers,
typically its mother, for sustenance and comfort. At this stage, the child's relative understanding of the world
and society comes directly from its caregivers and their interaction with the child. A child's first trust is
always with its caregiver, whoever that might be. If caregivers expose an infant to warmth, regularity, and
dependable affection, the infant's view of the world will be one of trust. Should caregivers fail to provide a secure
environment or to meet the child's basic needs, a sense of mistrust will result (Bee & Boyd, 2009). Development
of mistrust can lead to feelings of frustration, suspicion, withdrawal, and a lack of confidence throughout
childhood, as well as later in life.

   According to Erik Erikson, the major developmental task in infancy is to learn whether or not other people,
especially primary caregivers, regularly satisfy basic needs. If caregivers are consistent sources of food, comfort,
and affection, an infant learns trust (i.e., others are dependable and reliable). If they are neglectful, or perhaps
even abusive, the infant instead learns mistrust (i.e., the world is an undependable, unpredictable, and possibly
a dangerous place). The child's number one need in this stage is to feel safe, comforted, and well cared for (Bee
& Boyd, 2009).

Autonomy vs. Shame/Doubt (Toddlerhood)

As children gain increasing control over their motor abilities, they begin to move around and explore their
surroundings. Trusting caregivers provide a strong, secure base from which children can venture out to assert
their will and newfound independence. Caregivers' patience and encouragement help to foster a sense of
autonomy--or independence. Highly restrictive caregivers, caregivers who demand too much self-regulation
too soon, caregivers who refuse to let children perform tasks of which they are capable, or discourage early
attempts at self-sufficiency, instill in children a sense of shame and doubt in their ability to handle new
challenges. As a result, children learn to withdraw from their world.

Initiative vs. Guilt (Preschool Years)

The development of courage and independence are what set preschoolers, ages three to six years of age,
apart from other age groups. Young children in this category face the challenge of initiative versus guilt.
As described by Bee and Boyd (2009), the child during this stage faces the complexities of planning and
developing a sense of judgment. Because this sense of planning and judgment is still developing, along with
initiative, sometimes negative behaviors (such as throwing objects, hitting, or yelling) can also emerge. These
behaviors are often the result of the child's frustration in not being able to achieve a goal as planned. Sometimes
preschoolers take on projects they can readily accomplish, but at other times they undertake projects that are
beyond their capabilities or that interfere with other people's plans and activities. If caregivers and preschool
teachers encourage and support children's efforts, while also helping them make realistic and appropriate
choices, children develop a healthy sense of initiative in planning and undertaking activities. If, instead, adults
discourage the pursuit of independent activities or dismiss them as silly and bothersome, children develop guilt
about their needs and desires.

                                                                                                                                                      Psychosocial Theory | 25
Industry vs. Inferiority (Elementary Years)

The failure to master trust, autonomy, and initiative may cause the child to doubt themselves, leading to feelings
of shame, guilt, defeat, and/or inferiority. Children at this age are becoming more aware of themselves as
individuals; they work hard at being responsible, being good, and "doing it right." At this stage, children are very
eager to learn and accomplish progressively complex skills, such as reading, writing, telling time, etc. Erikson
viewed the elementary school years as particularly critical for the development of self-confidence. Ideally,
elementary school provides many opportunities to achieve the recognition of teachers, caregivers, and peers
by producing things--drawing pictures, solving addition problems, writing sentences, and so on. If children are
encouraged to make and do things and are then praised for their accomplishments, they begin to demonstrate
industry by being diligent, persevering at tasks until completed, and putting work before pleasure. If children
are, instead, ridiculed or punished for their efforts or if they find they are incapable of meeting their teachers'
and caregivers' expectations, they develop feelings of inferiority about their capabilities (Crain, 2011).

Identity vs. Role-Confusion (Adolescence)

As adolescents become newly concerned with how they appear to others, the need to settle on an identity
becomes an increasing priority. As they make the transition from childhood to adulthood, adolescents ponder
the roles they will play in the adult world. Initially, they are apt to experience some role-confusion--mixed ideas
and feelings about the specific ways in which they will fit into society, and they may experiment with a variety
of behaviors, social groups, and activities. Erikson is credited with coining the term identity crisis to explain
the negotiation of this particular challenge. Eventually, Erikson proposed, most adolescents achieve a sense of
identity regarding who they are and where their lives are headed. The teenager must achieve a sense of identity
in career, gender roles, politics, and religion, among others. This stage is considered to be a turning point
in human development because it marks the transition from childhood to adulthood, and more specifically,
seems to be the reconciliation between the person one has come to be and the person society expects one to
become. In relation to the eight life stages as a whole, the fifth stage corresponds to a crossroads.

Intimacy vs. Isolation (Early Adulthood)

At the start of this stage, identity vs. role confusion is coming to an end though it still lingers at the foundation
of this stage (Erikson, 1950). Young adults are still eager to blend their identities with friends; they want to fit
in. Once people have established their identities, they are ready to make long-term commitments to others.
They become capable of forming intimate, reciprocal relationships (for example, through close friendships or
marriage) and willingly make the sacrifices and compromises that such relationships require. If people cannot
form these relationships of intimacy (perhaps because of their own needs), a sense of isolation may result,
provoking feelings of darkness and angst.

Generativity vs. Stagnation (Middle Adulthood)

The stage of generativity has broad applications for family relationships, work, and society. "Generativity, then,

26 | Psychosocial Theory
is primarily the concern in establishing and guiding the next generation. . . the concept is meant to include.
. . productivity and creativity" (Erikson, 1950, p. 240). In other words, during middle adulthood, the primary
developmental task is one of contributing to society and helping to guide future generations. Socially-valued
work and disciplines are expressions of generativity. As a person experiences successes during this stage,
perhaps by raising a family or working toward the betterment of society, a sense of generativity--of productivity
and accomplishment--results. In contrast, a person who is self-centered and unable or unwilling to help society
move forward develops a feeling of stagnation or dissatisfaction with his or her relative lack of productivity Berk,
2017).

Integrity vs. Despair (Older Adulthood)

As we grow older and become senior citizens, we tend to slow down our productivity and explore life as retired
people. It is during this time that we contemplate our accomplishments and are able to develop integrity if we
see ourselves as leading a successful life. If we see our life as unproductive or feel that we did not accomplish
our life goals, we become dissatisfied with life and develop a sense of despair, often leading to depression and
hopelessness. This stage may manifest itself out of sequence when individuals feel they are near the end of their
lives (such as when receiving a terminal disease diagnosis) (Santrock, 2013).

Criticism of Psychosocial Theory

Erikson's theory may be questioned as to whether his stages must be regarded as sequential and only occurring
within the age ranges he suggests. There is debate as to whether people only search for identity during the

                                                                                                                                                      Psychosocial Theory | 27
adolescent years or if one stage needs to happen before other stages can be completed. Erikson himself states
that each of these processes occurs throughout the lifetime in one form or another, and he emphasizes these
periods only because it is at these times that the conflicts become most prominent (Erikson, 1956).

Educational Implications

Teachers who apply psychosocial development in the classroom create an environment where each child feels
appreciated and is comfortable with learning new things and building relationships with peers.

          At the preschool level, teachers want to focus on helping children develop healthy personalities
       and

            · Find out what students are interested in and create projects that incorporate their area of
                interest.

            · Make sure to point out and praise students for good choices.
            · Offer continuous, authentic feedback.
            · Not ridicule or criticize students. They should find a private place to talk with a child about a

                poor choice or behavior.
            · Help students formulate their own alternate choices by guiding them to a more positive

                solution and outcome.
            · When children experiment, they should not be punished for trying something that may turn

                out differently from what the teacher had planned.

          At the elementary level, teachers should focus on achievement and peer relationships and
            · Create a list of classroom duties that need to be completed on a scheduled basis. Ask
                students for their input when creating the list, as well as giving them a say in who will be in
                charge of what.
            · Discuss and post classroom rules.
            · Make sure to include students in the decision-making process when discussing rules.
            · Encourage students to think outside of their day-to-day routine by role-playing different
                situations.
            · Let students know that striving for perfection is not as important as learning from mistakes.
            · Teach children resilience.
            · Encourage children to help students who may be having trouble socially and/or
                academically.
            · Never allow any child to make fun of or bully another child.
            · Build confidence by recognizing success in what children do best.
            · Provide a variety of choices when making an assignment so that students can express

Behaviorist Theory

Behaviorism is primarily concerned with observable and measurable aspects of human behavior. In defining
behavior, behaviorist learning theories emphasize changes in behavior that result from stimulus-response
associations made by the learner. Behaviorists assert that the only behaviors worthy of study are those that
can be directly observed; thus, it is actions, rather than thoughts or emotions, which are the legitimate object
of study. Behaviorist theory does not explain abnormal behavior in terms of the brain or its inner workings.
Rather, it posits that all behavior is learned habits, and attempts to account for how these habits are formed. In
assuming that human behavior is learned, behaviorists also hold that all behaviors can also be unlearned and
replaced by new behaviors; that is, when a behavior becomes unacceptable, it can be replaced by an acceptable
one. A key element of this theory of learning is the rewarded response. The desired response must be rewarded
for learning to take place (Parkay & Hass, 2000). John B. Watson (1878-1958) and B. F. Skinner (1904-1990) are
the two principal originators of behaviorist approaches to learning.

   Watson's basic premise was that conclusions about human development should be based on observation
of overt behavior rather than speculation about subconscious motives or latent cognitive processes (Shaffer,
2000). Watson's view of learning was based in part on the studies of Ivan Pavlov (1849-1936). Pavlov was well
known for his research on a learning process called classical conditioning. Classical conditioning refers to
learning that occurs when a neutral stimulus (an unassociated signal) becomes associated with a stimulus that
naturally produces a behavior, such as a reflex or innate behavior. Pavlov noticed that dogs salivated shortly
before they were given food. He discovered that when the bell was rung at repeated feedings, the sound of the
bell alone (a conditioned stimulus) would cause the dogs to salivate (a conditioned response).

   Skinner believed that human behavior is predictable, just like a chemical reaction. He believed that people
don't shape the world, but instead, the world shapes them. Expanding on Watson's basic stimulus-response
model, Skinner developed a more comprehensive view of conditioning, known as operant conditioning. His
model was based on the premise that satisfying responses are conditioned, while unsatisfying ones are not.
Operant conditioning is the rewarding of a desired behavior or act that approaches it. Skinner remarked that
"the things we call pleasant have an energizing or strengthening effect on our behavior" (Skinner, 1972, p. 74).
Through Skinner's research on animals, he concluded that both animals and humans would repeat acts that
led to favorable outcomes and suppress those that produced unfavorable results (Shaffer, 2000). If a rat presses
a bar and receives a food pellet, he will be likely to press it again. Skinner defined the bar-pressing response
as operant (the learned voluntary response), and the food pellet as a positive reinforcer. Punishments, on the
other hand, are consequences that suppress a response and decrease the likelihood that it will occur in the
future. If the rat had been shocked every time it pressed the bar, that behavior would cease. Skinner believed
the habits that each of us develop result from our unique operant learning experiences (Shaffer, 2000).

   Negative reinforcement can be used as a strategy to encourage certain behaviors. Defined, negative
reinforcement is the encouragement of certain behaviors by removing or avoiding a negative outcome or
stimuli. An alarm clock is an example of a negative reinforcer. In order to stop the buzzing, you need to wake
up! Another example is the beeping car manufacturers install that go off until you fasten your seatbelt (Jordan,
2022).

Criticisms of Behaviorism

Behaviorism can be critiqued as an overly deterministic view of human behavior that ignores internal
psychological and mental processes; behaviorism oversimplifies the complexity of human behavior. The

30 | Behaviorist Theory
behaviorist approach has also been criticized for its inability to account for learning or changes in behavior that
occur in the absence of environmental input. Lastly, research has shown that the principles of conditioning are
not universal; the link between stimulus and response is not just a simple, direct, cause-and-effect relationship.
Factors beyond the stimulus are involved in determining the response. A complete understanding of human
behavior would need to include not just actions, but the inner life of the mind as well.

Educational Implications

Behaviorist techniques have long been employed in education to promote behavior that is desirable and
discourage that which is not. Among the methods derived from behaviorist theory for practical classroom
application are contracts, consequences, reinforcement, extinction, and behavior modification. Using
behaviorist theory in the classroom can be rewarding for both students and teachers. Behavioral change occurs
for a reason; students work for things that bring them positive feelings approval from people they admire.
They change behaviors to satisfy the desires they have learned to value. They generally avoid behaviors they
associate with unpleasantness and develop habitual behaviors from those that are repeated often (Parkay &
Hass, 2000). The entire rationale of behavior modification is that most behavior is learned. If behaviors can be
learned, then they can also be unlearned or relearned. A behavior that goes unrewarded will be extinguished.
Consistently ignoring an undesirable behavior will go far toward eliminating it. Other successful classroom
strategies are contracts, consequences, punishment, and others that have been described in detail earlier.
Behaviorist learning theory is not only important in achieving desired behavior in mainstream education but
also in other behavior.

   Advocates of behaviorism have effectively adopted this system of rewards and punishments in their
classrooms by rewarding desired behaviors and punishing inappropriate ones. Rewards can vary widely and
must be important to the learner in some way. As with all teaching methods, success depends on each
student's individual stimulus and response.

Social Cognitive Theory

Albert Bandura (1925-) is perhaps most famous for his Bobo Doll experiments in the 1960s. At the time there
was a popular belief that learning was a result of reinforcement. In the Bobo Doll experiments, Bandura
presented children with examples of violent behavior or non-violent behavior towards the inflatable Bobo Doll.
Children who viewed the violent behavior were in turn violent towards the doll; the control group was rarely
violent towards the doll. That became Bandura's social learning theory in the 1960s, a learning theory based
on the idea that people learn by observing and interacting with others. It is often called a bridge between
behaviorist and cognitive learning theories because it encompasses attention, memory, and motivation. Social
learning is also commonly referred to as observational learning, because it comes about as a result of observing
models. Bandura became interested in social aspects of learning at the beginning of his career. Early theories
considered behavior to be a function of the interaction between a person and their environment. Bandura
believed that behavior itself influences both the person and the environment, each of which in turn affects
behavior and each other; the result is a complex interplay of factors. Social learning theory emphasizes that
behavior, personal factors, and environmental factors are all equal, interlocking determinants of each other.

                       The top four images above show scenes of adults acting aggressively toward Bandura's doll.
                       Children were shown these scenes, then left in a room with the doll and observed. The center
                       and bottom rows of images show how two children emulated the behaviors they had just
                       seen.

Bandura and his colleagues continued to show that social modeling is a very effective way of learning and
went on to expand motivational and cognitive processes on social learning theory. In 1986, Bandura published
his second book Social Foundations of Thought and Action: A Social Cognitive Theory, which expanded and
renamed his original theory. He called the new theory Social Cognitive Theory (SCT). Bandura changed the
name social learning theory to social cognitive theory to emphasize the major role cognition plays in encoding
and performing behaviors. In this book, Bandura (1986) argued that human behavior is caused by personal,
behavioral, and environmental influences. The theory states that when people observe a model performing a
behavior, along with the consequences of that behavior, they remember the sequence of events and use this
information to guide subsequent behaviors. Depending on whether people are rewarded or punished for their

32 | Social Cognitive Theory
behavior and the outcome of the behavior, the observer may choose to replicate behavior modeled (Berk, 2017;
Crain, 2011; Santrock, 2013).

   Media provides models for a vast array of people in many different environmental settings.

     HOT TOPIC: Violence in Media

        There is still much debate over the influence exposure to media violence has on behavior, especially
     for children. These articles offer views on both sides of the discussion:

        The American Psychological Association's Policy Statement regarding media violence:

Criticism of Social Cognitive Theory

One of the main criticisms of the social cognitive theory is that it is not a unified theory, meaning that the
different aspects of the theory may not be connected. The theory is so broad that not all of its component
parts are fully understood and integrated into a single explanation of learning. The findings associated with this
theory are still, for the most part, preliminary. The theory is limited in that not all social learning can be directly
observed. Because of this, it can be difficult to measure the effect that social cognition has on development.
Finally, this theory tends to ignore maturation throughout the lifespan. Because of this, the understanding of
how a child learns through observation and how an adult learns through observation are not differentiated, and
factors of development are not included.

Educational Implications of Social Cognitive Theory

People can consciously change and develop their cognitive functioning. This is important to the proposition
that how we view ourselves can also be changed or enhanced. From this perspective, people are capable of
influencing their own motivation and performance. Improving performance, therefore, depends on changing
some of these influences. In teaching and learning, the challenge upfront is to

  · Get the learner to believe in his or her personal capabilities to successfully perform a designated task
  · Provide environmental conditions, such as instructional strategies and appropriate technology, that

      improve the strategies and self-efficacy of the learner
  · Provide opportunities for the learner to experience successful learning as a result of appropriate action

Cognitive Theory

Jean Piaget (1896-1980), a Swiss psychologist, is best known for his pioneering work on the development of
intelligence in children. His studies have had a major impact on the fields of psychology and education. Piaget
was the first to conduct systematic observations of children in order to study cognition. Piaget was primarily
interested in the nature of knowledge and how it could be seen as a form of adaptation to the environment.
He described his work as genetic epistemology - the study of the origins and development of knowledge.
Piaget based many of his ideas on observations of his own children-Jacqueline, Lucienne, and Laurent. From
his observations of children, Piaget concluded that children were actively constructing their own knowledge;
they were not limited to receiving knowledge from caregivers or teachers.

   In studying the cognitive development of children and adolescents, Piaget identified four major stages:
sensorimotor, preoperational, concrete operational, and formal operational. In each stage, children
demonstrate new intellectual abilities and increasingly complex understanding of the world. According to
Piaget, these stages cannot be skipped--cognitive development always follows this precise sequence. The
ages at which children progress through the stages are approximations, varying with the environment and
background of individual children. Further, at any given time, a child may exhibit behaviors characteristic
of more than one stage. Piaget's work provides the foundation on which constructivist theories are based.
Constructivists believe that knowledge is individually constructed and that each person constructs their own
understanding of concepts, which may vary from person to person (Berk, 2017; Crain, 2011; Santrock, 2013.

Sensorimotor Development

In the Sensorimotor Stage, occurring from birth to age 2, the child is concerned with gaining motor control
and learning about physical objects. Piaget proposed that an infant's intelligence is essentially practical in that
all interactions with its environment are either sensory (i.e., seeing, hearing, etc.) or motor (i.e., grasping, pulling,
etc.). Thus, the first stage of development is known as the sensorimotor stage. Knowledge is limited in this stage
because it is based on physical interactions and experiences. Infants cannot predict reactions, and, therefore,
must constantly experiment and learn through trial and error. Such exploration might include shaking a rattle
or putting objects in the mouth. As they become more mobile, infants' ability to develop cognitively increases,
and early language development begins during this stage.

     Piaget's Observations of Infant Jacqueline

        Jacqueline tries to grasp a celluloid duck on top of her quilt. She almost catches it, shakes herself,
     and the duck slides down beside her. It falls very close to her hand but behind a fold in the sheet.
     Jacqueline's eyes have followed the movement, and she has even followed it with her outstretched
     hand. But as soon as the duck has disappeared--nothing more! It does not occur to her to search
     behind the fold of the sheet, which would be very easy to do (she twists it mechanically without

                                                                                                                                                           Cognitive Theory | 35
     searching at all). But, curiously, she again begins to stir about as she did when trying to get the duck
     and again glances at the top of the quilt.

        I then take the duck from its hiding place and place it near her hand three times. All three times she
     tries to grasp it, but when she is about to touch it, I replace it very obviously under the sheet.
     Jacqueline immediately withdraws her hand and gives up. The second and third times, I make her
     grasp the duck through the sheet, and she shakes it for a brief moment, but it does not occur to her to
     raise the cloth.

        Then I recommence the initial experiment. The duck is on the quilt. In trying to get it, she again
     causes it to slide behind the fold in the sheet; after having looked at this fold for a moment (it is near
     her hand), she turns over and sucks her thumb.

                                                                                                                     (Source: Piaget, 1955, pp. 36-7)
        From such observations, Piaget concluded that infants lack an understanding of object
     permanence--the concept that objects continue to exist when they are out of sight. The fact that
     something as fundamental as object permanence does not appear to be innate illustrates how deeply
     and how early the child begins to build an understanding of the world, at least according to Piaget's
     theory.

Preoperational Development

In the Preoperational Stage, from ages 2 to 7, the child is preoccupied with verbal skills. At this point, the child
can name objects and reason intuitively. In this stage, children can use symbols to represent words, images,
and ideas, demonstrated by children in this stage by engaging in pretend play. A child's arms might become
airplane wings as he zooms around the room, or a child with a stick might become a brave knight with a sword.
Children also begin to use language in the preoperational stage, but they cannot understand adult logic or
mentally manipulate information (the term operational refers to logical manipulation of information, so children
at this stage are pre-operational). Children's logic is based on their own personal knowledge of the world so far,
rather than on conventional knowledge. More complex concepts, such as cause and effect relationships, have
not been learned. During this stage, we also expect children to display egocentrism, which means that the child
is not able to take the perspective of others. A child at this stage thinks that everyone sees, thinks, and feels just
as they do.

Concrete Operational Development

In the Concrete Operational Stage, from ages 7 to 11, the child begins to deal with abstract concepts such as
numbers and relationships. In this stage, children can think logically about real (concrete) events; they have
a firm grasp on the use of numbers and start to employ memory strategies. They can perform mathematical
operations and understand transformations, such as addition is the opposite of subtraction, and multiplication
is the opposite of division. Thinking at this stage becomes less egocentric, and children come to understand the

36 | Cognitive Theory
concept of conservation--even if something changes shape, its mass, volume, and number stay the same. For
example, if you pour water from a tall, thin glass into a short, fat glass, you still have the same amount of water.

Formal Operational Development

                                        The period from adolescence through adulthood is the Formal Operational Stage.
                                        During this stage, adolescents and adults begin to reason logically and
                                        systematically. Adolescents and adults in this stage are able to use symbols related
                                        to abstract concepts. Adolescents can think about multiple variables in systematic
                                        ways, can formulate hypotheses, and think about abstract relationships and
                                        concepts. Piaget believed that intellectual development was a lifelong process, but
                                        that when formal operational thought was attained, no new structures were
                                        needed. Intellectual development in adults involves developing more complex
                                        thoughts through the addition of knowledge (Berk, 2017; Crain, 2011; Santrock, 2013).
   "Play is the work of childhood." - Jean Piaget

Criticisms of Piaget's Cognitive Development Theory

As with other major contributors to theories of development, several of Piaget's ideas have come under criticism
based on the results of further research. For example, several contemporary studies support a model of
development that is more continuous than Piaget's discrete stages (Courage & Howe, 2002). Many others
suggest that children reach cognitive milestones earlier than Piaget describes. Piaget's theory also predicts
that thinking within a particular stage would be similar across tasks. In other words, preschool children should
perform at the preoperational level in all cognitive tasks. Research has shown diversity in children's thinking
across cognitive tasks. Researchers now believe that children may be more competent than Piaget originally
thought, especially in their practical knowledge.

   Lastly, according to Piaget, the highest level of cognitive development is formal operational thought, which
develops between 11 and 20 years old. However, many developmental psychologists disagree with Piaget,
suggesting a fifth stage of cognitive development, known as the postformal stage (Commons & Bresette, 2006).
In postformal thinking, decisions are made based on situations and circumstances, and logic is integrated
with emotion as adults develop principles that depend on contexts. One way that we can see the difference
between an adult in postformal thought and an adolescent in formal operations is in terms of how they handle
emotionally- charged issues.

Educational Implications

An important implication of Piaget's theory is the adaptation of instruction to the learner's developmental
level. The content of instruction needs to be consistent with the developmental level of the learner. The
teacher's role is to facilitate learning by providing a variety of experiences. Opportunities that allow students
of differing cognitive levels to work together often encourage less mature students to advance to a more
mature understanding. Perhaps the most significant implication for instruction is the use of concrete "hands-
on" experiences to help children learn.

                                                                                                                                                           Cognitive Theory | 37
          Additional Piagetian suggestions include
            · Continue to provide concrete props and visual aids
            · Use familiar examples to facilitate learning more complex ideas
            · Allow opportunities to classify and group information with increasing complexity
            · Present problems that require logical analytic thinking, such as "brain teasers"
            · Provide opportunities to discuss social, political, and cultural issues
            · Teach broad concepts rather than facts
            · Ground concepts in a context that's meaningful and relevant to the learner

38 | Cognitive Theory
Sociocultural Theory

Sociocultural Theory has a unique history. Russian-born Lev Semyonovich Vygotsky (1896-1934) was one of

the most notable theorists of his time. A remarkable and brilliant researcher and theoretician who died young,

Vygotsky has been called the "Mozart of psychology" (Toulmin, 1978). In his very short life (He died at the age

of 37 from tuberculosis), he received a law degree and studied literature, linguistics, sociology, psychology,

philosophy, and the arts. He is best known for his contribution to the understanding of the relationship between

the social world and cognitive development--specifically, his work focused on the significance of culture and

the role of language.

   Vygotsky's fundamental insight was that children         Vygotsky believed that language is
need social interaction with adults and older children to  what makes thought possible and is,
advance their psychological development. However, his
work was rejected in the Soviet Union under Joseph            thus, the basis of consciousness.

Stalin's leadership and was not released in the West

until decades after his death. In the latter part of the twentieth century, his theories became widely respected

and influential within the fields of developmental psychology, education, and child development, advancing

human understanding of how best to support the growth and development of children to reach their fullest

potential as mature human beings.

According to Vygotsky, children learn by internalizing the results of interactions with adults. The first

important concept he developed is the zone of proximal development (ZPD), referring to the difference

between a child's existing abilities and what he or she can learn under the guidance of an adult or a more

capable peer. In other words, it's the gap between what children are already able to do and what they are

not quite ready to accomplish by themselves. Vygotsky suggested that interactive learning with adults is most

effective in helping children cross this zone. According to Vygotsky, adults and more advanced peers must help

direct and organize a child's learning before the child can master and internalize it. This idea of a significant

adult guiding a child through the ZPD is known as scaffolding, or structuring learning encounters in order to

support and foster a child's emerging capabilities. Scaffolding can be provided in a few ways: in the form of a

mentor, by the use of objects or experiences, or by a child's past learning.

Vygotsky described human cognitive development as a "collaborative process," which means that the

learning process of individuals takes place through social interactions. Children acquire cognitive skills as part

of their orientation into a way of life. Shared activities help them internalize their society's modes of thinking

and behaving. Moreover, social interaction not only helps children remember. It may also even be the key to

memory formation. In addition to these ideas, Vygotsky also forwarded the notion that culture and community

play decisive roles in early development (Berk, 2017; Crain, 2011; Santrock, 2013).

Criticisms of Sociocultural Theory

One criticism is Vygotsky's view of active construction of knowledge. Some critics suggest that learning is not
always a result of active construction. Rather, learning can sometimes result passively.

   Another criticism is that Vygotsky's theory of language is not well-developed. Vygotsky, unfortunately, died
before he had a chance to fully develop his theories. His theories rely a lot on cultural influences, for it is
culture that helps to develop learners' language acquisition and cognitive development. Vygotsky believed
that very little language acquisition and cognitive development result from biological factors. However, some
psychologists dismiss the idea that cultural influences play a dominant role in the development of language.

                                                                                                                                                      Sociocultural Theory | 39
This lends credence to Piaget's view of cognitive development occurring in stages and children not being able
to learn some concepts until they reach a certain level of maturation.

   Perhaps the main criticism of Vygotsky's work concerns the assumption that it is relevant to all cultures. Some
dismiss the idea that Vygotsky's ideas are culturally universal and believe the concept of scaffolding, which is
heavily dependent on verbal instruction, may not be equally useful in all cultures and for all types of learning.
Indeed, in some instances, observation and practice may be more effective ways of learning certain skills.

Educational Implications

Although the social influences on cognitive development have been considered by other researchers, such as
Piaget and Bandura, Vygotsky emphasized that individual development is inherently integrated with cultural,
historical, and interpersonal factors, which is foundational to developmentally appropriate practice.

          Some general implications of Vygotsky's ideas can be summarized as
            · the central role of the teacher-student relationship in learning;
            · the inherent cultural and social influences on students' attitudes and beliefs
            · the importance and power of language as a primary tool for the transference of knowledge
                and thought
            · the benefits of a student-centered curriculum

         Think of scaffolding as providing training wheels for children. Training wheels provide just enough assistance to
         let the child be successful, until he/she is able to ride independently.

Humanistic Theory

Abraham Harold Maslow (1908-1970) has made a major contribution to teaching and classroom management
in schools. Humanistic theory is an approach to development that examines the "whole person"--taking into
consideration all aspects of human existence--and the uniqueness of all individuals. Maslow believed that
people are motivated to meet certain basic needs and that some needs take precedence over others. Our most
basic need is for physical survival, and this will be the first thing that motivates our behavior. Once that level
is fulfilled, the next level up is what motivates us, and so on. His theory is also called the Theory of Hierarchical
Needs and is often depicted as a pyramid with five distinct levels. Needs lower down in the hierarchy must
be satisfied before individuals can attend to needs higher up. From the bottom of the hierarchy upwards, the
needs are physiological, safety, love and belonging, esteem, and self-actualization.

   Maslow believed that while every person is capable and has the desire to move up the hierarchy toward a
level of self-actualization, unfortunately, progress is often disrupted by a failure to meet lower-level needs. Life
experiences, including divorce and the loss of a job, may cause an individual to fluctuate between levels of the
hierarchy. Therefore, not everyone will move through the hierarchy in a one-directional manner but may move
back and forth between the different types of needs, depending on each person's specific life circumstances.

   The first level of physiological needs is related to survival. These are biological requirements for human
sustenance (for example, air, food, drink, shelter, clothing, warmth, sex, and sleep.) The human body cannot
function normally if these needs are not satisfied. Maslow considered physiological needs the most important
as all the other needs become secondary until these needs are met.

   Safety needs appear when physiological needs are fulfilled. These include the need for structure and
predictability, protection from elements, security--physical and emotional, law and order, stability, and freedom
from fear. Reducing uncertainty is the chief objective at this stage. Individuals are free from danger, fear, and
chaos when their safety needs are adequately met.

   After physiological and safety needs have been fulfilled, the third level of human needs is social and involves
feelings of belongingness. The need for interpersonal relationships motivates behavior.

                                                                                                                                                        Humanistic Theory | 41
   Examples include friendship, intimacy, trust, acceptance, receiving and giving affection and love, affiliation,
or being part of a group (family, friends, work, etc.). In this stage, approval must come from earned respect, not
fame or social status.

   Maslow classified the next level, esteem needs, into two categories: esteem for oneself (for example, dignity,
achievement, mastery, and independence) and the desire for reputation or respect from others (for example,
status, and prestige). Maslow indicated that the need for respect or reputation is most important for children
and adolescents and precedes real self-esteem or dignity.

   If the previous needs are sufficiently met, a person now has the opportunity to reach self-
actualization--realizing personal potential, self-fulfillment, seeking personal growth and peak experiences-
the ability "to become everything one is capable of becoming" (Maslow, 1987, p. 64). Maslow believed this to
be an exceptional feat since it so rarely occurs. A person who reaches this stage strives for growth and self-
improvement--like Gandhi or Oprah.

   It is important to note that Maslow himself continued to refine his theory over several decades (Maslow,
1987), and proposed that the order in the hierarchy "is not nearly as rigid" (p. 68) as he may have implied in his
earlier description. Maslow also noted that the order of needs might be flexible based on external circumstances
or individual differences. For example, he notes that for some individuals, the need for self-esteem is more
important than the need for love. For others, the need for creative fulfillment may supersede even the most
basic needs.

   Maslow (1987) also pointed out that most behavior is multi-motivated and noted that "any behavior tends to
be determined by several or all of the basic needs simultaneously rather than by only one of them" (p. 71). His
revised model includes levels of:

  · Cognitive needs: knowledge and understanding, curiosity, exploration, need for meaning and
      predictability.

  · Aesthetic needs: appreciation and search for beauty, balance, form, etc.
  · Transcendence needs: A person is motivated by values which transcend the personal self (e.g., service to

      others, mystical experiences, religious faith, etc.)--like the Dalai Lama or the Pope (Berk, 2017; Crain, 2011;
      Santrock, 2013).

42 | Humanistic Theory
Educational Implications

Applications of Maslow's hierarchical needs theory to the work of the classroom teacher are obvious. Before a
student's cognitive needs can be met, they must first fulfill their basic physiological needs. For example, a tired
and hungry student will find it difficult to focus on learning. Students need to feel emotionally and physically
safe and accepted within the classroom to progress and reach their full potential. He suggests students must
be shown that they are valued and respected in the classroom and the teacher should create a supportive
environment. Students with low self-esteem will not progress academically at an optimal rate until their self-
esteem is strengthened.

Criticisms of Humanistic Theory

The most significant limitation of Maslow's theory concerns his methodology. He looked at the biographies and
writings of 18 people he identified as being self-actualized. From these sources, he developed a list of qualities
that seemed characteristic of this specific group of people, as opposed to humanity in general. From a scientific
perspective, there are numerous problems with this particular approach. First, it could be argued that this type
of analysis is extremely subjective, as it is based entirely on the opinion of the researcher. Therefore, Maslow's
operational definition of self-actualization must not be blindly accepted as scientific fact. Additionally, Maslow's
analysis focused on a biased sample of self-actualized individuals, limited to highly educated white males (such
as Thomas Jefferson, Abraham Lincoln, Albert Einstein, William James, Aldous Huxley, Beethoven).

   Although Maslow (1970) studied self-actualized females, such as Eleanor Roosevelt and Mother Teresa, they

                                                                                                                                                        Humanistic Theory | 43
comprised a small proportion of his sample; this makes it difficult to generalize his theory to females and
individuals from lower social classes or different ethnicities.

44 | Humanistic Theory
Ecological Theory

Also known as the Human Ecology Theory, Ecological Theory states that human development is influenced
by the different types of environmental systems. Formulated by famous psychologist Urie Bronfenbrenner
(1917-2005), this theory helps us understand why we may behave differently when we compare our behavior in
the presence of our family and our behavior when we are in school or at work. The ecological systems theory
holds that we encounter different environments throughout our lifespan that may influence our behavior in
varying degrees. These systems include the microsystem, the mesosystem, the exosystem, the macrosystem,
and the chronosystem, and are usually depicted by nesting spheres of influence.

   The microsystem is the setting in which we have direct social interactions with people and social agents.
Family, friends, classmates, teachers, neighbors and other people with whom we have direct contact are
included in the microsystem. The theory states that we are not simply recipients of experiences, rather we are
contributing to the construction of such environments; we have influence over the people and systems in our
lives, as they have influence over us.

   The mesosystem involves the relationships between the microsystems in one's life. This means that your
family experience may be related to your school experience. For example, if a child is neglected by his parents,

                                                                                                                                                          Ecological Theory | 45
he may have a low chance of developing a positive attitude toward his teachers. Also, this child may feel
awkward in the presence of peers and may resort to withdrawal from a group of classmates.

   The exosystem is a system of indirect influences and includes systems that have influence but are those with
which a child doesn't have any direct contact. For example, a parent who has been demoted at work may bring
home feelings of frustration or anger--the child may never have any interaction with the parent's boss, but that
boss may, nonetheless, have influence over how that parent interacts with the child. Ecological Theory

   The macrosystem setting is the actual culture of an individual. These cultural contexts include the
socioeconomic status of a child, his/her ethnicity or race, and the specific society in which a child lives.

   The chronosystem adds the dimension of time and includes the transitions and shifts in one's lifespan. One
classic example of this is how divorce, as a major life transition, may affect not only the couple's relationship but
also their children's behavior. According to the majority of research, children are negatively affected in the first
year after divorce. The next years after the divorce might reveal that the interaction within the family becomes
more stable and agreeable (Berk, 2017; Crain, 2011; Santrock, 2013).

Educational Implications

Bronfenbrenner looked at patterns of development across time as well as the interactions between the child
and the environment. The educational implications of his model include the social and political policies and
practices affecting children, families, and caregiving. As teachers and educators strive to become evidence-
based practitioners, the goal then becomes to identify those factors such as caregivers, family, peers, culture,
historical perspectives that influence students' learning and development.

   In that regard, Bronfenbrenner`s theory encourages much consideration of what constitutes supportive
interactions in fostering development. It goes beyond identifying what might influence development, and,
more importantly, assists in considering how and why it influences development. Furthermore,
Bronfenbrenner's theory also assists in considering how an interaction might be added or taken away or
improved to foster development and, especially, how a face-to-face interaction between a developing individual
and an agent within his or her environment might be changed. Although Bronfenbrenner's multi-system
model has value in identifying the resources that influence development, it is more likely of value in assisting
consideration of how those resources might be used. Inherent within this idea is the emphasis Bronfenbrenner
places on the understanding that interactions nearest to the child have the greatest influence on the
development of that child. The ecological systems theory has also become an important foundation for other
theorists' work. (Sincero, 2012)

Criticisms of Educational Theory

A criticism of Bronfenbrenner has been that the model focuses too much on the biological and cognitive
aspects of human development, but not much on the socio-emotional aspect of human development. A more
comprehensive view of human development, one with the domains of human development at the center, has
been developed. This ecological model is called the Integrated Ecological Systems Framework (Sincero, 2012).

Theory of Multiple Intelligences

Howard Gardner (1943- ) contends that previously accepted ideas of human intellectual capacity are all based
on the belief that intelligence is fixed throughout one's lifetime and that intelligence can be measured through
an individual's logical and language abilities. Gardner's theory challenges this traditional, narrow view of
intelligence. According to Gardner's theory, intelligence encompasses the ability to create and solve
problems,as well as create products or provide services that are valued within a culture or society. His original
theory proposed seven separate intelligences. He has since revised this thinking and has added an eighth
intelligence, and a proposed ninth intelligence that has yet to experience full acceptance. The nine intelligences
are Verbal/Linguistic, Logical/ Mathematical, Visual/Spatial, Bodily-Kinesthetic, Musical, Interpersonal,
Intrapersonal, Naturalistic, and Existential. Key tenets of Gardner's theory are

  · All human beings possess all nine intelligences in varying degrees.
  · Each individual has a different intelligence profile.
  · Education can be improved by assessment of students' intelligence profiles and designing activities

      accordingly.
  · Each intelligence occupies a different area of the brain.
  · The nine intelligences may operate in consort or independently from one another.
  · These nine intelligences may define the human species (Armstrong, 2018; Gardner, 1999; Gardner, 2006).

The Nine Intelligences

Verbal/Linguistic intelligence refers to an individual's ability to understand and manipulate words and
languages. Everyone is thought to possess this intelligence at some level. This includes reading, writing,
speaking, and other forms of verbal and written communication. Traditionally, linguistic intelligence and logical/
mathematical intelligence have been highly valued in education and learning environments.

   Logical/Mathematical intelligence refers to an individual's ability to do things with data: collect and organize,
analyze and interpret, conclude and predict. Individuals strong in this intelligence see patterns and
relationships. These individuals are oriented toward thinking: inductive and deductive logic, numeration, and
abstract patterns. This is the kind of intelligence studied and documented by Piaget.

   Visual/Spatial intelligence refers to the ability to form and manipulate a mental model. Individuals with
strength in this area depend on visual thinking and are very imaginative. People with this kind of intelligence
tend to learn most readily from visual presentations such as movies, pictures, videos, and demonstrations using
models and props. They like to draw, paint, or sculpt their ideas and often express their feelings and moods
through art. These individuals often daydream, imagine and pretend.

   Bodily/Kinesthetic intelligence refers to people who process information through the sensations they feel in
their bodies. These people like to move around, touch the people they are talking to and act things out. They
are good at small and large muscle skills; they enjoy all types of sports and physical activities. They often express
themselves through dance.

48 | Other Contemporary Theories to Consider
   Musical intelligence refers to the ability to understand, create, and interpret musical rhythm and tones, and
the capability to compose music. Composers and instrumentalists are individuals with strength in this area.

   Interpersonal Although Gardner classifies interpersonal and intrapersonal intelligences separately, there is a
lot of interplay between the two, and they are often grouped together. Interpersonal intelligence is the ability
to interpret and respond to the moods, emotions, motivations, and actions of others. Interpersonal intelligence
also requires good communication and interaction skills, and the ability to show empathy toward the feelings
of other individuals. Counselors and social workers are professionals that require strength in this area.

   Intrapersonal intelligence, simply put, is the ability to know oneself. It is an internalized version of
interpersonal intelligence. To exhibit strength in intrapersonal intelligence, an individual must be able to
understand their own emotions, and motivations, and be aware of their own strengths and weaknesses. It's
important to note that this intelligence involves the use of all others.

   Naturalistic intelligence describes the ability to both identify and distinguish between different types of
things found in the natural world. Naturalistic thinkers are people who value order and notice relationships and
patterns.

   Existential Intelligence encompasses the ability to pose and ponder questions regarding
existence--including life and death. This would be in the domain of philosophers and religious leaders
(Armstrong, 2018; Gardner, 1999; Gardner, 2006).

                                                                                                                     Other Contemporary Theories to Consider | 49
          Although Gardner's theory was not originally designed for use in a classroom application, it has
       been widely embraced by educators and enjoyed numerous adaptations in a variety of educational
       settings. Teachers have always known that students had different strengths and weaknesses in the
       classroom. Gardner's research was able to articulate that and provide direction as to how to improve
       a student's ability in any given intelligence.

Bloom's Taxonomy

Benjamin Bloom (1913-1999) was an influential psychological researcher and child activist. In 1956, Bloom,
with collaborators Max Englehart, Edward Furst, Walter Hill, and David Krathwohl, published a framework
for categorizing educational goals: The Taxonomy of Educational Objectives. Familiarly known as Bloom's
Taxonomy, this framework has been applied by generations of K-12 teachers and college instructors in their
teaching.

   The framework devised by Bloom and his collaborators consisted of six major categories of goals, in order of
complexity: Knowledge, Comprehension, Application, Analysis, Synthesis, and Evaluation. Those categories after
Knowledge were presented as "skills and abilities," with the understanding that knowledge was the necessary
precondition for putting these skills and abilities into practice.

   In 2001, a group of cognitive psychologists, curriculum theorists, instructional researchers, and testing and
assessment specialists published a revision of Bloom's Taxonomy with the title A Taxonomy for Teaching,
Learning, and Assessment. This title draws attention away from the somewhat static notion of "educational
objectives" (in Bloom's original title) and points to a more dynamic conception of the classifications of critical
thinking. The authors of the revised taxonomy underscore this dynamism, using verbs to label their categories
and subcategories (rather than the nouns of the original taxonomy). These "action words" describe the cognitive
processes by which thinkers encounter and work with knowledge:

50 | Other Contemporary Theories to Consider
The following chart lists verbs for student objective at each of Bloom's levels. Educators often find it helpful to use such a
chart to be sure that they are both focusing their lessons, as well as targeting a variety of levels when planning lessons. This
chart can be particularly useful in differentiation instruction for the varied needs of learners. It is important to keep in mind
that children of nearly any age are capable of functioning at each level, as long as they are provided with the proper
support to help scaffold their learning. Notice that some verbs can be applied to more than one level, depending on how
the lesson is structured.

Mindset Theory

The concept of Mindset Theory was developed by psychologist Carol Dweck (1946- ) and popularized in her
book, Mindset: The New Psychology of Success (2016). In recent years, many schools and educators have started
using Dweck's theories to inform how they teach students.

   A mindset, according to Dweck, is a self-perception or self-theory that people hold about themselves.
Believing that you are either intelligent or unintelligent is a simple example of a mindset. People may also have
a mindset related to their personal or professional lives-- "I'm a good teacher" or "I'm a bad parent," for example.
People can be aware or unaware of their mindsets, according to Dweck, but they can have a profound effect on
learning achievement, skill acquisition, personal relationships, professional success, and many other dimensions
of life.

   Dweck's educational work centers on the distinction between a fixed mindset and growth mindset.
According to Dweck, in a fixed mindset, people believe their basic qualities, like their intelligence or talent, are
simply fixed traits. They spend their time documenting their intelligence or talent instead of developing them.
They also believe that talent alone creates success--without effort. Dweck's research suggests that students
who have adopted a fixed mindset believe that they are either smart or dumb, and there is no way to change
this. For example, they may learn less than they could or learn at a slower rate, while also shying away from
challenges, since poor performance might either confirm they can't learn if they believe they are dumb or
indicate that they are less intelligent than they think if they believe they are smart. Dweck's findings also
suggest that when students with fixed mindsets fail at something, as they inevitably will, they tend to tell
themselves they can't or won't be able to do it ("I just can't learn Algebra"), or they make excuses to rationalize
the failure ("I would have passed the test if I had had more time to study").

   Alternatively, in a growth mindset, people believe that their most basic abilities can be developed through
dedication and hard work--brains and talent are just the starting point. This view creates a love of learning and
a resilience that is essential for great accomplishment. Students who embrace growth mindsets--the belief

                                                                                                                      Other Contemporary Theories to Consider | 51
that they can learn more or become smarter if they work hard and persevere--may learn more, learn it more
quickly, and view challenges and failures as opportunities to improve their learning and skills.

   Dweck's delineation of fixed and growth mindsets has potentially far-reaching implications for schools and
teachers since the ways in which students think about learning, intelligence, and their own abilities can have a
significant effect on learning progress and academic improvement. If teachers encourage students to believe
that they can learn more and become smarter if they work hard and practice, Dweck's findings suggest, it is
more likely that students will, in fact, learn more, and learn it faster and more thoroughly than if they believe
that learning is not determined by how intelligent or unintelligent they are. Her work has also shown that
a growth mindset can be intentionally taught to students. Teachers might, for example, intentionally praise
student effort and perseverance instead of ascribing learning achievements to innate qualities or talents (for
example, giving feedback such as "You must have worked very hard" rather than "You are so smart."

          Read more about mindset in Christine Gross-Loh's interview with Dweck for the Atlantic, titled
       Don't Let Praise Become the Consolation Prize. In the interview, Dweck clarifies some common
       misconceptions which are often made. The interview can be found by following this link:

CHAPTER THREE: DOMAINS IN
DEVELOPMENT

     After completing Chapter Three students will be able to:

          · Describe the two major themes of child development: nature vs. nurture and continuity vs.
             discontinuity

          · Define the four domains of development

When studying development, there is a lot to learn! As you read in Chapter 1, Child Development can be
approached in a number of ways: time, domains, theorists, themes, cultural perspectives, and appropriate
practice. Chapter 2 helped you to understand the theoretical perspectives, and most of the other chapters in
this textbook will tackle time, cultural perspectives, and appropriate practice. Here, we are going to take a closer
look at the four domains of development, and how they are related to the themes of "nature versus nurture"
and "continuity versus discontinuity."

   In Chapter 1, you read briefly about four domains of children's development that we will discuss in this
textbook: physical/biological, cognitive, social, and emotional. Before we start, it is important to recognize that
other authors may separate development into more or less than four domains. For example, in other textbooks,
you may see social and emotional development combined into a single domain; other sources identify as many
as seven individual domains. In this textbook, you will read about four domains; we, the authors, chose these
four because we feel they best represent the major areas that educators, psychologists, and researchers agree
on. Plus, without too many distinctions between domains, we will be able to better explain how the domains
are interconnected.

                                                                                                                       Chapter Three: Domains in Development | 53
54 | Chapter Three: Domains in Development
Themes of Development

Before exploring the four domains, let's take a moment to review the two major themes of Child Development.

Nature versus Nurture

As you read in Chapter 1, developmental psychologists have gone back and forth about what drives growth
and change in children. Is it the environment (nurture) or is it built-in (nature)? A nurture-based perspective
would argue that children are wholly influenced by the world around them, including the physical, social,
and educational environments. On the other hand, a nature-based theory would state that children grow and
change based on their genetic code, and there is little if anything that can be done to change that from the
outside world.

   By now, you have probably come to realize that both perspectives are correct, in their own way. There are
certainly aspects of development that are influenced by the environment, but there are just as many things
that are genetically determined. Language is a fantastic example of this: the environment determines which
language or languages a child speaks, but there are important biological factors that ensure a child CAN speak
a language. For many aspects of child development, nature and nurture cannot be separated.

Continuity versus Discontinuity

In Chapter 1, you also learned that psychologists debate whether development occurs in a continuous or a
discontinuous manner. Some theories, such as Erikson's psychosocial model, explain development in stages;
this is an example of a discontinuous theory and is often visually represented as a staircase. A child needs to
"step up" to the next stage. Just like when you yourself walk up a set of stairs, it is not your whole body moving
- you have to go one leg at a time and that is "discontinuous." In terms of what discontinuous development
actually looks like, imagine the difference between an infant who cannot walk and a toddler who can. These are
two distinct stages and you can literally observe when a child moves from one to the other. A baby's first steps
are a huge developmental milestone that moves them from infant to toddler!

   On the other hand, continuous development can be seen in models such as Vygotsky's sociocultural theory.
Continuous theories do not make clear distinctions between stages or phases. Instead of a staircase, you could
imagine continuous development like a ramp. Over time, you can tell that a child has moved up along the ramp,
but the small changes along the way can be hard to see. A great deal of physical development is continuous;
children grow and change over time, but often that change is only easy to see when you look at the difference
over months, rather than over days. Going back to Vygotsky's theory, the concept of the Zone of Proximal
Development is an example of continuous development; through interaction with others, children gradually
change their level of ability relative to a task.

Universal versus Individual Development

Within each domain of development, there will be things which are universal, meaning they happen to all

                                                                                                                                               Themes of Development | 55
children and things that are individual, meaning they may or may not happen to any particular child. Very
little about child development - or any development for that matter - is universal, but there are a few things
that happen to almost all children, regardless of geographical location, race, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, or
culture. In each section, there will be an example of something that is universal, to help you think about how
little of development is the same for every child!

Development versus Growth

When discussing physical development, it is sometimes difficult to separate the concepts of "development" and
"growth." In everyday language, we typically use the word "develop" to mean the same as grow, improve, or get
bigger. However, in psychology we use the word "development" whenever we are talking about change of any
kind; it may or may not have to do with an increase, and there are plenty of examples from adult development
where the concept actually refers to a decline or loss of something. In this section, and throughout the textbook,
we will be discussing child development. Since children are at the beginning of their lifespan, nearly all of their
development is a gain of some sort: they grow bigger, they learn language, they improve their social skills.
Physical development is no different, but there are a few exceptions, which we will get to. So, as you read this
section and move through the textbook learning about physical development in children, keep in mind that
some of that development will mean physical growth, but some of it will refer to invisible processes and could
include losses and declines.

   As you read more about the domains of development, try to pay attention to aspects that may develop
continuously or discontinuously; look for aspects of development that may be more or less influenced by nature
or nurture.

56 | Themes of Development
The Four Domains of Development

As you just learned, there are many domains in which children develop from infancy through school age. For
this chapter, we are going to discuss four overarching domains: physical, cognitive, social, and emotional. The
physical domain has to do with growth and changes in the body; the cognitive domain includes the functions
of the brain, intelligence, and language; the social domain looks at how children develop skills for managing
interactions with others; and the emotional domain covers internal states, such as feelings and personality.

                                                                                                                                The Four Domains of Development | 57
Physical/Biological Development

Of all the domains of development, physical development is the most obvious and possibly easiest to measure
with modern medical techniques. Some aspects of physical development are universal, biological processes
that all children experience, but there is a great deal of variation. For example, most children get taller and
stronger as they grow, but the range of what is "normal" is vast, and can be influenced by a range of factors
including nutrition, genetics, and experience. Here we will look at physical development such as changes in
children's height and weight, the development of gross and fine motor skills, and losing teeth.

Height and Weight

Typically, children grow physically larger in two ways: they get taller and they get heavier. It is considered
normal, healthy development if these two things increase in ratio to one another; as height increases, so should
weight. Often, we think of weight as being how much fat we are carrying around, but most of the human body
is made up of other things which weigh a lot!

   As children grow, their height and weight are increasing because their bones are increasing in both size and
density. On top of those bones are muscles, which are connected by ligaments and tendons. Internal organs,
such as the lungs and heart, are also growing as they have more space to fill inside the ribcage. Throughout the
body there are veins, arteries, and capillaries; all of these help to move fluid around for transporting nutrients
and gases.

   If you have ever sat in the doctor's waiting room, perhaps you have noticed a chart on the wall that indicates
a "normal" weight range according to your height and age. Although these charts become less helpful in
adulthood, for infants and young children they can be a quick way to determine if a child is physically
developing along a normal trajectory.

   The chart below is one example that shows the normal distribution for the weight of a fetus during gestation
up to 46 weeks.

                                                                                         If you pay attention to the percentages on the far
                                                                                      right side, you might notice that "normal" is a big
                                                                                      range - 80% variance! This is because physical
                                                                                      development - like most forms of development - can
                                                                                      be widely varied across individuals yet still within a
                                                                                      range that is considered healthy. Even at the 10th
                                                                                      percentile, weight is considered appropriate; it is not
                                                                                      unless the fetus weighs less than 2500 grams at term
                                                                                      that the baby is considered low birth-weight (LBW).

                                                                                         This image also indicates when and how much
                                                                                      growth should increase over the span of gestation. As
                                                                                      you can see from the two dark lines, a normally

                                                                                      duration of gestation, and then that growth should
                                                                                      taper off around week 42.

                                                                                         Throughout the chapters of this book, you will
                                                                                      encounter additional charts and diagrams similar to
                                                                                      this one which indicate the typical pattern of growth

58 | Physical/Biological Development
for children from infancy through age 8. As you read through each chapter, keep these things in mind about
the development of height and weight across childhood:

 1. There is a wide range of variance within what is considered "normal" development. Children come in all
      sizes, and grow at different rates depending on a range of biological and environmental factors.

2. Not every scale is going to be the same in a depiction of growth, so pay careful attention to the numbers
      on the outside of the graph, which will help you to understand what is being measured. Some charts,
      such as this one, are considering weight compared to week of gestation. After birth, these variables may
      change to include length (for infants), height, weight, age (in days, weeks, months, or years), or possibly
      Body Mass Index (BMI).

Gross and Fine Motor Skills

Gross motor movements are those associated with the large muscles of the body: arms, legs, torso, etc. while
fine motor skills are those completed with the smaller muscles such as those in your hands and fingers.

   As you will read in an upcoming chapter, control of your body depends on a good connection throughout your
central nervous system (CNS). At birth, infants' are still developing, and there is not yet a strong signal between
the brain and the muscles. Additionally, in the compact environment of the womb, the fetus did not have much
opportunity to stretch or strengthen muscles. For the first few months of life, the infant will be developing the
brain-body coordination and basic muscle control necessary for both gross and fine motor skills. Once that
foundation is set, however, physical development moves forward rapidly! At birth, infants cannot move on their
own and yet by age 8 a child is able to walk, run, jump, and skip which takes an enormous amount of muscular
strength and control!

   Fine motor skills take more time to develop than gross motor skills, because the smaller muscles of the body
are generally more difficult to learn to control. While it is relatively easy to learn how to control a whole limb
in space, it can be challenging to figure out how to work the tiny digits at the end of your arm! Have you ever
tried to manipulate something very small, and found that it was hard to get your fingers to cooperate? Tiny
movements, such as picking up a Cheerio in a pincer grip, or controlling the movement of your tongue in the
back of your mouth to distinguish between /ch/ and /ch/ requires an enormous amount of control. This only
comes with practice, which allows both the brain and the muscles to become familiar with the movement.

   Throughout the chapters of this book which detail each stage of early childhood (infancy, toddlerhood,
preschool age, and school age), you will read in more detail about the specific milestones for physical
development associated with each age.

Universals in Physical Development

Although there are always exceptions to every rule when it comes to human development, most of us are born
without teeth, and then throughout our childhood we grow and lose one set before our adult teeth come
in. Teeth are not the only universal physical development, but they might be the weirdest! Have you ever
wondered where those teeth come from, and why we lose our baby teeth?

   As it turns out, we are born with all of our teeth; they are simply embedded in our skull until it is time for them
to emerge! Most babies are born without any teeth (although neonatal and natal teeth are a thing!). The most
common explanation for this is simply that in general human babies are born very early compared to every
other mammal species; they are simply too young to have their teeth erupt yet. Human infants are born at a

                                                                                                                                   Physical/Biological Development | 59
point at which they are most likely to survive, but are not yet so large that they will get stuck in the birth canal.
To make that happen, the head can only be so large, and that includes the bones of the jaw.

   In utero, the teeth themselves have formed, along with the bones of the skull. Check out the exceptionally
creepy picture to the right - that is what a child's skull looks like under an x-ray! In this picture, the first set of
teeth have already erupted, but the "adult teeth" are still embedded in the upper and lower jaw bones.

   After birth, it takes approximately 6 months before the first set of "baby teeth" will start to come through
the gums. In the meantime, most infants are able to "chew" soft foods without issue. Teeth are not essential
for eating but do increase the range of foods that an infant can manage. Children keep this first set of teeth
for somewhere between 5-7 years, depending on their rate of growth, and their overall health. These teeth are
smaller simply because they must fit within the small jawbone of the baby. As a child's skeletal structure grows,
it creates more space for the teeth and actually widens the opening where new teeth can come in. Teeth start
to feel loose when the socket they sit in starts to widen; when it becomes too large, the baby tooth will fall out
and the adult tooth can move in.

   Remember, although we have discussed this as a universal piece of development, there are going to be
exceptions. Some children do not develop teeth, or their teeth are problematic for some reason. Like
everything, the environment can affect dental development. Anything that can influence how the skeleton
develops can also impact the teeth. Additionally, oral hygiene in toddlers and young children can impact dental
and cardiovascular health throughout life.

Cognitive Development

Cognition is the word psychologists use to describe the varied mental activities of your brain. Cognitive
development, therefore, is the development of the processes of memory, intelligence, and attention.
Additionally, language is usually described and measured as a cognitive process although it is connected to
physical, social, and emotional development in important ways. Here, you will learn a bit about each one, and
each chapter will provide more in-depth information.

Memory

In the next chapter on brain development, you will learn more about the physical mechanisms that create
memories, but for now, it is enough to know that within your brain are millions of neurons, and many of them
are designed especially to store memories.

   Memory is essential for navigating the world around us because it allows us to store vital information from
past experiences, and things that other people have taught us. We know facts (semantic memory); we have
experiences (episodic memory); we know how to do things (procedural memory); and we even remember
things that haven't happened yet (prospective memory) such as what you need to buy at the grocery store
tomorrow.

   You have two kinds of memory: short-term memory and long-term memory. Working memory is an aspect
of short -term memory. It is everything you are actively thinking about; long-term memory is everything you
know but aren't necessarily thinking about right away. Working memory has a very limited amount of space;
as children develop the amount increases but even in adulthood, most people can only remember about seven
distinct pieces of information. Our long-term memory, on the other hand, is extensive and we are able to store
and recall a seemingly endless amount of information.

   So, if our working memory is so amazing, why can't we remember being a baby! After all, that is when we
were learning new things all the time, and our brain wasn't cluttered with a lifetime of memories yet! There are a
couple of possible answers to that question, but most evidence suggests that those early memories simply get
buried as life continues to happen (Sneed, 2014) https://science.howstuffworks.com/life/inside-the-mind/why-
not-remember-babies.htm

Intelligence

What does it mean to you when you hear the word intelligence? Perhaps you thought of "school smarts" - being
good at particular academic subjects, for example. Or maybe you thought first of "street smarts" - having good
common sense, and being able to get along in the "real world." Some people think of Emotional Intelligence,
which is the ability to understand your own and other people's feelings.

   All of these things are right! Intelligence is both a cognitive and a social construct. This means that while
there are very real mental processes that are related to intelligence, what gets valued or measured might differ
among cultural groups.

   Intelligence is typically measured on a number of scales, that when added together provide a numerical
representation of general cognitive ability: the IQ score. Typically, IQ is assessed once children reach school age,
Cognitive Development

                                                                                                                                                 Cognitive Development | 61
   and so you will read more about IQ testing and alternative ways to understand intelligence in later chapters.
For now, let's quickly review the scales that are used for measuring intelligence:

  · Working memory: how much information can be retained and recalled;
  · Processing speed: how quickly information is used to generate an action or decision
  · Visual-spatial processing: how accurately a person can create a 3D representation of a 2D image (typically

      done with building blocks)
  · Language use, both productive and receptive
  · Mathematical reasoning

These are the underlying cognitive processes that are assumed to give rise to intelligence, but they are all just
approximations of the kind of mental tasks that people do every day as they interact with the world around
them (Bee & Boys, 2009; Berk, 2017). Intelligence is more than these processes; it is the behaviors and choices
that come from having these processes working efficiently behind the scenes.

   In real life, intelligence tends to look more like problem-solving, critical thinking, and creativity. You are
probably familiar with the concept of critical thinking because it is a major focus in school in recent years. How
often do you hear about creative thinking, though? Creativity is a significant factor in the cognitive ability of
young children, and it is only once formal schooling starts that creativity tends to take a backseat to critical
thinking.

   Creativity allows children to manipulate objects or ideas in ways that are not necessarily their intended use.
Sometimes we talk about "thinking outside the box", and perhaps you have done a lateral thinking task. These
are other ways to talk about creativity. But most of the time, we see evidence of creativity in the ways that
children play: f`or example, using a hairbrush as a microphone, or turning a few household items into a fort.

   It is important to note that creativity is more than just calling something by another name. Creativity's
products are useful and fill a need or gap. In pretend play, that means standing in for an object that is not
available which allows the game to continue. In later life, it means being able to see potential solutions to
problems that no one else has seen yet.

   Previously in this book, you learned about intelligence, as well as different ways that intelligence has been
defined to be more inclusive than just what is taught in school. Gardner's theory of Multiple Intelligences is
one example that is used frequently in schools. As you read, think about the ways in which you are intelligent,
and what that tells you about how your brain works. Do you learn quickly or prefer lots of repetition? Are things
easier for you when you do them yourself or do you like to watch videos of others trying things, so you know
how it is done? Are there certain school subjects you are more drawn to or do you think you put more cognitive
effort into the things you learn on your own time? There is no one way to be intelligent! One of the best parts of
working with young children is that no one has ever told them how to be smart, so they engage with the world
in ways that make sense to them, which gives adults such as caregivers and teachers a unique view into their
true cognitive processes.

Language

Language is generally considered a part of the cognitive domain of development, as it is closely tied to the ways
in which children process information about the world around them and how they share their thoughts with
others. Throughout this textbook, you will read more about how language develops at specific life stages, but
here let's briefly look at the importance of having spoken and written language in the first place.

   Language is one of the first cognitive tasks that an infant's brain tries to tackle, even before the physical
structures of the mouth, teeth, and tongue are coordinated enough for babies to talk. Starting shortly after

62 | Cognitive Development
birth, infants show more interest in language sounds than in other ambient noises, such as barking dogs
and the vacuum cleaner. Babies babble endlessly, practicing the language sounds they hear around them. As
children grow, their language use becomes increasingly mature until they are able to pronounce words, make
long sentences, and use language to get their way!

   Language is special in that it is more than a cognitive process. Of course, there are certain areas of the
temporal lobe that are specially designed to process and create language, but those areas - like all areas of the
brain - need input to fully develop. That means that in order to learn language, we need other people to talk to!
Our social and emotional interactions are mediated through language, and we actively teach children to "use
your words" to help navigate conflicts and express their feelings.

   Language is also an important way for parents, caregivers, and teachers to understand the internal states
of children. In infancy, it can be frustrating for parents as they try to decipher the meaning behind an infant's
crying; is the baby hungry or tired or wet? As children develop language, this frustration is eased because the
children can tell their parents exactly what is wrong and that allows the parent to ease the child's discomfort
that much more quickly. For a long time, parents had to wait well into their baby's second year of life to gain
access to these inner thoughts, but in recent years there has been a push to teach infants sign language. As it
turns out, infants often can understand language long before they can speak it, meaning they can respond to
direct requests from parents and caregivers, such as "Do you need a bottle?" Infants can also produce thoughts
that express their desires long before they can give them voice; infants can use sign language to answer "Yes,
bottle!" enthusiastically, or "No, no more" if they are done. This helps strengthen the parent-child bond because
it removes the guessing game and frustration of not being able to communicate.

   Of course, as children learn to talk and share their inner thoughts, they also learn how to influence the inner
thoughts of others through language.

An Interesting Example of Cognitive Development: Lying

It may seem counterintuitive, but telling a lie is a major developmental step in the domain of cognition! Let's
take a quick look at what mental processes are necessary for lying, and why that ability is an indicator of
successful development.

   To tell a lie requires that the liar is able to hold multiple stories in working memory, as well as consider the
knowledge available to each person who will hear the lie. Additionally, the liar has to be able to consider the
range of possible outcomes and consequences of the behavior. Let's try to pick this apart with an example.

   Sammy has been told to go brush his teeth, but when he gets upstairs he gets distracted by a toy and starts
to play with that instead. When his father comes up a few minutes later, he asks Sammy, "Did you brush your
teeth?" Before Sammy says "yes!" there are several things that happen in his mind.

   First, Sammy has to consider what is actually true (he did not brush his teeth), and whether or not his father
has access to that information (no, because he was downstairs and could not see what Sammy was doing the
whole time). This means Sammy is actively processing his experience and his father's experience, and drawing
a conclusion about what is different.

   Second, Sammy has to consider past experiences with this exact situation. Is this the first time he has
forgotten to brush his teeth, or the 20th? If it is the first, Dad is not expecting him to have forgotten, but if
Sammy always forgets, then he has to consider that Dad is expecting him to have forgotten. So now Sammy is
adding relevant episodic memory to his working memory stores.

   Third, Sammy has to consider the possibility of either a truthful or a dishonest answer. If he tells the truth,
will he get in trouble? If he lies, will Dad know? So now Sammy is working with knowledge of the present from
two perspectives, knowledge of the past, and knowledge of the future all at the same time. It requires a ton of
cognitive flexibility (Santrock, 2013).

                                                                                                                                                 Cognitive Development | 63
   It is worth it to mention here that this cognitive flexibility is by far the hardest and most risky part of
learning how to tell a good lie, and the place where most young children (and teens!) go wrong. As our brains
develop, one of the executive functions that has to slowly develop is the ability to anticipate all the potential
consequences of an action, how likely each is to occur, and what the cost of each might be. Typically, we are
not masters of this until our midtwenties, so it's reasonable to expect that Sammy might not be right in his
assessment of this situation!

   Admittedly, at first, children are not always great at this, which is why parents and caregivers often know
when young children are lying. Also, there are very real social and emotional aspects of lying that need to be
addressed with young children. But, from a purely cognitive perspective, when children begin to tell lies, it is a
significant cognitive milestone.

   Social and emotional development are often combined into a single domain, social-emotional development.
For this textbook, we will consider the two domains separately, although they are very closely related. However,
picking them apart will allow us to have a deeper discussion about each, so that we can look at a few key
concepts that have become important in the study of Child Development and Early Childhood Education
recently.

64 | Cognitive Development
Social Development

As we talk about social development, you will be reading mainly about how children develop their social
interactions with other people, from infancy through age 8.

Friendship in Early Childhood

When you hear the term "social development", what do
you think of? A lot of people think first of friends - the
people who we are social with. Friends and friendship are
essential to healthy emotional and physical development
in childhood.

   In infancy, friendship is about exposure that parents and
other caregivers orchestrate. Infants are often curious
about other babies, and typically will play with anyone they
are put down next to. However, infants lack the social
knowledge or language ability to navigate these
interactions the way that older child do; infant "friendship"
is really more of being in the same place at the same time than it is about an emotional bond.

   For example, infants playing together often explore their environment without any coordinated effort. If you
have ever watched two babies playing, you may have noticed that their play is very individual and typically
focused on an object that one or both of them wish to control. When babies interact, their play is often very
exploratory as well. They smile at one another and react positively when they get a smile in return. They may
touch each other, and it is common for babies to babble to one another in a conversational pattern. These
behaviors all demonstrate the first steps towards understanding social interactions and what the range of
possibilities are.

   As children mature into toddlerhood, their friendships start to become more about one another although
the ways in which children meet and the types of interactions they have are still very different from what you
experience as an adult. Once a baby becomes mobile, she is no longer stuck playing with the baby next to her;
she can get up and walk away, and find someone else to play with. However, she still is limited to playing with
the other children who are in her immediate environment - whether that is home, day care, or a playdate.

                                           As children begin preschool and then K-12 schooling, they are exposed to a much
                                        wider range of peers with whom to form friendships. In this exposure to new
                                        environments, children learn to manage social interactions and learn about people
                                        with different backgrounds, languages, and ideas. Meeting new people who don't
                                        look like them is an important piece of social development for young children. It
                                        helps them to understand that not everyone thinks the same things, and that each
                                        one of us is an individual. It also plays an important role in helping children to
                                        understand which characteristics about themselves are changeable (cutting your
                                        hair, for example), and which are not (racial identity).

                                                                                                                                                      Social Development | 65
Theory of Mind

One example of where domains overlap is in the development of Theory of Mind. This ability is based on factors
of cognitive development but allows children to have a wider range of social interactions.

   Theory of Mind is, in the most simple terms, the ability to understand that what is in your mind is different
from what other people have in their mind. It means understanding that your thoughts are private and that
unless you share them through some means, such as language, other people do not have access to them. It
also means understanding that you can think about your own point of view and another person's point of view
simultaneously, and are able to separate what you know / are thinking from what they know / are thinking. It
helps children to move from seeing the world as true/false and come to understand that there are shades of
gray everywhere.

   It might be easiest to understand this concept if we use a scenario:

       Susie's mother gives her a chocolate bar as a snack. Susie eats a few squares, then wraps it back up and
       puts it in the refrigerator. Then, she goes outside to play.

          While she is outside, her mother is making chocolate chip cookies but realizes that she doesn't have
       enough chocolate chips. She gets the chocolate bar from the refrigerator, and uses all of it in the cookies.
       When Susie comes back inside from playing, she looks for her chocolate bar. Where does she look?

Because you have a fully developed Theory of Mind, you know that Susie will look in the refrigerator, where she
left her chocolate bar before going outside. Since she was gone, there is no way for her to know that her mother
took it out and used it all.

   When this task is given to very young children, younger than 4, they typically will say that Susie will not
look in the refrigerator, because the chocolate isn't there anymore. Prior to the development of Theory of
Mind, children treat all knowledge as universal: everyone knows the same thing. However, as they have more
experience with social interactions, they will come to understand that is not true. This becomes essential for
negotiating social interactions that involve the transmission of information and may require one person to
make calculated choices about how much information to share with the other person: for example, knowing
when you need to give extra information about context for someone to understand your story, or knowing when
it is better not to share something that you shouldn't know, or that might upset someone else!

   Going back to our discussion of lying, Theory of Mind can be related to children's ability to tell lies and play
tricks on people; the cognitive ability to hold multiple perspectives in mind simultaneously comes from Theory
of Mind, and allows behaviors such as hiding things and other jokes that require one person to have more
information than another (Crain, 2011).

66 | Social Development
Emotional Development

Social interactions help babies and children to gain important information about how their actions influence
other people, including the feelings of others. This, in turn, can help children to understand their own feelings
and learn how to manage them. Emotional development, however, is not purely a function of nurture.
Important structures of the brain related to emotional regulation, attention, and self-regulation are actively
developing throughout childhood and into adolescence. This means that emotional development may be a
slow process that continues well into school-age.

   In early language development, the conversational pattern between infant and caregiver contains not only
phonological information, but also non-verbal information such as tone of voice, facial expressions, and body
language. These all provide clues about internal emotional states, onto which get mapped specific words that
describe those emotions.

   There are only a few universal emotions, and they are the ones we see almost immediately in babies: sadness,
fear, happiness, disgust, anger, and surprise. Infants are limited in how they can express these emotions, so
they mostly cry. However, it does not take long before babies and toddler, develop a wider range of emotional
behaviors. Fear may be expressed in tears, by hiding, or in issues with control of the bowel and bladder. Surprise
may provoke fear or happiness, depending on the child's temperament and the situation. Sadness and anger
sometimes get wrapped up together in a temper tantrum when a toddler doesn't get her way.

   As children grow, they become better able to describe and respond to their own emotions and the emotions
of others. Even babies and toddlers can display empathy when they realize a peer is sad or afraid. Empathy
and emotional intelligence are an important piece of moral development: the process by which children
understand right from wrong, and how their actions influence the well-being of others. Kohlberg's theory of
moral development is a beautiful example of a stage theory in which children move from having a very limited,
internal focus to understanding that emotions and actions can impact everyone.

   As you can read in this chart, as individuals grow from infancy to adulthood, their sense of morality also
develops. In early childhood, most children's morality is defined by adults around them, and avoiding
punishment or gaining rewards (both internal objectives) are the driving force behind moral behavior. Not until
later in life do we start to make moral choices based on people other than ourselves.

                                                                                                                                               Emotional Development | 67
Self-Regulation

If you have ever been intensely happy or sad, you know that feelings are more than just emotional states: they
also exist in our body as sensory experiences, and impact the way we interact with the people around us. In
early childhood, emotions can be intense and confusing for infants and babies. They are not able to cognitively
process the causes of their feelings, they just know that things are happening, and they cannot control them.

   Self-regulation is the ability to identify your emotions, understand what is causing them and how they are
impacting your behavior, and taking steps to manage what is happening because of your emotions. In children,
this takes several years - often well into adolescence - before they are able to do this consistently. For early
childhood educators, helping children to learn words for their feelings and teaching strategies for helping
children manage their emotions in healthy ways is important.

68 | Emotional Development
Emotional Development

Have you ever seen the movie Inside Out? It is a great representation of the "life" of
our emotions inside our body! Perhaps you noticed in this movie that the emotions
of the main character, who is a school-age girl, are much more dramatic than the
emotions of her parents. This is exactly how our emotions operate! In children,
feelings are intense and often cause problems without meaning to - just like Joy and
the other emotions do in Inside Out. As we grow up, our emotions mature as well,
and as adults we are much better at managing how we feel, and what we do to
manage those feelings.

CHAPTER FOUR: BRAIN DEVELOPMENT
FROM CONCEPTION TO AGE 8

     After completing Chapter Four students will be able to:

          · Identify the primary functions of the major areas of the brain
          · Identify the primary functions of neurons
          · Discuss the normal development of fetal brains
          · Identify the six neural processes of development: cell proliferation: cell differentiation, cell

             migration, synaptogenesis, cell pruning, and myelination
          · Discuss the normal trajectory of brain development from birth to age eight
          · Discuss the concept of brain plasticity and its role in mediating non-normative events that

             hinder brain development

The human brain is the most unique thing about each of us. It is home to our memories and our plans; we use
it also for essential activities such as breathing and regulating our heartbeat, but we can also use it for making
up bad jokes and excuses. Our brains help define who we are as individuals as our biology interacts with our
environments.

   During the first eight years of life, the brain of a child is doing an enormous amount of work, day and night. In
this chapter, we will explore the typical development of the human brain, starting at conception. To understand
this development, we will need to delve into the inner workings of the brain, from the smallest parts of the
neuron all the way up the four lobes of the cerebral cortex, where so much of our daily experience takes place.

   The brain plays an important role in all aspects of early development, and the experiences that happen early
in life lay the foundation for how the brain will operate across the lifespan. For that reason, it is essential for
anyone who is planning to work with infants, toddlers, and young children to understand the earliest stages
and milestones of brain development. Ensuring that children's brains get high quality input right from the start
is the best way to ensure a lifetime of brain functionality.

   Earlier, we talked about the four domains of development: physical, cognitive, social, and emotional. The brain
develops in each of these domains, just as every other part of the child does. Typically, the brain is most closely
associated with cognitive development. Cognition, after all, is largely about brain functions such as memory,
attention, processing speeds, and intelligence. When we talk about people who are smart, we often refer to
them as having a "big brain" or being a "brainiac." As will be discussed through this book, one of the most
impressive cognitive feats of the brain is the development of spoken (and later written) language.

   But our brains also develop - and help guide development - in the other three domains as well. One of
the primary functions of the somatosensory cortex of the brain is to accept, integrate, and act upon sensory
information in the form of physical sensation. This narrow strip of the cerebral cortex is essential in nearly
everything we do each day, helping us to know when we are touching objects, which in turn informs the
systems that maintain our balance and orientation in space. These parts of the brain are necessary for learning
to stand, walk, run, jump, and maybe even surf! Without the brain's constant integration of important sensory
information, our physical development would be significantly delayed (Jensen, 2019).

                                                                                          Chapter Four: Brain Development from Conception to Age 8 | 71
72 | Chapter Four: Brain Development from Conception to Age 8
Biology of the Brain

In order to understand what a child's brain can do, it is important to first understand how the brain is built.
Throughout gestation and into the first months of life, the brain of the infant is growing. Perhaps you have
heard that the human brain is not fully developed until age 25? This is true, but the majority of the cellular
development takes place in the first three years of life so that the next 22 years can be spent refining how
those cells are used. In this section, we will explore the smallest part of the brain - the cells - and how networks
between cells develop and become the brain from a biological perspective.

   There are six essential growth functions of your neural cells: cell proliferation, cell differentiation, cell
migration, synaptogenesis, cell pruning, and myelination. In this section, you will learn the fundamentals of
each of these processes, and throughout this textbook you will learn more about how these processes support
children's development in specific ages and stages. But first, let's discuss what makes neural cells special, and
how they work together to form the brain.

Brain Cells: Neurons

Like all living things, the brain is made of cells; brain cells are called neurons. Neurons are highly specialized
cells that have three main parts: an axon, the cell body, and multiple dendrites. Electrical impulses run through
these three structures in a specific pattern, causing chemical reactions which are our thoughts and feelings.
These impulses also control our physical actions.

                                                                                                                                                       Biology of the Brain | 73
   The cell body is just like any other cell in the human body: it has a nucleus that houses DNA and RNA,
which is surrounded by cytoplasm that contains organelles. In this picture, do you recognize any of the cellular
structures from biology class?

          If it has been a while since you took Biology, or you just want a little more information, check out
       this Boundless Anatomy and Physiology course from Lumen!

From this image, you may also be noticing several differences between a brain cell and other cells in the body.
The most obvious characteristics of neurons that set them apart from other cells are their dendrites and long
axons.

   In this illustration, the dendrites are the red branch-like structures extending from the main cell body. The
dendrites are responsible for "touching" other cells - usually the axons of neighboring cells. You can see this
depicted here where red branches are connecting to yellow branches, which come from a neighbor cell. Cells
communicate with one another, passing along an electrical current that stimulates a chemical reaction. We
perceive our thoughts and actions as instantaneous and smooth, but in reality our brains are constantly turning
signals on and off in a wave like pattern!

   At the site where the two cells meet, a gap called the synapse, electrical currents pass from one cell to
another. This is simply the name for the junction site between an axon and a neighboring dendrite, but a lot
of important works takes place at a synapse! Electrical impulses move along an axon and when it reaches the
synaptic cleft, it needs to "jump" from one neuron to another. The electrical current is moved across through
a chemical reaction that produces a neurotransmitter - literally a chemical that transmits impulses between
neurons. This electrical impulse travels from the dendrite, through the cell body, and down the axon to the next
neurons. This is what we refer to as brain cells "firing."

   Axons can be long relative to the size of an individual cell, allowing them to reach dendrites on neurons all
around them. This can also make them fragile, so they need special protection (Konkel, 2018).

   Imagine wires in your own home, constantly moving electricity around to where it needs to be. There are
places where two wires meet and electricity is transmitted from one to the next, just like between two neurons.
Also, like the wires in your house, the physical structure that contains the electricity needs to be insulated to
keep the electrical current inside the system and moving to where it needs to go. Axons are insulated by means
of a myelin sheath, which is a thin layer of lipids (fatty substance) that protects the axon and helps insulate the
electrical impulse as it moves. Without a healthy myelin sheath, it is possible for impulses to be slowed down or
even lost altogether.

74 | Biology of the Brain
   Electrical currents run the length of the axon with the help of the myelin sheath (Jensen, 2019). This image
shows two neurons: the one on the left does not have a myelin sheath, while the one on the right does. Axons
without myelin can still conduct signals, but the impulses move much more slowly. Follow this link to see an
animated version of these two neurons conducting an impulse.

   Did you notice how much more slowly the impulse on the left was moving?
   Imagine you and your friend are walking down the sidewalk; each square of pavement is a myelin node. If one
of you walks while the other one jumps from square to square, who will get to the end of the block first? The
person who is jumping! This is how myelin nodes are able to move electrical impulses so much more quickly.
   They allow the current to "jump" along the axon, rather than moving in a slow, continuous wave.

Neural Networks

In the brain, single cells do have independent functions, but most neurons work in small clusters to accomplish
a task or in larger clusters to control major functions of the body. For example, you have small but specialized
areas of the brain that accept sensory information for each of the different parts of your body (see "temporal
lobe" below) as well as an entire lobe that is devoted to visual information (see "occipital lobe" below). The size
of an area and its density of neurons is related to how much work it needs to do. Generally speaking, we actively
process and respond to significantly more visual information every day than we do to touch sensations.

   Neural cells gather together to form brain structures automatically, following a genetic blueprint that is
almost universal. This is called "experience independent" development (Berninger & Richards, 2002) because it

                                                                                                                                                       Biology of the Brain | 75
doesn't require any sort of environmental input or experience. However, large portions of the brain grow only
through experience, either "expected" or "dependent."

   Expected experiences are those that the brain anticipates encountering - such as seeing the world for the
first time- so it lays a foundation of neurons and then development continues based on what actually happens.

   in the child's life. "Experience dependent" neural networks are those which only develop if and when a child
has an experience that leads to their creation.

   For example, each person will develop a unique set of neural networks for their pets, their family members,
their favorite ice cream sundae, and so on. While many of us might have similar networks, they will never be
identical because not only do those networks consist of the memory of the specific thing (dog, mom, ice cream)
they also consist of all of the emotions, language, and episodic memories that go with it.

          Episodic memories are memories of things that have happened to us; they are narrative in nature
       (they are a story) and often are tied to strong visual, olfactory, and sensory memories.

As brain cells develop in utero, they become specialized for certain areas of the brain and follow genetically laid
plans to move to the right areas and connect to other cells. You will read more about this later in this chapter,
where we specifically talk about brain development in utero, but first it is important to understand what the
areas of the brain actually are!

The Main Structures of the Brain

Although we think of the brain as a single organ that floats in our skull all day, in reality the brain is made up of
several distinct structures that have specialized jobs and that develop somewhat independently. As brain cells
proliferate, they also become specialized for their future jobs as the place for making decisions in the brain. This
is the process of cell differentiation. As cells become differentiated, they also must be located in the correct area:
this is the process of cell migration. Once cells are in their specific area they become embedded in the physical
structure as well as the functional structure of those areas (Berninger & Richards, 2002).

   The image below highlights the primary structures of the brain which are needed for full functioning: the
spinal cord, the medulla oblongata, the cerebellum, the midbrain, and the cerebrum.

                                  Forebrain
                                  (cerebrum)

Midbrain   Hindbrain
Pons       (cerebellum)

Medulla    Spinal cord
oblongata

Spinal Cord

The spinal cord connects the brain to the rest of the body.

Medulla Oblongata

This part of the brain is primarily responsible for life functions, including breathing, digestion, heart and blood
vessel functioning, and swallowing. The medulla oblongata controls most of the involuntary actions that keep
us alive, and damage to this part of the brain can be catastrophic.

   From its position at the top of the brainstem, the medulla oblongata helps connect the automatic portion
of the central nervous system to the parts of the brain that process sensory, emotional, and memory input
(Berninger & Richards, 2002).

                                                                                                                                    The Main Structures of the Brain | 77
Cerebellum

The cerebellum, sometimes called the "little brain", may be one of the smaller parts of the brain, but it contains
the most neurons and plays an important role in how we interact with the world! It is a dense, butterfly-shaped
organ at the base of the brain. If you place your hand on the back of your head and feel the area where your
skull curves into your cervical spine, you are running your hand over your cerebellum.

   While the medulla oblongata controls involuntary functions, the cerebellum coordinates voluntary functions
throughout your body, particularly motor functions. It takes in sensory information from the spinal cord and
uses that to manage gross and fine motor control. Your cerebellum helps to keep you standing upright and
helps you coordinate your motor skills in space and time. It is essential for walking and talking, and its health
plays a significant role in how well children develop coordination as they grow (Berninger & Richards, 2002;
Santrock, 2013).

   Normally, a cerebellum is considered essential to living a normal life; people who damage their cerebellum
often experience dramatic declines in their coordination, balance, and ability to time their movements
appropriately. It can be like losing control over all of your voluntary motor functions and always feeling
uncoordinated. However, there have been cases reported of people who live completely normal lives without a
cerebellum - if they are born that way! (Thomson, 2014)

Pons

Between the upper and lower parts of the brain is the Pons - a small area of brain that is responsible for relaying
messages between the cerebellum and the cerebrum. Given what you have already learned about the function
of the cerebellum, it should be no surprise that the pons is responsible for relaying information related to the
voluntary functions that the cerebellum controls, as well as information about involuntary actions like sleep and
respiration.

Midbrain

Sitting atop the pons is the midbrain, which is also a small area that plays an important role in relaying
information around the brain, and ensuring proper functioning and communication.

Cerebrum

First, it is important to understand that the cerebrum is made up of two distinct hemispheres that mirror each
other. The two hemispheres - right and left - process information from and exert control over opposite sides of
the body. Your right hemisphere talks to the left side of your body, and vice versa. The main lobes of the brain
are duplicated on each side, such that both the right and left hemisphere have the same areas (vision, sensory
information, information processing, and speech) but the sides are complementary, not exact copies, meaning
they do the same jobs but with different types of information.

78 | The Main Structures of the Brain
Cerebral Cortex

When you think of the brain, you are probably imagining the outermost layer, but this is only a portion of what
makes up the human brain! Of course, that portion is responsible for a lot. The cerebral cortex is represented
by the wrinkled layer in this picture of the brain that is primarily responsible for how we interact with the world
around us.

   These two images both show the lobes of the brain, sometimes with added italicized labels. The ones above
give you more details, so that you can have a better sense of what areas are associated with each lobe or what
functions the areas have. The ones in italics show the functions of some areas.

   Let's take a look at what each of the lobes of the brain is responsible for.

                visual
                cortex

Occipital Lobe

The occipital lobe is primarily responsible for integrating visual information. It may seem strange that the back
of your brain is where information from your eyes is processed, but that is how your brain works! Even stranger
still is that the left side of your brain is responsible for processing information from your right eye, and vice versa.
Each eyeball has its own visual field from which information is gathered. This information is then sent across
the midline of the brain, and into the occipital lobe where it is processed. People who have lost the connection
between the two hemispheres of their brain experience significant changes to their visual field, and their ability
to talk about what they see!

Parietal Lobe

The parietal lobe runs along the top of the brain just below where a headband might sit. It is where the majority
of our sensory input is processed, including our senses of touch, taste, and temperature - all things that are
essential for babies as they interact with the world around them!

                                Cerebral Cortex | 81
   The parietal lobe includes a specific strip known as the somatosensory cortex. Along this strip, the brain has
designated areas that integrate sensory information from specific parts of the body. The name that has been
given to this "body map" is the homunculus. As you can see in the image above, the somatosensory cortex
is not an exact map, and there are some areas of the body that take up more areas of the brain than others.
Remember: each hemisphere of the brain processes information from the opposite side of the body. That
means that you have a map on either side of your brain, but each map coordinates information from the other
half of your body (Berninger & Richards, 2002).

   Look carefully at the brain map; what do you notice about the amount of space given to different body parts?
   You probably noticed that your hands and face - especially your lips - take up a lot of space on the
somatosensory cortex! Although it makes for a strange looking body map, this is actually very important to
understand. Our face and our hands are essential for interacting with the world around us safely and accurately.
Have you ever said "let me see that" but meant "Let me hold that in my hand" - that is because we "see" with our
hands just as much as with our eyes, in terms of sensory information. Touching things tells us about the weight,

82 | Cerebral Cortex
texture, and temperature of objects, as well as many other things. Our face is extremely sensitive because our
head is where our eyes, ears, and brain all live - and we want to keep those things safe. Other areas of our body,
such as our torso, get less neural space simply because this area tends to give us less essential information. It
is also worth noticing that parts of the body where we often wear clothes tend to be areas with less sensory
nerves. Think about how rarely you notice your clothes on your body compared to noticing a stray hair on your
face!

Temporal Lobe

Located along the sides of your head, just above your ears, is your temporal lobe. Unlike the other three lobes
of the brain, which obviously connect to one another across the midline of the brain, the temporal lobe appears
to be two separate pieces, but is in fact connected through the middle of the brain and crosses the midline
deep inside the cerebrum. It does this with the help of specific structures deep inside the brain, including the
hippocampus (Berninger & Richards, 2002).

   It is not a coincidence that the temporal lobe is situated so close to the ear; it is in this part of the brain
that speech and other sounds are processed. The image below shows the pathway of sounds, particularly
language, around the temporal lobe. As you can see, once a word is "heard" (the acoustic phonetics) that sound
information is split between parts of the temporal lobe that process sound information (lexical phonology)
and a part that processes the meaning (lexical semantics) before all of that information makes it way into the
hippocampus, where it is attached to memories and emotions, which help us to make sense of what we have
heard!

                                                                                                                                                             Cerebral Cortex | 83
   Perhaps the most important aspect of the temporal lobe is the role that it plays in the reception and
production of language. As you can see in the brain image above (motor and sensory regions), it is home
to Wernicke's and Broca's areas - both regions of the brain that specialize in language. These two regions of
the brain are located only in the left hemisphere of the temporal lobe, and work together to ensure speech
production and comprehension. Wernicke's area is important in the understanding of speech, while Broca's
area is related to speech production. For more information about each of these areas, check out these short
videos about Wernicke's Wernike's and Broca's areas respectively (Berninger & Richards, 2002; Berk, 2017).

Frontal Lobe

The frontal lobe is the last portion of the brain to fully develop, and that is largely because it is so dependent
on experience. This is the part of your brain that is the "you." Located in the front and center of your brain, this
is where you make decisions, solve complex problems, interpret social cues, and monitor your own behavior.
Although this part of the brain is present from birth, the vast neural networks that make up the frontal lobe are
under construction for years - up to 25!

   Your frontal lobe is where most of the functions that translate into behaviors originate. While the three lobes
of the brain are busy interpreting information from the body and the world, the frontal lobe allows us to make
choices about what we do with that information and then to act based on those choices. This is referred to as
executive functioning and the development of this part of the brain is essential for success in many aspects of
life, including school. A significant piece of executive functioning is attention. Our attention system allows us
to focus on a single thing or to divide our attention if necessary. Paying attention often means being able to
block out information that is not important, often sensory information in the form of touch, sight, or sound. This
means that before the attention system can fully develop, it is necessary for the sensory-information processing
lobes in the brain to develop and learn to separate important from unimportant input. In infants, these systems
are not yet developed, and it can take years until the attention system is fully functional. In the meantime,
children may be easily distracted by sensory information that an adult would not notice, or would be able to
ignore.

   As you will read later, not all children develop their attention system in the same way. Attention Deficit
Disorder is a common diagnosis in childhood, and it is identified when a child has an underdeveloped attention
system making it difficult to direct sustained focus on a single task.

   The executive function of the frontal lobe also includes our working memory. While our long-term memories
are stored deep in the brain, our short term, or work, memory operates in the frontal lobe. This makes sense,
since we want our working memory to be able to quickly and efficiently connect with our attention, problem
solving, and social processes. That allows us to make decisions and monitor our behavior in the moment.

   Buried within the cerebral cortex are several areas that are responsible for managing memory and emotion.
Without these parts of the brain, our emotional development would not be possible. The hippocampus,
thalamus, and hypothalamus work together to help us remember emotional events and to make sense of the
feelings that we have throughout the day. A major piece of early development is learning what feelings are, how
to express them appropriately, and how to control them when necessary. The brain plays a significant role in all
of this (Berninger & Richards, 2002).

Brain Development During Gestation

   Over the course of gestation, the brain grows rapidly and new neural cells grow at a rate of 50,000 to 100,000
per second between the 5th and 20th weeks. (Berninger & Richards, 2002; p79) This is where the six processes of
neural development begin. At full-term birth, much of the neural foundation is complete and what comes next
is to add on to the existing structure through experience. During the first three years of life, the brain will grow
rapidly, adding millions of neuronal connections as it stores information from nearly every sensory, emotional,
or cognitive experience.

   The brainstem, midbrain, and cerebral cortex will visibly develop during gestation. First, the brain stem
develops, and it can be clearly distinguished from the other areas of the brain within the first month of
gestation. At only four weeks into gestation, it is already possible to distinguish what will become the primary
structures of the brain. This is due to rapid cell proliferation and differentiation. Proliferation is the generation
of new neurons and their supporting cells, called glial cells. Differentiation refers to the shape and function of
those cells, which become apparent as they grow.

   As they grow, neurons move around in the brain so that they are physically located in the areas where they are
functionally compatible. This process is called cell migration. Genetic information within the nucleus of each cell
determines what its function will be and tells it where to move. Cells move by attaching to tracks created by glial
cells (helper cells) that provide a track for the neurons' journey. (Berninger & Richards, 2002; p 80) Typically, cells
in the cerebral cortex migrate from the inner layers of the brain outward, building the brain from the inside/
out - which should help to explain why the frontal lobe, somatosensory cortex, and even some areas related to
language develop later than other areas of the brain.

   The brainstem, the bottom-most section in the lateral view, is responsible for moving information between
the body - where sensory information originates - and the brain - where it is processed and commands are
given to the body. It connects the body to the three primary information processing areas of the brain: the
cerebellum, the midbrain, and the cerebrum.

   Brain development during gestation is influenced by a number of genetic and environmental factors. The
overarching structure of the brain is independent of experience, being guided by genetic information from
the beginning. Cell proliferation (the dividing of cells from a single cell into the trillions of cells that make
up the human body) begins as soon as a fertilized egg embeds itself in the lining of the uterus, and cells
continue to proliferate according to the instructions in each cell's DNA. Of course, it is possible for DNA to
give bad directions, and when this happens, the brain does not develop in the expected way. Environmental

86 | Brain Development During Gestation
influences can damage DNA and cause irregularities in brain development. Perhaps one of the more well-
known environmental causes of impaired brain development is from alcohol. Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders
are a family of diagnosable conditions that occur as a result of alcohol consumption during pregnancy.
Although there are several physiological markers of FASDs, there are also many known cognitive side-effects
due to the damage alcohol does to developing brain cells.

   Alcohol consumption is not the only way a pregnant woman can influence the brain development of her
child. General health and nutrition are important to ensure that the mother's body is able to direct adequate
resources to fueling cell proliferation and the building of fetal organs, including the brain. As we mentioned
above, the long axons on the end of neurons are covered by a fatty sheath called myelin. The developing brain
needs fat to build this sheath, so mothers need to supply this through their own diet.

   Myelination of neural axons begins before birth, and at full gestation most of the spinal cord and brainstem
are fully myelinated. However, myelination is not complete until adolescence! This means that although you
may have the most neurons early in childhood, your brain works the quickest and most efficiently in your late
teens and 20s. Throughout infancy, the midbrain and cerebellum are used regularly as infants learn to walk and
talk; therefore, these areas receive the most myelination during the first two years of life. Yet the areas of the
cerebral cortex, including the structures related to attention, language, and memory take up to ten years to be
completely myelinated. Recall when you learned about the Emotional Domain of development, you read that
the brain structures that underlie emotional regulation are not fully developed until later in life. This is because
those areas are not fully myelinated, and myelination helps to strengthen their connections.

   Myelination requires a healthy diet with plenty of healthy fats. You may already know that infants need a full
fat diet, but since myelination continues for nearly 18 years, nutrition is important at all stages of life. Now, let's
think about how this relates to infants and their brain development. Have you ever seen a baby explore the
world? What are some of the strategies that they use?

Brain Development in Infants and
Toddlers

Once infants enter the world, their brain is bombarded with information that fuels neural growth. During
the first three years of life, cells proliferate, differentiate, and migrate at an incredible rate! As they arrive in
their permanent network, they build connections with neighboring cells, and synaptogenesis occurs at each
junction. Synaptogenesis is the building of connections between the end of one axon and the receptor of a
neighboring dendrite. It is an essential part of cell growth, and as new cells proliferate and migrate into place,
they are quick to find neighbors to connect with.

   Well into toddlerhood, neural cell proliferation continues to happen quickly and abundantly. Every experience
for an infant or toddler is new, and therefore the brain chooses to use nearly all of them to build new network
connections. It cannot be sure what will and what will not turn out to be important. Around age 3, the brain
is as dense with neurons and neural connections as it will ever be throughout the lifespan! Creating a strong
connection at a synaptic juncture is important to the lifespan of a neuron. Neurons that make weak or no
connections cannot transfer impulses efficiently and tend to be removed in a process called pruning.

   But this density is hard to sustain, both in terms of keeping connections accessible and in terms of fueling
the brain with nutrients and oxygen. Therefore, the brain needs to start disconnecting some of these neurons.
This process is called pruning, because it is similar to what a gardener might do with a plant - carefully
removing selected neurons in an effort to ensure better health for the most important ones. Pruning of neural
networks continues throughout childhood and adolescence with different areas of the brain experiencing
greater intensity of pruning at different times (Courage & Howe, 2002).

   In upcoming chapters, you will read more about the experiences that infants and toddlers have which help to
support their brain development. As you learn about those important stages of childhood, keep in mind what
is happening behind the scenes in each child's brain!

88 | Brain Development in Infants and Toddlers
Brain Development in Preschool and
School-Age Children

As was mentioned previously, the brain processes which begin before birth continue well into childhood, and
some go until adolescence as well. Much of the brain's rapid growth can be attributed to the experiences that
children are having each day as they explore the world around them, interact with parents and caregivers, and
grow physically. These early experiences are often informal in nature. This all changes when children enter more
formal educational settings such as preschool and K-12 classes.

   Experiences once children begin to attend preschool become more intentionally designed to activate growth
by providing children with experiences deemed essential for cognitive, social, and emotional development. For
example, teaching children letter sounds and word meanings supports neural growth in their temporal lobe as
it stimulates areas related to both receptive and productive language use. In preschool settings, children have
opportunities to interact with peers of their own age, perhaps for the first time if they have been at home with a
parent or caregiver since birth. These interactions are essential for triggering the synaptogenesis of neurons in
the areas of the brain that help navigate social spaces, such as playing with friends. And as you just read, during
this time myelination of the brain areas associated with better emotional control is taking place.

   Not all preschool age children attend a formal preschool class, but many do. For the ones who do not, brain
development is still occuring at a furious rate, as children have other experiences with parents, caregivers, and
peers in other settings. Even children who remain at home until Kindergarten have plenty of opportunities
that fuel their neural growth - provided the adults in their life create such opportunities. As you will learn in
upcoming chapters, many cognitive functions have critical periods for their development - times when the
right experiences must occur in order for a function to develop. Language is one example of this; children who
are not exposed to spoken or sign language in the first years of life will always struggle to learn the sounds and
grammar of their language. Vision also has a critical period, and children with vision issues such as a "lazy eye"
or non-binocular vision (meaning the two eyes don't coordinate what they see across the midline of the brain)
can only benefit from interventions up until about age 4. (Berninger & Richards, 2002; p 88)

   By school age, most children have had enough experiences to at least have fully functional brains and a
healthy amount of connected neural networks. Children enter Kindergarten with a wide range of cognitive,
social, and emotional abilities, but typically the physical structure of the brain is nearly identical to an adult's
brain. In school, children will learn to use their neural networks in the act of learning.

   As brain research continues to evolve, so does what and how much educators know about children's brains. A
great deal of "best practice" in early and elementary education is based on what we know about how the brain
works and how to teach to that. For example, in this book you will learn more about multiple intelligences and
learning styles, both based on brain research that recognizes that the four areas of the cerebral cortex take in
different types of information (visual, sensory, auditory, and social-emotional). The best practice for educators
that are associated with MI and learning styles is based on the idea that designing curriculum that matches
how the brain already wants to process information is much more effective than trying to make children's brains
learn in less efficient ways.

The Role of Genetics

Jim Springer and Jim Lewis were identical twins separated
at 4 weeks of age.

   CBS NEWS: Twin brothers separated at birth reveal
striking genetic similarities

   When they were reunited at the age of 39, they
discovered that they possessed striking similarities. Both
worked as deputy sheriffs, suffered from tension
headaches, vacationed in Florida, were prone to nail biting,
smoked Salem cigarettes, drove Chevrolets, had dogs
named Toy and married and divorced women named
Betty. One twin named his son James Allan, and the other
named his son James Alan. Both preferred math over spelling and enjoyed carpentry and mechanical drawing.
The study of the "Jim twins" brings up the debate of nature vs. nurture and which has a greater impact on a
child's Image: Ripley's Believe It or Not! development-their environment or their genetics.

   Jim Springer and Jim Lewis were part of a landmark study, The Minnesota Twin Family Study, conducted from
1979 to 1999, which followed identical and fraternal twins who were separated at an early age. Researchers at the
University of Minnesota, led by Thomas Bouchard, launched the landmark study. Over the course of 20 years,
they studied 137 pairs of twins: 81 pairs of identical twins (twins who developed from one egg that split in two),
and 56 pairs of fraternal twins (twins who developed from two eggs fertilized by two different sperm). The study
set out to determine the impact of nature (genes) vs. nurture (environment) on a child's development.

   This topic has also come up in a 2018 film entitled "Three Identical Strangers." The film follows triplets
separated at birth and grapples with the question of whether nature or nurture had a greater impact on their
long-term development. In this case, the triplets born in 1961 were studied extensively, not knowing that they
had each other until adulthood. The case is tragic in many ways. Many siblings separated by the Louise Wise
Adoption Services have since found each other. The intricacies of the research that was done remains in closed
files (Wardle et al; 2018).

   When genetically identical twins separated as infants show such striking similarities, can we conclude that
their genes caused these similarities? The Minnesota study of identical twins points to both the importance
of the genetic basis of human development and the need for further research on genetic and environmental
factors (Bouchard, Lykken et. al. 1990). Certainly, genes play a crucial role in the way a child develops. In this
chapter, we will discuss the impact genes have on a child's development.

   Natural selection is the evolutionary process that favors individuals best adapted to survive and reproduce.
Evolutionary psychology emphasizes adaptation, reproduction, and "survival of the fittest" in shaping behavior.
Just as evolution shapes our physical features, it also influences how we make decisions, how aggressive we are,
and our mating patterns. For example, if our ancestors were hunters and gatherers and the men did most of the
hunting and the women gathered seeds and plants for food, the men would have to possess certain physical
traits to travel long distances and hunt and kill animals. Those born with these traits would be more likely to
gather more food, attract stronger mates and reproduce. Evolutionary developmental psychologists believe in
the importance of childhood. They believe that an extended "juvenile" period for learning information is crucial.
What is learned in childhood prepares children for adulthood.

   It is important to understand how conception takes place to better understand genetic and chromosomal
abnormalities that might impact a child's development. Reproduction occurs when the female gamete (ovum)
is fertilized by the male gamete (sperm). They join to form the first cell of life (the zygote). This cell contains 23
pairs of chromosomes.

                                                                                                                                                      The Role of Genetics | 93
   The zygote is the first cell of human life. Life begins as a single cell with a nucleus. Each nucleus has 23 pairs
of chromosomes, one member of each pair coming from each parent.

   DNA is a complex molecule that contains genetic information. Genes are the units of hereditary information
composed of DNA.

   Cells divide in two different ways. Mitosis is cellular reproduction in which the cell's nucleus duplicates itself
with two new cells being formed. Each new cell contains the same DNA as the parent cell, with the same 23
pairs of chromosomes. Meiosis is a specialized form of cell division that occurs to form eggs and sperm (or
gametes) (Santrock, 2013),

   Genotype is the actual genetic material. Phenotype is the way an individual's genotype is expressed in
measurable or observable characteristics (Berk, 2017).

   Males have X and Y chromosomes. Females have two X chromosomes. In some cases, one gene of a pair
always exerts its effects; it is dominant, overriding the potential influence of the other gene, called the recessive
gene. A recessive gene exerts its influence only if the two genes of a pair are both recessive. If you inherit a
recessive gene from both of your parents, you will inherit that recessive gene. If you inherit a recessive gene
from just one of your parents, you may never know you carry the gene. Brown hair, farsightedness, and dimples
rule over blond hair, nearsightedness, and freckles in the world of dominant-recessive genes. However, most
characteristics are not caused by only one gene. Most are determined by the interaction of several genes. This
is called polygenic inheritance. This is a picture of the dominant-recessive genes principle.

94 | The Role of Genetics
   If a parent passes along a dominant gene for brown hair, their child will be born with brown hair. The only way
they will have a blond-haired child is if both parents pass on a recessive gene for blond hair. Page URLs:

Concerns in Conception

Once you have a basic understanding of what a typical cell includes (23 pairs of chromosomes), it is easier to
understand how chromosomal abnormalities occur. A chromosomal abnormality occurs when a gamete does
not have a normal set of 23 chromosomes. Down Syndrome is the most common chromosomal abnormality.
It occurs when an extra chromosome causes mild to severe cognitive and physical delays. Advanced maternal
age appears to have an impact on the likelihood of a woman giving birth to a child with Down Syndrome. If a
mother is age 20, this syndrome occurs in 1 in 1,900 births. If a mother is 35, it occurs in 1 out of 300 births. If a
mother is age 45, it occurs in 1 out of 30 births (National Institute of Health, 2018). Down Syndrome is interesting
when considering the nature vs. nurture debate. Although the condition cannot be reversed, early intervention
can lead to much more positive outcomes. Children with Down Syndrome can grow up to be adults who live
independent, healthy, productive lives.

   Some other common chromosomal conditions that may be encountered when working with young children:
   Klinefelter Syndrome occurs when an extra X chromosome causes physical abnormalities. It occurs in one out
of six hundred male births. Hormone therapy can be effective.
   Fragile X Syndrome is an abnormality in the X chromosome that can cause cognitive delays, learning
disabilities and a short attention span. It is more common in males than females.
   Turner Syndrome, which occurs in one out of two thousand five hundred live births, develops when a female
is missing an X chromosome. It causes cognitive delays and sexual underdevelopment. Hormone therapy in
childhood and puberty can be beneficial.
   XYY Syndrome occurs when an extra Y chromosome is present. It can cause above average height (Santrock,
2013).

Gene-Linked Abnormalities

Gene-linked abnormalities can be caused by harmful genes. Here are some examples of gene-linked
abnormalities:

   Phenylketonuria, or PKU occurs when an individual cannot properly metabolize an amino acid; a special diet
can result in average intelligence and a normal life span. If left untreated, it causes mental retardation. This
is an excellent example of how nurture (the environment) can positively impact nature (the results of genetic
inheritance). If this condition is treated, a child goes on to live a perfectly normal, healthy life.

   Sickle-cell anemia occurs mainly in the African American population. It is caused by a recessive gene. It is
a blood disorder that limits the body's oxygen supply. It can cause heart and kidney failure, as well as joint
swelling. There is no cure for sickle cell anemia.

Prenatal Testing for Genetic Abnormalities

There are several tests that can be performed prenatally to give women information about how the fetus
is developing. An ultrasound is the most common prenatal test. High frequency sound waves are directed
into the pregnant woman's abdomen. The echo from the sounds creates a picture. Ultrasounds can detect
many abnormalities in the fetus, including microencephaly, a condition caused by an abnormally small brain.
Ultrasounds can also determine the number of fetuses and give clues to the baby's sex. The ultrasound

96 | Concerns in Conception
procedure is non-invasive, meaning it is done outside the body. There is no risk to the mother or the fetus when
this test is administered (Berk, 2017).

   Between the 10th and 12th weeks of pregnancy, chorionic villi sampling may be performed. In this procedure,
a sample of the placenta is taken to test for chromosomal or genetic abnormalities. There is a small risk of limb
deformity, and this test can cause false positives if a woman does not know the exact date of conception.

   Amniocentesis is another test that is administered to many women during pregnancy. During an
amniocentesis, a sample of amniotic fluid is taken to test for chromosomal and metabolic disorders. This is an
invasive procedure because the medical professional is going into the amniotic sac to take a sample of fluid.
Amniocentesis provides a small risk of miscarriage but provides a great deal of accurate information regarding
chromosomal and genetic conditions (Berk, 2017; Santrock, 2013).

   Maternal blood screening (sometimes called the AFP test) identifies pregnancies that have an elevated risk
for birth defects such as spina bifida. Triple screen measures three substances in the mother's blood. It is
noninvasive because the doctor is not going into the amniotic sac. After an abnormal triple screen, the next step
is usually an ultrasound. If an ultrasound does not explain the abnormal triple screen, amniocentesis is typically
used.

   All these prenatal tests give women important information about their developing fetus (Berk, 2017).

Other Concerns

For some women, conceiving a child can be extremely difficult. Infertility is an inability to conceive after 12
months of regular intercourse (Santrock, 2013). As women have chosen to have children later in life, the rates
of infertility have risen, due in some part to advanced maternal age. There are several strategies to deal with
infertility: in vitro fertilization (IVF), gamete intrafallopian transfer (GITF) and zygote intrafallopian transfer (ZIFT).
IVF has a 31% success rate. GITF has a 24.5% success rate and ZIFT has a 29.2% success rate (Zarinara, 2021).
People who continue to struggle with infertility often consider adoption.

                                                                                                                                                Concerns in Conception | 97
The Germinal Period

Now that we understand the process of conception, let's explore what happens once the egg is fertilized and
the zygote is created.

   The Germinal Period is the first two weeks after conception. The zygote is created and cells continue
to divide. At approximately 10 days after conception, the zygote attaches to the uterine wall. This is called
implantation. Even at this early date, the differentiation of cells has begun.

   The blastocyst (blastocoel) is an inner layer of cells that later develops into the embryo. The trophoblast is the
outer layer of cells that provides nutrition and support for the embryo.

   The embryonic period occurs two to eight weeks after conception. Organogenesis, or organ formation,
begins and the support systems for cells form.

   The embryo has three layers of cells. The endoderm is the inner layer of cells which becomes the digestive and
respiratory systems. The ectoderm is the outer layer of cells which forms the nervous system, sensory receptors
and skin. The mesoderm is the middle layer of cells which forms the circulatory, excretory and reproductive
systems as well as bones and muscles.

   The embryo has a complex life support system. The placenta provides nutrition for the embryo. The umbilical
cord connects the baby to the placenta. The amnion, or amniotic sac, is an envelope in which the baby floats. It
is temperature controlled, humidity controlled and virtually shock proof (Santrock, 2013).

98 | The Germinal Period
   The fetal period occurs two months after conception and lasts for approximately seven months until the baby
is born. The largest prenatal weight gains occur during this period. Fingers, toes, skin, lungs and reflexes all
develop as the baby prepares for birth. The three trimesters are different from the three prenatal periods. In
fact, the embryonic period, the germinal period and the beginning of the fetal period all occur during the first
trimester!

                                                                                                                                                     The Germinal Period | 99

Pregnancy Concerns

How long does a typical pregnancy last? People generally answer nine months, but that is not exactly true. Fetal
life begins with ovum fertilization. Pregnancy is calculated from the first day of the woman's last menstrual
period and generally lasts about 40 weeks, which is closer to ten months!

   Some early signs and symptoms of pregnancy are missed menstrual period, breast changes, aching in lower
abdomen, fatigue, nausea and frequent urination.

   During the first trimester women feel extreme fatigue, nausea and emotional changes. During the second
trimester they begin to feel less nauseous, and the uterus expands into the abdominal cavity. During the third
trimester, women anticipate the end of pregnancy and the uterus expands to the point below the breastbone.

   From the first sign of pregnancy a woman needs to be careful about what she eats, drinks, and how she takes
care of her body. Many factors can have an impact on the health and well-being of the embryo/fetus.

Risk Factors

Teratogen

A teratogen is anything that causes a birth defect. The severity of the defect is determined by the dose, whether
a child is genetically susceptible, and when they were exposed to the teratogen.

   Antibiotics, some antidepressants, certain hormones, diet pills, aspirin and too much caffeine can all affect
the fetus.

                                                                                                                                                     Pregnancy Concerns | 101
   Psychoactive drugs act on the nervous system. They change moods and modify perceptions.
   Alcohol can be extremely dangerous if it is abused when a woman is pregnant. Fetal Alcohol Syndrome (FAS)
causes cognitive and physical delays which can be extremely severe. FAS refers to a range of disorders caused
by drinking alcohol during pregnancy. Fetal alcohol syndrome can cause abnormal facial features, growth
deficiency, and problems with the central nervous system. Children with fetal alcohol syndrome may also
have learning disabilities, attention span disorders, and other physical disabilities, including vision and hearing
problems. The only way to prevent Fetal Alcohol Syndrome is to refrain from drinking during pregnancy.
   Smoking during pregnancy can lead to low birth-weight infants who often struggle with lung development.
   Cocaine, marijuana, methamphetamine and heroin are all teratogens that pose a great risk to the fetus.
   Cocaine: Babies born to women who used cocaine often have smaller heads and a lower IQ. They struggle
with cognitive performance, information processing, and attention to tasks.
   Marijuana: Babies born to mothers who smoke marijuana have a lower birth weight and underdeveloped
lungs.
   Methamphetamine: Women who use methamphetamines are more likely to miscarry or give birth to low
birth-weight infants. Infants experience irritability, feeding issues and failure to thrive.
   Heroin: Babies born to women who used heroin often experience serious withdrawal symptoms and are
extremely irritable. Long term they can experience cognitive delays and attention issues.

Environmental Hazards

Environmental hazards also pose a great risk to the fetus. Fathers' exposure to lead and radiation, certain
pesticides, petrochemicals, toxic waste, and manufactured chemicals are all cause for concern.

Medical Conditions

There are also many medical conditions that can pose a risk to the fetus. (CDC)
   Rubella is very dangerous for a woman and her developing baby. Most Americans are now vaccinated against

rubella (MMR vaccine) but if a woman contracts rubella during pregnancy, it can have an extremely negative
impact on her infant including:

  · Deafness
  · Heart Defect
  · Cataracts
  · Intellectual Disabilities
  · Liver and Spleen Damage
  · Low Birth-weight
  · Skin Rash

Syphilis is a sexually transmitted disease. It is especially important that women share their sexual history with
their OB/GYN to help protect their unborn baby. If a woman has syphilis, she can give birth to a baby that has
cognitive delays.

   Genital Herpes is also a sexually transmitted disease. If a baby is born vaginally, the baby can be born blind or
can tragically die during the birth process. If a baby is born by c-section, they will be absolutely fine.

   AIDS is a sexually transmitted disease that can be passed from mother to child through blood, breast milk

102 | Pregnancy Concerns
and the birth canal. If a mother is being treated for AIDS, chooses to deliver by c- section and bottle feeds, the
child's likelihood of contracting AIDS decreases dramatically (Santrock, 2013).

Other Concerns

Other parental factors that can affect a fetus are obesity, maternal nutrition, maternal age, paternal age,
emotional states and stress and maternal hormone treatments.

   On average, a woman gains 25 to 35 pounds during pregnancy. Pregnant women need to drink lots of water
and increase protein, iron, vitamin D, calcium, phosphorous and magnesium.

   Women should be careful about how much weight they gain. Maternal obesity can increase hypertension,
diabetes, respiratory complications and infections.

   It is fine to exercise during pregnancy. Women should exercise for shorter intervals and decrease intensity as
pregnancy progresses.

   Avoiding teratogens, eating healthy food, decreasing stress and participating in a frequent, low impact
exercise routine can help ensure a healthy baby and an easier birth process.

Birth

The experience of birth is a life changing event, especially for parents who are experiencing it for the first time.
   As a woman prepares for the baby's birth, Braxton Hicks contractions increase, the cervix becomes thinner,

and there is a strong desire for the pregnancy to end. Braxton Hicks contractions are a tightening in the
abdomen that comes and goes. They are contractions of your uterus in preparation for giving birth. They tone
the muscles in your uterus and may also help prepare the cervix for birth. Women may also begin nesting and
experience bursts of energy as their due date approaches.

   There are three stages of birth. The first lasts about 12 to 24 hours. Contractions begin about 15-20 minutes
apart. They occur closer together as birth nears. The cervix dilates to about 4 inches. This allows the baby to
move from the uterus to the birth canal.

   The second stage lasts approximately 45 minutes to an hour. The baby moves through the cervix and the
birth canal. Contractions come almost every minute. The baby is born!

   The third stage lasts only minutes. The placenta, umbilical cord, and other membranes are detached and
expelled.

   Women can use medicine, birthing strategies, and people to help provide support during the birthing
process.

   Doulas are professionals trained in childbirth who assist a woman before, during, and after her pregnancy.
   Mothers experience less pain, anxiety, and depression when provided with this support.
   Midwives are medically trained professionals who assist the mother prenatally and throughout the entire
birthing process. As midwives have gained popularity, many women choose to deliver in a birthing center with
a midwife attending rather than in a sterile hospital room under a doctor's care.
   There are three types of medications commonly used during the birthing process. Analgesics alleviate pain.
Anesthesia blocks pain. Oxytocics are synthetic hormones used to stimulate contractions and speed up labor.
   Natural childbirth tends to reduce a mother's pain by decreasing her fear. Prepared childbirth is like natural
childbirth, but a special breathing technique is used in the final stage of labor. The Lamaze method is the
most well-known method. Women are educated to understand what is happening with their bodies and to use
breathing/relaxation techniques to help manage the pain.
   Nearly one in four U.S. births are c-sections. The baby is removed from the uterus through an incision in the
abdomen. C-sections are procedures that are performed when the baby is breech (feet first), the head is too
large, vaginal bleeding has occurred, the baby is in distress, the mother is in distress, the mother has an STD,
the mother has had a prior c section, or in the case of multiple births.
   In today's world, many fathers are trained to coach the mother during labor and siblings are given information
prior to the birth to help address the child's emotions and behaviors in an age-appropriate way. The most
common method that places the father in the role of labor coach is the Bradley Method (Berk, 2017; Crain, 2011).

104 | Birth
After Birth

A low birth weight infant weighs less than 5.5 pounds. An extremely low birth weight infant weighs less than 2
pounds. A preterm baby is born at least three weeks early. Both preterm and low birth weight infants struggle
with lung development. Low-birth weight infants have more health and developmental problems and are more
likely to have a learning disability, ADD or ADD and breathing problems. It is important to nurture preterm
infants carefully. Massage has led to greater weight gain, improved skills, and better academic performance.
Kangaroo care is extremely important for preterm infants. This skin-to-skin contact leads to better sleeping,
more weight gain, less crying and longer periods of alertness.

   The Apgar Scale is widely used to assess health at 1 and 5 minutes after birth. This is usually administered
by the nurse and is one way to identify high-risk infants. The Apgar Scale tests skin color, pulse rate, reflexes,
activity, and respiratory effort.

   The Brazelton Neonatal Behavioral Assessment Scale is performed within 24 to 36 hours after birth. It tests
neurological development, reflexes and reactions to people.

   The Postpartum Period lasts approximately six weeks. It is the period after childbirth when the mother is
adjusting physically and psychologically.

   Involution is the time when the uterus returns to pre-pregnancy size. During the postpartum period, women
experience emotional and psychological changes including anxiety, depression and coping difficulties.
Postpartum depression is characterized by strong feelings of sadness, anxiety or despair in new mothers
including depression, changes in appetite, crying spells and an inability to sleep.

   After giving birth, a mother has a difficult decision to make-whether to stay at home or go back to work.
Societal, career and financial pressures affect mothers' options. Fathers can have difficult adjustments as well.
The father may feel the baby always comes first in the mother's mind. However, the postpartum reaction is
improved if the father attended childbirth classes and was active in the delivery. It is important that both
parents are committed to caring for the newborn. Both parents need to be aware of the young infant's
developmental needs, including physical, psychological and emotional needs. This helps them to bond with
their child. Bonding is a close physical bond between the infant and caregiver. Rooming in is one way to create
a closer bond. Rooming in is the alternative parents take to have the newborn stay in the hospital room with
them rather than the nursery to encourage closer bonding (Crain, 2011; Santrock, 2013).

     Cross Cultural Childbirth Practices Around the World

        The following are cross-cultural childbirth practices around the world. As you read about these
     practices, please consider the following questions:

          · Were you familiar with any of the following birth practices?
          · How do they differ from typical birth practices in the United States?
          · Which did you find most interesting and why?

world in a hands-on way. Infants are intrinsically             practice what they are learning." Fred

Infants are curious and want to explore the world around them and connect with the people in it. They are

"active participants in their own development, reflecting the intrinsic human drive to explore and master one's

environment" (National Research Council and Institute of Medicine 2000, 1). In this chapter we will discuss the

physical, cognitive, social, and emotional growth of infants.

Physical Development in Infancy

Healthy infants come in a range of sizes, and there is a wide
range of "normal development". That said, infant growth
tends to follow a predictable path. During infancy, children
experience the largest percentage of growth in their entire
life. Here are some general guidelines for growth in the first
year of infancy:

  · From birth to age 6 months, a baby typically grows 1/2
      to 1 inch (about 1.5 to 2.5 centimeters) a month and
      gains 5 to 7 ounces (about 140 to 200 grams) a week.
      Most babies double their birth weight by 5 months
      old.

  · From ages 6 to 12 months, a baby typically grows 3/8 inch (about 1 centimeter) a month and gains 3 to 5
      ounces (about 85 to 140 grams) a week. Most babies triple their birth weight by their first birthday.

Imagine what that growth pattern would look like as an adult! An average sized woman (150 pounds) would be
450 pounds in twelve months! It is important to realize that as infants grow physically at an exponential rate,
they also make great strides in their cognitive, social and emotional development.

   Keep in mind that many healthy babies go through brief periods when they stop gaining weight or even lose
a little weight. A doctor is only likely to be concerned if a baby doesn't gain weight from one well-baby exam to
the next. A baby's position on the curve in a growth chart isn't as important as the trend of the curve overall.

   The average North American newborn is 20 inches tall and weighs 7½ pounds. The average 2-year-old weighs
26 to 32 pounds and is 32 to 35 inches tall, almost half of their adult height. Growth slows considerably in the
second year.

   Children experience two growth patterns during infancy. The cephalocaudal pattern of growth is growth
from the head down. Children often appear "top heavy" with their heads proportionally larger than their bodies.
The proximodistal pattern of growth starts at the center of the body and moves toward extremities. Infants
have control of the trunk of their body, then their arms, then their hands and fingers (Santrock, 2013).

   The brain develops extensively in utero and during infancy. Neurons, or nerve cells, are present in the brain at
birth. Shaken baby syndrome is a cause for concern. Shaking a baby causes brain swelling and hemorrhaging.
Neurons help process information. The myelin sheath is a layer of fat that insulates nerve cells and makes
information processing happen more quickly. Experience is like little bursts of electricity to the brain, igniting
the neurons. Brain development occurs when certain areas bloom through experience. Experience helps to
develop the brain., and an infant's brain is waiting for experiences to determine connections among neurons.

   Sleep is extremely important during infancy because it helps to promote brain development. At about four
months, the infant has more adult-like sleep patterns. The length of sleep patterns is related to sleeping
arrangements and parental activities. Sharing a bed is common in many cultures; however, in the U.S. most
infants sleep in a separate crib in a separate room. Co-sleeping is discouraged because of the risk of SIDS.

   SIDS, or Sudden Infant Death Syndrome, is a condition in which an infant stops breathing, usually during the
night, and dies without apparent cause. There are increased risks if a child is of lower birthweight, has sleep
apnea, sleeps on their stomach, is exposed to cigarette smoke, has a sibling who died of SIDS, is sleeping in a
very warm room, or is using soft bedding or bumpers.

   Another crucial factor for healthy development in infants is nutrition. Healthy infants need 50 calories per day
per pound of weight. Fat is especially important for growth and brain development. Infants should not be put

                                                                                                                                  Physical Development in Infancy | 109
on a low-calorie diet. Breast milk is the ideal food for an infant although there are many healthy formula options
as well. Breast feeding is recommended because it reduces allergies and infections, lowers obesity risk, is free,
promotes cognitive growth, lowers the risk of SIDS, and fosters better visual acuity and bone density. It is often
the only safe option in poor countries where unclean water makes mixing formula impossible. There are two
serious conditions infants can develop if they are not receiving proper nutrition. They can develop marasmus,
a wasting away of body tissues in an infant's first year caused by a severe lack of protein, or kwashiorkor, a
deficiency in protein that causes the child's abdomen and feet to become swollen with water. The effects are
extremely detrimental and can even cause death.

   One way to help ensure an infant's health is to have them immunized. Immunization begins in infancy and
prevents many diseases including measles, mumps, rubella, hepatitis, and chicken pox.

   Infants' first actions are reflexes. The rooting reflex is the reaction when an infant's cheek is stroked. The
infant turns towards a food source. The sucking reflex is automatic sucking when something is placed in the
newborn's mouth. The moro reflex is a startle response that causes rapid closing of arms and legs. The grasping
reflex occurs when something touches an infant's palm and they automatically hold onto it.

                                                                                 Infants develop fine motor skills and gross motor skills in
                                                                              infancy. Fine motor skills are small muscle activities, such
                                                                              as coordinating the thumb and forefinger and reaching for
                                                                              and grasping objects. Gross motor skills are large muscle
                                                                              activities, such as pulling toys, climbing stairs, walking and
                                                                              running.

Infants reach motor milestones in diverse cultures based on opportunities. However, the variations are not
large. Milestones are reached within normal age ranges. During the sensorimotor stage (birth to 2 years), Piaget
believed that infants learned through their five senses and fine and gross motor skills. Piaget argued that
children need to have multi-sensory, hands-on experiences to better understand their world. Sensation is the
actual feeling someone has. It occurs when information contacts sensory receptors-eyes, ears, tongue, nostrils
and skin. Perception is the interpretation of sensation, what someone thinks about what they feel. The more
sensory experiences an infant has, the stronger their perceptual development. Since infants cannot talk, it is
sometimes difficult to understand how they are perceiving the world. It is known that when infants use all
five senses: sight, hearing, taste, touch and smell, they create perceptions about their experience. The more
infants interact with their world, the more they learn and grow. Caregivers can help foster a strong learning
environment by observing how infants are responding to a particular situation. Habituation occurs when an
infant becomes bored with a stimulus. Dishabituation occurs when an infant becomes reinterested after a
change in stimulation. It is the job of a caregiver to recognize when an infant requires more stimulation or needs
a break from a specific activity.

   How young do infants begin to use their five senses? Young infants have depth perception. They perceive
clear patterns as well as color. Their eyes are drawn to red as well as a clear black/white pattern. Hearing begins
in the womb. Touch and pain are experienced at birth. Smell is present shortly after birth, while taste may exist
even before birth. Since all five senses are engaged in early infancy or even before, the importance of sensory
experiences cannot be underestimated. Creating an environment that incorporates all five senses and fine and
gross motor experiences is crucial to infant development (Gordon & Browne, 2017).

Cognitive Development in Infancy

"Children have real understanding only of that which they invent themselves, and each time that we try to teach
them something too quickly, we keep them from reinventing it themselves." Jean Piaget

   The term cognitive development refers to the process of growth and change in thinking, reasoning and
understanding. Infants develop cognitively through social interactions and exploring their world. Parents,
teachers, friends and caregivers play a vital role in the cognitive development of infants. Infants who are raised
by caring, responsive adults develop cognitively at a quicker rate. Infants are "born to learn" (National Research
Council and Institute of Medicine 2000, 148) and they actively seek out opportunities in their environment to
assimilate new information.

   Piaget believed that assimilation and accommodation operate in very young infants. Cognitive changes
are qualitative at each stage. Assimilation is incorporating new information into existing schemes.
Accommodation is adjusting schemes to fit new information and experiences. Piaget believed that children
actively construct their own cognitive worlds, and providing infants with a safe, stimulating environment to
explore will encourage them to develop cognitively.

   Object permanence is an important cognitive milestone. It is the understanding that objects and events
continue to exist even when they cannot be seen, heard or touched. An example is a child playing with a stuffed
bear. When the stuffed bear is hidden, the infant begins to look for it. She realizes the object exists even though
it is out of her sight. When the stuffed dog is hidden, the infant begins to look for it. She realizes the object exists
even though it is out of her line of sight. Infants understand movement from a very early age, and if you show
them a toy that is moving in a line, then goes behind a wall or screen, they will automatically shift their gaze to
the other side of the wall to anticipate that object reappearing there!

Factors that Impact Cognitive Development

Nutrition is extremely important in infancy. It affects physical development and cognitive development.
Malnutrition limits cognitive development. A diet rich in protein and fat can have positive long-term effects in
infancy. Infants need a diet high in fat to help their brains develop. The first year of life is not the time to put an
infant on a diet. Fat feeds the infant's brain. "The disparagement of dietary fat sometimes obscures the fact that
children and adults need fat in their diets. It supplies essential fatty acids (EFA) and aids in the absorption of
fat-soluble vitamins A, D, E and K. It is a substrate for the production of hormones and mediators. Fat, especially
in infancy and early childhood, is essential for neurological development and brain function. Mother's milk and
infant formula supply 40-50% of their energy as fat." (Fidler et al. 1998).

   Universally, poverty presents a chronic stress for children and families that may interfere with successful
adjustment to developmental tasks, including school achievement. Children raised in low-income families
are at risk for academic and social problems as well as poor health and well-being, which can negatively
impact educational achievement. (Hyson, 2014) Poverty can have a negative effect on an infant's cognitive
development, but early intervention programs can prevent this negative effect. Many low-income parents
cannot provide an intellectually stimulating environment because they are spending most of their time making
sure their basic needs are met. Early Intervention and Head Start programs can help infants get the support
and stimulation they need to develop normally (Hyson, 2014).

114 | Cognitive Development in Infancy
Language

A key component of cognitive development is language development. Several theories have attempted to
explain our species' near-universal ability to learn spoken language, almost always in the absence of direct
instruction. While most of our language development takes place after birth, there are important pieces of the
puzzle that are laid down in utero. Components of spoken language:

  · Phonology: the rules that govern the shared sounds of language; includes phones (the smallest units of
      sounds) and phonemes (the smallest units of sound that can signal meaning); example: hit and hat - four
      distinct phonemes: /h/, /t/, /i/ and /a/ - but the two vowels /i/ and /a/ are the distinct phonemes that
      change the word from hit to hat (approximately 45 phonemes in English)
         o This is the first step of language development for infants;
         o Attention to sound almost from birth - strong preference for language over other sounds in the
            environment; it is as if infants are born with a sense that it is important to pay attention to what people
            are saying
         o As motor skill develops and babies can control their tongues more readily, they will begin to mimic
            sounds they have heard in their environment, often practicing them over and over.
         o Typically, infants can make vowel sounds early on, as these do not require a lot of fine muscular
            control in the mouth (try it yourself - make the vowel sounds /a/ /e/ /i/ /o/ u/ and you will notice that it is
            only the shape of your mouth that changes.
         o Usually, sounds that require less tongue control come first; back-to-front development in the mouth
            cavity "lip poppers" /b/ /p/ /m/, then sounds that involve tongue and front teeth /t/ /d/ , and then sounds
            that require specific control come later.
         o Typically blends (bl, cr, etc.) are the hardest, and they usually develop later in toddlerhood through
            preschool and even school age (Gordon & Browne, 2017; Santrock, 2013).

                                                                                                                                 Cognitive Development in Infancy | 115
  · Morphology - is the study of morphemes in a language. Morphemes are the smallest sequences of
      phonemes (units of sound) in a language that have meaning; for example, the /s/ at the end of a noun
      indicates that it is plural;
         o Theories of language development have their biggest challenge in describing how children develop
            morphological proficiency because there tends to be a common set of grammatical errors that
            children make that cannot be accounted for through experience

  · Syntax - also known as grammar; the syntax of a language is the set of rules that determine word-order in
      sentences, grammatical correctness, and the acceptability of words, phrases, and clauses.
         o This develops in a regular pattern: toddlers move from one-word utterances (holophrase hypothesis)
            to two (telegraphic speech), then three- and four-word utterances, all of which can have a range of

116 | Cognitive Development in Infancy
            meanings (often interpreted by caregivers through the context and non-verbal language of the child)
  · Semantics - the set of rules that govern the meaning of words and phrases; semantics bridges the gap

      between our perception of reality and the way we talk about that reality
         o There are socially shared meanings of every word: dog, car, bird, running, taxes, etc.
         o Semantic development entails learning the varied meanings of words and then also understanding
            how those meanings are related to the reality the speaker is trying to share (Gordon & Browne, 2017;
            Santrock, 2013)

  · Pragmatics - the intentional use of language to achieve specific outcomes; this can include the
      purposeful breaking of the rules of phonology, morphology, syntax, or semantics to make a point, or
      produce an outcome (action or thought); because pragmatics is related to the context of spoken
      language, it is sometimes considered the overarching organizing principle of language (Owens, 27)
         o Even with single word utterances from toddlers, we can see evidence of language pragmatics: any
            caregiver can tell you there are several interpretations of the word "cookie" from a 2-year-old- "I want a
            cookie." "Do we have any cookies." "I see a cookie." I see Cookie Monster. Is that a cookie you have? Etc.
         o Pragmatics helps us learn how to lie - and that is not a bad thing. Although many parents are
            dismayed when they discover that their toddler has started to lie, in many ways this behavior is a
            positive sign of healthy cognitive and linguistic development! In order to lie, the speaker needs to have
            a working proficiency in the rules of spoken language, especially semantics; they also must have the
            ability to talk about things that are not physically present or may not have ever been present; and they
            must be able to effectively consider the knowledge and thoughts of the person they are lying to. This is
            not easy to do (as we all know - sometimes it works, and sometimes it does not!)

Language Development Models

The models that seek to explain language development are not that different from the models used to
explain most other aspects of human development. They all can be reduced to one of three sources for
developmental input: Nature, Nurture, or a mix of the two. What makes theories of language development
particularly interesting are the fact that spoken language development - unlike many other things - is universal
across cultures and geographical locations, and the near impossibility of testing any one theory using truly
experimental methods. Instead, these theories have been informed by careful observation and
quasiexperimentation across language users.

Behavioral Theories

Behavioral Theories of language are firmly based in the "nurture" camp of developmental theories. The basic
premise of this theory stems from B.F Skinner's theory of operant conditioning, which states that all behavior is
learned and modified through the consequences of that behavior - either a reward or a punishment. According
to behavioral theories, learning language is no different from any other learning in childhood.

   Language is learned through a series of reinforcements or corrections by more competent speakers, typically
parents and other adults. In this model, the child attempts an utterance which is then either confirmed by the
adult to reinforce the speech behavior or corrected by the adult to modify it.

   For example, imagine a child who is given a ball:

                                                                                                                                 Cognitive Development in Infancy | 117
If the child says:  Then the adult will respond:            And the outcome will be:
Ball!               That's right! It's a ball!
Apple!              No, that is not an apple; it's a ball.  The behavior is confirmed and will be
                                                            repeated

                                                            The behavior is weakened and is less
                                                            likely to be repeated.

                                                                  According to the behavioral model of language acquisition, this is
                                                                  how language development proceeds, with each language
                                                                  behavior being either strengthened or weakened through
                                                                  feedback from a competent speaker. There are certainly examples
                                                                  of language development where this happens, and there is
                                                                  evidence that parents and other caregivers routinely correct
                                                                  children's language production in this manner. However, this
                                                                  theory alone cannot explain the rich variety of language use in
                                                                  early childhood. One of the main criticisms of this theory is that it
                                                                  cannot explain two of the most intriguing elements of language
                                                                  development: how quickly it happens, and how children can say
                                                                  things they have never heard before. If language were behaviorally
                                                                  conditioned, it would take an entire lifetime for children to develop
                                                                  proficiency in spoken language since every component would
                                                                  have to be learned through trial-and-error with competent
                                                                  feedback. Instead, children become competent speakers of their
                                                                  native languages in an average of five years. During that time, they
also say many things they have never heard before, including made-up words [like goed for went], incorrect
pronunciations of real words, and completely novel sentences (and sometimes whole stories!) In short,
behavioral theories explain one aspect of how competent speakers help the language development process
along by giving real-time feedback, but they can't explain most of language production in early childhood.

Psycholinguistic Models of Language Development

On the opposite end of the nature-nurture spectrum is the psycholinguistic-syntactic model of language
development. In this family of theories, the underlying assumption is that language development must be
driven by some innate, biological force - possibly even a physical structure in the brain. This theory attempts to
explain how language acquisition can be universal among all humans even if the languages we learn can vary
so much. There are thousands of languages spoken on this planet, and we can learn any one of them!

   When trying to explain human universals, most of the time a biological explanation is helpful because it works
around cultural differences. Adding in the possibility of an innate structure in the brain designed specifically for
language acquisition is also helpful; it provides an explanation for how quickly young children learn the sounds
and rules of spoken language, which can be extremely complicated. One early version of the psycholinguistic
theory of language development was proposed by Noam Chomsky. He theorized that infants were born with a
specific area or module in the brain, called the Language Acquisition Device (LAD), that was there specifically
to ensure the development of spoken language. The LAD was described as a universal, genetic attribute that
allowed anyone to learn any language and helped explain many of the gaps in the behavioral model.

   The LAD would be like a switchboard, with individual switches for phonemes, morphemes, and syntax. At
birth, the infant's brain starts immediately listening for language input in the environment - people talking.
What the infant hears helps the LAD decide which way to flip a switch. For phonemes, if certain sounds are
never heard, those switches do not get turned on. With syntax, hearing sentences spoken helps the LAD

118 | Cognitive Development in Infancy
determine that it should be set to a subject-verb-object word order for English and not a subject-object-verb
order, as in Korean.

   Although this theory helps fill in many of the gaps in other models, it still falls short of being able to explain
the range of situations in which language is developed. Plus, increasingly refined techniques for viewing the
brain in action, such as functional MRI, have failed to show any evidence for the LAD as described by Chomsky.
Instead, it seems that language development is another example of nature AND nurture, not versus.

Sociolinguistic Models

At the halfway point between nature and nurture lie the sociolinguistic models of language development. As
you probably already have guessed, this family of theories recognizes that while the brain structure is important
- after all, there are specific areas of the brain that process and create language - human interaction is also
essential.

   From the second chapter of this book, you should recall Vygotsky's theory and the emphasis he placed on the
balance between children's internal cognitive development (what they are ready to do independently) and the
challenge that can be provided by the environment (what children can do with help). Sociolinguistic models
are like this. These models recognize that large parts of language acquisition are socially supported, particularly
semantics and pragmatics. This makes sense; these are the two aspects of language that are most necessary for
social interaction. Semantics, or word meanings, need to be socially shared for words to make sense. Imagine if
we all used a different word for mayonnaise - ordering a sandwich would be an interesting surprise every time!
Pragmatics is how we use language to create shared thoughts and emotions, and to get people to do what we
want them to. For example, saying "I don't want mayonnaise on my sandwich" when a friend gets out the

   Miracle Whip tells them what you really mean is "That's gross!").
   Researchers into language development now routinely assume that language acquisition is a balance of
nature and nurture. Yes, most children will learn spoken language just by being around people who are talking,
which means there must be some strong, internal force that guides the brain to pay attention and develop
this ability. However, stories of children who are not exposed to spoken language and are never able to learn it
later in life give good evidence for the deep need for social interaction; hearing it at a distance is not enough
- infants and babies need to be a part of the social interactions in which language is used. These findings give
compelling evidence that language acquisition is both nature and nurture!

Language Development from Conception through Birth

The womb is not soundproof. The developing fetus hears muffled versions of the sounds of the outside world -
none so clearly and regularly as the sounds of the mother's speech. As the fetal brain develops, it is stimulated
by these sounds and becomes accustomed to hearing specific voices and sounds, which the newborn will
actively respond to once out and about in the world.

   During gestation, the areas of the brain which will later become adept at processing and producing language
are just developing, using the ambient sounds of the environment as early input.

   Recall from the chapter on Brain Development that some neural networks are "experience expectant." In that
chapter, we discussed the visual system, and how infants are born with the basic framework but need input
from the environment to complete the development of those neural pathways. It is possible that language is a
similar system, where the neural foundation is laid during gestation with some ambient input, but the system
is not fully functional until a significant amount of language experience takes place after birth.

                                                                                                                                 Cognitive Development in Infancy | 119
Language Development from Birth to 15 months (Infants)

Infants' and toddlers' effortless development of spoken language has led to several theories seeking to explain
how this acquisition occurs, and which environmental or innate features drive the development.

   Skinner and the other Behaviorists were not entirely wrong when they claimed that children learn language
from competent adults, and that it is through a system of feedback that children refine their language use.
Although this theory cannot explain everything about language acquisition, it does help us to understand the
importance of some of the earliest language that children are exposed to.

Conversational Patterns

If you have ever spent time with a pre-lingual baby, you have probably engaged in the critical practice of
patterning conversation - and you probably did it without even realizing that you were engaging in a major
developmental process. As babies begin to babble, they not only start to experiment with the phones of the
languages they hear, but also with the intonations and speech patterns of the speakers around them. Mothers,
fathers, and other caregivers are important first models not just for the sounds of speech, but also for the back
and forth of conversation.

   It is a common Western practice for adults to "talk" to babies long before the infant can respond in
conventional speech, yet in these conversations the babies often do a lot of the talking! Caregivers, parents, and
other adults frequently engage in the practice of modeling by responding to babies' speech as if it were in fact
comprehensible language, and then taking turns to allow the baby to "talk" more. Imagine the quite common
scenario of a parent making dinner while the infant rests in a bouncy chair on a nearby countertop or in a swing.
The baby babbles away, watching the parent prepare dinner. As the baby pauses in speech, the parent takes the
opportunity to "respond" to what the infant has been "saying." Perhaps the parent describes what he is doing
or agrees with the baby- "You're right, we should have added more garlic!" The parent then pauses, giving the
baby a chance to babble another "response" in the conversational chain, to which the parent again replies. This
time the parent asks a question ("Do you think the puppy would like these scraps?") or disagrees with what the
baby has said ("Oh, I don't know - that seems like a lot of cheese for one person...") and so on, in

   direct response to the inflection, volume, or facial expressions of the baby as she "talks."
   These episodes of modeling conversation are essential for helping infants figure out not only what the sounds
of their language are, but also how language can be used between two people. In each exchange, the infant
is exposed to a repetition of the phonemes of the language around her, helping her brain to narrow down the
range of possible sounds that can be speech. This also helps the infant to more reliably mark the boundaries
of words and phrases. Finally, this provides critical information about the patterns of discourse, including how
users share conversational responsibilities (if you pause, then it is my turn to talk).
   Although we tend to think of language as a cognitive process, it has a very real set of physical constraints. As
newborns, babies' brains are already tuned in to the language around them, and they quickly begin to pick up
sounds in their environment. It does not take long before infants are trying out those sounds, babbling away
to themselves while their parents are trying to get them to go to sleep! Over hours of practice, infants become
increasingly adept at forming sounds, at imitating speech patterns, and at attempting individual words. But
as all of that is happening, there is a lot of physical growth that must also occur. At birth, an infant's tongue
is disproportionately large for the mouth, and the musculature that is necessary for speech hasn't developed
fully. But over the course of the first year of life, these physical barriers to speech are resolved and by the time
they are a year old, most babies have one or two words they produce reliably along with a diverse collection of
almost-words that are the baby's developing attempts at spoken language.
   How does language develop in infancy? Crying is present at birth. It signals distress. Cooing begins at about

120 | Cognitive Development in Infancy
1 to 2 months. Babbling occurs in the middle of the first year. (Ma Ma, Da Da) Gestures begin at about 8 to 12
months. This is about the same for children who can hear and children who are deaf. From birth to 6 months,
infants are "citizens of the word". They recognize most sound changes in any language. After 6 months, infants
learn their own language and gradually lose the ability to recognize sound changes in other languages.

   The first words occur between 10 to 15 months. The holophrase hypothesis states that there is a time when
infants say one word that implies a whole sentence. (For example, "juice" means "I would like some juice in my
sippy cup.") Infants understand about 50 words at 13 months (receptive language) but they are unable to say
them until about 18 months (spoken vocabulary).

   Children have a huge amount of growth in language from 18 months to 2 years. This is called the vocabulary
spurt. They speak 50 words at 18 months and 200 words at two years. Toddlers use short and precise two-word
utterances to communicate-telegraphic speech. Biology influences language development. Human language
is about 100,000 years old and is strongly influenced by biology. The vocal apparatus has evolved over the years.
The brain plays a large role in language development. Aphasia is brain damage that involves a loss of ability to
use words. Broca's area is the brain's left frontal lobe that directs the muscle movements involved in speech
production. Wernicke's area is in the brain's left hemisphere. It is involved in language comprehension.

   Noam Chomsky believes that humans are biologically prewired to learn language. Children are born with
a language acquisition device (LAD), a biological ability to learn language. Children all over the world reach
language milestones at the same time.

   However, there is a critical period for learning language. One of the most famous examples of this is the story
of Genie, a girl who suffered severe emotional abuse and neglect. She was kept in a closet for many years and
was never spoken to. At age 14 she was finally rescued and placed in a loving home with many people working
together to help her. Even after years of professional interventions she was never able to progress past the stage
of toddler speech. She had passed the critical period and was stunted in her growth. She was only able to learn
to speak 50 words and was unable to combine them into full sentences.

   Preschoolers experience rapid language learning. Critics argue that learning continues beyond preschool. The
behavioral view states that language is a complex skill which is learned and reinforced. Biology cannot explain
creativity or the orderliness of language; individual differences exist.

   Environmental influences impact children's language development as well. Parents' talkativeness, vocabulary
and level of language is linked to children's vocabulary growth. Parents often use child directed speech. This
is spoken in a higher pitch than normal with simple words and sentences. It holds an infant's attention and
maintains communication.

   Other strategies used to encourage infant speech include recasting, rephrasing what a child says, expanding,
adding more sophisticated vocabulary to what a child says, and labeling, assigning and identifying objects by
name.

   Parents can stimulate infants' language development by being an active conversational partner, talking as if
an infant understands what you are saying, and using a comfortable language style.

   Parents can stimulate toddlers' language development by being an active listener, using comfortable
language while expanding language abilities, avoiding sexual stereotypes, and resisting making comparisons.

   The interactionist view of language development states that biology and sociocultural experiences contribute
to language development. Parents and teachers construct a language acquisition support system. Children
acquire native language without explicit teaching. Children learn by modeling their parents' language.

Imitation

Imitation is a powerful way for children to learn. Newborns love to imitate facial expressions and vocalizations.
Through reciprocal socialization, adults interact with infants and infants learn to respond back by imitating

                                                                                                                                 Cognitive Development in Infancy | 121
what they have seen/heard. Infants engage in both immediate imitation and delayed imitation. When a parent
sticks out their tongue and the infant responds by doing the same, this is an example of immediate imitation.
When an infant covers a doll with a blanket a few hours after watching her parent do so, that is an example of
delayed imitation. Children imitate the language that they hear. Being raised in a language-rich environment
allows the infant to imitate the wide range of words they are exposed to.

Memory

The capacity to remember things an infant has been exposed to allows them to learn language, interact with
familiar adults and understand how objects work. As infants get older, they can remember information for
longer periods of time.

Social and Emotional Development in
Infancy

Infants are emotional beings. Although they can't use language to express their feelings and emotions, they are
extremely sensitive to other people's emotional states. Understanding what an emotion is and how to respond
to an infant's emotional state is crucial.

   An emotion is a feeling or an affect. It can be positive or negative. It varies in intensity and is influenced by
one's perceptions. Functionalists believe that emotions are relational and are linked with an individual's goals.

   There are two broad types of emotions. Primary emotions are present in humans and animals. They appear
within the first 6 months of life. They include surprise, anger, joy, sadness, and fear. Emotions promote caregiver-
infant interactions.

   Self-conscious emotions require cognition. Empathy, jealousy and embarrassment first appear at about 1 ½
years old. Pride, shame and guilt first appear at about 2 ½ years.

   Crying is the first way an infant communicates. There are three types of crying: a basic cry, an anger cry,
and a pain cry. An attentive caregiver can recognize why infants are crying and quickly respond to their needs.
There is a controversy among experts about how to respond to a crying infant. Some believe a quick response is
important in developing a strong caregiver-infant bond. This helps to develop trust and security. Others believe
that a quick response increases and reinforces crying and spoils the child. Young infants cry to communicate
their needs and quickly responding creates trust. Swaddling and massaging can also help to soothe a crying
infant.

   There are two types of smiling: a reflexive smile and a social smile. A reflexive smile happens during the first
month after birth, usually during sleep. A social smile appears at about 2 to 3 months of age. A child responds
to an external stimulus, often responding to faces.

   Fear first appears at about 6 months of age. Stranger anxiety is a fear of strangers. It intensifies from 9 to
12 months. Separation protest is distress at being separated from a caregiver. It peaks at about 15 months in
infancy.

   Social referencing is reading emotional cues in others to help determine how to act in a particular situation.
Infants "check" with a parent or caregiver before acting in a social situation.

   It is important that over time an infant learns to self-soothe. Infants often use a transitional object (a teddy
bear, a blanket) to make the transition from being dependent to independent. When an infant moves from
relying on a caregiver to learning self-soothing strategies, they exhibit emotional regulation.

   Temperament is one's behavioral style and characteristic emotional response. There are three basic
temperaments: easy, difficult, and slow to warm up. An easy child has a positive mood and adapts easily. A
difficult child is negative, cries often and adapts slowly. A slow-to-warm- up child has a low activity level, low
adaptability and intensity of mood. Physiological characteristics are associated with different temperaments.
It is important that parents consider children's temperaments when choosing caregivers. Goodness of fit is a
match between a child's temperament and environmental demands. It is important to pay attention to and
show respect for individuality. When considering a child's temperament, it is important to structure the child's
environment, carefully choose caregivers, and avoid labeling.

   To be emotionally secure, an infant must learn to trust. Erikson believed that trust vs. mistrust is the most
important stage in development (birth to one year). Infants experience the world as either secure and
comfortable or insecure and uncomfortable. If a child learns to trust their caregiver in their first year of life,
they will be more comfortable throughout their childhood. Erikson believed that the first year is the key year
for attachment, and Freud agreed. However, Erikson believed that attachment was formed with the person
an infant trusted the most (Erikson, 1956). Freud believed that infants become attached to the person giving

                                                                                                              Social and Emotional Development in Infancy | 123
oral satisfaction. Some developmentalists believe secure attachment in the first year provides an important
foundation for psychological development. Others believe too much emphasis is placed on attachment in
infancy (Santrock, 2013).

   The transition to parenthood can be an emotional time for parents as well. New parents must adapt to having
the responsibility of a new life as well as new demands on time, finances and changing roles. While both parents
can be excited about the new baby, it still can have an impact on a marriage. The family functions as a system.
Marital relations, parenting and infant behavior all impact each other. If a newborn is extremely difficult, that
can put a strain on the marriage. If parents have different beliefs about parenting, that can cause stress as well.
It is important that parents work together to be on the same page about parenting strategies. If parents are
feeling stress, the infant is going to feel that stress as well. Mothers and fathers also typically interact differently
with a child even when they are both competent caregivers. Mothers focus more on caring for the children and
meeting their basic needs, while fathers are more likely to center on play activities.

   Infants develop socially through interactions with the people in their environment. Reciprocal socialization is
the term used to describe activities in which children interact with an adult and an adult interacts with a child.
This includes eye-to-eye contact and a great deal of language. When a parent speaks to a child and a child coos
back, that is an example of reciprocal socialization. Parents can also support their infants through scaffolding.
Scaffolding is the support that a parent gives a child until they can do something independently. For example,
when children are learning to walk, they first grip their parent's hands tightly. Then they hold on to one finger of
each hand. Next, they may take a tentative first step and fall into their parents' arms. Finally, parents may take
a few steps back encouraging children to walk independently. Scaffolding provides the child with the correct
support needed to learn a new skill in a supportive environment.

                                                                                 Often parents need to go back to work while their child is
                                                                              still an infant. There are five types of parental leave:
                                                                              maternity leave, parental leave, child-rearing leave and
                                                                              family leave, but rarely does a parent receive leave with pay
                                                                              throughout infancy. Choosing a safe, educational

                                                                              can seem to be a daunting task. High quality childcare is
                                                                              characterized by small group sizes, low adult-child ratios,
                                                                              teachers with specialized training, and caregiver sensitivity

                                                                              to positive outcomes. To raise an infant who is emotionally
                                                                              secure, it is important to keep in mind the effect of quality
parenting on a child's development. Parents must make good parenting decisions, spend a great deal of time
interacting with their children (reciprocal socialization), teach their children to self-soothe, monitor their
children's development, and take time to find the best childcare.

CHAPTER SEVEN: TODDLERS (15 MONTHS
TO 3 YEARS)

     After completing Chapter Seven students will be able to:

          · Discuss physical development and growth in toddlerhood
          · Describe the importance of play
          · Summarize Piaget's theory of toddler development
          · Describe how toddlers learn and remember
          · Discuss specific safety concerns for toddlers
          · Describe the nature of language and how it develops in toddlerhood
          · Discuss emotional and personality development in toddlerhood
          · Explain how social contexts influence the toddler's social and emotional development

                                                   A child's first birthday is a big celebration! Beyond the cake, this moment
                                                   should also be savored as the calm before the storm. Once a child turns one,
                                                   if they are not walking already, the child will soon be walking and then
                                                   running! This is the year of independence as a child develops autonomy-a
                                                   sense of self. Autonomy in early childhood means letting children know that
                                                   they have control over themselves and the choices that they make. With the
                                                   new independence that walking brings, there is also a tumultuous
                                                   ambivalence that can be challenging for those in a child's life. Temper
                                                   tantrums emerge because of this ambivalence. Although exhausting for
                                                   parents and caregivers, the life of a toddler also brings excitement and joy as
                                                   they watch their rapid development and growth over the next couple of
                                                   years. Welcome to toddlerhood!

                                                                              triple their birth weight and on average, between 28 and 32
                                                                              inches. By age two, the weight has quadrupled. This makes
                                                                              the average two-year-old between 20 and 40 pounds. Boys
                                                                              reach about 50 percent and girls 53 percent of their adult
                                                                              height by age two (Santrock, 2013).

                                                                                 Genetic factors play a major role in determining a child's
                                                                              growth pattern, especially for height and to a lesser extent
                                                                              for weight. Generally, tall parents have children who are tall
                                                                              and short parents have children who are short.

                                                                                 The conditions in which children are raised also influence
                                                                              growth patterns. Children who do not receive adequate
nutrition during their early years do not achieve optimal height. They are also at risk for developmental delays
and other health concerns due to the lack of adequate nutrients needed to sustain physical growth and brain
development.
   Physically, a toddler at 18 months (about 1 and a half years) is walking and even running. They are able to pull
toys while walking. Toddlers can help undress themselves, drink from a cup, and start to eat with a spoon. They
are climbing stairs with assistance.

Bowel and Bladder Control

During the first year of life, infants do not have control over the muscles involved in elimination. They also lack
awareness of the physical signs that signal the need for elimination. It is not until the middle of the second
year when children may begin to make the connection between the feelings of impending elimination and
their outcome. At the end of the second year or the beginning of the third year the potential for toilet training
emerges. Control over bowel movements is usually accomplished earlier than bladder control.

   When to begin toilet training is a serious concern for many parents. It is important to remember that there is a
wide range of individual differences when children will be trained and when they are physically and emotionally
ready for this milestone in development. Most children learn to control their bladders and bowels when they
are ready, just as they learned to sit and walk. Starting to train a child before he or she is ready can potentially
lengthen the process and lead to emotional distress for both the child and parents/caregivers. Only four percent
of children are potty trained by age two. One of the key signs of developmental readiness is if a child stays dry for
at least two hours. They also need to have the ability to walk independently and remove clothing necessary to
use the potty. Approximately 60 percent of children are trained by age three. Only approximately 2 percent are
not trained by age four. Girls are generally able to meet this developmental milestone earlier than boys (Berk,
2017).

                                                                                                                               Physical Development for Toddlers | 127
Safety Concerns

It is very important to make sure that toddlers, just like infants, are supervised at all times. Toddlers are at risk
for many types of accidents including falling down stairs, drowning, and getting hit by cars if they wander
off. Parents need to make sure that their homes are toddler-proofed. Electrical outlets need to be covered.
Hazardous materials such as chemicals and household cleaners need to be stored out of reach and ideally
locked up out of harm's way. Medication needs to be made inaccessible as well as access to any firearms that a
family may own. Toddlers are fast. They also have Houdini-like skills when it comes to escape and getting into
things that they shouldn't have access to. As a toddler learns to walk, they will also begin the art of climbing. If
the child is still sleeping in a crib, mattresses should be at their lowest setting and monitored closely because
the toddler will soon learn to climb out of cribs and playpens. Caution near water is another area of concern.
Toddlers can drown in as little as an inch of water. Children under age five have the highest risk of drowning,
with death rates of nearly 3 per 100,000 in 2010 according to the Centers for Disease Control (CDC). Swimming
pools are the most common place where children under five drown each year. Car seat safety is also of critical
importance.

Car Seat Safety

Car seat safety is of utmost importance. Many toddlers spend a considerable amount of time in a motor vehicle.
According to the Centers for Disease Control (CDC, 2018), white children are more likely to be buckled up than
black or Hispanic children. From 2001 to 2010, approximately 1 in 5 child passenger deaths in the United States
involved drunk driving. Sixty-five percent of the time it was the child's own driver that had been drinking
(CDC, 2018). Restraint use among young children often depends upon the driver's seat belt use. Almost 40%
of children riding with unbelted drivers were themselves unrestrained. Child restraint systems are often used
incorrectly. An estimated 46% of car and booster seats (59% of car seats and 20% of booster seats) are misused in
a way that could reduce their effectiveness (CDC, 2018). Children should remain in rear-facing car seats until age
2 or when they reach the upper weight or height limit of that seat (CDC, 2018). All children 2 years old, or those
younger than 2 years old who have outgrown the rear-facing weight or height limit for their car seat, should use
a forward-facing car seat with a harness for as long as possible, up to the highest weight or height allowed by
the manufacturer of their child safety seat (CDC, 2018). Car seat installation should be completed by a trained
professional. Many local police and fire stations offer this service free of charge to help ensure that car seats are
installed properly. Proper car seat installation significantly helps protect a child in the event of a motor vehicle
accident.

Immunizations

Today, most children in the United States lead much healthier lives and parents live with much less anxiety
and worry over infections during childhood. Immunizations are one of the success stories of modern medicine.
Parents often wonder if vaccinations are worth putting their young child through the distress of receiving
vaccinations or the potential side effects. The answer from the vast majority of medical experts is a resounding
"yes." The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP)
recommend that healthy children get vaccinated against 14 diseases by age 2 (with boosters later for some),

128 | Physical Development for Toddlers
along with an annual inoculation against the flu. The government supports vaccines so strongly that any
uninsured child can walk into a clinic and get his or her shots for free.

   Despite doctors' reassurances and mounting evidence that underscores the safety and value of vaccination,
many educated, dedicated parents are still wary of vaccines or strongly opposed to them. Although the national
immunization rate has remained stable over the past decade (76 percent of children ages 19 to 35 months were
up to date on all of their shots in 2008), that's still short of the government's goal of 80 percent. In some parts
of the United States, a rising number of parents are delaying shots for their children or skipping certain ones
altogether, citing religious or philosophical exemptions from state laws that require children to be vaccinated
in order to attend school. As a result, there have been recent outbreaks of serious diseases that vaccines
had virtually wiped out in the U.S., including measles, mumps, pertussis (whooping cough), and haemophilus
influenzae type b (Hib), which was once the most common cause of bacterial meningitis in children under 5
(CDC, 2023).

   What scares parents most about inoculations is that there are some who believe that their child's autism
was caused by immunizations. Some believe that the increased number of vaccines are to blame for the rise in
children with autism spectrum disorders (ASD). The idea first made headlines in 1998, when Andrew Wakefield,
M.D., a British gastroenterologist, published a study of 12 children in The Lancet that linked the measles,
mumps, and rubella (MMR) combination vaccine with intestinal problems that he believed led to autism. The
following year, the American Academy of Pediatrics issued a warning about thimerosal, the mercury-containing
preservative that was found in most vaccines. Though it didn't mention autism specifically, it suggested that
the use of vaccines with thimerosal could theoretically push an infant's total exposure of mercury, a neurotoxin,
above safe limits, and it recommended that the preservative be removed from shots. The vaccine-autism
hypothesis was solidly in the mainstream by the time actress Jenny McCarthy went public with her belief that
vaccines caused her son's autism, describing in heartbreaking detail how "the soul left his eyes" on a 2007
segment of the The Oprah Show.

   Caregivers can rest assured, however, since at least seven large studies in major medical journals have now
found no association between the MMR vaccine and ASD and The Lancet officially retracted Dr. Wakefield's
original paper. In March, the U.S. Court of Federal Claims, Office of Special Masters, a group of judges appointed
to handle cases of families who believe immunizations were responsible for their child's autism, ruled that
thimerosal in vaccines does not increase the risk of the disorder. Several demographic analyses have also found
that autism rates continued to rise even after thimerosal was removed from all vaccines except some flu shots
(AAP, 2018).

   Any association of ASD characteristics emergence with the timing of vaccines is almost certainly coincidental.
Children get their first dose of the MMR vaccine at 12 to 15 months, the age at which autism symptoms typically
become noticeable. Some autism activists now believe that we shouldn't even be performing more studies
about a possible vaccine connection because they take attention and money away from important research
that is investigating other potential causes of the disorder which has reached alarming numbers in the past
decade.

Cognitive Development for Toddlers

Did you know that 80% of a child's brain develops by the age of three years old? It is during these early years
of development that a child's brain begins to develop memory, language, thinking, and reasoning skills. They
learn by imitating the behavior of others, especially adults and older children. It can also be a challenging time
as children begin to show defiant behavior and set out to explore the world around them.

   During the toddler years, a child's ability to play pretend emerges. At 18 months, it is a simple ability, such
as feeding a doll. By the end of this period (3 years), a child's ability to pretend play has become much more
elaborate. As stated in chapter two, Erikson's psychosocial theory has eight stages. Erikson claims that human
motivation is social. During the first year of life, infants experience trust vs. mistrust. Erikson stated that this
was the most important stage in development. If infants learn to trust their caregivers, they will feel confident
to explore their world independently. During the second stage, autonomy vs. shame and doubt, ages 1 to 3,
toddlers and young preschoolers want to be independent. You often hear them saying, "Me do it." They get
frustrated and may feel shame and doubt when they are unsuccessful. It is important to provide them with
opportunities to accomplish tasks independently-for example, providing small pitchers so they can pour their
own milk and clothing that they can put on independently.

   According to Piaget, toddlers remain in the sensorimotor stage of development through approximately 24
months or two years of age. From 12 to 18 months, toddlers become creative problem solvers. For the first
time, they are able to apply entirely new strategies to solve problems rather than simply using combinations of
previously used schemes. Their creativity during this stage stems from their use of tertiary circular reactions, in
which toddlers make subtle modifications in their behavior so as to explore the effects of those modifications.
The ability to utilize tertiary circular reactions provides toddlers with the means to learn from their actions
(Piaget, 1955).

   The final stage of the sensorimotor period involves the emergence of symbolic representation and the use of
mental symbols to represent objects. Toddlers develop the ability to imagine the acts of a sequence of events to
discover the outcome. This is the emergence of their problem-solving abilities, which will continue to develop
throughout childhood.

   Joint attention between caregiver and child is critical during the toddler phase of development. It facilitates
cognitive development through a sharing of focus, allowing the toddler to learn how to interpret and
understand interactions with others. Caregivers who are sensitive and responsive to a child's needs and focus
with the child on a shared task assist the child in their cognitive development.

First Sentences: Language Development in Toddlerhood

Between 12 and 18 months, toddlers add about three words per month to their vocabularies. After 18 to 24
months, a vocabulary explosion often takes place, which adds a multitude of words at a rapid rate of acquisition.
At about 18 months, many children begin to produce sequences of words. They are usually separated by long
pauses. By the end of the second year, these sequences give way to true sentences. Toddlers shift from using
holophrases (single-word utterances that convey as much meaning as a whole sentence) to actual sentences
with multiple words strung together. This shift is one of the tremendous accomplishments of the toddler years.

130 | Cognitive Development for Toddlers
Social and Emotional Development for
Toddlers

At 18 months, a toddler has met many developmental milestones. In the social/emotional domain, they like to
hand things to others and will often point to show others something of interest to them. A child at 18 months
may be afraid of strangers, shows affection to familiar people, and explores alone but still prefers a parent or
caregiver close by. They may cling to caregivers in new situations.

   Temper tantrums are a normal part of toddler development. Saying and shaking one's head "no" is common
during the toddler stage. At 18 months, a child has several single words that they can say. Their vocabulary will
expand rapidly over the next several years.

Biting

Biting is a very common behavior among toddlers. It brings a source of stress to parents and caregivers alike in
trying to determine what is causing the biting behavior. Children bite in order to cope with a challenge or fulfill
a need. For example, a child may be biting to express a strong feeling (like frustration), to communicate a need
for personal space (maybe another child is standing too close), or to satisfy a need for oral stimulation. Trying to
understand the underlying cause of the biting will help develop an effective response (zerotothree.org).

   There are many reasons why toddlers might bite. The following list includes some of the most common
reasons, with the most common being a lack of language skills necessary for expressing important needs or
strong feelings like anger, frustration, or joy. Biting is a substitute for the messages toddlers can't yet express in
words, such as "I am so mad at you," "You are standing too close to me," "I am really excited," or "I want to play
with you."

   Biting could also be the result of :

  · Being overwhelmed by the sounds, light, or activity level in this setting
  · Experimentation to see what will happen
  · The need for more active playtime
  · Being over-tired
  · Teething
  · Having a need for oral stimulation

Helping to understand the reasons a child is biting will help caregivers develop a plan to address the underlying
needs the child has that are not being met (Crain, 2011).

Hitting/Scratching and Temper Tantrums

Most toddlers get aggressive sometimes. Tantrums and aggressive behaviors such as hitting, kicking,
scratching, and biting are all behaviors that are exhibited by children at some point during this phase of
development.

   An aggressive young child, at least up to the age of three, is not being `bad' or disobedient. The child is trying

                                                                                                            Social and Emotional Development for Toddlers | 131
to communicate and hasn't yet developed the language skills or emotional habits to express themselves more
effectively. Another possibility is that the child does not feel that they are being heard, and violence is the only
way to get their caregiver's attention.

   Toddler aggression usually happens when a little one is not getting what they want, whether that want
is reasonable (food, attention, a cuddle), or not (candy, someone else's toy, something dangerous). Context
matters. Quite predictably, toddlers are more likely to be aggressive when they're tired, worried, not feeling
well, hungry, or otherwise stressed. The caregiver can help remedy a difficult situation by looking at it from
the toddler's point of view. Hitting, scratching, and temper tantrums are the reactions that often express the
powerlessness of being a toddler

2-3 Year Milestones

Are the terrible twos a universal experience?

Contrary to the experience of many Western parents, the "terrible twos" is not a universal phenomenon. In fact,
it is much less dramatic and even completely absent in some cultures. The Aka in central Africa, for example,
have a culture in which infants are doted on and held by both mother and father and then transition easily to
playing alone or with siblings, peers, and others in their villages. Behaviors such as playing with machetes and
spears are not only tolerated but often encouraged.

   Similarly, research into Guatemalan mothering practices found that if there was a situation where an older
sibling or older peer had a desired toy that the toddler wanted, the Guatemalan mother insisted that the toy
be given over to the toddler. Although this may be seen as overly indulgent by standards in the United States,
the terrible twos are not an experienced phenomenon in this culture. The Guatemalan mothers' approach
seems to be more reflective of cultural values of collectivism and interdependence. It is interesting to think
about whether the experience of tantrums in two-year-olds in American culture reflects a cultural emphasis on

Physical Development in Early Childhood

Growth in Height and Weight

Children continue to grow greatly during early childhood. The average child grows 2 ½ inches and gains
between 5 and 7 pounds a year. Each year as they grow older, their increases in height and weight decrease.
Growth patterns are affected by genetics, growth hormones and environmental factors. Some reasons for
unusually small children are genetic problems, prenatal problems, physical problems in early childhood and
emotional problems. Deprivation dwarfism is a condition in which children who are deprived of attention do
not grow at a normal rate. This deprivation affects the release of hormones by the pituitary gland.

   Girls are slightly smaller and lighter than boys during the preschool years, and most children have lost their
"top heavy" look. Boys gain muscle and girls gain fatty tissue during this time. Children are fascinated by their
bodies. They are constantly asking questions about their bodies and are beginning to understand the physical
differences between boys and girls. Two developmentally appropriate books to share with children are "The
Body Good" by Claire Raynor and "Blood and Guts" by Linda Allison.

Brain Development

The brain and the head experience the fastest growth in the body. It is 75% of adult size by age 3 and 90% of
adult size by age 5. It is interesting to note that at age five a child's body is only 1/3 of adult size. The top parts
of the head, the eyes and the brain grow faster than the jaw. Nerve endings continue to grow into adolescence.
Myelination refers to the process by which nerve cells are insulated. Myenilation makes information process
more quickly. It occurs in the areas of the brain related to hand/eye coordination at 4 years old and in the areas
related to attention in middle childhood. It is interesting to think about the pressure we put on children to
spend large amounts of time sitting and focusing in preschool when their brains need more active learning to
develop.

   There are also structural changes in the brain. The brain undergoes dramatic anatomical changes between
ages 3 and 15. Some areas almost double in size, and the purge of unneeded cells follows up to the age of 4.
Frontal lobe growth occurs between 3 and 6 years of age, and temporal and parietal lobes from age 6 through
puberty (Berk, 2017; Hyson, 2014).

Signs of Vision Problems

It is important for children to have regular vision screening before age 3. Treatment before age 6 can prevent
vision loss. It can sometimes be difficult to discern if a child is having vision problems. Some signs to look for
are tilting of the head, squinting, irritability when asked to complete tasks that require long distance vision,
rubbing the eyes, shutting and covering one eye, excessive blinking, and headaches. Two eye conditions that
many children suffer are functional amblyopia and strabismus. Functional amblyopia, also called lazy eye, is an
eye defect that occurs when one eye is not used as much as the other eye to avoid the discomfort of double
vision. It is caused by imbalanced eye muscles. Strabismus is misalignment of the eyes (CDC, 2022).

                                                                                                                     Physical Development in Early Childhood | 137
Gross Motor Skills

                                                                              Preschoolers have the highest activity level of any age in
                                                                              the life span. They need daily exercise, and good programs
                                                                              with creativity and free movement. Exercise increases
                                                                              physical and visual awareness. Children's gross motor skills
                                                                              develop when they use the large muscles of their body. At
                                                                              age 3, children enjoy simple movements such as hopping,
                                                                              jumping, running back and forth, throwing a ball
                                                                              underhand, catching a large ball and catching a bounced
                                                                              ball. At age 4, children become more adventurous and love
                                                                              to climb. They can kick a ball towards a target, bounce a ball
under control, hop on one foot four times and come down stairs with one foot on each step. At age 5, children
run hard, enjoy races, kick a rolling ball, skip using alternating feet, roller skate, jump rope, ride a two-wheeled
bike with training wheels and are adventurous and try hair-raising stunts in climbing. Some gross motor ideas
to incorporate into a preschool classroom are:
  · Beam Walking
  · Daily Fitness Activities
  · Creative Movement With Music
  · Moving To A Steady Beat
  · Including Language Activities (over, under, around)
  · Including Perceptual Activities (copying teacher's movements)
Remember that children are not able to sit still! (Hyson, 2014)

Fine Motor Skills

Fine motor skills are subtler movement skills in children's hands and fingers. At age 3, children are still clumsy at
picking things up with their thumb and forefinger. They have difficulty placing pieces in a puzzle but are adept
at building block towers. At age 4, their coordination has improved and is more precise. They are much better at
puzzles. At age 5, the hand, arm, and body all move together well. Children want to build a more detailed block
structure. Hand strengthening activities are important during this time. Finger painting, squeezing stress balls,

138 | Physical Development in Early Childhood
tearing paper, manipulating windup toys and spray bottles can all strengthen children's hands, which will lead
to increased fine motor skills for when children are learning to write (Gestwicki, 2017; Shaffer, 2000).

Young Children's Artistic Drawings

Art provides a hands-on approach to problem solving skills; it reinforces ideas of scale, space, motion and
distance. Child art reflects inventive problem solving. Developmental changes depend on talent, motivation,
familial support and cultural values. It flourishes in sociocultural contexts where tools are available and art
activity is valued.

   Rhoda Kellogg is a preschool teacher who has observed and guided young children's artistic efforts for many
years. She has collected over 2,000 samples of drawings produced by preschool children. She documented that
children's art is ordered, structured and meaningful. She outlines five stages of artistic development:

                                                   Basic Scribbles: a child's first attempts at drawing

                                                   Placement: age 2-3, drawings are patterns placed on
                                                   the page

                                                                                                                     Physical Development in Early Childhood | 139
                                                   Shape Stage: age 3, drawings consist of diagrams in
                                                   different shapes

                                                   Design Stage: age 3-4, two basic shapes mix into more
                                                   complex designs

                                                   Pictoral Stage: age 4-5, drawings of objects adults can
                                                   recognize
(Berk, 2017; Santrock, 2013; Jensen & Arnett, 2019).
140 | Physical Development in Early Childhood
Handedness

People argue about whether handedness is determined at birth. Some believe it is genetically inherited. Others
believe it develops in early childhood. Right-handedness is dominant in all cultures. Hand preference may occur
in the womb. Many preschoolers use both hands before preference develops later.

   Approximately 95% of right-handed individuals process speech primarily in the left hemisphere. Left-handed
individuals show more variation in processing and are more likely to have reading problems.

   Left-handers are more common among mathematicians, musicians, architects and artists (Berk, 2017;
Santrock, 2013; Jensen & Arnett, 2019).

Sleep and Sleep Problems

By preschool, most young children sleep through the night. Many use transitional objects: stuffed animals,
blankets, etc. to help them sleep independently. Sometimes sleep can be interrupted by nightmares, night
terrors and somnambulism. Nightmares are frightening dreams that usually wake the sleeper. Night terrors
are characterized by sudden arousal and are extremely intense. Somnambulism is sleep walking (Berk, 2017;
Santrock, 2013; Jensen & Arnett, 2019).

Nutrition

Proper nutrition is extremely important in early childhood. Energy/calorie needs increase with age. Diets should
be well balanced. Young children should avoid excessive fast food, fat and sugar. This can be difficult as children
grow older and are exposed to different types of food. Children's diets worsen with age. Parents should be
persistent in exposing children to the right foods. They should avoid giving children sweets at snack times and
set limits on certain foods. Childhood obesity is on the rise. The average American child consumes almost 2
pounds of sugar a week! Be aware of hidden sugar in juices, cereals, granola bars, ketchup and crackers. Lifelong
eating habits are determined in early childhood.

   Sweets, snacks and fussy eaters: Many eating problems carry over from toddler years. It is important to allow
a child to eat in any order/combination, let the meal end when the child has had enough, keep mealtimes
enjoyable, and not use food as a reward or punishment.

   Obesity in children: The percentage of obese children is increasing. It is important to encourage children to
make independent and better choices. Childhood obesity affects health problems. Obesity is linked to poor self-
esteem. Caregivers should center life around activities, not meals, and keep children active.

   Malnutrition is linked to many aspects of development: iron deficiency anemia, cognitive deficits, aggressive
and hyperactive behavior. Underfed children tend to receive less supervision, stimulation and education.

Accident Prevention

Accidents are the leading cause of death in children ages 1 through 4. Most accidents occur in the bathtub or in
the car. Many injuries can be prevented. Caregivers should always use car seats and lock up guns. They should
childproof home and playground and make sure playground equipment is well constructed (CDC, 2022).

Cognitive Development in Early
Childhood

     Learning Objectives

          · What cognitive changes occur in early childhood?
          · How do young children develop language?
          · What are some important features of early childhood education?

Piaget's Preoperational Stage: Operations are an internalized set of actions. During the preoperational stage,
stable concepts are formed. Mental reasoning and magical beliefs emerge. Egocentrism strengthens, then
weakens. Thought is still flawed and not well organized.

   The symbolic function substage is the first substage of preoperational thought. It occurs between the ages
of 2 to 4. The child gains an ability to mentally represent an object not present. Drawings are imaginative.

   There are two limitations on preoperational thought. Egocentrism is a child's inability to distinguish between
one's own perspective and someone else's. Animism is the belief that inanimate objects have lifelike qualities
and are capable of action.

   The intuitive thought substage occurs between 4 and 7 years of age. Children begin to use primitive
reasoning and seek answers to all sorts of questions. Centration and conservation occur during this stage.
Centration is the focusing of attention on one characteristic to the exclusion of all others. Conservation realizes
that altering an object's substance does not change it quantitatively (Berk, 2017; Santrock, 2013; Jensen & Arnett,
2019).

                                                                                                                   Cognitive Development in Early Childhood | 143
Vygotsky's Theory of Development

Vygotsky believed that children actively construct their knowledge and understanding. Their ways of thinking
develop primarily through social interaction. He believed that all members of a classroom could be both
teachers and learners. He theorized that each child has a zone of proximal development at each stage in
their learning. The Zone of Proximal Development has two limits: the lower limit is what a child can achieve
independently, and the upper limit is what can be achieved with the guidance and assistance of adults or more
skilled children. Vygotsky introduced the notion of scaffolding in instruction, which is changing the level of
support over the course of a teaching session to fit the child's current performance level. Guided participation
is used to stretch and support children's understanding of skills.

   Language and thought: Children use language to plan, guide, and monitor their behavior. Private speech
(self-talk) is an early transition to being more socially communicative. It is used more when tasks are difficult
(Berk, 2017; Santrock, 2013; Jensen & Arnett, 2019).

144 | Cognitive Development in Early Childhood
Teaching Strategies Vygotsky Would Agree With

Use a child's zone of proximal development
   Use more skilled peers as teachers
   Monitor and encourage private speech
   Effectively assess the child's zone of proximal development
   Place instruction in a meaningful context
   Transform the classroom to encourage group learning (Berk, 2017; Santrock, 2013; Jensen & Arnett, 2019).

Vygotsky vs. Piaget

Vygotsky is a social constructivist; Piaget is a cognitive constructivist.
   In Vygotsky's theory, no general stages of development are proposed. In Piaget's theory, there is a strong

emphasis on stages of development: sensorimotor, preoperational, concrete operation and formal operational.
   Vygotsky believed that language shapes thought; Piaget believed that language has a small role. Thought

directs language.
   Vygotsky believed that education plays a central role in helping children learn about culture. Piaget believed

that education just refined the child's skills that had already emerged.
   Vygotsky believed that a teacher is a facilitator and guide and that it was important to provide many

opportunities for children to learn with a teacher and more skilled peers. Piaget also viewed the teacher as the
facilitator and guide, someone to provide support for children to explore their world and discover knowledge
(Berk, 2017; Santrock, 2013; Jensen & Arnett, 2019).

Literacy in Early Childhood Education

Literacy is the understanding of language. Literacy encompasses reading, writing, listening and speaking.
Children develop literacy when they have the opportunity to speak, when they have active language partners,
and when they are read to.

Nourishing the Young Child's Cognitive Development

Caregivers should provide opportunities for young children to develop symbolic thought by encouraging
exploration

   Being an active language partner
   Being sensitive to the child's level of cognitive functioning: what they can do with and without your help.
   Evaluating the quality of the child's early childhood programs.

Social and Emotional Development in
Preschool

     Learning Objectives

          · What characterizes young children's socioemotional development?
          · What roles do families play in young children's development?
          · How are peer relations, play and television involved in young children's development?

Emotional Development

Emotions are strong feelings deriving from one's circumstances, mood, or relationships with others. Self-
conscious (evaluative) emotions first appear at about 2½ years. Pride is felt when a successful outcome results
in joy. Guilt results from judging efforts as failure. Emotional development is heavily influenced by parents'
responses.

   Young Children's Understanding of Emotions: From ages 4 to 5 children show increased ability to reflect on
emotions. Self-regulation of emotions continues. Parents play an important role in its development through
emotional coaching by nurturing and using praise. Emotional dismissal is when a parent ignores and denies.
Emotions also play a big role in peer relations. Moody, negative children experience greater peer rejection.
Emotionally positive children are popular. Children controlling emotional responses are more likely to show
social competence (Gordon & Browne, 2017; Hyson, 2014).

Moral Development

Moral Development refers to rules and regulations about what people should do in interactions with other
people. Piaget extensively researched children. He wrote about two distinct stages of how children think about
morality.

   Here is a chart outlining Piaget's Theory of Moral Development, heteronomous morality and autonomous
morality.

   Imminent justice is the belief that if a rule is broken, punishment will be meted out immediately. This is
characteristic of heteronomous morality. Autonomous morality realizes that punishment is not inevitable.

                                                                                                          Social and Emotional Development in Preschool | 147
Gender

Gender is the social and psychological dimension of being male or female. A gender role is a set of expectations
of how females or males should think, act, and feel. Gender typing is a process for acquiring thoughts, feelings
and behaviors considered appropriate for one's gender in their culture. There are many things that impact
children's beliefs about gender.

Peer Influence

Gender plays an important role in interaction with peers. Children prefer same-sex groups by age 3, and this
preference increases through age 12. Gender also impacts social situations. Boys in preschool engage in rough
and tumble play and are very competitive. Girls engage in collaborative discourse. More time in same-sex
groups is linked to more gender-stereotyped behavior (Berk, 2017).

148 | Social and Emotional Development in Preschool
Teacher Influence

Teachers also have a strong influence on beliefs about gender. Boys' academic problems tend to be ignored
more frequently. They experience more learning problems, receive more criticism, and are more likely to be
stereotyped as having a behavior problem. Teachers often spend more time disciplining boys and more time
giving girls academic tasks to complete.

School and Media Influences

On television, females are often portrayed as less competent. Most prime-time characters are male and
traditional roles are reinforced. Most advertising continues to reflect traditional roles.

   Gender Schema organizes the world in terms of female and male. Children gradually develop schemas of
what is gender-appropriate and gender-inappropriate in their culture.

   Socialization is also influenced by parenting styles, sibling relationships and the context of the family
structure.

   There are four different parenting styles:

  · Authoritative: clear expectations, firm consequences
  · Authoritarian: harsh, strict punishment, child does not have a voice
  · Neglectful: uninvolved, disinterested
  · Indulgent: no limits, caregiver gives child everything they ask for (Jensen & Arnett, 2019).

Child Abuse

Punishment sometimes leads to abuse. Types of maltreatment, which include physical maltreatment, child
neglect, and sexual and emotional abuse, are all causes for concern. Here are some warning signs to be aware
of: questionable patterns of injuries, age-inappropriate sexual knowledge, poor hygiene, food hoarding, and
stealing and behavioral extremes.

   Developmental consequences of abuse: Poor emotional regulation, attachment and peer relation problems,
school difficulties, psychological problems and a later risk of violence and substance abuse. As a teacher, you
are a mandated reporter and legally you must report any suspicion of abuse.

   Sibling relationships and birth order: Sibling relationships can be both pleasant and aggressive. Siblings treat
children differently than parents do. Extensive sibling conflict can be linked to poor outcomes. Birth order can
affect sibling relationships.

Importance of Play

Play is a pleasurable activity engaged in for its own sake. It can increase health, release tensions and help
children control conflicts. Play also helps with cognitive development. Therapists often use play therapy to help
children work through problems.

                                                                                                          Social and Emotional Development in Preschool | 149
Social Development in Preschool: Friendship

In infancy and toddlerhood, social interactions with peers are often limited to proximity and to parents' choice.
However, upon entering preschool, children suddenly have the chance to play with new peers, in new settings.
Unlike early playdates, which are closely monitored and in which parents may choose to intervene to redirect
play and to initiate cooperative play, in preschool, children are more likely to be encouraged to play with one
another without a great deal of adult guidance, for the purpose of creating social skills.

   In a new setting, with new peers, there is often a pattern to the development of social interactions.
   Preschool children will not always follow these exact phases, but they are most common and early childhood
educators can use this pattern to help set up their classroom for new students, to help move them through the
stages.
   Nonsocial Play: It may seem counterintuitive, but the first type of play that many preschool students engage
in is "nonsocial", which just means that children play at the same time and perhaps even in the same area, but
their play is self-centered. Even in a group of 4-5 children, you may see each child playing with an individual toy,
talking to themselves and not one another, and following an internal plan for the play that is not shared with or
dependent on what any of the other children are doing.
   Parallel Play: As preschoolers become more accustomed to the group setting of the classroom, their play
begins to be more social as well. Parallel play describes activities that children participate in while physically
near each other and often using the same toys, but the intention is still mostly internal, and the social aspect
occurs only in an effort to share (or not share) space and objects. For example, two children may be playing
in a block center with the same set of blocks, but each is building a separate structure that is not a shared
project. This sort of play is an important first step in helping children understand how to share resources (toys
and space) and to become aware of other children in their environment. This period of parallel play can be
challenging for children who have limited experience with same-age peers because they may not be used to
having to negotiate sharing toys with other children who also don't know how to navigate this new social world!
   Associative Play: As preschool children get better at parallel play, they will gradually start to incorporate one
another into games and activities. This might start out as joining their two block towers or sharing crayons
during an art project. The intention of the play may not yet be shared since each child likely has his or her own
ideas about what the purpose of the game is; however, they are working together more overtly and are probably
speaking to one another to figure out next steps (Gordon & Brown, 2017. This language is likely to be directive
"Give me that." as opposed to negotiating phrases such as "should we use that block?")
   Cooperative Play: Finally, as preschool children settle into the rhythm of group play and social interactions,
they become more comfortable and able to talk to peers. They develop more cognitive awareness of their own
intentions, and play becomes cooperative. At this stage, children are playing together intentionally, sharing
objects and purpose for games and activities. They may be making up games with shared rules or planning
projects together. Now the block building is a joint effort to make the tallest tower, with language being used to
negotiate how that will be done. Games have rules, although those may be questioned and changed repeatedly
as play goes on!
   Television, Prosocial Behavior and Aggression: Watching too much television can cause aggression. Children
who watch less television are more likely to engage in prosocial behavior, develop higher level cognitive skills
and experience greater achievement (Gordon & Brown, 2017; Shaffer, 2000).

Physical Development in School Age

Overall Physical Growth

Rates of growth generally slow during the early school years. Typically, a child will gain 5-7 pounds a year and
grow about 2-3 inches per year (Kuczmarski, 2000). They also tend to slim down and gain muscle strength
and lung capacity making it possible to engage in strenuous physical activity for long periods of time. Boys
typically outperform girls during this period in gross motor tasks such as learning to ride a bicycle. Girls typically
outperform boys during this period in fine motor tasks such as stringing beads or cutting one's fingernails.

Brain Growth

During these early school years, children gain greater control over the movements of their bodies. Between ages
6 and 8, significant improvements in fine motor skills and eye-hand coordination are noted. They are able to
master many gross and fine motor skills that eluded the younger child. There is a brain growth spurt between
the ages of 6 and 8. Another factor related to brain growth is that between the ages of 6 and 12, the nerve cells
in the areas of the brain associated with motor planning become almost completely myelinated. Children are
better able to plan and coordinate activities using both the right and left hemispheres of the brain and are
beginning to be able to control emotional outbursts. The ability to pay attention also improves as a function of
continued maturation of the prefrontal cortex (Berk, 2017; Santrock, 2013).

Sports

                                                                                 Children between the ages of 5 and 8 are often exposed
                                                                              to organized sports for the first time. It is also common for
                                                                              parents to give their children the opportunity to engage in
                                                                              other organized physical activities such as martial arts,
                                                                              horseback riding, gymnastics, or dance. The most popular
                                                                              organized sport for youth in America is soccer. Over three
                                                                              million children play soccer in the United States (United
                                                                              States Youth Soccer, 2018). Soccer is an activity that
                                                                              promises to help children build social skills, improve
                                                                              athleticism, and learn a sense of competition. Too much

                                                                              many children desiring to quit. The focus for soccer and
                                                                              other youth sports and activities should be on building a
love for the game or activity and allowing children to foster their natural talents.
   Some of the researched benefits of children's participation in sports include better academic performance,
improved physical and emotional development, and higher levels of satisfaction with family and overall quality
of life.

                                                                                                                            Physical Development in School Age | 153
   Sabo & Veliz (2008) found in their study on children's sports in the United States that gender, disability,
ethnicity, poverty, and location all play a role in limiting opportunities for sports participation. Children living in
suburban neighborhoods were more likely to participate in sports than those living in urban areas. Caucasian
boys and girls participated in sports at higher rates than minority children.

Cognitive Development in School Age

Cognitive Growth

Once children reach the age of 5-8 (school-age), they are more able to place themselves in other people's
shoes maturely. Along with that, their imaginations and perceptive way of thinking also develop immensely
during these years. A child's genuine enthusiasm to learn unfolds while they also strive to gain self-confidence.
Children during this age are also developing the cognitive skills that allow them to learn to read, an important
developmental milestone that occurs in most children by age eight. This varies greatly among children. With so
many milestones, it is important to remember that many things need to be in place developmentally before a
child can read. In Finland, which has in recent years been hailed as the country with one of the best educational
systems in the world, children do not begin school until age seven. Despite this, Finnish students score higher
in reading comprehension than students from the United States at age 15. This child centered approach with
no formal academic instruction during the early years of childhood is an important consideration for schools
across the globe (Sahlberg, 2021). Earlier is not necessarily better. Children in the early school aged years still
need lots of opportunities to play and create with open-ended materials.

   Secondly, children at this age disclose genuine enthusiasm to learn new things while striving to gain self-
confidence. They are open to embracing the necessary skills to understand the world and others around them.

   When they enter their 8th year, children can articulate their feelings properly. Also, they can solve various
problems verbally and with a range of ideas.

7-8 Year Olds

When the children cross over the 7-8-year-old threshold, their attention span grows greater. They also willingly
take responsibility for doing chores. The understanding of fractions and space concepts heightens during this
time. Children understand the concept of money by the age of eight. They can also tell time by reading a clock.
Remembering the names of days and months becomes easier for them (Santrock, 2017).

The Emergence of Concrete Operational Thought

During Piaget's preoperational stage, children are learning to think symbolically about the world. Cognitive
skills continue to expand throughout childhood as thought processes become more logical and organized
when dealing with concrete information. As they transition from the preoperational stage into the concrete
operational stage, children understand concepts such as past, present, and future. This gives them the ability to
plan and work toward goals. Additionally, they can process more complex ideas such as addition, subtraction,
and cause-and-effect relationships (Berk, 2017).

   Children between the ages of 7 and 11 are in what Piaget calls the concrete operational stage of cognitive
development. This stage involves mastering the use of logic in concrete ways. The child in this stage of
development can understand principles of cause and effect, size, and distance (Piaget, 1955).

                                                                                                                          Cognitive Development in School Age | 155
Inductive Reasoning

Inductive reasoning applies a "bottom to top" approach to logic. It allows the person to detect regularities,
rules, or generalizations and, conversely, to detect irregularities. It is one way in which we structure our world,
Deductive reasoning applies a "top to bottom" approach. With deductive reasoning, if a statement's premises
are true, the conclusion must be true. But with the inductive form, even if the premises are true, that doesn't
mean the conclusion must be true. Inductive reasoning increases during this stage of development and
continues to grow into adulthood (Berninger & Richards, 2002). It is significant because it reflects a child's
increasing understanding of the world around them.

Language & Literacy Development

By the time children enter the formal schooling years beginning in kindergarten, they have mastered many of
the basic building blocks of language. They have a large vocabulary, understand how to communicate many of
their needs to others, adjust their speech for their listeners, and use many grammatical rules in their speech.
Their language skills will continue to become more refined during the upcoming years, but the changes are
subtler than they were during the preschool years. Compared to the preschool-aged child, the school-aged
child can communicate more effectively over a broader range of contexts. A significant accomplishment also
occurs during these years... children learn to read!

Intelligence

Traditional View of Intelligence

The first tests of intelligence were developed by Alfred Binet and Theodore Simon at the beginning of the
twentieth century. The reason these tests were designed was to differentiate between those children who
would benefit from standard schooling versus those who might need special types of instruction. Intelligence
Quotient (IQ) was originally used to express the relationship between the number of items passed and the
child's age. More recently, a child is compared to children of the same age. This method assumes that IQ is
equally distributed across the population, with most people falling in average ranges, and fewer people falling
in the upper and lower ends of the scale. Children who score 100, for example, have an IQ equal to or greater
than that of 50 percent of children of the same age (Santrock, 2013).

   For many children, especially those with strong verbal abilities, IQ tests have been able to predict school
achievement and success. They have also helped identify children who may need extra support in school. They
have limited value in predicting life success. They have been questioned and even banned for use in school
placement in many states. There are many reasons why IQ tests have been questioned, but one of the primary
ones has been due to their inherent cultural bias. They test material that is more important or familiar to people
from one culture than people from another. This has caused a disproportionate number of children from racial
minorities to be placed in special education. Today it is widely recognized that the assumptions underlying IQ
tests are flawed and that it is best to conduct a more holistic assessment of the child and their functioning.
(Santrock, 2013).

156 | Cognitive Development in School Age
Gardner's Theory of Multiple Intelligences

Multiple Intelligence (MI) Theory is widely recognized as a more holistic approach to viewing an individual's
abilities and strengths. It was the result of a synthesis of research on human cognition and a response to the
psychologist Piaget who viewed intellect as a single entity (Armstrong, 2018).

   Intelligence Defined
   The term intelligence, as defined by Gardner, is "a biopsychological potential to process information that
can be activated in a cultural setting to solve problems or create products that are of value in a culture"
(Gardner,1999, p.33).
   Here is an overview of the eight intelligences Gardner (1993) has researched and whose existence he has
documented:
   Linguistic (Word Smart): The ability to think in words, and use language effectively, either in writing or orally.
The ability to reflect on the use of language in daily life (Gardner, 2006).
   Logical-Mathematical (Math Smart): The capacity to use numbers effectively and reason well. Sensitivity to
cause and effect functions, patterns, calculation, hypothesis, inference, generalization, problem solving, and
categorization (Gardner, 1993).
   Spatial (Art Smart): The ability to see the visual world accurately. To think in pictures, three-dimensions, and
involves sensitivity to form, space, color, line, and shape. The ability to effectively orient oneself in space and
manipulate objects in meaningful ways (Gardner, 2006).
   Bodily-Kinesthetic (Body Smart): Involves specific physical skills such as coordination, balance, dexterity,
strength, flexibility and speed. The ability to use one's body in expressing ideas and feelings and the ability to
use one's hands to transform or produce things (Gardner, 1993).
   Musical (Music Smart): The capacity to recognize, create and reproduce music by using an instrument or
voice. Involves sensitivity to rhythm, tone, pitch, timbre, melody, and emotions of a musical piece (Gardner,
2006).
   Interpersonal (People Smart): Intelligence that is about thinking and understanding another person. The
ability to distinguish the moods, motivations, and intentions of others by being sensitive to facial expressions,
voice, gestures, and cues. It involves working and interacting effectively with others in a variety of circumstances
(Gardner, 2006).
   Intrapersonal (Self-Smart): The ability to understand oneself. The awareness of one's strengths, and
weaknesses, and the ability to plan in such a way that personal goals can be achieved. The capacity to reflect
and monitor one's thoughts, feelings, emotions, and self-esteem effectively (Gardner, 2006).
   Naturalist (Nature Smart): The capacity for understanding the natural world, including plants and animals,
sensitivity to other natural phenomena such as cloud formation and mountains. The naturalist can discriminate
between nonliving forms. They can also interact positively with living creatures and decipher patterns in life
cycles and ecological relationships (Gardner, 2006).
   MI Theory is now taught in educational institutions around the globe as a framework for best teaching
practices. Teachers incorporate the approach into their lessons for students of all ages and in all curriculum
areas. Entire schools have adopted an MI approach in how they approach curriculum and assessment
(Armstrong, 2009; Buckley, 2019). It has been demonstrated that the use of multiple intelligences enhances
instruction for children with and without documented disabilities as well as for English Language Learners
(Armstrong, 2018; Buckley, 2019).

                                                                                                                          Cognitive Development in School Age | 157
When Development Looks Atypical

In order to best be able to identify a child who may have a developmental difference, it is important to have a
strong understanding of what typical development looks like. This is what this entire book intends to give the
reader!

   The early years of school are often when developmental red flags may emerge.
   If you are an educator, parent, or practitioner, what should you do? There are three important steps to
consider.
   The first step is to ask questions about a child's development and health history.
   Does the child have a history of any health problems? Even common ear infections, if frequent, can delay
speech development.
   Has the child been hospitalized? Has a vision and hearing screening been conducted?
   The second step is to document what you are seeing. The importance of documentation cannot be
understated. Record observations, the reports of others and information regarding developmental milestones
that have been met or are emerging.
   The final step is to communicate. If you are a parent concerned with your child's development, share your
concerns with others, including your child's pediatrician and educators. If you are an educator or caregiver,
share your concerns with the child's parents or guardians. Ongoing communication is critical.
   If concerns seem warranted, have the child referred for a full developmental evaluation. Many developmental
challenges are best addressed with early intervention.
   Early supports for a young child who needs them provides the opportunity for the best long-term outcomes
for a child.

CONCLUSION

We hope that you have found this textbook helpful in your understanding of young children and their
development. We have not gone into detail on a child's development once a child reaches beyond what
becomes known as middle- childhood or school-aged, nor have we gone into detail on atypical development.
Our hope is that this textbook serves as solid foundation in better understanding what early childhood
development encompasses and that the student of early childhood education desires to continually learn more!
More and more research continues to support the fact that the early years of a child's life are the most critical
years in a child's life. Working with young children for decades and now guiding the next generation of early
childhood educators continues to bring both of great joy. Thank you for your commitment to young children
and their families. The work you are doing will make a difference for generations to come.
