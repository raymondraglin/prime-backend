Introduction

Research assignments--resulting in final products such as research papers, essays, posters, multimedia
projects, blog posts, 3-D models, etc.--are a common requirement in college courses, but they can also be a
source of stress when you aren't sure what to do. This guide is intended to decrease your stress and increase
your comfort with such assignments.

                   Think of research as an exploration, with unexpected twists and turns.

  TIP: Decoding Writing Assignments

  Professors steeped only in the research traditions of their own discipline may be unaware of how different
  conducting research can be in other disciplines. They may assume you already know what they expect for
  the research assignment they just gave you. But that may not be true at all: you may only know about how
  to conduct research in another discipline or, especially if you've been taking courses in multiple disciplines,
  be utterly confused because the expectations seem to change from course to course. This handout from the
  Ohio State University Writing Center can help you figure out what you need to do for your assignment.
1 | Introduction
Throughout this guide, we try to make more explicit some things less often talked about in class in order to "fill
in the blanks." The sections are ordered, more or less, as though you are conducting a research project while
you're reading them--from developing research questions through using sources in your writing. In between,
you will learn how to figure out which sources to look for, how to find them, and how to evaluate them.
You'll also find information you may find helpful to help you navigate other questions--copyright, the fair use
exception to copyright, and more.

Conversation Balloons?

The balloon graphics used throughout this guide are a reminder that you are entering the scholarly
conversation when you do research and write about it. That conversation has been going on for many centuries.
Now it's your turn to join in.

This guide features colorful conversation balloons to emphasize that you are entering the scholarly conversation when you do research and write about it.

                                                                                                                                                                   Introduction | 2

1. The Purpose of Research Questions

                          Research questions are very important.

Both professional researchers and successful student researchers develop research questions. That's because
research questions are more than handy tools; they are essential to the research process.
By defining exactly what the researcher is trying to find out, these questions influence most of the rest of the
steps taken to conduct the research. That's true even if the research is not for academic purposes but for other
areas of our lives.
For instance, if you're seeking information about a health problem in order to learn whether you have anything
to worry about, research questions will make it possible for you to more effectively decide whether to seek
medical help-and how quickly.
Or, if you're researching a potential employer, having developed and used research questions will mean you're
able to more confidently decide whether to apply for an internship or job there.
The confidence you'll have when making such decisions will come from knowing that the information they're
based on was gathered by conscious thought rather than serendipity and whim.

                                                                                                                              1. The Purpose of Research Questions | 4
2. Narrowing a Topic

For many students, having to start with a research question is the biggest difference between how they did
research in high school and how they are required to carry out their college research projects. It's a process of
working from the outside in: you start with the world of all possible topics (or your assigned topic) and narrow
down until you've focused your interest enough to be able to tell precisely what you want to find out, instead of
only what you want to "write about."
Process of Narrowing a Topic

Visualize narrowing a topic as starting with all possible topics and choosing narrower and narrower subsets until you have a specific enough topic to form a
research question.

All Possible Topics -You'll need to narrow your topic in order to do research effectively. Without specific areas of
focus, it will be hard to even know where to begin.
Assigned Topics - When professors assign a topic you have to narrow, they have already started the narrowing
process. Narrowing a topic means making some part of it more specific. Ideas about a narrower topic can come
from anywhere. Often, a narrower topic boils down to deciding what's interesting to you. One way to get ideas
is to read background information from a source like Wikipedia.
Topic Narrowed by Initial Exploration - It's wise to do some more reading about that narrower topic to a) learn
more about it and b) learn specialized terms used by professionals and scholars who study it.
5 | 2. Narrowing a Topic
Topic Narrowed to Research Question(s) - A research question defines exactly what you are trying to find out.
It will influence most of the steps you take to conduct the research.

          ACTIVITY: Which Topic Is Narrower?
          When we talk about narrowing a topic, we're talking about making it more specific. You can
          make it more specific by singling out at least one part or aspect of the original to decrease the
          scope of the original. Now here's some practice for you to test your understanding.

Why Narrow a Topic?

Once you have a need for research--say, an assignment--you may need to prowl around a bit online to explore
the topic and figure out what you actually want to find out and write about.
For instance, maybe your assignment is to develop a poster about the season "spring" for an introductory
horticulture course. The instructor expects you to narrow that topic to something you are interested in and that
is related to your class.

                                                                                                                                                        2. Narrowing a Topic | 6
Another way to view a narrowed topic is as a sliver of the whole topic.

Ideas about a narrower topic can come from anywhere. In this case, a narrower topic boils down to deciding
what's interesting to you about "spring" that is related to what you're learning in your horticulture class and
small enough to manage in the time you have.
One way to get ideas would be to read about spring in Wikipedia, looking for things that seem interesting and
relevant to your class, and then letting one thing lead to another as you keep reading and thinking about likely
possibilities that are more narrow than the enormous "spring" topic. (Be sure to pay attention to the references
at the bottom of most Wikipedia pages and pursue any that look interesting. Your instructor is not likely to let
you cite Wikipedia, but those references may be citable scholarly sources that you could eventually decide to
use.)
Or, instead, if it is spring at the time you could start by just looking around, admire the blooming trees on
campus, and decide you'd like your poster to be about bud development on your favorites, the crabapple trees.
What you're actually doing to narrow your topic is making at least one aspect of your topic more specific. For
instance, assume your topic is the maintenance of the 130 miles of sidewalks on OSU's Columbus campus. If you
made maintenance more specific, your narrower topic might be snow removal on Columbus OSU's sidewalks.
If instead, you made the 130 miles of sidewalks more specific, your narrower topic might be maintenance of the
sidewalks on all sides of Mirror Lake.

Anna Narrows Her Topic and Works on a Research Question

The Situation: Anna, an undergraduate, has been assigned a research paper on Antarctica. Her professor
expects students to (1) narrow the topic on something more specific about Antarctica because they won't have
time to cover that whole topic. Then they are to (2) come up with a research question that their paper will
answer.

The professor explained that the research question should be something they are interested in answering and
that it must be more complicated than what they could answer with a quick Google search. He also said that
research questions often, but not always, start with either the word "how" or "why."

What you should do:

1. Read what Anna is thinking below as she tries to do the assignment.
2. After the reading, answer the questions at the end of the monologue in your own mind.
3. Check your answers with ours at the end of Anna's interior monologue.
4. Keep this demonstration in mind the next time you are in Anna's spot, and you can mimic her actions and

     think about your own topic.

Anna's Interior Monologue

Okay, I am going to have to write something--a research paper--about Antarctica. I don't know anything about
that place--I think it's a continent. I can't think of a single thing I've ever wanted to know about Antarctica. How
will I come up with a research question about that place? Calls for Wikipedia, I guess.

At https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antarctica. Just skimming.
Pretty boring stuff. Oh, look- Antarctica's a desert! I guess
"desert" doesn't have to do with heat. That's interesting.
What else could it have to do with? Maybe lack of
precipitation? But there's lots of snow and ice there. Have
to think about that--what makes a desert a desert?

It says one to five thousand people live there in research     A desert?
stations. Year-round. Definitely, the last thing I'd ever do.
"...there is no evidence that it was seen by humans until the
19th century." I never thought about whether anybody
lived in Antarctica first, before the scientists and stuff.

Lots of names--explorer, explorer... boring. It says Amundson reached the South Pole first. Who's Amundson?
But wait. It says, "One month later, the doomed Scott Expedition reached the pole." Doomed? Doomed is always
interesting. Where's more about the Scott Expedition? I'm going to use that Control-F technique and type in
Scott to see if I can find more about him on this page. Nothing beyond that one sentence shows up. Why would
they have just that one sentence? I'll have to click on the Scott Expedition link.

                                                                          2. Narrowing a Topic | 8
                          But it gives me a page called Terra Nova Expedition. What
                          does that have to do with Scott? And just who was Scott?
                          And why was his expedition doomed? There he is in a
                          photo before going to Antarctica. Guess he was English.
                          Other photos show him and his team in the snow. Oh, the
                          expedition was named Terra Nova after the ship they sailed
                          this time--in 1911. Scott had been there earlier on another
                          ship.

Terra Nova...             Lots of stuff about preparing for the trip. Then stuff about
                          expedition journeys once they were in Antarctica. Not very
                          exciting--nothing about being doomed. I don't want to
                          write about this stuff.

                                                                               Wait. The last paragraph of the first section says "For many
years after his death, Scott's status as a tragic hero was unchallenged," but then it says that in the 20th-century
people looked closer at the expedition's management and at whether Scott and some of his team could be
personally blamed for the catastrophe. That "remains controversial," it says. Catastrophe? Personally blamed?
Hmm.

Back to skimming. It all seems horrible to me. They actually planned to kill their ponies for meat, so when they
actually did it, it was no surprise. Everything was extremely difficult. And then when they arrived at the South
Pole, they found that the explorer Amundsen had beaten them. Must have been a big disappointment.

The homeward march was even worse. The weather got worse. The dog sleds that were supposed to meet
them periodically with supplies didn't show up. Or maybe the Scott group was lost and didn't go to the right
meeting places. Maybe that's what that earlier statement meant about whether the decisions that were made
were good ones. Scott's diary said the crystallized snow made it seem like they were pushing and pulling the
sledges through dry sand.

                          It says that before things turned really bad (really bad?
                          You've already had to eat your horses!), Scott allowed his
                          men to put 30 pounds of rocks with fossils on the sledges
                          they were pushing and dragging. Now was that sensible?
                          The men had to push or pull those sledges themselves.
                          What if it was those rocks that actually doomed those
                          men?

Rocks?!                   But here it says that those rocks are the proof of
                          continental drift. So how did they know those rocks were
                          so important? Was that knowledge worth their lives?
                          Could they have known?

                                                                               Wow-there is drama on this page! Scott's diary is quoted
                                                                               about their troubles on the expedition--the relentless cold,
frostbite, and the deaths of their dogs. One entry tells of a guy on Scott's team "now with hands as well as feet
pretty well useless" voluntarily leaving the tent and walking to his death. The diary says that the team member's
last words were "I am just going outside and may be some time." Ha!

They all seem lost and desperate but still have those sledges. Why would you keep pulling and pushing those
sledges containing an extra 30 pounds of rock when you are so desperate and every step is life or death?

9 | 2. Narrowing a Topic
A diary...         Then there's Scott's last diary entry, on March 29, 1912. "... It
                   seems a pity but I do not think I can write more." Well.

                   That diary apparently gave lots of locations of where he
                   thought they were but maybe they were lost. It says they
                   ended up only 11 miles from one of their supply stations. I
                   wonder if anybody knows how close they were to where
                   Scott thought they were.

                   I'd love to see that diary. Wouldn't that be cool? Online? I'll
                   Google it.

                   Yes! At the British museum. Look at that! I can see Scott's
                   last entry IN HIS OWN HANDWRITING!

Actually, if I decide to write about something that requires
reading the diary, it would be easier to not have to
decipher his handwriting. Wonder whether there is a
typed version of it online somewhere?

Maybe I should pay attention to the early paragraph on the

Terra Nova Expedition page in Wikipedia--about it being

controversial whether Scott and his team made bad

decisions so that they brought most of their troubles on

themselves. Can I narrow my topic to just the controversy     A digital version?
over whether bad decisions of Scott and his crew doomed

them? Maybe it's too big a topic if I consider the decisions

of all team members. Maybe I should just consider Scott's decisions.

So what research question could come from that? Maybe: how did Scott's decisions contribute to his team's
deaths in Antarctica? But am I talking about his decisions before or after they left for Antarctica? Or the whole
time they were a team? Probably too many decisions involved. More focused: How did Scott's decisions after
reaching the South Pole help or hurt the chances of his team getting back safely? That's not bad--maybe. If
people have written about that. There are several of his decisions discussed on the Wikipedia page, and I know
there are sources at the bottom of that page.

                   Let me think--what else did I see that was interesting or
                   puzzling about all this? I remember being surprised that
                   Antarctica is a desert. So maybe I could make Antarctica as
                   a desert my topic. My research question could be
                   something like: Why is Antarctica considered a desert? But
                   there has to be a definition of deserts somewhere online,
                   so that doesn't sound complicated enough. Once you
                   know the definition of desert, you'd know the answer to
                   the question. Professor Sanders says research questions
                   are more complicated than regular questions.

Really, a desert?  What's a topic I could care about? A question I really
                   wonder about? Maybe those rocks with the fossils in them.
                   It's just so hard to imagine desperate explorers continuing

                                                                                  2. Narrowing a Topic | 10
to push those sledges with an extra 30 pounds of rocks on them. Did they somehow know how important they
would be? Or were they just curious about them? Why didn't they ditch them? Or maybe they just didn't realize
how close to death they were. Maybe I could narrow my Antarctica topic to those rocks.

                                                 Maybe my narrowed topic could be something like: The
                                                 rocks that Scott and his crew found in Antarctica that
                                                 prove continental drift. Maybe my research question could
                                                 be: How did Scott's explorers choose the rocks they kept?

Why rocks?                                       Well, now all I have is questions about my questions. Like,
                                                 is my professor going to think the question about the rocks
                                                 is still about Antarctica? Or is it all about continental drift
                                                 or geology or even the psychology of desperate people?
                                                 And what has been written about the finding of those
                                                 rocks? Will I be able to find enough sources? I'm also
                                                 wondering whether my question about Scott's decisions is
                                                 too big--do I have enough time for it?

                                                                               I
think my professor is the only one who can tell me
whether my question about the rocks has enough to do
with Antarctica. Since he's the one who will be grading my
paper. But a librarian can help me figure out the other
things.

So Dr. Sanders and a librarian are next.

       Our Answers:
           1. Was Anna's choice to start with Wikipedia a good choice? Why or why not? Wikipedia is a
                great place to start a research project. Just make sure you move on from there, because it's a
                not a good place to end up with your project. One place to move on to is the sources at the
                bottom of most Wikipedia pages.
          2. Have you ever used that Control-F technique? If you haven't used the Control-F technique, we
                hope you will. It can save you a lot of time and effort reading online material.

11 | 2. Narrowing a Topic
3. At what points does Anna think about where to look for information? When she began;
     when she wanted to know more about the Scott expedition; when she wonders whether she
     could read Scott's diary online; when she thinks about what people could answer her
     questions.

4. At the end of this session, Anna hasn't yet settled on a research question. So what did she
     accomplish? What good was all this reading and thinking? There are probably many answers
     to this question. Ours includes that Anna learned more about Antarctica, the subject of her
     research project. She focused her thinking (even if she doesn't end up using the possible
     research questions she's considering) and practiced critical thinking skills, such as when she
     thought about what she could be interested in, when she worked to make her potential
     research questions more specific, and when she figured out what questions still needed
     answering at the end. She also practiced her skills at making meaning from what she read,
     investigating a story that she didn't expect to be there and didn't know had the potential of
     being one that she is interested in. She also now knows what questions she needs answered
     and whom to ask. These thinking skills are what college is all about. Anna is way beyond where
     she was when she started.

                                                                                                                                           2. Narrowing a Topic | 12
3. Background Reading

It's wise to do some more reading about that narrower topic
once you have it. For one reason, you probably don't know
much about it yet. For another, such reading will help you learn
the terms used by professionals and scholars who have studied
your narrower topic. Those terms are certain to be helpful
when you're looking for sources later, so jot them down or
otherwise remember them.

For instance, if you were going to do research about the

biology of the Covid pandemic virus, this background reading

would teach you that professionals and scholars often refer to       Get a good look at your topic through background reading.
the virus itself as SARS-CoV-2. If you didn't learn and use that in

your eventual search for sources, you would miss the kinds of

sources you'll need for your assignment--sources written by people in a position to know about virus biology,

unlike the general public.

Most sources other than journal articles are good sources for this initial reading, including the New York Times or
other mainline American news outlets, Wikipedia, encyclopedias for the discipline your topic is in (horticulture
for the crabapple bud development topic, for instance), dictionaries for the discipline, and manuals, handbooks,
blogs, and web pages that could be relevant. The reason journal articles are not helpful at this stage of your
reading is that they are usually much more specific and difficult to understand than you need.

This initial reading could cause you to narrow your topic further, which is fine because narrower topics lead to
greater specificity for what you have to find out. After this upfront work, you're ready to start developing the
research question(s) you will try to answer for your assignment.

TIP: Keeping Track of Your Information

While you are in the background reading phase of your research you will come across a lot of sources and
won't know yet if they will prove useful in the long run. A handy type of software to help you keep track of
all your findings is called citation management software. It will also be extremely valuable when it comes to
using the resources you end up needing. Three of these tools are available for free to OSU students, staff and
faculty. Learn more about these tools and how to access them.

5. Influence of a Research Question

Whether you're developing research questions for your personal life, your work for an employer, or for academic
purposes, the process always forces you to figure out exactly:

  · What you're interested in finding out.
  · What is feasible for you to find out (given your time, money, and access to information sources)?
  · How you can find it out, including what research methods will be necessary and what information sources

      will be relevant.
  · What kind of claims you'll be able to make, or conclusions you'll be able to draw about what you found out.
For academic purposes, you may have to develop research questions to carry out both large and small
assignments. A smaller assignment may be to do research for a class discussion or to, say, write a blog post for
a class. Larger assignments may have you conduct research and then report it in a lab report, poster, research
paper, essay, or article.
For large projects, the research question (or questions) you develop will define or at least heavily influence:
  · Your topic, in that research questions effectively narrow the topic you've first chosen or been assigned by

      your instructor.
  · What, if any, hypotheses you test.
  · Which information sources are relevant to your project.
  · Which research methods are appropriate.
  · What claims you can make or conclusions you can come to as a result of your research, including what

      thesis statement you should write for a research paper or what results section you should write about the
      data you collected in your own science or social science study.

17 | 5. Influence of a Research Question
Your research question drives your hypothesis, research methods, sources, and your claims or conclusions.

Influence on Thesis

Within an essay, poster, or research paper, the thesis is the researcher's answer to the research question(s). So
as you develop research questions, you are effectively specifying what any thesis in your project will be about.
While perhaps many research questions could have come from your original topic, your question states exactly
which one(s) your thesis will be answering.
For example, a topic that starts out as "desert symbiosis" could eventually lead to a research question that is
"How does the diversity of bacteria in the gut of the Sonoran Desert termite contribute to the termite's survival?"
In turn, the researcher's thesis will answer that particular research question instead of the numerous other
questions that could have come from the desert symbiosis topic.
Developing research questions is all part of a process that leads to greater and greater specificity for your
project.

       Tip: Don't Make These Mistakes
       Sometimes students inexperienced at working with research questions confuse them with the

                                                                                                                                5. Influence of a Research Question | 18
       search statements they will type into the search box of a search engine or database when looking
       for sources for their project. Or, they confuse research questions with the thesis statement they will
       write when they report their research. The next activity will help you sort things out.

      Activity: Language from Topic to Thesis Statement

Influence on Hypothesis

If you're doing a study that predicts how variables are related, you'll have to write at least one hypothesis. The
research questions you write will contain the variables that will later appear in your hypothesis(es).

      Activity: Guess the Question

       Despite how strong their influence is on the rest of the researcher's tasks, research questions don't
       always appear in a report of the research. Nonetheless, you can usually figure out what the
       researcher's research questions were by reading the title and some of the report. Take a look at this
       article "Getting to the Center of a Tootsie Roll Pop®" [OSU login required] and determine what the
       students' research question was.

Influence on Resources

You can't tell whether an information source is relevant to your research until you know exactly what you're
trying to find out. Since it's the research questions that define that, it's they that divide all information sources
into two groups: those that are relevant to your research and those that are not--all based on whether each
source can help you find out what you want to find out and/or report the answer.

Influence on Research Methods

Your research question(s) will help you figure out what research methods you should use because the questions
reflect what your research is intended to do. For instance, if your research question relates to describing a group,
survey methods may work well. But they can't answer cause-and-effect questions.

Influence on Claims or Conclusions

The research questions you write will reflect whether your research is intended to describe a group or situation,

19 | 5. Influence of a Research Question
to explain or predict outcomes, or to demonstrate a cause-and-effect relationship(s) among variables. It's those
intentions and how well you carry out the study, including whether you used methods appropriate to the
intentions, that will determine what claims or conclusions you can make as a result of your research.

6. Developing Your Research Question

Because of all their influence, you might worry that research questions are very difficult to develop. Sometimes
it can seem that way. But we'll help you get the hang of it and, luckily, none of us has to come up with perfect
ones right off. It's more like doing a rough draft and then improving it. That's why we talk about developing
research questions instead of just writing them.

Steps for Developing a Research Question

The steps for developing a research question, listed below, can help you organize your thoughts.
Step 1: Pick a topic (or consider the one assigned to you).
Step 2: Write a narrower/smaller topic that is related to the first.
Step 3: List some potential questions that could logically be asked in relation to the narrow topic.
Step 4: Pick the question that you are most interested in.
Step 5: Change the question you're interested in so that it is more focused and specific.

Practice

Once you know the steps and their order, only three skills are involved in developing a research question:
  · Imagining narrower topics about a larger one,
  · Thinking of questions that stem from a narrow topic, and
  · Focusing questions to eliminate their vagueness.

Every time you use these skills, it's important to evaluate what you have produced--that's just part of the
process of turning rough drafts into more finished products.

21 | 6. Developing Your Research Question
Three steps for developing a research question

Maybe you have a topic in mind but aren't sure how to form a research question around it. The trick is to think
of a question related to your topic but not answerable with a quick search. Also, try to be specific so that your
research question can be fully answered in the final product for your research assignment.

      ACTIVITY: Thinking of Questions

       For each of the narrow topics below, think of a research question that is logically related to that
       topic. (Remember that good research questions often, but not always, start with "Why" or "How"
       because questions that begin that way usually require more analysis.)
       Topics:

            · U.S. investors' attitudes about sustainability
            · College students' use of Snapchat
            · The character Scout in To Kill a Mockingbird
            · Nature-inspired nanotechnologies
            · Marital therapy
       After you think of each research question, evaluate it by asking whether it is:
            · Logically related to the topic
            · In question form

Sometimes the first draft of a research question is still too broad, which can make your search for sources more
challenging. Refining your question to remove vagueness or to target a specific aspect of the topic can help.

      ACTIVITY: Focusing Questions

       The first draft research questions below are not focused enough. Read them and identify at least
       one area of vagueness in each. Check your vagueness with what we identified. It's great if you found
       more than we did because that can lead to research questions of greater specificity. See the bottom
       of the page for our answers.
       First Drafts of Research Questions:

           1. Why have most electric car company start-ups failed?
          2. How do crabapple trees develop buds?
           3. How has NASA helped America?
          4. Why do many first-time elections soon after a country overthrows a dictator result in very

                conservative elected leaders?
           5. How is music composed and performed mostly by African-Americans connected to African-

                American history?

      ACTIVITY: Developing a Research Question

      ANSWER TO ACTIVITY: Focusing Questions

       Some answers to the "Focusing Questions" Activity above are:
       Question 1: Why have most electric car company start-ups failed?
       Vagueness: Which companies are we talking about? Worldwide or in a particular country?
       Question 2: How do crabapple trees develop buds?
       Vagueness: There are several kinds of crabapples. Should we talk only about one kind? Does it
       matter where the crabapple tree lives?
       Question 3: How has NASA helped America?

23 | 6. Developing Your Research Question
Vagueness: NASA has had many projects. Should we should focus on one project they completed?
Or projects during a particular time period?
Question 4: Why do many first-time elections soon after a country overthrows a dictator result in
very conservative elected leaders?
Vagueness: What time period are we talking about? Many dictators have been overthrown and
many countries have been involved. Perhaps we should focus on one country or one dictator or one
time period.
Question 5: How is music composed and performed mostly by African-Americans connected to
African-American history?
Vagueness: What kinds of music? Any particular performers and composers? When?

25 | 2-Types of Sources
1. Categorizing Sources

                          Understanding types of sources helps guide your search.

Once you have your research question, you'll need information sources to answer it and meet the other
information needs of your research project.
This section about categorizing sources will increase your sophistication about them and save you time in the
long run because you'll understand the "big picture". That big picture will be useful as you plan your own
sources for a specific research project, which we'll help you with in the next section Sources and Information
Needs.
You'll usually have a lot of sources available to meet the information needs of your projects. In today's complex
information landscape, just about anything that contains information can be considered a potential source.
Here are a few examples:

  · Books and encyclopedias
  · Websites, web pages, and blogs
  · Magazine, journal, and newspaper articles
  · Research reports and conference papers
  · Field notes and diaries
  · Photographs, paintings, cartoons, and other artworks
  · TV and radio programs, podcasts, movies, and videos
  · Illuminated manuscripts and artifacts
  · Bones, minerals, and fossils
  · Preserved tissues and organs

                                                                                                                                                  1. Categorizing Sources | 26
  · Architectural plans and maps
  · Pamphlets and government documents
  · Music scores and recorded performances
  · Dance notation and theater set models
With so many sources available, the question usually is not whether sources exist for your project but which
ones will best meet your information needs.
Being able to categorize a source helps you understand the kind of information it contains, which is a big clue to
(1) whether might meet one or more of your information needs and (2) where to look for it and similar sources.
A source can be categorized by:
  · Whether it contains quantitative or qualitative information or both
  · Whether the source is objective (factual) or persuasive (opinion) and may be biased
  · Whether the source is a scholarly, professional or popular publication
  · Whether the material is a primary, secondary or tertiary source
  · What format the source is in
As you may already be able to tell, sources can be in more than one category at the same time because the
categories are not mutually exclusive.

27 | 1. Categorizing Sources
2. Quantitative or Qualitative

One of the most obvious ways to categorize data is by whether it is     Data can be quantitative or qualitative.
quantitative or qualitative. Some sources contain either
quantitative information or qualitative information, but sources
often contain both.

Many people first think of data as something like what's in a table
or spreadsheet of numbers and words. But data can be conveyed
in more ways than textually or numerically.

Quantitative Data - Involves a measurable quantity. Often,
numbers are used, but sometimes other information is used
instead. Some examples are length, mass, temperature, and time.

Qualitative Data - Involves a descriptive judgment using concept
words instead of numbers. Gender, country name, animal species,
and emotional state are examples of qualitative information.

Take a quick look at the Example table below. Another way we
could display the table's numerical information is in a graphic
format --listing the students' ages or GPAs on a bar chart, for
instance, rather than in a list of numbers. Or, all the information in
the table could be displayed instead as a video of each student
giving those details about themselves.

                                                                        2. Quantitative or Qualitative | 28
  EXAMPLE: Data Table with Quantitative and Qualitative Data

   This table illustrates that information can include a range of formats, including pictures.

Increasingly, other formats (such as images, sound, and video) may be is used as data or used to convey data.
Some examples:

  · A video of someone watching scenes from horror movies, with information about their heart rate and
      blood pressure embedded in the video. Instead of getting a description of the person's reactions to the
      scenes, you can see their reactions.

  · A database of information about birds, which includes a sound file for each bird singing. Would you prefer
      a verbal description of a bird's song or an audio clip?

  · A list of colors, which include an image of the actual color. Such a list is extremely helpful, especially when
      there are A LOT of color names.

  · A friend orally tells you that a new pizza place is 3 blocks away, charges $2 a slice, and that the pizza is
      delicious. This may never be recorded, but it may be very valuable information if you're hungry!

  · A map of Ohio with counties shaded different intensities of red according to the median household
      income of inhabitants.

3. Fact or Opinion

Thinking about the reason an author created a source can be         An author's purpose can influence the kind of information
helpful to you because that reason was what dictated the kind of    he or she chooses to include.
information he/she chose to include. Depending on that purpose,
the author may have chosen to include factual, analytical, and
objective information. Or, instead, it may have suited his/her
purpose to include information that was subjective and therefore
less factual and analytical. The author's reason for producing the
source also determined whether he or she included more than one
perspective or just his/her own.

Authors typically want to do at least one of the following:

  · Inform and educate
  · Persuade
  · Sell services or products
  · Entertain

Combined Purposes

Sometimes authors have a combination of purposes, as when a marketer decides he can sell more
smartphones with an informative sales video that also entertains us. The same is true when a singer writes and
performs a song that entertains us but that she intends to make available for sale. Other examples of authors
having multiple purposes occur in most scholarly writing.

In those cases, authors certainly want to inform and educate their audiences. But they also want to persuade
their audiences that what they are reporting and/or postulating is a true description of a situation, event, or
phenomenon or a valid argument that their audience must take a particular action. In this blend of scholarly
authors' purposes, the intent to educate and inform is considered to trump the intent to persuade

Why Intent Matters

Authors' intent usually matters in how useful their information can be to your research project, depending on
which information need you are trying to meet. For instance, when you're looking for sources that will help you
actually decide your answer to your research question or evidence for your answer that you will share with your
audience, you will want the author's main purpose to have been to inform or educate his/her audience. That's
because, with that intent, he/she is likely to have used:

  · Facts where possible.
  · Multiple perspectives instead of just his/her own.
  · Little subjective information.
  · Seemingly unbiased, objective language that cites where he/she got the information.

The reason you want that kind of source when trying to answer your research question or explaining that
answer is that all of those characteristics will lend credibility to the argument you are making with your project.
Both you and your audience will simply find it easier to believe--will have more confidence in the argument
being made--when you include those types of sources.

Sources whose authors intend only to persuade others won't meet your information need for an answer to your

                                                                                                                                                          3. Fact or Opinion | 32
research question or evidence with which to convince your audience. That's because they don't always confine
themselves to facts. Instead, they tell us their opinions without backing them up with evidence. If you used
those sources, your readers would notice and would be less likely to believe your argument.

Fact vs. Opinion vs. Objective vs. Subjective

Need to brush up on the differences between fact, objective information, subjective information, and opinion?

Fact - Facts are useful to inform or make an argument.

Examples:

  · The United States was established in 1776.
  · The pH levels in acids are lower than the pH levels in alkalines.
  · Beethoven had a reputation as a virtuoso pianist.

Opinion - Opinions are useful to persuade, but careful readers and listeners will notice and demand evidence
to back them up.

Examples:

  · That was a good movie.
  · Strawberries taste better than blueberries.
  · Timothee Chalamet is the sexiest actor alive.
  · The death penalty is wrong.
  · Beethoven's reputation as a virtuoso pianist is overrated.

Objective - Objective information reflects a research finding or multiple perspectives that are not biased.

Examples:

  · "Several studies show that an active lifestyle reduces the risk of heart disease and diabetes."
  · "Studies from the Brown University Medical School show that twenty-somethings eat 25 percent more

      fast-food meals at this age than they did as teenagers."

Subjective - Subjective information presents one person or organization's perspective or interpretation.
Subjective information can be meant to distort, or it can reflect educated and informed thinking. All opinions
are subjective, but some are backed up with facts more than others.

Examples:

  · "The simple truth is this: As human beings, we were meant to move."
  · "In their thirties, women should stock up on calcium to ensure strong, dense bones and to ward off

      osteoporosis later in life." *

*In this quote, it's mostly the "should" that makes it subjective. The objective version of that quote would read
something like: "Studies have shown that women who begin taking calcium in their 30s show stronger bone
density and fewer repercussions of osteoporosis than women who did not take calcium at all." But perhaps
there are other data showing complications from taking calcium. That's why drawing the conclusion that
requires a "should" makes the statement subjective.

4. Primary, Secondary & Tertiary Sources

Another way to categorize information is by whether the
information is in its original format or has been reinterpreted.

This information category is called publication mode and has to do
with whether the information is

· Firsthand information--primary sources (information in its                                   Another way to categorize information is by whether the
   original form, not interpreted, translated, or published in                                 information is in its original format or has been
   another form).                                                                              reinterpreted.

· Secondhand information--secondary sources (a restatement,
   analysis, or interpretation of original information).

· Third-hand information--tertiary sources (a summary or
   repackaging of original information, often based on secondary
   information that has been published).

Here are examples to illustrate the first-handedness, second-handedness, and third-handedness of information:

When you make distinctions between primary, secondary, and tertiary sources, you are relating the information

itself to the context in which it was created. Understanding that relationship is an important skill that you'll

understand the "big picture" in which information operates and helps us figure out which information we can

depend on. That's a big part of thinking critically, a major benefit of actually becoming an educated person.

· Any literary work, including novels, plays, and poems.

· Advertisements.
· Music and dance performances.
· Eyewitness accounts, including photographs and recorded interviews.
· Artworks.
· Data.
· Blog entries that are autobiographical.
· Scholarly blogs that provide data or are highly theoretical, even though they contain no autobiography.
· Artifacts such as tools, clothing, or other objects.
· Original documents such as tax returns, marriage licenses, and transcripts of trials.
· Websites, although many are secondary.
· Buildings.
· Correspondence, including email.
· Records of organizations and government agencies.
· Journal articles that report research for the first time (at least the parts about the new research, plus their

35 | 4. Primary, Secondary & Tertiary Sources
      data).

(The term primary source doesn't come up much in the sciences. Scientists often call a journal article that was
the most helpful to their work their primary source.)
Secondary Source - These sources are translated, repackaged, restated, analyzed, or interpreted information
from a primary source. Thus, the information comes to us secondhand, or through at least one filter. Here are
some examples that are often used as secondary sources:

  · All nonfiction books and magazine articles except autobiography.
  · An article or website that critiques a novel, play, painting, or piece of music.
  · An article or website that synthesizes expert opinion and several eyewitness accounts for a new

      understanding of an event.
  · The literature review portion of a journal article.

Tertiary Source - These sources further repackage the original information used in secondary sources as they
index, condense, or summarize the original.
Typically, by the time tertiary sources are developed, there have been many secondary sources prepared on
their subjects, and you can think of tertiary sources as information that comes to us "thirdhand." Tertiary sources
are usually publications that you are not intended to read from cover to cover but to dip in and out of for the
information you need. You can think of them as a good place for background information to start your research
but a bad place to end up. Here are some examples that are often used as tertiary sources:

  · Almanacs
  · Dictionaries
  · Guide books, including the one you are now reading
  · Survey articles
  · Timelines
  · Bibliographies
  · Encyclopedias, including Wikipedia
  · Most textbooks

Tertiary sources are usually not acceptable as cited sources in college research projects because they are so far
from firsthand information. That's why most professors don't want you to use Wikipedia as a citable source: the
information in Wikipedia is far from original information. Other people have considered it, decided what they
think about it, rearranged it, and summarized it-all of which is actually what your professors want students, not
another author, to do with the information in your research projects.

        ACTIVITY: Primary, Secondary, or Tertiary?

                                                                                                                        4. Primary, Secondary & Tertiary Sources | 36
The Details Are Tricky-- A few things about labeling primary or secondary sources might surprise you:

  · Sources become primary rather than always exist as primary sources.

It's easy to think that it is the format of primary sources that makes them primary. But that's not all that matters.
So when you see lists like the one above of sources that are often used as primary sources, it's wise to remember
that the ones listed are not automatically already primary sources. Firsthand sources get that designation only
when researchers actually find their information relevant and use it.

For instance: Records that could be relevant to those studying government are created every day by federal,
state, county, and city governments as they operate. But until those raw data are actually used by a researcher,
they cannot be considered primary sources.

Another example: A diary about flying missions kept by an American helicopter pilot in the Vietnam War is not
a primary source until, say, a researcher uses it in her study of how the war was carried out. But it will never
be a primary source for a researcher studying the U.S. public's reaction to the war because it does not contain
information relevant to that study. But if a researcher were to study, say, pilots' long-term opinions about serving
in the war and used that diary as a source, then it would become a primary source.

  · Primary sources, even eyewitness accounts, are not necessarily accurate. Their relevance and credibility
      have to be evaluated, just like that of all sources.

  · Something that is usually considered a secondary source can be considered a primary source, depending
      on the research project.

For instance, movie reviews are usually considered secondary sources. But if your research project is about the
effect movie reviews have on ticket sales, the movie reviews you study would become primary sources.

  · Deciding whether to consider a journal article a primary or a secondary source can be complicated for at
      least two reasons.

First, journal articles that report new research for the first time are usually based on data collected by the author
or others. So some disciplines consider the data to be the primary source and consider the journal article that
describes and analyzes them a secondary source.

However, particularly in the sciences, the original researcher might find it difficult or impossible (he or she
might not be allowed) to share the data. So sometimes you have nothing more firsthand than the journal
article, which argues for calling it the relevant primary source because it's the closest thing that exists to the
data.

Second, even journal articles that announce new research for the first time usually contain more than data.
They also typically contain secondary source elements, such as a literature review, bibliography, and sections on
data analysis and interpretation. So they can actually be a mix of primary and secondary elements. Even so, in
some disciplines such as the sciences, a journal article that announces new research findings for the first time
is considered to be, as a whole, a primary source for the researchers using it, particularly if it is where they got
most of the information on which to base their own journal article.

37 | 4. Primary, Secondary & Tertiary Sources
        ACTIVITY: Under What Circumstances?

          Instructions: Look at each of the sources listed below and think of circumstances under which
          each could become a primary source. (There are probably many potential circumstances for
          each.) So just imagine you are a researcher with projects that would make each item firsthand
          information that is relevant to your work. What could a project be about that would make each
          source relevant firsthand information? Our answers are at the bottom of the page, but
          remember that there are many more-including the ones you think of that we didn't!

              1. Fallingwater, a Pennsylvania home, designed and constructed by Frank Lloyd Wright in the
                  1930s.

             2. Poet W.H. Auden's elegy for Y.S. Yeats.
             3. An arrowhead made by (Florida) Seminole Native Americans but found at Flint Ridge

                  outside Columbus, Ohio.
             4. E-mail between the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, Nikki Haley, and her staff about

                  North Korea.
             5. A marriage license.

Despite their trickiness, what primary sources usually offer is too good not to consider using because:

  · They are original. This unfiltered, firsthand information is not available anywhere else.
  · Their creator was a type of person unlike others in your research project, and you want to include that

      perspective.
  · Their creator was present at an event and shares an eyewitness account.
  · They are objects that existed at the particular time your project is studying.

Particularly in humanities courses, your professor may require you to use a certain number of primary sources
for your project. In other courses, particularly in the sciences, you may be required to use only primary sources,
which usually means journal articles in the sciences. If they are called primary sources in the sciences, it's usually
because the researchers got their information primarily from those sources.
What is considered primary and secondary sources can vary from discipline to discipline. If you are required
to use primary sources for your research project, before getting too deep into your project check with your
professor to make sure he or she agrees with your choices. After all, it's your professor who will be grading your
project. A librarian, too, can verify your choices. Just remember to take a copy of your assignment with you when
you ask, because the librarian will want to see the original assignment. After all, that's a primary source!

                                                                                                                        4. Primary, Secondary & Tertiary Sources | 38

39 | 4. Primary, Secondary & Tertiary Sources
5. Popular, Substantive Popular,
Professional, & Scholarly

One of the handiest and thus most-often-used categorizations of sources is
by the expertise of their intended audiences. In this categorization, sources
are either meant for everybody (popular sources), for only a college-
educated or otherwise well-prepared audience (substantive popular
sources), for professionals in an occupation (professional sources), or for
scholars, students, and other people who want a deep understanding of a
subject (scholarly sources).

Considering the intended audience--how expert one has to be to
understand the information--can help you figure out whether the source
has sufficient thoroughness/complexity and credibility to meet your needs.
It can also help you figure out where to look for these kinds of sources because sources in each category
tend to hang out together. (See our Source Locator.)

When categorizing this way, it's probably better to consider the source itself (say, a specific article in The New
York Times or a specific PBS documentary) rather than only its publisher (The New York Times or PBS). However,
as you will learn in Chapter 6, Evaluating Sources, some publishers have strong processes in place to help ensure
the credibility of all their products.

There are varying degrees of expertise required to understand the sources explained below. For college writing,
substantive popular, professional, and scholarly sources are usually your best bets because of their combination
of thoroughness/complexity and the credibility of their publishers. (See Chapter 3, What Sources to Use When.)

Popular Sources - These sources, such as books, TV shows, newspaper and magazine articles, podcasts, social
media, and most websites, are meant for a large general audience and are generally easy to purchase or
available for free. Their subjects include news, politics, government, health, music, art, hobbies, what to buy,
entertainment, and opinions about the news--anything, really, that we could be interested in.

These types of sources are more attractive than scholarly journals because they have catchy titles, attractive
artwork, and many advertisements. Some might quote named sources, identify how they got their experience
and expertise, and provide links to other sources. But you'll not likely see a formal list of footnotes or references
at the end.

These sources are published by both commercial and nonprofit publishers. They are written by staff writers,
journalists, and sometimes just by people enthusiastic about the subject matter. News and magazine articles
are published after review and approval from editors or producers. But with other examples of popular sources,
such as the many forms of social media, they are published without any review at all.

The online and print magazine Men's Health is an example of a popular source and there are millions of others.

Understanding the content of popular sources is usually not difficult, although a subset of popular sources
called substantive popular sources requires more effort. You will need to use your critical thinking skills to
determine whether a source is a popular or substantive popular source.

Substantive Popular Sources - This category is a subset of popular sources. Unlike the rest of popular sources,
they are aimed at a college-educated audience or those otherwise well-informed in the subject matter, even
though they are available to people in general. They may be more difficult for a complete novice to understand.

Their creators are serious about their intent to inform and want to be thorough. These sources are frequently

                                                                                               5. Popular, Substantive Popular, Professional, & Scholarly | 40
about the news, health, science, societal problems, politics, and government-but they can be about any topic.
Even when they are about entertainers or entertainment, they are intended to inform more than to entertain.

Both credibility of the author and publisher, as well as the complexity of the content, are important when
identifying this category of sources. To be considered a substantive popular source, a source must be both
published by a credible author or publisher and provide an in-depth, well-researched investigation and analysis
of a topic or issue.

For all but the most well-staffed news publishers, news sources are more likely to be considered substantive
popular if they are created later in the information life cycle than early with breaking news because it is difficult
to provide their thoroughness and detail earlier for all but the most well-staffed new publishers. (See the
information lifecycle later in this chapter.)

       Examples of the difference between popular and substantive popular sources:

            · Opera, classical music, R&B, jazz, and hip-hop available on TV, radio, or a digital source are
                popular sources. But a PBS documentary about any of those same kinds of music is more likely
                to be a popular substantive source because rather than offering the experience of the music,
                its purpose is to inform and its publisher has processes in place to ensure accuracy.

            · A TV news or print or online newspaper story reporting that a local group has taken up the
                issue of the need for more affordable housing in your town is likely to be a popular source. But
                a detailed story in the Washington Post about how zoning codes across the country make it
                difficult or impossible to build affordable housing is more likely to be a popular substantive
                source. That's not only because of the Post's processes for accuracy but because of the
                complexity of the story.

            · A news story in the Columbus, Ohio newspaper, the Columbus Dispatch, reporting that 56
                exotic animals escaped from a farm in Ohio the previous day is likely to be a popular source.
                But a Dispatch story a year later about the animals escaping and reactions of neighbors since
                that day has more chance of being a substantive popular story. That's not only because of the
                Dispatch's processes for accuracy but because the later story has a better chance of being
                more thorough and complex. And a New Yorker magazine article about the fight against
                international wildlife trafficking is also likely to be a substantive popular source for the same
                reasons, including the length of time New Yorker authors usually have to create most articles.

For information on using news articles as sources (from newspapers in print and online, broadcast news outlets,
news aggregators, news databases, news feeds, social media, blogs, and citizen journalism), see News as a
Source.

Professional Sources - Professional magazine articles (in such publications as Music Teacher) and Plastic
Surgical Nursing (OSU only) are meant for people in a particular profession and are often accessible through a
professional organization. Staff writers or other professionals in the targeted field write these articles at a level
and with the language to be understood by everyone in the profession.

Additionally, they are:

41 | 5. Popular, Substantive Popular, Professional, & Scholarly
  · About trends and news from the targeted field, book reviews, and case studies.
  · Often less than 10 pages, some of which may contain footnotes and references.
  · Usually published by professional associations and commercial publishers.
  · Published after approval from an editor.
Scholarly Sources - Scholarly journal articles (such as those published in the Journal of Plant Science and
Education and Child Psychology) are meant for scholars and students in a particular field of study. While they
can also be read by members of the general public who have an interest in the topic, since they are written by
experts, they often assume that the reader will already have a significant amount of existing knowledge on the
topic. The authors may use discipline-specific terminology or reference developments or events that may be
unfamiliar to those who do not have experience in the field. As a result, they can sometimes be challenging to
understand for those who do not have a background in the field. Researchers and scholars write these articles
to present new knowledge and further understanding of their field of study.
Additionally, they are:
  · Where findings of research projects, data and analytics, and case studies usually appear first.
  · Often long (usually over 10 pages) and always include footnotes and references.
  · Usually published by universities, professional associations, and commercial publishers.
  · Published after approval by peer review or from the journal's editor.

6. Publication Formats and the
Information Lifecycle

We can also categorize sources by publication format. That's because of the difference in time and effort sources
in each format require for their production.

Sources can come in many different formats.

Sources in particular formats simply cannot exist until there has been enough time for people to create them.
The result is that the sources that are created toward the end of the information lifecycle may come to very
different conclusions about an event than did those sources created early on.
Sometimes the information presented in the later formats is more valid and reliable than what is in those
produced earlier.
A very good example is that conclusions about the Columbine High School shooting in 1999 and the causes of
that tragedy reached by books--which took years to complete after the event--were likely to be very different
than the conclusions reached by news coverage created early on. For instance, many early reports concluded
that the two teens responsible for the shooting had been shunned by their classmates and that it was the

                                                                                                     6. Publication Formats and the Information Lifecycle | 44
pain of their exclusion that had moved them to take revenge. Consequently, many K-12 schools nationwide
took steps to try to ensure that all students felt included in their student bodies. But more time-consuming
reportage concluded that the boys were not shunned (one had had a date for prom activities just days before)
and that it was mental illness that made them kill their classmates. (See Columbine, by Dave Cullen, New York:
Twelve, 2009.)

        MOVIE: Information Cycle

          This video explains what kinds of information sources about an event can exist at any point in
          time during and after that event.

          View Text Version

        ACTIVITY: The Information Lifecycle

A Closer Look at Common Formats
Books - Usually a substantial amount of information, published at one time and requiring great effort on the
part of the author and a publisher.
Magazines/Journals - Published frequently, containing lots of articles related to some general or specific
professional research interest; edited. Research journals are part of the scholarly conversation and many, but
not all, require peer review.
Newspapers - Each is usually a daily publication of events of social, political, and lifestyle interest.
Web sites - Digital items, each consisting of multiple pages produced by someone with technical skills or the
ability to pay someone with technical skills.
Articles - Distinct, short, written pieces that might contain photos and are generally timely. Timeliness can
mean that it's something that is of interest to readers at the point of publication or that is something the writer
is thinking about or researching at a given point of time.

45 | 6. Publication Formats and the Information Lifecycle
      Tip: Evaluating Articles

       Evaluating whether articles are credible enough for your information need is similar to evaluating
       any other source. There's more information on evaluating in Chapter 6, Evaluating Sources.

Conference Papers - Written form of papers delivered at a professional or research-related conference. Authors
are generally practicing professionals or scholars in the field. Conference papers are part of the scholarly
conversation.
Blogs - Frequently updated websites that do not necessarily require extensive technical skills and can be
published by virtually anyone for no cost to themselves other than the time they devote to content creation.
Usually marked by postings that indicate the date when each was written.
Documentaries - Works, such as a film or television program, presenting political, social, or historical subject
matter in a factual and informative manner and often consisting of actual news films or interviews
accompanied by narration.
Online Videos - Short videos produced by anybody, with a lot of money or a little money, about anything for the
world to see. Common sites for these are YouTube and Vimeo.
Podcasts - Digital audio files, produced by anyone and about anything, that is available for download, often by
subscription.

7. Scholarly Articles as Sources

Articles in scholarly journals are valued for several reasons. First, they are usually trustworthy because their
publication process includes a peer review that helps ensure their accuracy and contribution to their disciplines.
In addition, they often contain the first reports of new research, which makes their sections on methodology,
data, analysis, and interpretation primary sources. Sometimes they instead consist of literature reviews and
summaries of multiple research studies done in the past on particular subjects of current interest. That makes
those articles very helpful secondary sources.

Peer-Reviewed Sources

The most-respected scholarly journals are peer-reviewed, which means that experts in their field other than the
author and editor check out each article before it can be published. It's their responsibility to help guarantee
that new material is presented in the context of what is already known, that the methods the researcher used
are the right ones, and that the article contributes to the field.
For those reasons, peer-reviewed articles are more likely to be credible. Peer-reviewed journal articles are the
official scholarly record, which means that if it's an important development in research, it will probably turn up
in a journal article eventually.
Here's a longer explanation of the peer review process, which concludes that it is good but not perfect.

Parts of a Scholarly Article

The articles you use for your assignments must also be relevant to your research question--not just credible.
Reading specific parts of an article can help save you time as you decide whether an article is relevant.

Finding Scholarly Articles

Most scholarly articles are housed in specialized databases. Libraries (public, school, or company) often provide
access to scholarly databases by paying a subscription fee for patrons. For instance, OSU Libraries provide
access to hundreds of databases via its Research Databases List that are made available free to people affiliated
with the University. You can search for a journal title in these databases or view a list of databases by subject.
For more information, including how to search databases, see Specialized Databases.
Databases that aren't subject-specific are called general databases. Google Scholar is a free general scholarly
database available to all who have access to the Internet and it provides some scholarly articles. For more
information, see our section on using Google Scholar.

      Tip: Known Article Searching

       What if you have a citation for an article you need and now have to find the actual text of the article?
       Follow these instructions to Access to a Known Journal Article.

8. News as a Source

News sources can provide insights that scholarly sources may not or that will take a long time to get into
scholarly sources. For instance, news sources are excellent for finding out people's actions, reactions, opinions,
and prevailing attitudes around the time of an event--as well as to find reports of what happened at the event
itself.

Whether news sources are good for your assignment
depends on what your research question is. (You'll find
other relevant information in Chapter 3, What Sources to
Use When.)

News is a strange term, because even when the
information is old, it's still news. Some sources are great for
breaking news, some are great for aggregated (or
compiled) news, and others are great for historical news.

While news was transmitted for centuries only in                 Newspaper by Amethyst Studio from Noun Project (CC BY 3.0)
newspapers, news is now transmitted in all formats: via
radio, television, and the Internet, in addition to print. Even
most newspapers have Internet sites today. At the time of
this writing, the Student Government Association at Ohio
State University provides an online subscription to The
New Yok Times for all students, faculty, and staff at the
university.

News must be brief because much of it gets reported only
moments after an event happens. News reports occur early in the Information Lifecycle. See the Information
Lifecycle video earlier in this chapter for more information.

When Are News Sources Helpful?

· You want to keep up with what is going on in the world today.
· You need breaking news or historical perspectives on a topic (what people were saying at the time).
· You need to learn more about a culture, place, or time period from its own sources.

When Are News Sources of Limited Use?

· You need very detailed analysis by experts.
· You need sources that must be scholarly or modern views on a historical topic.

ACTIVITY: Using News Effectively

49 | 8. News as a Source
Mainline and Non-Mainline News Sources

Mainline American news outlets stick with the tradition of trying to report the news as objectively as possibly.
That doesn't mean their reports are perfectly objective, but they are more objective than non-mainline news
sources. As a result, mainline news sources are more credible than non-mainline sources. Some examples of
mainline American news outlets: The New York Times, The Washington Post, The Boston Globe, The Chicago
Tribune, The Los Angeles Times; ABC News, CBS News, NBC News, PBS News, NPR News.

News from non-mainline American news outlets is often mixed with opinions. One way they frequently exhibit
bias is that they leave out pertinent facts. Some examples of non-mainline American news outlets: MSNBC, Fox
News, and reddit.

Types of News Sources

Press Services--News outlets (print, broadcast, and online) get a lot of their news from these services, such as
Reuters, Bloomberg, or the Associated Press (AP), which make it unnecessary for individual outlets to send their
own reporters everywhere. These services are so broadly used that you may have to look at several news outlets
to get a different take on an event or situation.

News aggregators--Aggregators don't have reporters of their own but simply collect and transmit the news
reported by others. Some sources pull news from a variety of places and provide a single place to search for and
view multiple stories. You can browse stories or search for a topic. Aggregators tend to have current, but not
archival news. Google news and Yahoo News are examples.

Newspaper sites - Many print newspapers also have their own websites. They vary as to how much news they
provide for free. Take a look at these examples.

  · The Lantern, Ohio State University's student newspaper
  · The Columbus Dispatch
  · USA Today
  · The Boston Globe
  · The Times of London
  · China Daily, USA edition
  · The New York Times

News Databases - Search current, recent, and historical newspaper content in databases provided free by
libraries. OSU Libraries offers 69 news databases to students, staff, and faculty. They include:

  · LexisNexis Academic - contains news back to 1980 from newspapers, broadcast transcripts, wire services,
      blogs, and more.

  · Proquest Historical Newspapers - contains older content from several major U.S. newspapers.
  · allAfrica - contains more than a million articles from 100 African news sources, 1996-present.
  · Lantern Online - contains the archive of all of OSU's student newspaper issues, 1881-1997.

See the complete list of OSU Libraries' newspaper databases.

                                                                                                                                                       8. News as a Source | 50

       good place to find an article with an international left perspective on a topic? Our answer is at the
       end of this section.

Broadcast News Sites - Although broadcast news (from radio and television) is generally consumed in real
time, such organizations also offer archives of news stories on their websites. However, not all of their articles
are provided by their own reporters: some originate from the press services, Reuters and the Associated Press
(AP). Here are some examples of broadcast new sites:

         ABC News
         BBC
         CNN
         NPR News

        ACTIVITY: Quick World News Scan

          Visit the BBC's News page and scan the headlines for a quick update on the world's major news
          stories.

  Social Media - Most of the news outlets listed above contribute to Twitter, now called X, and Facebook. It's
  customary for highly condensed announcements in this venue to lead you back to the news outlet's website
  for more information. However, how credible tech companies such as Facebook, Twitter, and Google are
  with news is in serious doubt now that their lawyers have testified to the U.S. Congress that more than
  100 million users may have seen content actually created by Russian operatives on the tech companies'
  platforms leading up to the 2016 U.S. presidential election. Read more about their testimony
  at NPR and The New York Times.
  Blogs - Sometimes these are good sources for breaking news, as well as commentary on current events
  and scholarship. Authors who write more objectively elsewhere can share more insights and opinions, more
  initial questions and findings about a study before they are ready to release definitive data and conclusions
  about their research.
  Citizen Journalism - A growing number of sites cater to those members of the general public who want to

51 | 8. News as a Source
report breaking news and submit their own photos and videos on a wide range of topics. The people who
do this are often referred to as citizen journalists.
Examples of such sources include CNN iReport, and reddit. For more details on the history and development
of citizen journalism, including addressing some of the pros and cons, read Your Guide to Citizen Journalism.
News Feeds - You can get updates on specific topics or a list of major headlines, regularly sent to you so
you don't have to visit sites or hunt for new content on a topic. Look for links that contain headings such as
these to sign up for news feeds:

  · RSS feeds
  · News Feeds

9. Data as Sources

Using data as sources can help with all of your research project's information needs:
  · Learn more background information.
  · Answer your research question. (The evidence that data provide can help you decide on the best answer
      for your question.)
  · Convince your audience that your answer is correct. (Data often give you evidence that your answer is
      correct.)
  · Describe the situation surrounding your research question.
  · Report what others have said about your research question.

        ACTIVITY: Example of Data

          Check out this very detailed data about frozen lasagna. Did you ever think this much data was
          available? Are there elements new to you? How might you use such data?

          View Text Version

  What is data?

  The word means many things to many people. (Consider "data" as it relates to your phone contract, for
  instance!) For our purposes, a definition we like is "units of information observed, collected, or created in
  the course of research."
  Erway, Ricky. 2013. Starting the Conversation: University-wide Research Data Management Policy. Dublin,
  Ohio: OCLC Research.
  http://www.oclc.org/content/dam/research/publications/library/2013/2013-08.pdf

53 | 9. Data as Sources
       TIP: From Latin
       Data is the plural of datum. (It's similar to how media is the plural of medium.)

Data observed, collected, or created for research purposes can be numbers, text, images, audio clips, and
video clips. But in this section on using data as sources, we're going to concentrate on numerical data.

Sometimes data are actually necessary to answer research questions, particularly in the social sciences, life,
and physical sciences. For instance, data would be necessary to support or rule out these hypotheses:

  · More women than men voted in the last presidential election in a majority of states.
  · A certain drug shows promising results in the treatment of pancreatic cancer.
  · Listening to certain genres of music lowers blood pressure.
  · People of certain religious denominations are more likely to find a specific television program

      objectionable.
  · The average weight of house cats in the United States has increased over the past 30 years.
  · The average square footage of supermarkets in the United States has increased in the past 20 years.
  · More tomatoes were consumed per person in the United Kingdom in 2022 than in 1962.
  · Exploding volcanoes can help cool the planet by spewing sulfur dioxide, which combines with water

      vapor to make reflective aerosols.

So using numeric data in those portions of your final product that require evidence can often strengthen
your argument that your answer to your research question is correct or the most reasonable answer. At other
times, even if data are not actually necessary, numeric data can be particularly persuasive and sharpen the
points you want to make in other portions of your final product devoted to, say, describing the situation
surrounding your research question. (See Chapter 9, Making an Argument)

For example, for a research paper about the research question "Why are there many more people who
qualify for food from U.S. foodbanks than the number of people who actually use foodbanks?," you could
find data on the website of Feeding America, the nation's largest network of foodbanks.

Similarly, for a project with the research question "How do some birds in Australia use "smart" hunting
techniques to flush out prey, including starting fires?," you might find a journal article with data about how
many people have observed these techniques and estimates of how frequently the techniques are used and
by how many bird species.

Obtaining Data

There are two ways of obtaining data:

  · Obtain data that already have been collected and analyzed. That's what this section will cover.
  · Collect data yourself. This can include activities such as making observations about your environment,

      conducting surveys or interviews, directly recording measurements in a lab or in the field, or even
      receiving electronic data recorded by computers/machines that gather the data. You will explore these

                                                                                                                                                      9. Data as Sources | 54
        activities in courses you take.

  Finding Data in Articles, Books, Web Pages, and More

  Numeric search data can be found all over the place. A lot of it can be found as part of other sources such as
  books, journals, newspapers, magazine articles, and web pages. In these cases, the data do not stand alone
  as a distinct element but instead are part of the larger work.

  When searching for data in books and articles and on web pages, terms such as statistics or data may or may
  not be useful search terms. That's because many writers don't use those terms in their scholarly writing. They
  tend to use the words findings or results when talking about the data that could be useful to you. In addition,
  statistics is a separate discipline, and using that term will turn up lots of journals in that area, which won't
  be helpful to you. So use the search terms data and statistics with caution, especially when searching library
  catalogs. (See information on the Library Catalog. More information on searching is in Chapter 4 Precision
  Searching.)

  Even without using those search terms, many scholarly sources you turn up are likely to contain data. Once
  you find potential sources, skim them for tables, graphs, or charts. These items are displays or illustrations
  of data gathered by researchers. However, sometimes data and interpretations are solely in the body of the
  narrative text and may be included in sections called "Results" or "Findings." (That shouldn't keep you from
  displaying the data in charts, graphs, or tables as you like in your own work, though.)

  If the data you find in a book, article, or web page are particularly helpful and you want more, you could
  contact the author to request additional numeric research data. Researchers will often discuss their data
  and its analysis - and sometimes provide some of it (or occasionally, all). Some may link to a larger numeric
  research data set. However, if a researcher shares his or her data with you, it may be in what's called a "raw"
  form. This means that you might have to do additional analysis to make it useful in answering your question.

  Depending on your research question, you may need to gather data from multiple sources to get everything
  you need to answer your research question and make your argument for it. (See Chapter 9, Making an
  Argument.)

  For instance, in our example related to foodbanks above, we suggested where you could find statistics about
  the number of people who get food from American food banks. But with that research question ("Why
  are there many more people who qualify for food from U.S. foodbanks than the number of people who
  actually use foodbanks?"), you would also need to find out from another source how many people qualify for
  foodbanks based on their income and compare that number with how many people actually use foodbanks.

  Finding Data, Data Depositories, and Directories

  Sometimes the numeric research data you need may not be in the articles, books, and websites that
  you've found. But that doesn't mean that they haven't been collected and packaged in a usable format.
  Governments and research institutions often publish data they have collected in discipline-specific data
  depositories that make data available online. Here are some examples:

    · United States Census Bureau
    · Budget of the United States Government
    · U.S. Bureau of Justice Statistics
    · National Center for Education Statistics

  · Daily Weather Maps NOAA)
  · GeoData.gov
  · The World Factbook (CIA)
  · OSU Knowledge Bank
The United Nations and just about every country provide information as numeric data available online. Free
and accessible data like this is called open data. The U.S. federal government, all states, and many local
governments provide "open" data. You can find them (among other places) at site: .gov.
Other data are available through vendors who publish the data collected by researchers. Here are some
examples:
  · Hoover's Online (OSU Only)
  · International Monetary Fund Statistical Databases
  · World Health Organization Statistical Information System
  · Envirofacts
  · Census of Agriculture (OSU only)
  · OECD Education at a Glance
  · Corruption Perceptions Index
Don't know of a depository that could contain data in your discipline? Check out a data directory such as
re3data.org where data can be registered.

Evaluating Data as Sources

Evaluating data for relevance and credibility is just as important as evaluating any other source. See Chapter
6, Evaluating Sources for help with that.

                                                                                                                                                       9. Data as Sources | 56
10. People as Sources

People don't just create the sources we use. They are actually sources themselves. Most of us use people as
sources all the time in our private lives, such as when we ask a friend for a restaurant recommendation or
ask whether a movie is worth watching. But you probably aren't using people as sources very often in your
assignments-unless you are a journalism major, of course.

In fact, research indicates that employers such as Battelle, Nationwide Insurance, Microsoft, the FBI, the
Smithsonian, the Port of Los Angeles, SS&G Financial Services, and Marriott International have been dissatisfied
with their new hires' inability to gather information by talking with real people. They've found new hires
unwilling or unprepared to ask the experienced employee down the hall or the expert across town for
information to solve a problem. For instance, the study linked above quotes one employer as saying about new
hires:

Here's something we're targeting in interviews now--the big thing is they believe the computer is their
workspace, so basic interactions between people are lost. They won't get up and walk over and ask someone a
question. They are less comfortable and have some lack of willingness to use people as sources and also have
a lack of awareness that people are a valid sources of information...

So getting some experience using people as sources is likely to help you not just with a current research
assignment but with your work in the future.

Important: Who's an "Expert"?

Experts aren't only researchers with PhDs doing academic work. The question when trying to decide who can
be a source is really always, who can speak with authority about any part of the subject? And the answer to that
question is always contextual, a kind of "it depends."

People can speak with authority for different reasons. According to the Framework for Information Literacy in
Higher Education, they can have subject expertise (say, having done scholarship in the field), societal position
(maybe a public office or other relevant work title), or special experience (say, living or working in a particular
situation of interest or having participated in a historical event).

For instance, people who have had firsthand experience living or working with a situation (say, a survivor of a
school shooting if your topic is on that subject) you are studying can have a unique perspective unavailable
elsewhere. And it's that up-close, firsthand view of the situation that gives them the authority that you and your
audience respond to.

Of course, such sources have to be evaluated just like any other. Could they be biased? Like any source, yes.
We just have to keep that possible bias in mind as we use the information from such a source. That's part of
exercising the critical thinking that research assignments are famous for producing.

Potentially biased or not, sometimes a source's firsthand experience can't be beaten. And recognizing what
they offer can help us open up to diverse ideas and worldviews that we would otherwise miss. Don't be
surprised if this kind of source takes you off in completely new directions with your assignment, ones that turn
out to be much more interesting than those you were following before. For many researchers, finding sources
that really open up a topic like that is one of the most rewarding--and fun--things about doing research.

TIP: How to identify researchers at OSU to interview.

   1. Search the database Scopus for your topic. Once you have some results, use the Affiliation
        option among Define Results options on the left to limit your search to Ohio State University.
        You may also want to limit by the Year option.

   2. Pull up relevant articles' records in Scopus (you can sort by times cited) and then identify
        which of the authors were at the time at OSU. (Articles may have multiple authors-sometimes
        over a dozen or more if they are in science).

   3. Go to Find People (on the OSU navigation bar on all OSU pages) and search for the OSU
        person's name to see if they're still at OSU and get their contact information. In many cases,
        they will still be at OSU, especially for fairly recent articles, because OSU updates author
        profiles regularly. Note that researchers may or may not be faculty-some may be staff or even
        students.

Citing People as Sources

Like other sources, people should be cited in your research final product, depending on the citation style
you're using. See Purdue Online Writing Lab (OWL) for information on how to handle interviews and other
communication with people in various styles.

                                                                                                       10. People as Sources | 58

                                                                                                                                3-Sources and Information Needs | 60
1. What Sources to Use When

                          It's easier to find appropriate sources when you start with a plan.

Sometimes students hate assignments that require sources to meet their research projects' information needs.
But if you didn't use sources to meet those needs, you would have to make everything up yourself. Just think of
the work! And then, would your audience believe you? So don't lament that you need sources. They are a huge
help, not an unnecessary bother, and you can learn to handle them.
A big way we can help is to let you know when to use which important categories of sources covered in Chapter
2 to meet your project's information needs. And some of those needs are pretty choosey.
Along with sometimes collecting your own data, meeting information needs is how you complete your project.
Here are those needs:

  · To learn more background information about your topic and research question.
  · To develop your research question(s).
  · To describe the situation surrounding your research question for your audience and explain why it's

      important.
  · To report what others have said about your question, including any different answers to your research

      question.
  · To answer your research question(s).
  · To convince your audience that your answer is correct or, at least, the most reasonable answer.
The verbs in the list of information needs above tell you exactly how you'll use sources to carry out your research
and create your final product: to learn, develop, describe, report, answer, and convince. But you won't be doing
any of that alone.
61 | 1. What Sources to Use When
Your sources will be giving you information to do all that. They'll also give you direct quotes and information to
summarize and paraphrase as you create your final product. In other words, your sources will support you every
step of the way during your research project.
That's true even when you find sources that disagree. Don't ignore this--it happens often. Instead, address
their differences within your report of what sources have said about your research question. That's a good way
to show your professor that you considered your research question from multiple perspectives. As you'll see
in Chapter 10, Writing Tips, showing different perspectives will actually strengthen your argument that your
answer is correct or at least the most reasonable answer.

          Tip:
          For another way to think about the work your sources do, see Roles of Research Sources.

  Needs and Final Products

  Background information seldom appears directly in any final product. But meeting each of the other
  information needs will usually result in written sections of a research paper or essay.
  For final products other than research papers and essays, you'll have to meet the same needs and will use
  sources to meet them. But not all needs will necessarily be included in sections of your final product.
  Example: Posters and Information Needs
  On a poster about your own original research, you aren't likely to have room to describe the situation
  surrounding your research question and why the question is important. That same lack of space may also
  mean you do not report what others have said about your research question. (Maybe you'll just add footnotes
  with no further explanation.) But that doesn't mean you didn't meet those information needs and others as
  your carried out your research. Unlike a research paper, essay, or journal article, the poster format in which
  you reported it just had less space.
  For instance, to justify doing the research to yourself and your professor, you probably started by meeting
  the information need to describe the situation around your research question and why it is important. Your
  instructor may have had you turn in that justification. And to do research based on what has already been
  found out, you will have studied what others have already reported about your research question. You may
  also have had to do that in order to make your answer to your research question more correct and believable.
  All that is without having room on your poster to report that you met those needs. But all your decisions
  about the information that is on your poster will have been informed by meeting those information needs.
  Here's a helpful ebook about developing a research poster in the sciences.

                                                                                                                                         1. What Sources to Use When | 62

2. Which Kinds of Sources Meet Which
Needs?

       Student Voices: Riley says sources are keyed to information needs | Transcript

Understanding the categories of sources explained in Chapter 2, Types of Sources, can give you a better sense
of command over your sources. But because there are several categories, the options you have to meet your
project's information needs can still seem complex.

       Tip:
       The upcoming section refers to courses in the arts, the sciences and social sciences, and the
       humanities. We make source recommendations accordingly. Deciding whether your particular
       course is in the arts or the sciences or social sciences may be pretty obvious to you.
       But what kinds of courses are in the humanities? Different universities organize knowledge
       differently, and you can always ask you professor. In general, though, the recommendations in the
       next section for humanities courses apply to these kinds of courses:

            · Literature, religion, history, classics, languages, linguistics, museum studies, area or ethnic
                studies, and philosophy.

       Our recommendations for the sciences also apply to these courses:
            · Engineering, architecture, computer science, physical anthropology, agriculture, physical
                geography, and math/statistics.

       The recommendations for social sciences courses, such as education, sociology, social work,
       psychology, economics, and criminology, also apply to:

            · Business, political science, cultural anthropology, law, labor/management, and human
                geography.

Our best advice is to ask yourself these two questions when considering which sources you must use to
meet an information need in a project for a specific course:

 1. Must I use only sources created for professional and scholarly audiences?If your course is in the sciences,
      social sciences, and engineering, the answer is most likely yes for all information needs except learning
      background information. Except when meeting that information need, those students' sources will need
      to be professional and scholarly sources such as research journal articles, books by researchers and other
      scientists or academics, conference papers, tech reports, and theses and dissertations.While they may not
      be so limited, students in other kinds of courses (say, in the humanities) also may find that using
      professional and scholarly sources is often the best way for them to make their argument, too. That's

                                                                                                              2. Which Kinds of Sources Meet Which Needs? | 64
      because such sources are often the most persuasive sources across disciplines. So just because you aren't
      limited to those sources in a particular course doesn't mean you can't make good use of them.If your
      course is in the arts, the answer is usually no. Students in the arts, for instance, often use popular sources
      because that may be where their art first appears.In all cases, pay attention to what's suggested in the
      instructions for your assignment and, if necessary, ask your professor.

2. Must I pay attention to how close my sources are to the original information? In other words, are
      primary and secondary sources acceptable, while tertiary sources are not? If your course is in the
      humanities the answer is usually yes. For instance, your instructions for your history research project
      might tell you to "Use 5 sources, at least 2 of which are primary sources." But even while students avoid
      tertiary sources, their primary and secondary sources still must be evaluated for relevance and accuracy
      just like their other sources. (See Chapter 6, Evaluating Sources.) Because of the information lifecycle, the
      latest secondary sources are often the best because their creators have had time for better analysis and
      more information to incorporate.The answer is likely to be no in science and social science courses, where
      the primary, secondary, and tertiary designations seldom come up. When they do, the term primary
      source usually does not mean original or contemporary with what is being studied. Instead, it is usually
      applied to the source that was most important to the researcher's work.Many other courses outside the
      sciences and social sciences also tend not to place extra value on information that is closest to the original.
      To tell whether it matters in your course, pay attention to whether your professor uses the terms primary,
      secondary, and tertiary when discussing sources, and read your project instructions carefully. Don't forget
      that you can ask your professor which kinds of sources matter in his or her discipline.

The material below should give you further details about how to meet particular information needs with
sources.

To learn background information about your topic and research question:

  · No matter which kind of course you're taking, when you first get a research assignment and perhaps for a
      considerable time afterward, you will almost always have to learn some background information before
      you can develop your research question and explore how to answer it.

  · Although you shouldn't cite it as a source, Wikipedia is often a great source for background information.
      You may even want to check out the sources at the bottom of most pages because those sources can
      often be cited.

  · One important reason for finding background information is to learn the language that professionals and
      scholars have used when writing about your research question. The language you learn may be helpful to
      use as search terms later, particularly when you're searching for sources to answer your research question.
      To identify that language, you can always type the word glossary and then the discipline for which you're
      doing your assignment in the search engine search box.

Here are two examples to try searching: Glossary neuroscience and Glossary "social media marketing"

       Tip: (Putting a phrase in quotation marks tells Google to search it as all words together rather than
       searching the individual words.)

  · You probably won't be citing these background sources in your final product. They are usually only to build

65 | 2. Which Kinds of Sources Meet Which Needs?
      your understanding and help you develop a research question.
  · Because of that, use whatever kind of source you can understand. The intended audience and how close

      the source is to original information is not important at this stage. You are not limited to primary sources.
      Secondary sources that synthesize an event or work of art and even tertiary sources such as guidebooks
      and timelines can be a big help. Don't forget your textbook for the course.
  · For most undergraduates, research journal articles are usually sources least likely to be helpful for
      background information because they are usually too technical and specific to be easily understood. Only
      after you have more understanding and are trying to meet other information needs will journal articles be
      more useful to you.

To describe the situation surrounding your research question for your audience and explain why it's
important:

  · Sources for this information need are among those you can cite in your final product.
  · In the sciences and social sciences, you are most likely limited to professional and scholarly sources.
  · In most other courses, you have more freedom to include whatever kinds of sources provide a clear and

      compelling reason why getting your research question answered is important and to whom.
  · Helen Sword, the author of Stylish Academic Prose, suggests using a literary quotation, a historical

      quotation, a personal or historical anecdote or one drawn from your research, a description of a scene or
      artwork, a surprising fact, or a challenging question.
  · Some examples of acceptable sources to meet this need outside the sciences and social sciences are
      substantive popular sources such as major newspaper or magazine articles and documentaries, books,
      poems, plays and movies, lyrics from songs, and examples and descriptions of artwork. Also acceptable, of
      course, are blogs, websites, and publications from professional associations, articles from scholarly
      research journals, conference papers, tech reports, and theses and dissertations. Those professional and
      scholarly sources listed are appropriate for science and social science courses, too.

To answer your research question, convince your audience that your answer is right or at least reasonable,
and to report what others have reported about your research question:

  · These are among the sources you will cite in your final product.
  · For these information needs, the credibility of your sources is of paramount importance. You want your

      reader to believe your argument.
  · What is most credible varies by discipline.
  · Just ask yourself Questions 1 and 2 that appeared at the beginning of this chapter and choose your

      sources accordingly. And remember: you can always ask your professor about whether a particular source
      is useful.

You already may have realized that you can use the same source to meet more than one information need in
your research project. For instance, let's say you're working on a presentation for an economics class. You could
use a scholarly article or book to help you develop your research question, to report what others have said about
the question, and to help you formulate your own answer. Of course, your professor also will want you to have
investigated the perspective of more than one source, so you will be needing others. Still, it's nice to know that
a single source can meet more than one information need.

Here are some profiles of students choosing sources for their courses.

                                                                                                              2. Which Kinds of Sources Meet Which Needs? | 66
If you need more examples of sources that are primary, secondary, or tertiary and popular, professional, or
scholarly, our Source Locator which you'll find later in this chapter, is a good list of categorized sources. Chapter
2, Types of Sources, also has more detail about sources in each category.

3. Planning Your Sources

Okay, you should be able to tell from the information above which sources will be most useful to you for specific
kinds of courses. When you are about to start a research project in such a course, actually making a plan for the
kinds you need will save you time as you search for sources.

       Student Voices: Gabe talks about planning his sources | Transcript
Instead of just seeing what sources you can find "out there," having a plan can help you conscientiously choose
sources that will meet all your information needs. It will save you time in the long run and will lead to more
successful research projects, with fewer last-minute panics over not having the best sources. It's very comforting
to have a plan all in one place so that you can just follow the plan and aren't having to re-think everything each
time you look for sources. Perhaps most important, it can also help you answer the question "Have I have found
enough sources?" which really depends on whether you have sources to meet all your information needs.
Here's a form for such a plan, called Plan for Sources, plus an example of it filled out for a hypothetical
research project. You can download a copy of the form to fill out for your own research project in Word at
http://go.osu.edu/planforsources. (On our example form, the  indicates the student thinks she has found all the
sources she needs to meet that need.)

                         Thinking through the types of sources you need to meet your information needs helps you target your search. You
                         can download the Plan for Sources table at http://go.osu.edu/planforsources.

  EXAMPLE: Sample "Plan for Sources" Table

                          Completing the table puts all your planning in one place.

Knowing what you need is a huge clue to knowing where to look for them. Here's another aid to make it
easier to plan for what you need and then find your sources.
Our Source Locator can help by suggesting where to find particular kinds of sources in various formats. Once
more, thinking of categories can help because where sources are located is generally organized by audience
expertise level--by whether they are popular, professional, or scholarly sources. Popular and professional are
often grouped together. But scholarly sources tend to hang out by themselves. That's why searching Google
Scholar locates more of them than plain old Google, and academic libraries have more scholarly sources than
public libraries. However, disciplines can still influence where you should and should not look for those sources.
For example, if you are majoring in the life sciences, ask your professor whether Google Scholar is okay to use.
They may tell you to use the library database called PubMed instead.

1. Why Precision Searching?

                          Precise searches turn up more appropriate sources.

Effective searching takes precision. This section shows you how to perform several steps to make your searching
more precise--you'll turn up more sources that are useful to you and perhaps, sources that may be even crucial
to your research question.
You've probably been searching in a more casual way for years and may wonder: Is going to the trouble of
precision searching actually worth it?
Yes, definitely, for searches that are important to you! You're in competition with many people who are working
to be as skilled as they can be. So you should use of these steps for course assignments and for information
tasks you do on the job. With other tasks and searches, precision searching may be less important.

Search Strategy

This information on precision searching is based on how search tools such as Google and specialized databases
operate. If you've been more casual in your searching practices, some of these steps may be new to you.
Starting with a research question helps you figure out precisely what you're looking for. Next, you'll need the
most effective set of search terms - starting from main concepts and then identifying and alternate between
related and terms. Those search terms need to be arranged in the most effective way as search statements,
which you actually type into a search box.

71 | 1. Why Precision Searching?
An important thing to remember is that searching is an iterative process: we try search statements, take a look
at what we found and, if the results weren't good enough, edit our search statements and search again--often
multiple times. Most of the time, the first statements we try are not the best, even though Google or another
search tool we're using may give us many results.

It pays to search further for the sources that will help you the most. Be picky.

Here are the steps for an effective search.

The steps in a precise search

2. Main Concepts

       Student Voices: Riley talks about using main concepts as search terms | Transcript

Identify the main concepts in your research question by selecting nouns important to the meaning of your
question. Leave out words that don't help the search, such as adjectives, adverbs, prepositions and, usually,
verbs. Nouns that you would use to tag your research question so you could find it later are likely to be its main
concepts.
Finding the main concepts in a research question is a lot like finding the main idea in an essay or story. Often the
main idea is in the first paragraph, but not always. Sometimes it's in a later paragraph or even in the conclusion.
The same is true with research questions--the main concepts can be at the beginning, middle, or end. Stick
to the nouns and only what's necessary, not already implied. Don't read in concepts that are not really there.
Be alert to words that may have connotations other than the concept you are interested in. For instance, if you
identify depression as a main idea, be aware that the search engine won't automatically know whether you
mean depression as a psychological state or as a condition of the economy or as a weather characteristic.

  EXAMPLE: How are birds affected by wind turbines?

  The main concepts are birds and wind turbines. Avoid terms like affect (except the noun) and effect as search
  terms, even when you're looking for studies that report effects or effectiveness.

  EXAMPLE: What lesson plans are available for teaching fractions?

  The main concepts are lesson plans and fractions. Stick to what's necessary. For instance, don't include:
  children--nothing in the research question suggests the lesson plans are for children;
  teaching--teaching isn't necessary because lesson plans imply teaching; available--available is not
  necessary.
Sometimes your research question itself can seem complicated. Make sure you've stated the question as
precisely as possible (as you learned in Research Questions). Then apply our advice for identifying main
concepts as usual.

73 | 2. Main Concepts
ACTIVITY: Main Concepts
ACTIVITY: More Main Concepts
EXAMPLE: Does the use of mobile technologies by teachers and students in the
classroom distract or enhance the educational experience?

Acceptable main concepts are teaching methods and mobile technology. Another possibility is mobile
technologies and education.
Watch out for overly broad terms. For example, don't include:

  · Educational experience (it misses mobile technology).
  · Classroom distractions (too broad because there are distractions that have nothing to do with

      technology).
  · Technology (too broad because the question is focused on mobile technology).

                                                                                                                                                        2. Main Concepts | 74
3. Related and Alternative Terms

For each main concept, list alternative terms, including synonyms and singular and plural forms of the words.
Sometimes synonyms, plurals, and singulars aren't enough. So also consider associations with other words and
concepts. For instance, it might help, when looking for information on the common cold, to include the term
virus--because a type of virus causes the common cold.
Check to make sure that your terms are not too broad or too narrow for what you want. Figuring out what's too
broad or too narrow takes practice and may differ a bit with each search.

  TIP: Try a Thesaurus

  Have you considered using a thesaurus, such as thesaurus.com? Or adding a thesaurus to your browser
  search bar?

  ACTIVITY: Finding Synonyms

  When figuring out search terms, you can try your search terms in Visuwords <visuwords.com>, an online
  graphical dictionary, to see the connections visually in a diagram reminiscent of a neural net. It can help you
  see connections between terms that are not easy to think of.

  ACTIVITY: Alternate Terms

Subject Headings Instead of Keywords

All the searches we have talked about so far have been keyword searches, usually used in search engines.
But sometimes it pays to use tools--such as library catalogs and journal article databases--that have subject
headings that you can search. Subject headings are standardized terms that are assigned by trained experts.
(Some such tools also allow keyword searching.) See the section on Specialized Databases for more detail about
searching subject headings.

75 | 3. Related and Alternative Terms
4. Search Statements

At this point in your search process, you are moving from merely identifying main concepts and similar search
terms to developing more complicated search statements that can do more precise searching.

Use Quotation Marks for Phrases

Put quotation marks around any phrases among your terms so that the phrase is what's searched for, rather
than the separate words. "Common cold" instead of common cold is a good example. Without those quotation
marks, just think how many sources Google or other search tools would waste their/your time on things that
have nothing to do with our sniffles.

Putting a phrase in quotes returns results containing that phrase, and not the results for the individual words.

Use Wildcard and Truncation Symbols to Broaden

Consider whether using wild card or truncating symbols would help find variations of a word. For instance, the
wildcard symbol in wom?n finds both woman and women, and the truncating symbol in mathematic* finds
mathematics, mathematically, mathematician, etc.

Using wildcard characters allows you to find variations of a word.

                                                                    4. Search Statements | 76
Consider AND, OR, NOT

You can often do more precise searching by combining search terms by using the words AND, OR, and NOT.
These are known as Boolean Operators. Generally, using these operators narrows your search, making it more
precise.

     The Boolean operators AND, OR, and NOT exclude or include subsets of sources.

AND - If the main idea contains two or more ideas, you'll want to use AND to combine those terms in your search
statement. To look for information about spiders as signs of climate change, you'll want to have both terms in
the search and perform an AND search. That's what automatically happens in search engines such as Google
and Bing unless you tell them to do something different by using OR,NOT, or-.
OR - If the main idea has several synonyms, use OR to combine them. Most search tools search for all terms
(AND) by default, so you need to use the operator OR between terms to let them know you want to find any
of the terms not documents with all the terms. For instance, in the previous example of Latino small business
growth, we would want to also use the term Hispanic.
NOT - If the main idea has a common use you want to exclude, use NOT to exclude that word. For example, if
we were looking for information about illegal drug use we would want to exclude prescription drugs from the
search results. This is commonly done with NOT or the use of the minus (-) sign. In Google, to exclude a word
use-word with no space between the - and the word you want to exclude. If you put a space in there, Google
will not exclude the word.(When using some search tools, you have to use AND NOT before the word to exclude
it.)

77 | 4. Search Statements
Using Parentheses with Multiple Operators

When a search statement requires the Boolean operators OR or NOT (or their symbols) with one another or with
AND, you must use parentheses to group the appropriate terms. The parentheses make their contents a single
unit, no matter how many terms are there.
The reason parentheses are necessary in searching is that search tools, including Google and Bing, generally
perform their operations from the left to right of a search statement. If you are mixing Boolean operators, the
way to make sure that the search is done as a whole statement requires that you use parentheses to combine
the sets in your statement.
Using parentheses may remind you of the mathematical statements written in math courses.

      A correct example:

       (saddles OR bridles) AND equestrian
       The parenthesis is necessary because you're mixing OR with the AND that Google and Bing will
       automatically put in, even if you don't. In this search, Google or Bing will first find documents that
       contain either the word saddles or the word bridles. Then Google or Bing will search those
       documents for the word equestrian and give you those documents as your search results.

      An incorrect example:

       (saddles OR bridles) AND (equestrian).
       The second parenthesis is unnecessary because there's no mixing of operators after the AND.
        Parentheses should never contain a single term in a search statement.

      Another correct example:

       (cats OR dogs) AND (treatment OR therapy).
       Notice the mixed multiple Boolean operators (OR, AND, OR)? They make the two parentheses
       necessary.

      Compare that with this incorrect example:

       (cats OR dogs) AND (treatment AND therapy)

                                                                                                                                                    4. Search Statements | 78
        ACTIVITY: Search Analysis

1. Library Catalog

The Ohio State University library catalog is searchable online and contains records for all the items owned or
licensed by OSU Libraries. It also includes a circulation system that is used to check out materials. Students can
use the system to have books and other materials quickly sent to their residence hall or for pick up at a library
on the Columbus campus or at any of the regional campus libraries. Items in the catalog include books, journals
(but not individual journal articles), documents, maps, movies, and recordings.

When to Use It

Use the library catalog to search for items that you can access because you are affiliated with Ohio State, to
locate where those materials are stored, and to request them.
Note that OSU's library catalog:

  · Does not contain the full-text of any materials. However, some items may include a table of contents and a
      link to full-text digital content.

  · Does not contain specific articles. The catalog can only tell you whether a journal or other periodical title is
      available.

How to Use It

To access the catalog, choose the Books and More tab on the OSU Libraries' main page at http://library.osu.edu.
From there, you can do a search or click on More Options to get access to other search options.

Searching Ohio State's catalog from library.osu.edu

Search Types

The catalog allows searching by author, title, journal title, subject, and keyword as well as specialty numbers
such as the Library of Congress call number and ISBN (International Standard Book Number). There is also an
option for advanced search.
Additional tips:

                                                                                                                                                           1. Library Catalog | 82
  · Keyword searches are the broadest search, as they search all information in an item record. (The search tips
      in Precision Searching, are based on using keywords.)

  · Subjects are a very specific set of terms that are helpful for precision searches. Often, the easiest way to
      find subject terms is to do a keyword search first and then look at the subject terms for those that are
      good matches for your topic. There is more about subject heading searching in Specialized Databases
      later in this section.

  · The Advanced Search screen allows a few additional search capabilities, such as multiple search fields to
      narrow the scope of a search term. You can also limit by year range, language, location, or format.

83 | 1. Library Catalog
2. WorldCat@OSU

WorldCat@OSU searches the holdings of libraries from all over the world (including Ohio State University
Libraries and OhioLINK libraries), as well as content from thousands of journals and millions of electronic books
and web-accessible documents.

When to Use It

WorldCat@OSU is good for quick searches on a topic, as a starting point, and for interdisciplinary topics.
However, despite its size, it is not all-inclusive. It does not search all journals and databases, and full-text
searching is limited.

How to Use It

To access WorldCat@OSU, choose the Search All tab on the OSU Libraries' main page at http://library.osu.edu.
(Off-campus users will be asked to sign in with an OSU username and password or proceed as a guest for
fewer options.)

Searching WorldCat@OSU from library.osu.edu

Narrowing Searches

  · To specific databases - From the Search All tab, click the Advanced Search link to get access to other
      search options, including selecting specific databases.

  · To articles - Under the Articles tab on the OSU Libraries home page, you will be using WorldCat@OSU to
      search only for articles.

                                                                                                                                                         2. WorldCat@OSU | 84
3. Google Scholar

Google Scholar is a tool for finding books and journal articles that you might normally get from a library. Where
possible, it provides links to online versions and to library copies to help you locate an item.

When to Use It

Use Google Scholar to find scholarly articles and books, verify citations, and explore related resources. When
books are available through Google Books, some of their content may be available online.

How to Use It

Go to Google Scholar (http://scholar.google.com).

4. Specialized Databases

A specialized database--often called a research or library database--allows targeted searching on one or more
specific subject areas (i.e., engineering, medicine, Latin American history, etc.), for a specific format (i.e., books,
articles, conference proceedings, video, images), or for a specific date range during which the information was
published. Most of what specialized databases contain can not be found by Google or Bing.
There are several types of specialized databases, including:

  · Bibliographic - details about published works
  · Full-text - details plus the complete text of the items
  · Multimedia - various types of media, such as images, audio clips, or video excerpts
  · Directory - brief, factual information
  · Numeric - data sources
  · Product - model numbers, descriptions, etc.
  · Mixed - a combination of other types, such as multimedia and full-text

  ACTIVITY: Database Types

When to Use Specialized Databases

Search specialized databases to uncover scholarly information that is not available through a regular web
search. Specialized databases are especially helpful if you require a specific format or up-to-date, scholarly
information on a specific topic.
Many databases are available both in a free version and in a subscription version. Your affiliation with a
subscribing library grants you access to member-based services at no cost to you. For example, using PubMed
via OSU Libraries enables a Find It link to help you request an item.

  TIP: Free vs. Subscription?

  In some cases, the data available in free and subscription versions are the same, but the subscription version
  provides some sort of added value or enhancement for searching or viewing items.

Database Scope

Information about the specific subject range, format, or date range a particular specialized database covers is
called its scope. A specialized database may be narrow or broad in scope, depending on whether it, for instance,
contains materials on one or many subject areas.
If you are using a database licensed by OSU Libraries and have clicked the title in the list of databases, you will
see scope information at the bottom of the same page that says "Click on the following to go to the resource."

                                                                                                                                               4. Specialized Databases | 86
This example shows the scope page for an OSU-licensed database. View the live example.

Once you are aware of a database's scope, you'll be able to decide whether the database is likely to have what
you want (for instance, journal articles as opposed to conference proceedings). Reading about the scope can
save you time you would have otherwise wasted searching in databases that do not contain what you need.

87 | 4. Specialized Databases
  ACTIVITY: Determining Subject Scope

  ACTIVITY: Years of Coverage

  Instructions: In addition to subject scope, database descriptions should include years of coverage. Visit Ohio
  State's Research Databases List to search for the databases listed below. Which database contains the oldest
  information? Which covers the fewest years?

     · Evidence Based Medicine Reviews
     · MathSciNet
     · GeoRef

  ANSWER TO ACTIVITY: Years of Coverage

  The answer to the "Years of Coverage" Activity above is:
    · The database containing the oldest material is GeoRef, which goes back to 1785.
    · The database covering the fewest years is Evidence Based Medicine Reviews, which goes back to 1991.

How to Use Them

Use of each database varies somewhat.
See Ohio State's research database list.

  EXAMPLE: Academic Search Complete

  Academic Search Complete (OSU only) is a general article database available through most academic and
  large public libraries that is often recommended for undergraduate research projects.

  MOVIE: Academic Search Complete Database in 3 Minutes

                                                                                                                                               4. Specialized Databases | 88
Keyword Searching

Although keyword search principles apply (as described in Precision Searching), you may want to use fewer
search terms since the optimal number of terms is related to database size. Google and Bing work best with
several terms since they index billions of web pages and additional terms help narrow the results. Each scholarly
database indexes a fraction of that number, so you are less likely to be overwhelmed by results even with one
or two keywords than you would be with a search engine.
Phrase searching (putting multiple words in quotes so Google or Bing will know to search them as a phrase)
is also less helpful in specialized databases because they are smaller and more focused. Databases are better
searched by beginning with only a few general search terms, reviewing your results and, if necessary, limiting
them in some logical way. (See Limiting Your Search below.)

  ACTIVITY: Compare Them!

  Instructions:
  Compare a search for items containing both phrases "United States" and "female serial killers" in the article
  database Academic Search Complete (OSU only) and in the web search engine Bing. (Make sure you include
  the quotation marks so they will be searched as phrases.) Notice how searching too narrowly (searching for
  phrases) affects results in the specialized database. How could you revise the specialized database search to
  get more results?

Limiting Your Search

Many databases allow you to choose which areas (also called fields) of items to search for your search term(s),
based on what you think will turn up documents that are most helpful.
For instance, you may think the items most likely help to you are those whose titles contain your search term(s).
In that case, your search would not show you any records for items whose titles do not have your term(s). Or
maybe you would want to see only records for items whose abstracts contain the term(s).
When this feature is available, directing your search to particular parts of items, you are said to be able to "limit"
your search. You are limiting your search to only item parts that you think will have the biggest pay-off at
distinguishing helpful items from unhelpful items.
Searching fields such as title, abstracts, and subject classification often gives helpful items.

  TIP: Full-Text Searches

  Some databases allow for full-text searching, but this option includes results where a search term
  appears only once in dozens or more pages. Searching fields such as title, abstracts, and subject
  classification will often give more relevant items than full-text searching.

89 | 4. Specialized Databases
Subject Heading Searching

One precision searching technique may be helpful in databases that allow it, and that's subject heading
searching. Subject heading searching can be much more precise than keyword searching because you are sure
to retrieve only your intended concept.
Subject searching is helpful in situations such as:

  · There are multiple terms for the same topic you're interested in (example: cats and felines).
  · There are multiple meanings for the same word (example: cookie the food and cookie the computer term).
  · There are terms used by professionals and terms used by the general public, including slang or shortened

      terms (example: flu and influenza).
Here's how it works:
Database creators work with a defined list of subject headings, which is sometimes called a controlled
vocabulary. That means the creators have defined which subject terms are acceptable and assigned only those
words to the items it contains. The resulting list of terms is often referred to as a thesaurus. When done
thoroughly, a thesaurus will not only list acceptable subject headings, but will also indicate related terms,
broader terms and narrower terms for a concept.

  TIP: Finding Useful Subject Headings

  Try this strategy to find useful subject headings. Remember it by thinking of the letters KISS:
    · Keyword-search your topic.
    · Identify a relevant item from the results.
    · Select subject terms relevant to your topic from that item's subject heading.
    · Search using these subject terms. (Some resources will allow you to simply click on those subject terms
        to perform a search. Others may require you to copy/paste a subject term[s] into a search box and
        choose a subject field.)

  ACTIVITY: Searching Specialized Databases

Records and Fields

The information researchers usually see first after searching a database is the "records" for items contained in
the database that also match what was asked for by the search.
Each record describes an item that can be retrieved and gives you enough information so that, hopefully, you
can decide whether it should meet your information need. The descriptions are in categories that provide

                                                                                                                                               4. Specialized Databases | 90
different types of information about the item. These categories are called "fields." Some fields may be empty of
information for some items, and the fields that are available depend on the type of database.

  EXAMPLE: Database Fields

  A bibliographic database describes items such as articles, books, conference papers, etc. Common fields
  found in bibliographic database records are:

    · Author.
    · Title (of book, article, etc.).
    · Source title (journal title, conference name, etc.).
    · Date.
    · Volume/issue.
    · Pages.
    · Abstract.
    · Descriptive or subject terms.
  In contrast, a product database record might contain the following fields:
    · Product Name.
    · Product Code number.
    · Color.
    · Price.
    · Amount in Stock.

91 | 4. Specialized Databases
5. Web Search Engines

Web search engines use special software programs (called robots, spiders, or crawlers) to find Web pages and
list (or index) all words within each one to make searching large quantities of pages faster. Indexes capture the
largest amount of information on the Web, but no index lists everything on the Internet.
Commonly used search engines include Google (https://www.google.com) and Bing (http://www.bing.com).
In addition to search engines, there are also:

  · Specialized web search engines - A tool that has a specialty, usually either a subject or format focus. It
      ignores the rest of the information on the web. Examples include science.gov (http://www.science.gov/)
      and TinEye Reverse Image Search (https://www.tineye.com).

  · Metasearch engines - Tools that search multiple web search engines and gives you results from all of
      them. Some of these return the best results from the search engines they search. Examples include
      Dogpile (http://www.dogpile.com) and WebCrawler (https://www.webcrawler.com).

  · Web directories - Tools created by editors or trained researchers who categorize or classify web sites by
      subject. Directories are more selective than search engines. An example is the Directory of Open Access
      Journals (https://doaj.org/).

When to Use Them

Web Search Engines and related web search tools are helpful for locating background information, news
(especially if it's recent), and public opinion.
However, scholarly information is often not available through a regular web search. If you do find scholarly
information through a web search engine, especially if you are off campus, you may be asked for payment to
access it. Ohio State Libraries can usually get you what you need without additional payment.
Remember to follow the advice in Evaluating Sources to determine whether information you locate online is
suitable for your information needs.

How to Use Them

6-Evaluating Sources

                                                                                                                                                   6-Evaluating Sources | 94
1. Thinking Critically About Sources

                          Evaluating sources often involves piecing together clues.

Evaluating sources for relevance, currency, and credibility is one of the most complex tasks you'll do when
working on a research project. Such sources will meet the information needs of your research project and make
it possible for you to complete your final product.
In order to evaluate a source, you have to answer three questions about it. The first two are intertwined and
answered pretty much at the same time as you're looking for sources. Then you answer the third question about
those sources that you have already decided are relevant and recent enough.

  · Is this source relevant to my research question?
  · Is this source recent enough (or created in the right time period)?
  · Is this a credible source-a source my audience and I should be able to trust?
You should be able to answer "yes" to these three questions about each source you cite for a research project.

          TIP: Other Criteria from Your Professor
          Don't forget that you also have to make sure your sources meet any other criteria that your
          professor may have given you for this assignment. For instance, professors often stipulate that

95 | 1. Thinking Critically About Sources
          some of your sources have to be scholarly sources or journal articles from a particular database.
          Professors in the humanities may also say that some of your sources must be primary sources. So
          make sure you have identified enough of the kind of sources your professor has requested.

It's important to determine relevance before credibility because no matter how credible a source is, if it's
not relevant to your research question it's useless to you for this project. By the same token, a source that
is not recent enough or not created in the right time period will also be unsuitable for your project, except
perhaps for background information that you don't cite.
You might already be worrying about how long evaluating sources is going to take. So let's say right off that
you won't have to read all of every source to decide whether it is relevant, current or created in the right time
period, and credible. (Later, of course, it will take a closer read to determine what direct quotes, paraphrases,
and summaries you may want to use from the sources you have selected. We take that up in Chapter 10, Writing
Tips.)
Regardless, our advice is to not begrudge the time you spend evaluating sources. It's one of the most important
things to learn in college--the opportunity to evaluate sources is one of the big reasons your professors assign
research projects. And your future employers will expect you to have learned how to do it. For the rest of your
professional and personal life, you will be using the critical thinking skills that make choosing the right sources
possible. So taking the time to learn those skills is a great investment.
Happily, you'll also get much faster the more you do it.

          ACTIVITY: Evaluation Basics

Making Inferences: Good Enough for Your Purpose?

Sources should always be evaluated relative to your purpose - why you're looking for information. But because
there often aren't clear-cut answers when you evaluate sources, much of the time it is inferences - educated
guesses from available clues - that you have to make about whether a source is relevant, current, and credible.
That's true even when your purpose is to answer the research question of your research assignment.
Your purpose will dictate:

  · What kind of information will help?
  · How serious you consider the consequences of making a mistake by using information that turns out to

      be inaccurate? When the consequences aren't very serious, it's easier to decide a source and its

                                                                                                                                1. Thinking Critically About Sources | 96
      information are good enough for your purpose. Of course, there's a lot to be said for always having
      accurate information, regardless.
  · How hard you're willing to work to get the credible, timely information that suits your purpose. What
      you're learning here will make it easier.
Thus, your standards for relevance and credibility may vary, depending on whether you need, say:
  · Information about a personal health problem.
  · An image you can use on a poster.
  · Evidence to win a bet with a rival in the dorm.
  · Dates and times a movie is showing locally.
  · A game to have fun with.
  · Evidence for your argument in a research project.
For your research assignments or a health problem, the consequences may be serious if you use information
that is irrelevant, or out-of-date, or not credible.

97 | 1. Thinking Critically About Sources
2. Evaluating for Relevancy

Relevant sources are those that pertain to your research question. You'll be able to identify them fairly quickly
by reading or skimming particular parts of sources and maybe jotting down little tables that help you keep
track. We'll show you how below, including where to look in specific kinds of sources and what questions to ask
yourself as you do.

One thing to consider early on as you make inferences about relevancy is the effect that timeliness- called
a source's currency-should have on deciding whether a source is relevant. Sometimes timeliness has a lot
to do with relevancy; sometimes it is less important. Your research question and your discipline will determine
that.

For instance, if your research question is about the life sciences, you probably should consider only the most
recent sources relevant for citing because the life sciences are changing so quickly. There is a good chance that
anything but the most recent sources may be out of date. So it's a good idea to aim for life sciences sources no
more than 5 years old. (An example of a discipline that calls for even newer sources is computer security.)

Sometimes emergencies change the schedule of what is recent enough. For instance, when the Covid-19
pandemic started, it was incredibility important for scientists to share their research information as quickly as
possible. At that time, scientific information about Covid-19 could become outdated in weeks or months-before
the peer review process was barely started.

Lives were at stake and for that reason, scientists started publishing their new research results on Covid-19 as
preprints--publications of results that had not yet been peer-reviewed-in an attempt to have them be useful
faster. Nonetheless, after preprint publication, the peer review process continued for much of that research.

But pre-prints didn't start with the Covid pandemic. Around for more than 30 years and now at Cornell
University, arXiv is a free distribution service and an open-access archive for more than two million scholarly
articles first published as preprints in the fields of physics, mathematics, computer science, quantitative
biology, quantitative finance, statistics, electrical engineering and systems science, and economics. Materials
on the site are not peer-reviewed by arXiv itself. (arXiv is pronounced archive.)

Before using preprints as sources, talk with your professor about whether she or he recommends their use in
your situation.

Many sciences other than life sciences primarily use newer content under 10 years old. But not always. That's
because the history department is not alone in valuing older content. For instance, mathematics is a discipline
that makes heavy use of older content. So how important the currency of your sources is will depend on your
research question and your discipline. Your professor can guide you about your own situation.

In most cases, it's best not to use a hard and fast rule about how current your sources have to be. Instead,
consider your discipline and research question and do some critical thinking. For example, suppose your
research question is about the Edo Period in Japan (1603-1868) or about Robert Falcon Scott, who explored the
Antarctic from 1901-1913. In these cases, an item from 1918 might be just as useful as an item from 2018 (although
new information may have been found in the 100-year gap). But something from 1899 about Antarctica or from
1597 about Japan would not be current enough for these research questions.

These examples also give you two more clues about how to treat the timeliness or currency of sources as you
consider relevance:

  · Because of how long ago they lived or occurred, it would be unusual for many sources on Robert Scott or
      the Edo Period to have been published very recently. So, unlike sources for the life sciences, whether a
      source is very recent should probably not determine its relevancy to research questions about Scott or the

                                                                                                                                            2. Evaluating for Relevancy | 98
      Edo Period.
  · Primary sources might be considered especially relevant to many humanities and other non-science

      research questions. For disciplines in the humanities, the phrase primary sources refers to sources created
      at the same time as something under study--in this case, things such as Scott's diaries and expedition
      photographs, as well as paintings, literature, clothing, and household items from the Edo Period. They go a
      long way to explain faraway people and times. (See Primary, Secondary, & Tertiary Sources.) On the other
      hand, when science disciplines use the phrase primary source, they usually mean where they primarily
      find the information they consider valid--in research journals.

  EXAMPLE: TED Currency
  Check out how currency is handled on TED. This site provides videos of speakers talking about new ideas
  in technology, entertainment, and design. (That's what TED stands for.) Some videos are labeled "Newest
  Talks," and TED tells when every video was recorded. That's because currency matters with TED Talks.

For your own sources for which timeliness matters, see the section below called Where to Look, which includes
where to look in websites, articles, and books for information about a source's currency.

Time-Saving Tips

Instead of thinking you have to read all of every source in order to figure out whether it's relevant, read or skim
only parts of each source. If you're looking at the right parts, that should give you enough information to make
an educated guess about relevancy and currency.
But what should you be looking for as you do that reading and skimming? One way to figure that out is to first
parse your research question so that you can figure out its main concepts. (This is like identifying main concepts
in your research question in order to search precisely, as we advise in Chapter 4.)
For instance, suppose your research question is: How does having diverse members in a group increase the
critical thinking of the group?
What are this question's main concepts? Our answer is: group diversity and critical thinking.
So when trying to judge which sources are relevant to these main concepts, you would assess whether each
source you've found pertains to at least one of these main concepts. We recommend you jot down a little table
like the one in the example below to keep track of which sources address each main concept.
To be considered relevant to your research question, a source wouldn't necessarily have to cover all of your main
concepts. But finding sources that do is ideal. Otherwise, you just have to make do with what you've got. Don't
forget that each source would have to pass the currency test, too, if the currency is important to your research
question. So it saves time to record your decisions about the sources' currency on your tables, too.

helpful later in your research process.

Where to Look in Websites, Articles, and Books

The information below tells where to look and what questions to ask yourself to assess the relevancy of articles,
books, and websites. The name of a source seldom tells you enough about its relevance, so whatever you do,
don't stop evaluating after looking only at a website's name or the title of another source.

Save time by looking in particular places in sources for information that will help you figure out whether the
source is relevant to your research project. Much of our advice below comes from "Speedy Reading" in The
Craft of Research, second edition, by Wayne Booth, Gregory Colomb, and Joseph Williams, University of Chicago
Press, 2003, pp. 108-109.

On a website, check the name of the website and its articles for clues that they contain material relevant to
your research question. Consider whether time should have an impact on what information can be considered
relevant to your research question. If so:

  · Skim any dates, datelines, What's New pages, and press releases to see whether any website content
      works with the time considerations you need.

  · Check for page creation or revision dates that you find. What you've already learned from other sources
      can also help. For instance, you may know that the information covered by a particular website, which
      seems relevant, is no longer considered the latest thinking. In that case, you could mark it irrelevant on
      your little table.

  · Skim any site map and index on the website for key words related to your research question.
  · Try the key words of your research question in the search box. Do you see enough content about your

      keywords to make you think parts of the website could be helpful?

For a research journal article, magazine article, or newspaper article, think about the title. Does it have
something to do with your research question? Consider whether time should have an impact on what sources
can be considered relevant. If so:

  · Is the publication date of any of these three kinds of articles within your parameters?
  · Skim the abstract of a journal article to see whether the article works with the time considerations you

                                                                                                                                           2. Evaluating for Relevancy | 100
      need. For instance, if there is a time period in your research question, does the article address the same
      time period or was it created during that time period?
  · Look at the abstract and section headings in a journal article or the early parts of a newspaper or
      magazine article to locate the problem or question that the article addresses, its solution, and the outline
      of the article's argument for its main claim. Can those help answer your research question? Do they make
      it seem as if the article will give you information about what others have written about your research
      question? Do they offer a description of the situation surrounding your research question?
  · Do the journal article's introduction and conclusion sections help you answer your research question and/
      or offer a description of the situation surrounding your question so you can explain in your final product
      why the question is important?
  · Check whether the journal article's bibliography contains keywords related to your research question. Do
      the sources cited by the bibliography pertain to your research question? (Bibliographies are especially
      good places to look for sources.)
  · If you decide the newspaper or magazine article is relevant, look at sources quoted or otherwise
      identified within it. Those may be additional sources for you.

For a book (perhaps in its library catalog listing), check whether the title and/or subtitle indicates the book
could be about your research question. You can find a lot of such information about the book from its listing in
a library catalog. Consider whether time should have an impact on what sources can be considered relevant.

  · Is the publication date or copyright date (usually listed in the library catalog or on the back of the book's
      title page) too early or late for any time constraints in your research question? Maybe it's just right.

  · Skim some of the preface and introduction to see whether the book works with the time considerations
      you need.

  · Check the bibliography to see whether the sources cited are about your research question.
  · Skim the book's table of contents and any summary chapters to locate the problem or question that the

      book addresses, its solution, and the broad outline of the book's argument for its main claim. Will any of
      that be helpful in answering your research question?
  · Skim some of the preface and introduction to see whether the book works with the time considerations
      you need.
  · Do those sections give you information about what others have written about your research question?
  · Do they offer a description of the situation surrounding your research question?
  · Look for your key words in the bibliography. Do the sources cited pertain to your research question?
  · Skim the index for topics with the most page references. Do the topics with the most page references
      pertain to your research question?

        ACTIVITY: Follow a Title's Clues for Relevance

          Instructions: This quiz asks you to use logic, the titles of sources, and their publication dates, to
          identify the source most likely to be relevant to each research question. (Outside of this quiz,
          sources are not actually in competition with one another to be relevant. But this seemed like a

101 | 2. Evaluating for Relevancy
good way to have you practice your skills at assessing relevance.) Many titles and dates below are
fictitious, but that doesn't affect their relevance within the quiz. Book, journal, website, and
newspaper titles are italicized; chapter and article titles are in quotes.

   1. For each, read the information about the research question and each source.
   2. For each, record your judgments on a little table that you jot down like those illustrated

        earlier.
   3. For each, mark your answer, which should be the most relevant source according to the

        little table you completed for the question.
  4. Check your answers with our feedback.

ACTIVITY: Connecting the Dots Beyond the Title

Instructions: You always need to go beyond the title of a source when judging relevance. In the
previous activity, you evaluated the titles of sources for currency and relevance. For this activity,
you will investigate beyond the title to see whether one of the (hypothetical) articles named in
the last activity is indeed relevant to meeting your information needs.

   1. Read the abstract of the article below, using your critical thinking skills to try to identify the
        information needs of your project it could help you meet.

   2. Then answer the questions about which information needs the source can help you meet.
        (Mark all that apply.)

   3. If there is at least one need it can help meet, you should judge the article relevant. Don't
        forget to compare your answers with our feedback.

Your research question is: How does "prospect theory" in behavioral economics help explain
medical doctors' decisions to favor surgery or radiation to cure cancer in patients?
As usual, your information needs are:

    · To learn more background information.
    · To answer your research question.
    · To convince your audience that your answer is correct or, at least, the most reasonable

        answer.
    · To describe the situation surrounding your research question for your audience and explain

        why it's important,
    · To report what others have said about your question, including any different answers to

                                                                                                                               2. Evaluating for Relevancy | 102
                  your research question.

                  Abstract:
                  "Cancer Treatment Prescription-Advancing Prospect Theory beyond Economics," in
                  Journal of The American Medical Association Oncology, June, 2022. (This article and
                  abstract are fictitious but the journal and its form for abstracts are real.)
                  Importance Cancer treatment is complex. We expect oncologists to make treatment
                  decisions according to definitive standards of care. Finding out that prospect theory
                  demonstrates that they react very much like most other people when deciding to
                  recommend surgery or chemotherapy for their patients indicates that more self-
                  reflection on oncologists' part could help patients make better decisions. (Prospect theory
                  describes how people choose between alternatives that have risk when the probability of
                  different outcomes is unknown.)
                  Objective To show whether prospect theory applies to how oncologists framed their
                  recommendations for surgery or chemotherapy for patients in good condition and bad
                  condition.
                  Design, Settings, and Participants Records of 100 U.S. oncologists were examined for the
                  years 2019 and 2020, which documented patient conditions and the way oncologists
                  framed their recommendations regarding surgery or chemotherapy. Records of nine
                  thousand patients were involved. Thus, a quasiexperimental ex post facto design was
                  used for the study.
                  Main Outcomes and Measures This study explored the relationship between the way in
                  which the oncologists "framed" the choice of surgery or chemotherapy as they made
                  recommendations to patients, the patients' conditions, and the choice actually made.
                  Those results were compared to what prospect theory would predict for this situation.
                  Results Physicians seemed to present their recommendation of surgery or
                  chemotherapy in a loss frame (e.g., "This is likely to happen to you if you don't have this
                  procedure") when patients' conditions were poor and in a gain frame (e.g., "By having this
                  procedure, you can probably dramatically cut your chances of reoccurrence") when their
                  conditions were less poor. These results are what prospect theory would have predicted.
                  Conclusions and Relevance This study opens up the possibility that, as described by
                  prospect theory, a person's choice of framing behavior is not limited to how we naturally
                  act for ourselves but includes how we act for other people, as the oncologists were acting
                  on behalf of their patients. More research is necessary to confirm this line of evidence and
                  determine whether oncologists' decision making and framing is the most effective and
                  entirely according to the best standards of care.

          Which information needs could this source help you meet if your research question was: How
          does "prospect theory" in behavioral economics help explain medical doctors' decisions to favor
          surgery or radiation to cure cancer in patients?

3. Evaluating for Credibility

Once you have determined that a source is relevant and current, it's very important to evaluate it for credibility.
That is, should you be able to trust that source?
The best practices for evaluating credibility have recently changed in interesting ways. Previously, we looked
deeper and deeper into the source itself to evaluate it. That was sort of a "vertical" look at the source. But
because of research conducted at Stanford University in 2017, now we recommend you instead look at what
others have written about your source. Look across other sources at what they have to say about the source
you are evaluating so that you are not just accepting what sources say about themselves. This method is called
"lateral reading," and we will show you how to do it below.
To sum up right now, if you have not considered what others have written about your source and its author
and publisher, you have not evaluated its credibility.

       The new recommendations stem from a 2017 Stanford University study that compared university
       students' and faculty members' actions to evaluate sources with those of professional fact-checkers.
       The fact-checkers' actions were superior and faster, the study concluded. You can read about the
       study yourself at Lateral Reading: Reading Less and Learning more When Evaluating Digital
       Information.

How to Use Lateral Reading+

Here's what we recommend for evaluating credibility of the relevant sources you have found.
The goal is to end up with a list of trustworthy sources. It's from that list you will choose some to answer your
research question in your final product and meet the rest of your information needs as you complete your final
product. (You can read about your information needs in Chapter 3, What Sources to Use When.)
You will get very fast at this, the more you do it. Remember, you are only checking the credibility of these
sources, not whether you will use them. You'll end up identifying trustworthy sources you can safely use, not
with a list you will use. (Help for figuring out which you will use is in Chapter 10, Writing Tips.)
Your mental attitude should be one of skepticism--make the sources prove to you that they are credible.

Steps for Lateral Reading+

As you take the steps below, keep brief notes on what you find out from Steps 1-5 so that you build a context
with which to infer in Step 6 that the source is credible or not credible. (We give you the details about particular
steps after this list of steps.)

 1. Bring up the relevant source on your screen. (If you are evaluating a relevant print source, have it in front of
      you.) As you'll see below, you will be reading or viewing one aspect of this source at a time and checking
      those things out online.

2. Open a new tab to evaluate the source as a whole. You can look on our suggested sites that may be helpful
      to quickly weed out individual sources that are untrustworthy. Make brief notes on what you find out.

 3. Open a new tab to determine what type of source it is. This is important because different kinds of sources
      usually have more or fewer processes in place to ensure credibility, which is a big clue to whether you can
      trust them. (To review kinds of sources, see Chapter 2, Types of Sources.) Make brief notes on what you find
      out.

4. Open a new tab to evaluate whether there is reason to believe the author and/or publisher know what
      they are talking about. Or do they just have opinions? Make brief notes on what you find out.

                                                                                                                                           3. Evaluating for Credibility | 106
 5. Open a new tab to evaluate major bits of information the source puts forward as fact. Make brief notes on
      what you find out.

6. Make your inference about the source's credibility by grading on credibility and record it in your notes: Give
      it an A (very acceptable), B (good, but could be better), C (OK in a pinch), D (marginal), or E (unacceptable).
      You may decide to use those sources that received a C or higher grade, although you should obviously
      prefer those with grades A or B, especially for answering your research question.

 7. Go on to the next relevant source you want to evaluate.

Do you notice how almost all of your time is spent looking outside the source itself during those steps? That's
lateral reading. The idea is to not spend much time reading a source that may not turn out to be credible.

       TIP:
       What you should ignore online when determining credibility:

            · Whether it's a .com, .org, .edu, or .net. (It is a myth that domains of a URL indicate anything
                about credibility.)

            · Whether it looks aesthetically pleasing.
            · Whether the site has advertisements.
            · Whether scientific jargon or statistics are used.
            · How socially approved a website's or its organization's name is.

Details about Step 2

You'll want to find out what others have thought of your source as a whole. Open a new tab and use Google or
Bing to type in the name of the website, the publisher, and/or the author of the source. View some of your initial
results.
Has anyone raised concerns about your source? If so, look for assessments of your source on a few of these
websites: Wikipedia, NPR, Snopes, Politifact, SciCheck, FactCheck.org, and Washington Post Fact Checker.
Wikipedia also has a list of fact-checking websites about political and not-political subjects.
What they found out may make you immediately distrust the source and rule it out. But their reviews of your
source--or lack of a review-may be positive enough to keep you evaluating it.
Next, look for other websites' assessments of your source among your search results. Your Google results
page should show you above each title where each result was published, as is illustrated here for a search for
consumerism ecology and here in Google Scholar for the same search. Did others identify any problems or good
things about the source? Record that in your notes.

       TIPS:

107 | 3. Evaluating for Credibility
Are you trying to see what others are saying about a journal article? There are tools that track where
journal articles (and some conference papers and books) are being cited. Scopus and Web of
Science are two library databases that do this. Google Scholar also does this, as well. A few cautions:

    · New content hasn't had a chance to get cited.
    · Some subject areas may make use of certain formats more than other subjects (books may get

        more citations in math than in physics, for example).
    · Citing something doesn't equal agreeing with it.
    · Different subject areas have different citation levels. Areas like medicine or physics articles tend

        to get more citations than history or literature articles, for example.
    · Some journals' items get cited more because of their reputation, but that doesn't mean other

        titles have bad content.

Details about Step 3

This step accounts for the "+" in "Lateral Reading +". Here's
where you determine which type of source you're
evaluating, which involves thinking about who it was
created for. If you get stuck, thinking about what the
source's purpose is can help.

Figure out who it was created for. Ask yourself whether it     Spam by remmachenasreddine from Noun Project (CC BY 3.0)
is (a) a popular source for everyone, (b) a substantive
popular source created for educated people or those very
interested in the subject, (c) a professional source created
for members of a particular profession, or (d) a scholarly
source aimed at scholars and others who want a deep view
of a subject. (If you need to brush up on these distinctions,
see Chapter 2, Types of Sources.)

You can often get fast clues to what kind of source it is
even before clicking on it on your results page in Google or
Bing. For instance, the URL may tell you the source was published in an online version of a newspaper or
magazine.

Or maybe you searched for the source in Google Scholar or a library database, so you already know that your
source is likely to be a professional source or a scholarly article in a research journal. For more on how to tell what
each database covers (often called its scope), see Chapter 5, Search Tools. (If you are in a life sciences course,
make sure to ask your professor whether Google Scholar is a good search engine for you.)

Wikipedia can sometimes tell you whether your source is a magazine, newspaper, journal, etc. For instance, see
what Wikipedia says about Men's Health, Investopedia, and Cell. Library catalogs can also tell you about sources,
as these OSU Libraries full catalog entries do about Athletic Business and The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes.

In general, substantive popular sources, professional sources, and scholarly sources tend to be more credible

                                                               3. Evaluating for Credibility | 108
than popular sources. That's because the creation of these kinds of sources often involves processes that
help ensure their accuracy. (You still need to evaluate them, but it tends to be easier.)
Those processes include ways of preventing inaccuracies (including fact checkers for many substantive popular
sources and peer review for scholarly sources) and ways of correcting mistakes that nonetheless occur. For
instance, major U.S. newspapers correct previously published information every day or week and research
journals retract journal articles whose inaccuracies becomes apparent. Even articles by Nobel laureates have
been retracted, as this article in the journal Nature illustrates.
Because their processes are so strong, The New York Times and The Washington Post are considered to be
newspapers of record. Other news sources such as the Wall Street Journal, Boston Globe, Los Angeles Times,
Star Tribune in Minnesota, NPR, PBS, ABC News, CBS News, NBC News, the Associated Press and Bloomberg
wire services, and the BBC are also substantive popular sources with strong processes for credibility.
The same is true for magazines such as The Atlantic, The New Yorker, Harpers, National Review, Discover,
Popular Science, Popular Mechanics, Psychology Today, Wired, Forbes, The Chronicle of Higher Education,
Smithsonian, FiveThirty Eight, National Geographic, and Slate. TED is also a substantive popular source.
That doesn't mean they and the many, many other credible substantive popular sources never make mistakes.
But it means that those like the ones named take special care to be more credible than popular sources in
general.
Here's an essay called "Journalism's Essential Value" by the publisher of the New York Times about the
importance of news sources remaining an independent source of information, unlike many newspapers in
Europe (such as the Guardian and the Guardian U.S., which lean left politically) and what some would want here
in the U.S. The essay was published in the Columbia Journalism Review (a professional source) on May 15, 2023.
If, after considering who the source was created for, you are still unsure of an online source's type,
determining the source's purpose can help. To do so, consider what Internet neighborhood the source is
published in.
To understand this concept and begin to use it, imagine that all the sites on the web constitute a community.
Just like in a geographical community, there are neighborhoods in which individual sites hang out.

Details about Step 4

Now go back to your source and open up a new tab. This time you will be identifying who created and
published your source and whether you think they are trustworthy about the information in this source.

As you consider what you learn about the author and/or publisher,
ask yourself whether any of your results give you a reason to
suspect they are interested in providing misinformation, perhaps
for profit or for religious or political reasons.

If so, that doesn't necessarily make it an unacceptable source,
depending on your research question. But you should be aware of
that potential bias of the source because it's part of the context of
the conversation around that source.

In addition, if you end up using and citing such a source, you may     The reputation of the author and publisher influences your

"These authors say X about Y, although one has to keep in mind
what might be their political bias." That way, your instructor will
know that you are aware of the whole conversation so far about
this source, which always counts as a positive. (See our feedback
about the sources in our last activity in this chapter called Your
Turn to Evaluate for more on this subject.)

The more you know about the author and/or publisher, the more confidence you can have in your decision
about credibility. Sites that do not identify an author or publisher are generally considered less credible for

111 | 3. Evaluating for Credibility
many purposes, including for research papers and other high-stakes projects. The same is true for sources in
other formats, including videos and print.

Authors and publishers can be individuals, organizations, companies, or government agencies. (Webmasters
put things on the site but do not usually decide what goes on all but the smallest websites. They often just carry
out others' decisions.)

                                                         If your source is online, you may see a hyperlinked
                                                         author name. Click on that to see if you can get more
                                                         information about the person. Sometimes, you may
                                                         see information about them at the bottom of the
                                                         source. If it's a scholarly journal, book, or conference
                                                         paper that you are examining, you will often see their
                                                         affiliation (where they work) - often a university,
                                                         research lab, museum, or some other institution with
                                                         experts. Databases like Scopus and Web of Science
                                                         also allow you to look up authors and see profiles of
                                                         their research (just be careful to get the right person
                                                         - some names are very common!).

                                                         You may find the publisher's name next to the

                                                         copyright symbol, ©, at the bottom of at least some

university by ABDUL LATIF from Noun Project (CC BY 3.0)  pages on a site. In books, the identity of the publisher
                                                         is traditionally on the back of the title page, with a few

                                                         sentences about the author on the back cover or on

                                                         the flap inside the back cover. (But, of course,

remember that those comments are those the publisher decided to publish.)

If your source is a website, sometimes it helps to look at the source's URL for whether it belongs to a single
person or to a reputable organization. Because many colleges and universities offer blog space to their faculty,
staff, and students that uses the university's web domain, this evaluation can require deeper analysis than
just looking at the address. Personal blogs may not reflect the official views of an organization or meet the
standards of formal publication.

Unless you find information about the author to the contrary, such blogs and websites should not automatically
be considered to have as much authority as content that is officially part of the university's site. But you may
instead find that the author has a good academic reputation and is using their blog or website to share
resources he or she authored and even published elsewhere. That would nudge him or her toward the school's
neighborhood of the Intranet and toward credibility.

In this step, you are trying to figure out whether the author and/or publisher publishes serious information and
has a "good" reputation. Is there reason to believe that the author knows what he or she is talking about?
This involves considering what they have published before and where, where they work, and their academic
and other credentials.

Don't be automatically impressed with Ph.D. or M.D. degrees. A Ph.D., M.D., or other advanced degree is not
automatically a marker of someone you can trust about the information in your source.

Ask yourself whether their academic degree makes sense with the subject matter they are writing about.
Someone with a Ph.D. in chemistry, for instance, may not know anything about criminology and whether
sentencing guidelines should be changed for Americans convicted of a crime.

                                                                           3. Evaluating for Credibility | 112
College credentials are not the only thing that could matter. Maybe an author has substantial life experience
or training that seems sufficient to make them authorities on the subject of your research question. For that
reason, for example, a comparatively uneducated person who has lived for many years in a rural county may be
able to provide you with information about what that's like that is just as credible as what a university professor
of rural sociology can provide.

       ACTIVITY: Checking the Authors and/or Publishers
       Check out the author and/or publisher of these sources on the web and select things you notice
       about them that you think should be considered in your decision about the credibility of each. Some
       answer options are not true, so don't assume an answer option is true until you verify it.

Looking for what else the author has written can include searching a large library catalog (OSU Library Catalog,
OhioLINK, WorldCat@OSU).
If your source is an article, you might also look in Google Scholar. (While you can search for free, you may not
be able to retrieve articles unless searching through a library.) Specialized library databases that cover the same
topical area as information on a website can also be helpful (and free). For example, use the database ERIC (OSU
users only) to locate any articles published by the author on an education website. Scopus and Web of Science
are other good examples where you can look. OSU Libraries databases, arranged by subject or guides.osu.edu
can also direct your search for information about an author or publisher.
Record whether you consider the author and/or publisher trustworthy in your notes and why or why not.

       TIP:
       What should help you trust?

            · Determining that the source is a substantive popular source, a professional source, or a
                scholarly source.

            · Seeing that other sources you respect trust it.
            · Its author/publisher seems expert.
            · Its author/publisher seems uninterested in providing misinformation for profit or for religious

                or political reasons.

113 | 3. Evaluating for Credibility
Details about Step 5

Go back to your source and start reading or viewing it, engaging in the argument the author is trying to make.
Identify major statements of fact the author makes and then check a few of them out on Google, Bing, or any
of the search tools or databases and other links listed in Step 4. Keep track of what others have said about your
source's statements of fact so that you get an idea of how well their ideas are accepted by others.

Remember, though, that if your source is especially innovative, not everyone may agree with some of its
statements of fact and it could still be a credible source. You'll have to use your own critical thinking skills about
the topic and your research question as you consider your course's credibility here.

                                       For example, this New York Times story covers how long and hard two
                                       Australian medical researchers had to work to convince other doctors that a
                                       bacterium, rather than stress, causes most stomach ulcers--one even infected
                                       himself with the bacterium so as to cure the resulting ulcer with a drug. In the
                                       story, a former dean of the University of Chicago's Pritzker School of Medicine
                                       states that peer review "tends to adhere to things that are consistent with
                                       prevailing beliefs and models," and "really new ideas usually just get thought
                                       of as crazy."

Australia by Milinda Courey from Noun  That fits with the fact that the Australian researchers identified the bacterial
Project (CC BY 3.0)                    cause of ulcers in 1979, but it wasn't until 2005 that they received a Nobel Prize
                                       for the importance of that discovery and their persistence in convincing other
doctors.

A note about data:

You can use the same skills to evaluate text for credibility to evaluate data. Use the 5Ws and 1H
questions to ask yourself:

    · Who created or owns the data? A non-profit or government organization? A corporation? A
        lobbyist? Does the individual or organization who created or owns the data have an incentive
        to collect or present the data in a particular way to support its mission?

    · What variables were collected and how are these variables defined?
    · Where did the data originate? If survey data, are the survey demographics relevant for your

        project? If scientific data, is the material or population sampled relevant for your project?
    · When was the data first created or last updated?
    · Why is the data important to you? Will it support your argument? Help you make a decision?
    · How was the data created? What was the methodology used to collect the data? Was the

        methodology valid?

Data is influenced by the individuals who design and implement the processes used to collect it.
Consider the influence of bias when evaluating both raw and reported data.

1. Ethical Use and Citing Sources

                          It's helpful to understand why to cite your sources.

You likely know that research projects always need a reference or a works cited page (also called a bibliography).
But have you ever wondered why?
There are some big picture reasons that don't often get articulated that might help you get better at meeting
the citation needs of research projects. It's helpful to understand both the theory behind citing, as well as the
mechanics of it, to really become a pro.

  TIP: How to Cite Sources

  This section introduces the concept of citing sources, so you can begin your search for sources with it in
  mind. See the next section, How to Cite Sources for examples and the steps for citing appropriately.
In everyday life, we often have conversations where we share new insights with each other. Sometimes these
are insights we've developed on our own through the course of our own everyday experiences, thinking,
and reflection. Sometimes these insights come after talking to other people and learning from additional
perspectives. When we relate the new things we have learned to our family, friends, or co-workers, we may or
may not fill them in on how these thoughts came to us.

117 | 1. Ethical Use and Citing Sources
In everyday conversation and political speeches, evidence for arguments is often not provided. (Image source: XKDC)

Academic research leads us to the insight that comes from gaining perspectives and understandings from
other people through what we read, watch, and hear. In academic work we must tell our readers who and what
led us to our conclusions. Documenting our research is important because people rely on academic research to
be authoritative, so it is essential for academic conversation to be as clear as possible. Documentation for clarity
is a shared and respected practice, and it represents a core value of the academy called "academic integrity." It
is a way to distinguish academic conversations (or discourse) from everyday conversations (or discourse).
It is hard to talk about citation practices without considering some related concepts. Here are some definitions
of those concepts that are often mentioned in assignments when citation is required.

What Is Academic Integrity?

Different universities have different definitions. Ohio State University uses this definition:
       Academic integrity is a commitment, even in the face of adversity, to five fundamental values: honesty,
       trust, fairness, respect, and responsibility. From these values flow principles of behavior that enable
       academic communities to translate ideals into action.

Please take a few moments to read the Office of Undergraduate Education web page that describes these
values in more detail.
In other words, you must take full responsibility for your work, acknowledge your own efforts, and acknowledge
the contributions of others' efforts. Working/Writing with integrity requires accurately representing what you

                                                                                                                                   1. Ethical Use and Citing Sources | 118
contributed, as well as acknowledging how others have influenced your work. When you are a student, an
accurate representation of your knowledge is important because it will allow both you and your professors to
know the extent to which you have developed as a scholar. Part of that development is evidenced by how you
apply the rules for acknowledging the work of others.

What Is Academic Misconduct?

As you might imagine, academic misconduct is when you do not use integrity in your academic work.
Academic misconduct includes many different unacceptable behaviors, but the one most relevant to what we
are discussing here is submitting plagiarized work:

       Submitting plagiarized work for an academic requirement. Plagiarism is the representation of another's
       work or ideas as one's own; it includes the unacknowledged word-for-word use and/or paraphrasing of
       another person's work, and/or the inappropriate unacknowledged use of another person's ideas.
To see the full definition of academic misconduct, refer to the Ohio State University Code of Student Conduct.

  NOTE: Check Your Syllabi

  You might have noticed a reference to the Code of Student Conduct on several of your syllabi, as faculty are
  asked to include this statement for your benefit:

          It is the responsibility of the Committee on Academic Misconduct to investigate or establish
          procedures for the investigation of all reported cases of student academic misconduct. The term
          "academic misconduct" includes all forms of student academic misconduct wherever committed;
          illustrated by, but not limited to, cases of plagiarism and dishonest practices in connection with
          examinations. Instructors shall report all instances of alleged academic misconduct to the committee
          (Faculty Rule 3335-5-487). For additional information, see the Code of Student Conduct.

What Is Plagiarism?

Plagiarism is defined by the OSU First Year Experience Office in this way:
       At any stage of the writing process, all academic work submitted to the teacher must be a result of a
       student's own thought, research or self-expression. When a student submits work purporting to be his
       or her own, but which in any way borrows organization, ideas, wording or anything else from a source
       without appropriate acknowledgment of the fact, he/she is engaging in plagiarism.

Take time to look at the full definition, which also describes another form of academic misconduct called
"collusion."
Plagiarism can be intentional (knowingly using someone else's work and presenting it as your own) or
unintentional (inaccurately or inadequately citing ideas and words from a source). It may be impossible for your

119 | 1. Ethical Use and Citing Sources
professor to determine whether plagiarized work was intentional or unintentional. But in either case, plagiarism
puts both you and your professor in a compromising position.
While academic integrity calls for work resulting from your own effort, scholarship requires that you learn from
others. So in the world of academic scholarship you are actually expected to learn new things from others
AND come to new insights on your own. There is an implicit understanding that as a student you will be both
using others' knowledge as well as your own insights to create new scholarship. To do this in a way that meets
academic integrity standards you must acknowledge the part of your work that develops from others' efforts.
You do this by citing the work of others. You plagiarize when you fail to acknowledge the work of others and do
not follow appropriate citation guidelines.

What Is Citing?

Citing, or citation, is a practice of documenting specific influences on your academic work. See How to Cite
Sources for details.
In other words, you must cite all the sources you quote directly, paraphrase, or summarize as you:

  · Answer your research question
  · Convince your audience
  · Describe the situation around your research question and why the question is important
  · Report what others have said about your question

                                                                                                                                   1. Ethical Use and Citing Sources | 120
2. Why Cite Sources?

       Student Voices: Riley talks about when and why to cite | Transcript

As a student, citing is important because it shows your reader (or professor) that you have invested time in
learning what has already been learned and thought about the topic before offering your own perspective. It is
the practice of giving credit to the sources that inform your work.
Our definitions of academic integrity, academic misconduct and plagiarism, also give us important reasons for
citing the sources we use to accomplish academic research. Here are all the good reasons for citing.

To Avoid Plagiarism & Maintain Academic Integrity

Misrepresenting your academic achievements by not giving credit to others indicates a lack of academic
integrity. This is not only looked down upon by the scholarly community, but it is also punished. When you are
a student this could mean a failing grade or even expulsion from the university.

To Acknowledge the Work of Others

One major purpose of citations is to simply provide credit where it is due. When you provide accurate citations,
you are acknowledging both the hard work that has gone into producing research and the person(s) who
performed that research.
Think about the effort you put into your work (whether essays, reports, or even non-academic jobs): if someone
else took credit for your ideas or words, would that seem fair, or would you expect to have your efforts
recognized?

To Provide Credibility to Your Work & to Place Your Work in Context

Providing accurate citations puts your work and ideas into an academic context. They tell your reader that
you've done your research and know what others have said about your topic. Not only do citations provide
context for your work but they also lend credibility and authority to your claims.
For example, if you're researching and writing about sustainability and construction, you should cite experts
in sustainability, construction, and sustainable construction in order to demonstrate that you are well-versed
in the most common ideas in the fields. Although you can make a claim about sustainable construction after
doing research only in that particular field, your claim will carry more weight if you can demonstrate that your
claim can be supported by the research of experts in closely related fields as well.
Citing sources about sustainability and construction as well as sustainable construction demonstrates the
121 | 2. Why Cite Sources?
diversity of views and approaches to the topic. In addition, proper citation also demonstrates the ways in which
research is social: no one researches in a vacuum--we all rely on the work of others to help us during the
research process.

To Help Your Future Researching Self & Other Researchers Easily Locate Sources

Having accurate citations will help you as a researcher and writer keep track of the sources and information you
find so that you can easily find the source again. Accurate citations may take some effort to produce, but they
will save you time in the long run. So think of proper citation as a gift to your future researching self!

                                                                                                                                                    2. Why Cite Sources? | 122
3. Challenges in Citing Sources

Here are some challenges that might make knowing when and how to cite difficult for you. Our best advice for
how to overcome these challenges is in the first item.

Running Out of Time

When you are a student taking many classes simultaneously and facing many deadlines, it may be hard to
devote the time needed to doing good scholarship and accurately representing the sources you have used.
Research takes time. The sooner you can start and the more time you can devote to it, the better your work
will be. From the beginning, be sure to include in your notes where you found information you could quote,
paraphrase, and summarize in your final product.

Having to Use Different Styles

Different disciplines require that your citations be in different styles: which publication information is included
and in what order. So your citations for different courses could look different, particularly for courses outside
your major.

Shifting Cultural Expectations of Citation

Because of new technologies that make finding, using, and sharing information easier, many of our cultural
expectations around how to do that are changing as well. For example, blog posts often "reference" other
articles or works by simply linking to them. It makes it easy for the reader to see where the author's ideas have
come from and to view the source very quickly. But in these more informal writings, blog authors do not have
a list of citations (bibliographic entries). The links do the work for them. This is a great strategy for online digital
mediums, but this method fails over time when links break and there are no hints (like an author, title and date)
to know how else to find the reference, which might have moved.
This example of a cultural change of expectations in the non-academic world might make it seem that there
has been a change in academic scholarship as well, or might make people new to academic scholarship even
less familiar with citation. But in fact, the expectations around citing sources in academic research remain
formal.

1. Citation and Citation Styles

                          Sources that influenced your thinking and research must be cited in academic writing.

Citing sources is an academic convention for keeping track of which sources influenced your own thinking and
research. (See Ethical Use of Sources for many good reasons why you should cite others' work.)
Most citations require two parts:

  · The full bibliographic citation on the Bibliography page or References page, or Works Cited page of your
      final product.

  · An indication within your text (usually author and publication date and maybe the page number from
      which you are quoting) that tells your reader where you have used something that needs a citation.

With your in-text citation, your reader will be able to tell which full bibliographic citation you are referring to by
paying attention to the author's name and publication date.
Let's look at an example.

  EXAMPLE: Citations in Academic Writing

  Here's a citation in the text of an academic paper:
          Studies have shown that compared to passive learning, which occurs when students observe a

125 | 1. Citation and Citation Styles
          lecture, students will learn more and will retain that learning longer if more active methods of
          teaching and learning are used (Bonwell and Eison 1991; Fink 2003).
  The information in parentheses coordinates with a list of full citations at the end of the paper.
  At the end of the paper, these bibliographic entries appear in a reference list:

           Bonwell, C. G., and Eison, J. A.1991. "Active learning: Creating excitement in the classroom." ASHE-ERIC
           Higher Education Rep. No. 1, George Washington Univ., Washington, D.C.
           Fink, L. D. 2003. Creating significant learning experiences, Wiley, New York.
  You can see the full article [OSU login required] from which this example was taken online.

Citation Styles

Style guides set the specific rules for how to create both in-text citations and their full bibliographic citations.
There are over a dozen kinds of citation styles. While each style requires much of the same publication
information to be included in a citation, the styles differ from each other in formatting details such as
capitalization, punctuation, order of publication information, and whether the author's name is given in full or
abbreviated.

        EXAMPLE: Differences in Citation Styles

          Example: Differences in Citation Styles
          The image and text below show the same source's bibliographic citation in four common citation
          styles. Notice that all of the citations contain information about who the author is, the article title,
          the title of the journal in which it was published, the year the source was published, and
          information about the volume, issue, and pages in the journal. But, depending on the style, that
          publication information is arranged differently within the citation. Notice also the small

                                                                                                                                        1. Citation and Citation Styles | 126
          differences in punctuation, spacing, and order of information that make one citation style
          different from another.

            Differences between citation practices occur mainly in formatting.

127 | 1. Citation and Citation Styles
2. Steps for Citing

To write a proper citation we recommend following these steps, which will help you maintain accuracy and
clarity in acknowledging sources.

Step 1: Choose Your Citation Style

Find out the name of the citation style you must use from your instructor, the directions for an assignment,
or what you know your audience or publisher expects. Then search for your style at the Purdue Online Writing
Lab (OWL) or use Google or Bing to find your style's stylebook/handbook and then purchase it or ask for it at a
library.

Step 2: Create In-Text Citations

Find and read your style's rules about in-text citations, which are usually very thorough. Luckily, there are usually
examples provided that make it a lot easier to learn the rules.

  EXAMPLE: Style Guides Are Usually Very Thorough

  For instance, your style guide may have different rules for when you are citing:
    · Quotations rather than summaries rather than paraphrases
    · Long, as opposed to short, quotations.
    · Sources with one or multiple authors.
    · Books, journal articles, interviews and email, or electronic sources.

Step 3: Determine the Kind of Source

After creating your in-text citation, now begin creating the full bibliographic citation that will appear on the
References or Bibliography page by deciding what kind of source you have to cite (book, film, journal article,
webpage, etc.).

  EXAMPLE: Using a Style Guide to Create an In-Text Citation

  Imagine that you're using APA style and have the APA style guide rules for in-text citations open in OWL. In
  your psychogeography paper, you want to quote the authors of the book The Experience of Nature, Rachel
  Kaplan and Stephen Kaplan, which was published in 1989. What you want to quote is from page 38 of the
  book.
  Here's what you want to quote:

                                                                                                                                                         2. Steps for Citing | 128
          "The way space is organized provides information about what one might want to do in that space. A
          relatively brief glance at a scene communicates whether there is room to roam, whether one's path
          is clear or blocked."

    1. Skim the headings in the style guide to remind yourself of what its rules concern.
        Since it has rules about the length of quotations, you count the number of words in what you want to
        quote and find that your quote has 38, which is within the range for short quotations (less than 40),
        according to the APA style guide.According to the rule for short quotations, you see that you're
        supposed to introduce the quote by attributing the quote to the author (last name only) and adding
        the publication date in parentheses. You write:
                According to the Kaplans (1989), "The way space is organized provides information about what
                one might want to do in that space. A relatively brief glance at a scene communicates whether
                there is room to roam, whether one's path is clear or blocked."

   2. Then you notice that the example in the style guide includes the page number on which you found the
        quotation. It appears at the end of the quote (in parentheses and outside the quote marks but before
        the period ending the quotation). So you add that:
                According to the Kaplans (1989), "The way space is organized provides information about what
                one might want to do in that space. A relatively brief glance at a scene communicates whether
                there is room to roam, whether one's path is clear or blocked" (p.38).

   3. You're feeling pretty good, but then you realize that you have overlooked the rule about having
        multiple authors. You have two and their last names are both Kaplan. So you change your sentence to:
                According to Kaplan and Kaplan (1989), "The way space is organized provides information about
                what one might want to do in that space. A relatively brief glance at a scene communicates
                whether there is room to roam, whether one's path is clear or blocked" (p.38).
        So you have your first in-text citation for your final product:
                According to Kaplan and Kaplan (1989), "The way space is organized provides information about
                what one might want to do in that space. A relatively brief glance at a scene communicates
                whether there is room to roam, whether one's path is clear or blocked" (p.38).

Step 4: Study Your Style's Rules for Bibliographic Citations

Next, you'll need a full bibliographic citation for the same source. This citation will appear on the References
page or Bibliography page or Works Cited page. (APA style, which we're using here, requires a page called
References.) Bibliographic citations usually contain more publication facts than you used for your in-text
citation, and the formatting for all of them is very specific.

129 | 2. Steps for Citing
  EXAMPLE: Bibliographic Citation Rules Are Very Specific

    · Rules vary for sources, depending, for instance, on whether they are books, journal articles, or online
        sources.

    · Sometimes lines of the citation must be indented.
    · Authors' names usually appear last name first.
    · Authors' first names may be initials instead.
    · Names of sources may or may not have to be in full.
    · Names of some kinds of sources may have to be italicized.
    · Names of some sources may have to be in quotes.
    · Dates of publication appear in different places, depending on the style.
    · Some styles require Digital Object Identifiers (DOIs ) in the citations for online sources.

Step 5: Identify Citation Elements

Figure out which bibliographic citation rules apply to the source you've just created an in-text citation for. Then
apply them to create your first bibliographic citation.

  EXAMPLE: Using a Style Guide to Create a Bibliographic Citation

  Imagine that you're using APA style and have the APA style guide rules for bibliographic citations open
  in OWL. Your citation will be for the book called The Experience of Nature, written by Rachel Kaplan and
  Stephen Kaplan and published in 1989.

    1. You start by trying to apply OWL's basic rules of APA style, which tell you your citation will start with the
        last name of your author followed by his or her first initial, and that the second line of the citation will
        be indented. So you write:Kaplan, R. and Kaplan, S. and remind yourself to indent the second line when
        you get there.

   2. Since you have two authors, you look for a rule regarding that situation, which requires a comma
        between the authors and an ampersand between the names. So you write:Kaplan, R., & Kaplan, S.

   3. Because you know your source is a book, you look for style guide rules and examples about books. For
        instance, the rules for APA style say that the publication date goes in parentheses, followed by a period
        after the last author's name. And that the title of the book is italicized. You apply the rules and
        examples and write the publication information you know about your source:Kaplan, R., & Kaplan, S.
        (1989). The Experience of Nature.

   4. Next, you look at the rules and examples of book citations and notice that they show the city where the
        book was published and the publisher. So you find that information about your source (in a book,
        usually on the title page or its back) and write:Kaplan, R., & Kaplan, S. (1989). The Experience of Nature.
        Cambridge:
        Cambridge University Press.

   5. Congratulations, especially about remembering to indent that line! You have created the first
        bibliographic citation for your final product.

                                                                                                                                                         2. Steps for Citing | 130
Step 6: Repeat the steps for creating an in-text citation and a bibliographic citation for
each of your sources.

Create your bibliographic citation by arranging publication information to match the example you chose in Step
4. Pay particular attention to what is and is not capitalized and to what punctuation and spaces separate each
part that the example illustrates.

  If you like, you can use citation generator software to arrange the information needed for your citation
  according to the style guide you chose. Learn more later in this section.

131 | 2. Steps for Citing
3. Citation Software

You may be familiar with the many citation generators that allow you to auto-generate reference lists from
citation data. Some allow you to save and store citations to reuse them in different lists and in different work, as
needed.
Such tools are worth investigating and learning about for any long-term research project. Zotero is online and
available for free to anyone from anywhere. RefWorks and EndNote are available to all OSU students, faculty,
and staff from anywhere because OSU Libraries subscribes to this service. For information about using any of
these tools, go to software available to OSU students.

Common Citations Tools

Good reasons to use citation generation software include:
  · To save time: it takes citation generation software only a few seconds to create a citation.
  · To easily convert citations from one style to another.
  · To have a centralized source list that is not attached to a specific project, which allows you to reuse
      references and their citations in various projects.

Care you must use with citation generation software includes:
  · Citation generation software is only as good as the information entered into it. In other words, if you
      provide incorrect information or do not include some information, then your citation will be incorrect.
  · Most citation generation software can create citations by searching for the information online. Sometimes
      software can pull the information from the wrong edition of a source, for example, or specific formatting
      (such as italics) might be lost. Or perhaps the generator didn't use the latest version of the style guide.
  · Always review the citations you create with this software.

                                                                                                                                                      3. Citation Software | 132
4. When to Cite

Citing sources is often described as a straightforward, rule-based practice. But in fact, there are many gray areas
around citation, and learning how to apply citation guidelines takes practice and education. If you are confused
by it, you are not alone - in fact you might be doing some good thinking. Here are some guidelines to help you
navigate citation practices.

Cite when you are directly quoting. This is the easiest rule to understand. If you are stating word-for-word what
someone else has already written, you must put quotes around those words and you must give credit to the
original author. Not doing so would mean that you are letting your reader believe these words are your own and
represent your own effort.

Cite when you are summarizing and paraphrasing. This is a trickier area to understand. First of all,
summarizing and paraphrasing are two related practices but they are not the same. Summarizing is when
you read a text, consider the main points, and provide a shorter version of what you learned. Paraphrasing is
when you restate what the original author said in your own words and in your own tone. Both summarizing
and paraphrasing require good writing skills and an accurate understanding of the material you are trying to
convey. Summarizing and paraphrasing are difficult to do when you are a beginning academic researcher, but
these skills become easier to perform over time with practice.

Cite when you are citing something that is highly debatable. For example, if you want to claim that the Patriot
Act has been an important tool for national security, you should be prepared to give examples of how it has
helped and how experts have claimed that it has helped. Many U.S. citizens concerned that it violates privacy
rights won't agree with you, and they will be able to find commentary that the Patriot Act has been more
harmful to the nation than helpful. You need to be prepared to show such skeptics that you have experts on
your side, too.

  TIP: Why Cite Sources?

  This section covers how and when to cite sources. For a discussion of why to cite sources, see Ethical Use of
  Sources.

When Don't You Cite?

Don't cite when what you are saying is your own insight. As you learned in The Purpose of Academic
Argument, research involves forming opinions and insights around what you learn. You may be citing several
sources that have helped you learn, but at some point you must integrate your own opinion, conclusion, or
insight into the work. The fact that you are not citing it helps the reader understand that this portion of the
work is your unique contribution developed through your own research efforts.

Don't cite when you are stating common knowledge. What is common knowledge is sometimes difficult to
discern. In general, quick facts like historical dates or events are not cited because they are common knowledge.

Examples of information that would not need to be cited include:

  · The Declaration of Independence was signed in 1776.
  · Barack Obama became the 44th president of the United States in January, 2009.

Some quick facts, such as statistics, are trickier. For example, the number of gun-related deaths per year

133 | 4. When to Cite
probably should be cited, because there are a lot of ways this number could be determined (does the number
include murder only, or suicides and accidents, as well?) and there might be different numbers provided by
different organizations, each with an agenda about gun laws.

A guideline that can help with deciding whether or not to cite facts is to determine whether the same data is
repeated in multiple sources. If it is not, it is best to cite.

The other thing that makes this determination difficult might be that what seems new and insightful to you
might be common knowledge to an expert in the field. You have to use your best judgment, and probably err on
the side of over-citing, as you are learning to do academic research. You can seek the advice of your instructor,
a writing tutor, or a librarian. Knowing what is and is not common knowledge is a practiced skill that gets easier
with time and with your own increased knowledge.

TIP: Why You Can't Cite Wikipedia

You've likely been told at some point that you can't cite           Wikipedia, while good for early research and background
Wikipedia, or any encyclopedia for that matter, in your scholarly   information, shouldn't be cited as a source because it's
work.                                                               already a summary.

The reason is that such entries are meant to prepare you to do
research, not be evidence of your having done it. Wikipedia
entries, which are tertiary sources, are already a summary of what
is known about the topic. Someone else has already done the
labor of synthesizing lots of information into a concise and quick
way of learning about the topic.

So while Wikipedia is a great shortcut for getting context,
background, and a quick lesson on topics that might not be
familiar to you, don't quote, paraphrase, or summarize from it.
Just use it to educate yourself.

1. The Purpose of Academic Argument

                          Scholarly conversation makes an argument for a given point of view.

Nearly all scholarly writing makes an argument. That's because its purpose is to create and share new
knowledge so it can be debated in order to confirm, dis-confirm, or improve it. That arguing takes place
mostly in journals and scholarly books and at conferences. It's called the scholarly conversation, and it's that
conversation that moves forward what we humans know.

2. Components of an Argument

Making an argument in an essay, research paper, blog post or other college writing task is like laying out a case
in court. Just as there are conventions that attorneys must adhere to as they make their arguments in court,
there are conventions in arguments made in research assignments. Among those conventions is to use the
components of an argument.

  NOTE:

  This section on making an argument was developed with the help of "Making Good Arguments" in The Craft
  of Research, by Wayne Booth, Gregory Colomb, and Joseph Williams, University of Chicago Press, 2003.
The arguments you're used to hearing or participating in with friends about something that is uncertain or
that needs to be decided contain the same components as the ones you'll need to use in academic writing.
Arguments contain those components because those are the ones that work--used together, they stand the
best chance of persuading others that you are correct.
For instance, the question gets things started off. The claim, or thesis, tells people what you consider a true way
of describing a thing, situation, relationship, or phenomenon or what action you think should be taken. The
reservations, alternatives, and objections that someone else brings up in your sources (or that you imagine your
readers logically might have) allow you to demonstrate how your reasons and evidence (maybe) overcome that
kind of thinking--and (you hope) your claim/thesis comes out stronger for having withstood that test.

  ACTIVITY: Labeled Components

  Read the short dialog on pages 114 and 115 in the ebook The Craft of Research by Wayne Booth, Gregory
  Colomb, and Joseph Williams. The components of an argument are labeled for you.

  EXAMPLE: Argument as a Dialog

  Here's a dialog of an argument, with the most important components labeled.
                     Jerald: Where should we have my parents take us for dinner when
                         they're here on Sunday? [He asks the question about something
                                                                                         that's unsettled.]

                                                                           Cathy: We should go to The Cascades! [She makes her main claim
                                                                           to answer the question.] It's the nicest place around. [Another
                                                                           claim, which functions as a reason for the main claim.]

                             Jerald: How so? [He asks for a reason to believe her claims.]

137 | 2. Components of an Argument
                                                      Cathy: White table cloths. [She gives a reason.]

       Jerald: What's that have to do with how good the food is? [He
                    doesn't see how her reason is relevant to the claim.]

                                                      Cathy: Table cloths make restaurants seem upscale. [She relates
                                                      her reason for the claims.] And I've read a survey in Columbus
                                                      Metro that says the Cascades is one of the most popular
                                                      restaurants in town. [She offers evidence.]

     Jerald: I never read the Metro. And Dino's has table cloths. [He
                                  offers a point that contradicts her reason.]

                                                      Cathy: I know, but those are checkered! I'm talking about heavy
                                                      white ones. [She acknowledges his point and responds to it.]

Jerald: My dad loves Italian food. I guess he's kind of a checkered-
table-cloth kind of guy? [He raises another reservation or objection.]

                                                      Cathy: Yeah, but? Well, I know The Cascades has some Italian
                                                      things on the menu. I mean, it's not known for its Italian food but
                                                      you can order it there. Given how nice the place is, it will probably
                                                      be gourmet Italian food. [She acknowledges his point and responds
                                                      to it. There's another claim in there.]

      Jerald: Ha! My dad, the gourmet? Hey, maybe this place is too
                                 expensive. [He raises another reservation.]

                                                      Cathy: More than someplace like Dino's. [She concedes his point.]

                                                      Jerald: Yeah. [He agrees.]

                                                      Cathy: But everybody eats at The Cascades with their parents
                                                      while they're students here, so it can't be outlandishly expensive.
                                                      [She now puts limits on how much she's conceding.]

                                                                                                               2. Components of an Argument | 138

3. Order of the Components

The order in which the components should appear in your argument essays, papers, and posters may depend
on which discipline your course is in. So always adhere to the advice provided by your professor and what you
learn in class.
One common arrangement for argument essays and research papers is to begin with an introduction that
explains why the situation is important--why the reader should care about it. Your research question will
probably not appear, but your answer to it (your thesis, or claim) usually appears as the last sentence or two of
the introduction.
The body of your essay or paper follows and consists of:

  · Your reasons the thesis is correct or at least reasonable.
  · The evidence that supports each reason, often occurring right after the reason the evidence supports.
  · An acknowledgement that some people have/could have objections, reservations, counterarguments, or

      alternative solutions to your argument and a statement of each. (Posters often don't have room for this
      component.)
  · A response to each acknowledgement that explains why that criticism is incorrect or not very important.
      Sometimes you might have to concede a point you think is unimportant, if you can't really refute it.
(Again, posters often don't have much room for this part of an argument.)
After the body, the paper or essay ends with a conclusion, which states your thesis in a slightly different way
than occurred in the introduction. The conclusion also may mention why research on this situation is important.
(Posters often don't have much room for this component.)

A Blueprint for Argument

It's no accident that people are said to make arguments--they're all constructed, and these components
are the building blocks. The components are important because of what they contribute. The components
generally, though not always, appear in a certain order because they build on or respond to one another.
For example, the thesis or claim is derived from the initial question. The reasons are bolstered by evidence to
support the claim. Objections are raised, acknowledged and subsequently responded to.

                                                                                                                                         3. Order of the Components | 140

4. Where You Get the Components

This section will help you figure that out which components may come from your professor, which you just
have to think about, which you have to write, and which you have to find in your sources.
Here, again, are the components we'll cover:

  · The research question you (or your professor) wanted answered.
  · Your claim or thesis.
  · One or more reasons for your thesis.
  · Evidence for each reason.
  · Others' objections, counterarguments, or alternative solutions.
  · Your acknowledgment of others' objections, counterarguments, or alternative solutions.
  · Your response to others' objections, counterarguments, or alternative solutions.

The Question You Wanted Answered

Sometimes your professor will give you the research question, but probably more often he or she will expect you
to develop your own from an assigned topic. You learned how to develop research questions in another section.
Though vitally important, they are often not stated in essays or research papers but are usually stated in reports
of original studies, such as theses, dissertations, and journal articles.

  EXAMPLES: Research Questions for Hypothetical Essays or Term Papers

    · How do at least some animals' bones help control their weight?
    · Did the death of his beloved daughter have any effect on the writings of Mark Twain?

Your Claim or Thesis

You write the claim or thesis-it doesn't come directly from a source. Instead, it is the conclusion you come to in
answer to your question after you've read/listened to/viewed some sources. So it is a statement, not a question
or a hypothesis that you plan to prove or disprove with your research.
After you've read/listened to/viewed more sources, you may need to change your thesis. That happens all the
time-not because you did anything wrong but because you learned more.

  EXAMPLES: Claims (or Theses) for Hypothetical Essays or Term Papers

    · Bone cells monitor whether more or less weight is pressing down on the skeleton and send
        biochemical signals to appetite centers in their brains to turn appetite down or up, accordingly.

    · Mark Twain wrote more urgently and with less humor during the four years immediately after the
        death of his daughter.

                                                                                                                               4. Where You Get the Components | 142
One or More Reasons

You write what you believe makes your claim or thesis (the answer to your research question) true. That's your
reason or reasons. Each reason is a summary statement of evidence you found in your research. The kinds of
evidence considered convincing varies by discipline, so you will be looking at different sources, depending on
your discipline. How many reasons you need depends on how complex your thesis and subject matter are, what
you found in your sources, and how long your essay or research paper must be. It's always a good idea to write
your reasons in a way that is easy for your audience to understand and be persuaded by.

  EXAMPLES: Reasons in Hypothetical Essays or Term Papers

    · Animals (including humans) have a biological tendency to regain any weight that they lose and lose
        any weight that they gain, seemingly in an effort to maintain whatever weight they have sustained for
        some time. Skeletons are logical places where any gains or losses could be noted, and recent studies
        seem to show that osteocytes (a kind of bone cell) are involved in whether appetites go up or down
        after weight gain or loss.

    · My content analysis and a comparison of publication rates four years before and after Mark Twain's
        daughter died indicate that his writing was more urgent and less humorous for four years after. It is
        reasonable to conclude that her death caused that change.

Evidence for Each Reason

You write this also. This is the evidence you summarized earlier as each reason your thesis is true. You will
be directly quoting, paraphrasing, and summarizing your sources to make the case that your answer to your
research question is correct, or at least reasonable.

  EXAMPLES: Evidence for Reasons in Hypothetical Essays or Term Papers

    · Report the results of studies about osteocyctes' possible effect on weight grain or loss.
    · Report the results of your comparison of writing content and publication rate before and after Twain's

        daughter's death.

Others' Objections, Counterarguments, or Alternative Solutions

Do any of your sources not agree with your thesis? You'll have to bring those up in your research paper. In
addition, put yourself in your readers' shoes. What might they not find logical in your argument? In other words,
which reason(s) and corresponding evidence might they find lacking? Did you find clues to what these could be

143 | 4. Where You Get the Components
in your sources? Or maybe you can imagine them thinking some aspect of what you think is evidence doesn't
make sense.

  EXAMPLES: Objections, Counterarguments, or Alternative Solutions in Hypothetical
  Essays or Term Papers

    · Imagine that some readers might think: The hormone leptin is released by fat cells when they are
        added to animals' bodies so it is leptin that tells appetite centers to turn down when weight is gained.

    · Imagine that some readers might think: Computerized content analysis tools are sort of blunt
        instruments and shouldn't be used to do precise work like this.

Your Acknowledgement of Others' Objections, Counterarguments, or Alternative
Solutions

So what will you write to bring up each of those objections, counterarguments, and alternative solutions? Some
examples:

  · I can imagine skeptics wanting to point out...
  · Perhaps some readers would say...
  · I think those who come from XYZ would differ with me...
It all depends on what objections, counterarguments, and alternative solutions your audience or your
imagination come up with.

  EXAMPLES: Acknowledgement of Others' Objections, Counterarguments, or
  Alternative Solutions in Hypothetical Essays or Term Papers:

    · Some readers may point out that the hormone leptin, which is released by fat cells, signals appetite
        centers to lower the appetite when weight is gained.

    · Readers may think that a computerized content analysis tool cannot do justice to the subtleties of text.

Response to Others' Objections, Counterarguments, or Alternative Solutions

You must write your response to each objection, counterargument, or alternative solution brought up or that
you've thought of. (You're likely to have found clues for what to say in your sources.) The reason you have to
include this is that you can't very easily convince your audience until you show them how your claim stacks up
against the opinions and reasoning of other people who don't at the moment agree with you.

                                                                                                                              4. Where You Get the Components | 144
  EXAMPLES: Response to Others' Objections, Counterarguments, or Alternative
  Solutions in Hypothetical Essays or Term Papers:

    · But leptin must not be the entire system, since many animals do keep on the new weight.
    · Unlike other content tools, the XYZ Content Analysis Measure is able to take into account an author's

        tone.

1. Writing Tips

                          This section features advice for using sources well in your writing projects.

If your final product is a research paper or essay, much of your writing will be devoted to:
  · Reporting what others have said about your research question.
  · Answering your research question.
  · Convincing your audience that your answer is correct or, at least, the most reasonable answer (giving them
      evidence).
  · Describing the situation surrounding your research question for your audience and explaining why it's
      important.

To do that writing, you will often use direct quotes from your sources and will paraphrase and summarize
sources. But how should you choose which technique to use and when?

When to Quote, Paraphrase, or Summarize

Choose a direct quote when:
  · It is more likely to be accurate than summarizing or paraphrasing would be.
  · When what you're quoting is the text you're analyzing.
  · When a direct quote is more concise than a summary or paraphrase would be
      and conciseness matters.
  · When the author is a particular authority whose exact words would lend
      credence to your argument.

149 | 1. Writing Tips
When the author has used particularly effective language that is just too good to pass up.
                                             Choose to paraphrase or summarize rather than to quote directly when the
                                             meaning is more important than the particular language the author used and
                                             you don't need to use the author's preeminent authority to bolster your
                                             argument at the moment.
                                             Choose to summarize instead of paraphrasing when you need to provide a brief
                                             overview of a larger text. Summaries let you condense the resource material to
                                             draw out particular points, omit unrelated or unimportant points, and simplify

how the author conveyed thier message.
       Tip: Citing Sources
       Remember to cite your sources when quoting, paraphrasing, and summarizing. See How to Cite
       Sources for details.

2. Helping Others Follow

As you switch from component to component in your paper, you'll be making what are called rhetorical
moves--taking subsequent steps to move your argument along and be persuasive. Your readers will probably
know what you're doing because the components in everyday oral arguments are the same as in written
arguments. But why you're switching between components of your argument, and with these particular
sources, might be less clear.

          Note:
          The ideas and examples in this section are informed by all five editions of They Say/I Say, by
          Gerald Graff and Cathy Birkenstein, and published by W.W. Norton and Company. The third
          edition of the They Say/I Say provides templates of actual language to be used in written
          arguments. This can be extremely helpful to beginning writers because it takes some of the
          mystery out of what to say and when to say it. For these templates, check the book out from your
          library. (OSU only)

You can help readers follow your argument by inserting phrases that signal why you're doing what you're doing.
Here are some examples:

         To state that what you're saying in your thesis (answer to your research question) is in opposition to
            what others have said:
            "Many people have believed ..., but I have a different opinion."

         To move from a reason to a summary of a research study that supports it (evidence):
            "Now let's take a look at the supporting research.

         To introduce a summary of a resource you've just mentioned:
            "The point they make is..."

         If the objection is that you're not being realistic:
            "But am I being realistic?"

         To acknowledge an objection you believe a reader could have:
            "At this point, I should turn to an objection some are likely to be raising..."

         To move from the body of an essay to the conclusion:
            "So in conclusion..."

Phrases like these can help facilitate your argument in your readers' minds, making it a lot easier for them to
quickly understand it instead of getting stuck on figuring out why you're bringing something up at a particular
point. You will have pulled them into an argument conversation.

       Examples: The Language of Arguments
       The blog that accompanies the book They Say/I Say with Readings, by Gerald Graff, Cathy
       Birkenstein, and Russel Durst, contains short, well-constructed contemporary arguments from a

3. Synthesis of Your Own Ideas

Professors usually want to see evidence of your own thinking in your essays and papers. Even so, it will be your
thoughts in reaction to each of your sources:

  · What was the author really trying to say?
  · What parts of the source do you agree with?
  · What parts of the source do you disagree with?
  · Did they leave anything out?
  · What does an author's work lead you to say?
It's wise to not only analyze--take apart for study--the sources, but also to try to combine your own ideas with
ideas you found in class and in the sources.
Professors frequently expect you to interpret, make inferences, and otherwise synthesize--bring ideas together
to make something new or find a new way of looking at something old. It might help to think of synthesis as
the opposite of analysis.

          Activity: Creative Thinking
          Synthesis is a creative act. Are there places, things, activities, or situations that you already use to
          spark your creativity? Sometimes even simple things can help us be more creative. Take a look at
          the NPR article 5 Ways to Spark Your Creativity for some tips.
          The book Thinker Toys, 2nd edition, by Michael Michalko, may help you expand your ability to
          think creatively.

Getting Better at Synthesis

To get an A on essays and papers in many courses, such as literature and history, what you write in reaction to
others' work should use synthesis to create new meaning or show a deeper understanding of what you learned.
|
To do so, it helps to look for connections and patterns. One way to synthesize when writing an argument essay,
paper, or other project is to look for themes among your sources. So try categorizing ideas by topic rather than
by source--making associations across sources.
Synthesis can seem difficult, particularly if you are used to analyzing others' points but not used to making your
own. Like most things, however, it gets easier as you get more experienced at it. So don't be hard on yourself if
it seems difficult at first.

153 | 3. Synthesis of Your Own Ideas
EXAMPLE: Synthesis in an Argument

Here's an example of synthesis: Imagine that you have to write an argument essay
about Woody Allen's 2011 movie Midnight in Paris. Your topic is "nostalgia," and the
movie is the only source you can use. In the movie, a successful young screenwriter
named Gil is visiting Paris with his girlfriend and her parents, who are more politically
conservative than he is.
: Inexplicably, every midnight he time-travels back to 1920's Paris, a time period he's
always found fascinating, especially because of the writers and
painters--Hemingway, Fitzgerald, Picasso--that he's now on a first-name basis with.
Gil is enchanted and always wants to stay. But every morning, he's back in real-
time--feeling out of sync with his girlfriend and her parents.
You've tried to come up with a narrower topic, but so far nothing seems right.
Suddenly, you start paying more attention to the girlfriend's parents' dialogue about
politics, which amount to such phrases as "we have to go back to...," "it was a better time," "Americans used
to be able to..." and "the way it used to be."
And then it clicks with you that the girlfriend's parents are like Gil--longing for a different time, whether real
or imagined. That kind of idea generation is synthesis.
You decide to write your essay to answer the research question: How is the motivation of Gil's girlfriend's
parents similar to Gil's? Your thesis becomes "Despite seeming to be not very much alike, Gil and the parents
are similarly motivated, and Woody Allen meant Midnight in Paris`s message about nostalgia to be applied
to all of them."
Of course, you'll have to try to convince your readers that your thesis is valid and you may or not be
successful--but that's true with all theses. And your professor will be glad to see the synthesis.
There is a lot more you can learn about creating synthesis in scholarly writing. One place synthesis is usually
required is in literature reviews for honors' theses, master's theses, and Ph.D. dissertations. In all those cases,
literature reviews are intended to contribute more than annotated bibliographies do and to be arguments
for the research conducted for the theses or dissertations. You will find more help with Susan Imel's Writing
a Literature Review in The Handbook of Scholarly Writing and Publishing (OSU only), edited by Tonette S.
Rocco and Tim Hatcher, 2011.

       Activity: Balancing Sources and Synthesis
       Here's a technique to quickly assess whether there is enough of your original thought in your
       essay or paper, as opposed to information from your sources: Highlight what you have included
       as quotes, paraphrases, and summaries from your sources. Next, highlight in another color what

                                                                                                                                   3. Synthesis of Your Own Ideas | 154
          you have written yourself. Then take a look at the pages and decide whether there is enough you
          in them.
          For the mocked-up pages below, assume that the yellow-highlighted lines were written by the
          writer and the pink-highlighted lines are quotes, paraphrases, and summaries she pulled from
          her sources. Which page most demonstrates the writer's own ideas? See the answer below.

1. What Is Copyright?

                          Copyright gives creators an incentive to produce and share new works by granting them exclusive rights to their work
                          for a limited time.

Copyright is the law. While digital technology has made some aspects of copyright more complex, knowing the
basics can help you to use material legally and to protect your own creative works.
You create copyrighted works regularly. When you write an original email or paper, record a song or video,
or take a photograph you have created a work that is protected by copyright. It is important to know how to
manage your rights as a creator.
Every day you work with copyrighted materials created by other people. Whenever you read a book, download a
song, stream a video or play a video game, you are potentially dealing with copyrighted materials. It is important
to understand what is and is not covered by copyright law and the ways you may use these works under the
law.

      Student Voices: Riley notes copyright helps motivate creators | Transcript

157 | 1. What Is Copyright?
Copyright Law

U.S. Copyright Law has its origin in the U.S. Constitution:
       The Congress shall have the power ... to promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts, by securing for
       limited Times to Authors and Inventors the exclusive Right to their respective Writings and Discoveries.
       - U.S. Constitution Article 1, Section 8

The U.S. Congress has the power to create laws that govern copyright. (Image Source: National Archives and Records Administration, Public Domain.)

The purpose of copyright is to encourage the creation and sharing of creative works. Copyright gives creators
an economic incentive to produce and share new works by granting them exclusive rights to their work for a
limited time. This provides an opportunity for a creator to benefit from his or her work.
Congress determines the limits of this monopoly, including the length of time that copyright lasts. These limits
can (and have) changed over time.

                                                                                                                                                    1. What Is Copyright? | 158
2. What Copyright Covers

The kinds of works covered by copyright are listed in Section 102 of the Copyright Act. In order for a work to be
covered by copyright, it must be an original work of authorship fixed in any tangible medium of expression. (See
the detailed explanations below.)

Copyright covers original work that is fixed in a tangible medium of expression.

There are several types of works that can be protected, including:
  · Literary works
  · Musical works, including any accompanying words
  · Dramatic works, including any accompanying music
  · Pantomimes and choreography
  · Pictorial, graphic, and sculptural works
  · Motion pictures and other audiovisual works
  · Sound recordings
  · Architectural works

These categories are broad and can include print and digital works, such as email, computer software, web
pages, and video games.

159 | 2. What Copyright Covers
        DEFINITION: Original Work of Authorship

          In copyright law, originality means that a work is independently created and possesses at least a
          minimum amount of creativity. For example, an alphabetized list of names and phone numbers
          would not receive copyright protection because it required no creativity to produce. Under the
          law, it does not matter how much time or effort you put into creating a work; if the work does not
          meet the minimum amount of creativity, it will not receive copyright protection.

        DEFINITION: Tangible Medium of Expression

          For a work to be "fixed in a tangible medium," it must exist in some perceptible format for more
          than a transitory duration. For example, a work that is fixed in a tangible medium could be
          written on paper, saved to a computer hard drive, or recorded on film. An improvised jazz
          performance that is not recorded would not have copyright protection, because the creative
          expression of the musician has not been saved in any tangible format.

What ISN'T Covered by Copyright?

Not all works are covered by copyright. Those not covered include:
Works already in the public domain (discussed in detail later in this book)

  · Moby Dick
  · Shakespeare's plays
  · Beethoven's works
Works not fixed in a tangible medium
  · A song in your head, but not recorded or written down

Copyright in Cases of a Work Made for Hire

If you create something as part of your job duties, it is likely a work made for hire. In these cases, the employer
is considered the author and rights holder of a work made for hire rather than the employee.
Read the United States Copyright Office's Works Made for Hire circular for a more nuanced discussion.

        ACTIVITY: Copyrightable?

161 | 2. What Copyright Covers
3. Rights Granted by Copyright

So, now that you know what kinds of works are covered by copyright, what exactly are the rights granted to a
copyright holder?
Six exclusive rights are granted to the author of a copyrighted work. We call these the author's bundle of rights.
This means the copyright holder is the only person who has the right to do these things and has the authority
to grant permission for others to do these things, with some important exceptions that we will discuss later in
this chapter.
If you are not the copyright holder and want to do any of the examples, you may need to get permission to do
so from the holder of the copyright.

  AUTHOR'S BUNDLE OF RIGHTS

  To Reproduce
    · Example: Making physical and digital copies.

  To Prepare Derivative Works
    · Example: Creating foreign language translations, movie adaptation of a book, etc.

  To Distribute
    · Example: Selling, renting, lending, or leasing a work online or in physical copies.

  To Perform Publicly
    · Example: Performing a play, showing a movie, or reading aloud from a book to an audience outside of
        your normal circle of family or friends.
    · Example: Playing recorded music in clubs, restaurants, stores, on the radio, etc.

  To Display Publicly
    · Example: Displaying in a gallery, putting posters on a noticeboard, etc.

  To Perform Publicly a sound recording by means of a digital audio transmission
    · Example: Streaming music online.

                                                                                                                                     3. Rights Granted by Copyright | 162
        ACTIVITY: Author Rights

When Does Copyright Apply?

Under current U.S. law, copyright applies as soon as an original work is fixed in a tangible medium of expression.
This means that when you save a file, take a photograph, record a song, or paint a picture your work has
copyright protection.
As the creator, provided that the work is not a work made for hire, you are the owner of the copyright on your
work. You do not have to register the work with the U.S. Copyright Office, publish it, or put a copyright notice on
it.
If you wish to give away, sell or license any or all of the copyright on your work, you have the right to do so.
If you give away or sell your exclusive copyright to someone else, you no longer have the rights mentioned above
and need to treat the work the same as any other copyrighted work created by someone else.
See Public Domain and Term of Copyright later in this section for details about the duration of copyright.

163 | 3. Rights Granted by Copyright
4. Respecting Copyright

While working with other people's copyrighted works, remember that their works are under copyright
protection from the moment of creation.
Additionally, U.S. Copyright Law applies to works found on the Internet. Many of the works you find online are
protected by copyright, even if there is no copyright notice. Your ability to access copyrighted materials on the
Internet, including public social media accounts, does not necessarily mean that you have the right to use, reuse
and distribute the works in any manner you wish. It is important to respect copyright, whether the works are in
a physical or digital format.

Risks of Infringing Copyright

If you violate one or more of the exclusive rights of a copyright owner, the copyright owner can bring a claim
against you for copyright infringement. There are a few different penalties that are possible if you are accused
of copyright infringement:

  · Under specific circumstances, U.S. copyright law allows criminal prosecution in cases of willful
      inf ringement.

  · If the infringing work is online, such as a video posted to YouTube, the copyright owner can request the
      material be taken down. This may be done through a Cease-and-Desist Letter or DMCA Takedown Notice.
      The material will be taken down and you will be notified of the accusation of infringement. If you believe
      that your use of the material is legal, you can respond with your explanation of why. Some Internet Service
      Providers will cut off your access if you receive too many takedown notices.

  · The copyright owner can sue you. They could ask for an injunction to stop your use of their work. They can
      also ask for either actual damages or statutory damages. Actual damages are the actual amount of money
      the copyright owner lost due to your activity plus any profit you made from using the work. These can be
      hard to determine, so the law alternatively allows for statutory damages under certain conditions. These
      are a set range, from $750 to $30,000 per infringed work, that the judge or jury awards to the rights holder
      if you are found guilty. These damages can increase to $150,000 per infringed work if your use is
      determined to be a "willful" infringement and can go no lower than $200 per infringed work for cases of
      "innocent" infringement.

  · Some rights holders may offer the option of settling out of court. This agreed settlement may be cheaper
      than the cost of a trial for the rights holder and you.

The accusation of infringement is not the same as a conviction. You always have the right to defend your use.

                                                                                                                                               4. Respecting Copyright | 164
5. Exceptions to Copyright

U.S. Copyright Law includes exceptions that limit the rights of the copyright holder. These exceptions allow for
certain uses of copyrighted material without seeking permission. Congress created these exceptions in order to
balance the rights of creators and users and to enable some socially beneficial uses of copyrighted works.
Some of these exceptions are explained below.

Fair Use

Fair Use (Sec. 107) allows for various uses of copyrighted works. This is the most flexible of the exceptions in the
copyright law and can apply in a wide variety of situations.
To learn more check out our section on Fair Use.

Reproduction for Libraries

Section 108 of the Copyright Act allows libraries and archives to make copies of copyrighted works under very
specific conditions. For example, a patron can ask the library to make a copy of a journal article or portion of a
book in the library's collection as long as it is for the patron's personal study.

First Sale Doctrine

The first sale doctrine (Sec. 109) allows you to distribute a legally acquired physical copy of a copyrighted work.
This allows libraries to lend books and individuals to lend or sell used books, movies or CDs.

Classroom Display or Performance

Under Section 110(1) it is okay to display or perform copyrighted works in a face-to-face classroom setting at
a non-profit educational institution. This allows a teacher to show a video or students to display multimedia
projects in class. Section 110(2) allows for the display or performance of copyrighted works for distance learning
(e.g., on a course management system), but you must fulfill many specific requirements in order to qualify for
this exception.

165 | 5. Exceptions to Copyright
6. Creative Commons - An Open Option

The internet has made the creation and sharing of creative works much easier than it has ever been. Most of
these new works are protected by copyright as soon as they are created. But not everyone wants to lock up their
creativity behind the protection of copyright. Many people want their work to be freely shared and even built
upon.
Creative Commons (CC) was developed out of the desire to make it easier to share and use copyrighted works.
Creative Commons allows a creator to grant licenses to their work that could include the ability to share, adapt
and/or use material for commercial purposes without having to ask for permission. The creators still own the
copyright, but they proactively decide to let others use their works under certain conditions.

Creative Commons allows a creator to grant licenses to their work without requiring they grant individual permission.

            ACTIVITY: Finding Creative Commons Works

               Many websites include CC licensed works. You can search them to find materials that you
               can freely use in creating your own work provided that you comply with the terms of the
               license. You can also upload your own CC licensed works to share with others.
               Examples include:

                    · Flickr
                    · YouTube
                    · The Noun Project
                    · Wikipedia's Wikimedia Commons

167 | 6. Creative Commons - An Open Option
7. Public Domain and Term of Copyright

Copyright protection of a work doesn't last forever. Once the copyright term ends for a work, it enters the public
domain. This means that no one owns the rights to the work anymore, so the work may be used by anyone,
for any purpose, without permission. The public domain includes works where copyright has expired and works
that were never protected by copyright in the first place (such as works of the U.S. federal government created
by federal employees).

The public domain includes works where copyright has expired and works that were never protected by copyright.

      Activity: Finding Works in the Public Domain

       The public domain provides a great source of materials that you can use for any purpose, without
       requesting permission or paying a fee. The internet is full of useful sites that can help you find Public
       Domain materials, including:

            · Copyright Services: Find Public Domain and Openly Licensed Materials
            · HathiTrust
            · Internet Archive
            · Project Gutenberg

                                                                                                                       7. Public Domain and Term of Copyright | 168
When Does a Work Enter The Public Domain?

Congress has placed a limitation on the length of copyright so that works can eventually become part of the
public domain and be re-used and built upon by others. Over the years, due to U.S. participation in international
treaties and changes to U.S. copyright law, the term of copyright has changed significantly.
The current term is:

  · 70 years after death of author. If there are multiple authors, then it is 70 years after the death of the last
      author.

  · If corporate, or anonymous, authorship the term is either 95 years from date of first publication, or 120
      years from the date of creation, whichever comes first.

Term of Copyright

Since the duration of copyright has changed throughout the years, it can be difficult to determine when
copyright expires for a particular work. Below are links to a couple of online sources to help you determine when
a particular work enters the public domain.

  · Copyright Term and the Public Domain in the United States
  · ALA Copyright Genie

  EXAMPLES: Copyright Duration

  The duration of copyright depends on when the work was created and whether it was the work of a single
  author, multiple authors, or an anonymous or corporate author.

1. What Is Fair Use?

                          Fair Use is an exception to U.S. copyright law that allows use of copyrighted work under certain conditions.

Are you incorporating any materials in your research final product that were created by someone else, such as
images or text from other works? These materials could be protected by copyright. For example, content you
find online, text, books, movies, songs, email, images, and videos are most likely copyrighted. Fortunately, U.S.
copyright law includes an exception that could allow you to use copyrighted work in your assignments for class.
However, if you would like to share your research product outside of the classroom (such as on a webpage or
blog or in your portfolio), you will need permission from the copyright owner(s) unless your use is covered under
another statutory exception. Fair use is one such exception, and it can apply to a wide variety of uses.

      Note: Fair Use and Educational Use

       Fair Use plays an important role in education. Although educational use receives several protections
       in copyright law, not all educational use is automatically fair use. It's important to know that there
       are limits to how you can use others' creative works even as a student or teacher in the classroom.
       In this section, you will learn about fair use and strategies to help determine whether or not a
       proposed use of someone else's copyrighted works falls under the fair use exception. Understanding

       how to properly perform a fair use analysis and assert your fair use rights can help you to build upon
       others' works with confidence.

Fair Use and Copyright - A Balance

Copyright in the U.S. is intended to promote the creation of new works by providing an incentive for creators.
However, recognizing that new works often build on or incorporate existing works, the law strikes a balance
between the rights of creators and the rights of users via exceptions to the exclusive rights of the creator.
The fair use exception is detailed in Section 107 of the U.S. Copyright Act. Unlike other copyright exceptions, fair
use is flexible and can apply to a broad array of uses. It is designed to be adaptable to new uses and technologies
so that Congress doesn't have to create new exceptions before a new technology can be utilized.

      Movie: What Is Fair Use?

       Watch a short introduction to fair use from Copyright Services.

173 | 1. What Is Fair Use?
2. The Four Factors

Most of the copyright exceptions are very specific about what kinds of uses may qualify for the exception and
often include various restrictions about who can use the exception and under what precise conditions.
Fair use, on the other hand, is much more flexible and can apply to a wide variety of uses. Instead of specifying
an exact type of user, type of material or amount that qualifies for this exception, the fair use statute provides a
framework for the analysis and application of four factors that determine whether or not a particular use may
qualify as fair use.
The four factors of fair use are:

  · Purpose & character of use, including whether commercial (i.e., publishing a book) or non-commercial (i.e.,
      using in a classroom assignment)

  · Nature of the original material (i.e., is the work published or unpublished? Fact or fiction? Highly creative?)
  · Amount and substantiality of the original work (are you using the entire work or just a portion?)
  · Effect on the market for the work (will your use have a substantial negative financial impact on the creator

      or market for the work? Will your use be a substitute for the original work?)

When considering whether a proposed use of a copyrighted work may qualify as fair use, you must weigh all
four factors together.

Transformation

The courts have recently emphasized the concept of transformation or a transformative purpose, which falls
under the first factor of fair use.
Transformation means that the way in which the work is being used is different than the original use for which
it was created, adding a new expression, meaning, or message.
In many cases a transformative use of a copyrighted work will strongly favor a determination of fair use.
There are two ways in which a use can be transformative.
First, you could actually make changes to the original work in order to use it for a new purpose. An example
would be to take short clips of popular movies and remix them to create a video for the purpose of social
commentary or teaching.
The second form of transformative use does not require that you alter the original work in any way. Instead, you
use the work for a purpose that is significantly different than the use for which it was created. An example of
this would be using clips from a blockbuster movie that was originally sold for mass market entertainment for
the purpose of teaching and research.

Copyright law lacks specificity, so it can be difficult to determine whether or not a particular use may qualify
as fair use. Fortunately, there are a number of useful tools available online to help you consider the four fair use
factors as they apply to your intended use.
A Fair Use Checklist can be very helpful for conducting a fair use analysis. The checklist indicates various criteria
for each factor which have been found in a court of law to favor or oppose a finding of fair use. It is highly
recommended that you use a fair use checklist to evaluate the strength of your argument for fair use.

      Movie: Follow the Four Factors of Fair Use

       Watch this video to see a fair use analysis using a fair use checklist.
       https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/mYB3f7U9NFs?si=jInYkirtk5Qq_VISrel=?0

In a fair use analysis, you consider each of the four factors in light of your proposed use and determine whether
your use is favoring or opposing fair use for that factor. You then weigh all four factors together. You cannot rely
on a numerical tallying of criteria in favor and opposing fair use in order to make a determination. You must
consider all four factors holistically and determine if, taken as a whole, they favor or oppose fair use, and to what
extent (e.g., strongly favoring fair use, slightly favoring, etc.).

  · If, overall, your use favors fair use, then you may decide to proceed.
  · If your use instead opposes fair use, you should reassess your use and determine if you can make any

      changes that could strengthen your case for fair use.
There are other tools in addition to the checklist that can help you conduct a fair use analysis. The American
Library Association has developed a tool called the Fair Use Evaluator.

                                                                                                                               3. Evaluating Your Case for Fair Use | 176

      Tips for Best Practice

       While it is important to perform a fair use evaluation for each and every use of copyrighted material,
       there are some general rules that can often help you to strengthen a fair use claim.
       Below are a few tips to consider when relying on the fair use exception in order to use copyrighted
       works in your endeavors.

            · Use only lawfully acquired copyrighted works - To be able to claim fair use you must have
                used a legal copy of the original work.

            · Acknowledge all of your sources with a bibliographic citation - Giving proper credit to the
                original creator demonstrates good faith and may help strengthen your fair use case.

            · Use only the amount of the original work that you need to accomplish your goal - Since the
                amount of the original work that is used is one of the fair use factors, it is always important to
                only use what you need and not add extra material.

            · Restrict the audience and/or make only the number of copies that you need - The less you
                copy and share the parts of the original work, the less effect you have on the market for it.

            · Use Creative Commons licensed or public domain works - If you use works that expressly
                allow you to use them or have no copyright protection, you do not need to rely on fair use and
                can be more confident that your use is legal.

            · Use works that you created - If you created it, you own the copyright, with the exception of
                works made for hire. (When you create things for your job, typically your employer owns the
                copyright.)

177 | 3. Evaluating Your Case for Fair Use
       If you are in doubt about your fair use claim, either reassess and make changes to your proposed
       use in order to make a stronger claim or ask for permission to use the copyrighted material - It is
       much easier to make changes or ask for permission before you use copyrighted material than to get
       hit with an infringement claim and have to make changes or face a law suit after your use.

A number of groups have developed Codes of Best Practices in Fair Use for different types of activities. These
codes propose examples of fair use within specific communities of practice. Below are links to some of these
Codes of Best Practices.

4. Common Examples of Fair Use

Students and teachers rely on fair use in order to accomplish many of their educational goals. Below are some,
but by no means all, educational activities that rely upon fair use.

Student Projects

Includes both media and text.
Your fair use analysis will change depending on how the project is presented, for example only the professor
sees it, you share it with the whole class, you present it to a group outside of the class, or you post it online for
anyone to see.

Course Reserves

Includes electronic reserves.
Instructors may in some situations, rely on fair use to copy or post small portions of books or journals for
supplementary student readings, but cannot copy entire copyrighted works as a replacement for materials that
students would normally be required to purchase.

Sound or Video Clips for Teaching

Students and teachers can make use of video or sound clips in creating multi-media presentations for use in
the classroom.

Digitization Projects

Many university libraries rely on fair use in order to create large scale digitization projects that preserve older
materials, as well as providing improved access to their collections for the purpose of research. For an example
of this type of digitization project check out the HathiTrust Digital Library.

Content in Scholarly Articles

It is common to quote other researchers' writings or use others' images, graphs or charts in your own scholarly
writing. These practices have long been considered acceptable under fair use.

Access for People with Disabilities

When specific exemptions don't fit.
While there are specific exceptions that allow for making copies of copyrighted works in order to provide access
to the blind or other people with disabilities, they are sometimes too narrow to provide complete access. In
these cases it is possible to rely upon fair use in order to provide access to materials.
Fair Use for Non-Educational Purposes

179 | 4. Common Examples of Fair Use
Fair use is not only available for educational purposes. Many other commercial and non-commercial activities
depend upon fair use. Some of these common fair uses include:

  · Quotes in books, news reports and blogs
  · Mash-ups and remixes
  · Parody, such as on television shows like South Park or Saturday Night Live
  · Video or sound clips in documentary films
  · Thumbnail images on search engines

Myths about Fair Use

Many people have heard of fair use and have some ideas about what it is. Unfortunately, there are many myths
or misunderstandings about exactly what fair use covers, what the law states or how it can be applied. Below
we dispel just a few of the most common myths about fair use.
Myth 1: All educational use is fair use.
Fact: While many educational uses are considered fair use, there are some activities that do not meet the fair
use criteria. For example, a teacher can't make copies of an entire text book so that students don't have to buy
it.
Myth 2: Every educational use is transformative.
Fact: Using copyrighted works for teaching can often be a transformative use, but not always. For example,
using a text book created to teach Biology 101 to teach Biology 101 is not transformative.
Myth 3: All socially beneficial use is fair use.
Fact: Fair use is designed to help balance the rights of the creator and the social benefit of using copyrighted
works in certain ways. Not all uses of copyrighted works that would be socially beneficial, however, qualify as
fair use. For example, scanning and posting an entire medical text book online for anyone to access for free is
socially beneficial but probably not fair use.
Myth 4: All commercial use precludes fair use.
Fact: Many commercial activities, such as newspapers and online news sites, rely heavily on fair use.
Myth 5: It is not possible to have a fair use when a permissions scheme exists for a work.
Fact: Just because rights holders are willing to charge you to use their copyrighted material, does not mean that

                                                                                                                                 4. Common Examples of Fair Use | 180
fair use cannot apply. For example, the Associated Press created a licensing scheme to quote from AP stories
but quoting from news stories has long been considered fair use.
Myth 6: Fair use specifies a percentage or amount of a work that is okay to use.
Fact: The law does not state that using 10% of a book or 30 seconds of a song or video clip is fair use. You can
often use more than these arbitrary limits, while sometimes using even less might not be fair use. The amount
of the original work used is only one of the four factors to consider.

                                                                                                                                       13-Roles of Research Sources | 182
1. Thinking About Roles of Sources

Knowing how to use your "players" effectively improves the outcome. (Image source: Scott Stuart)

Does this nightmare sound like how you feel every time you have to write a research paper?
            Your team is playing in the big game and you're the coach. (Maybe the real coach missed the plane.
            Who knows-it's a nightmare!) The stakes are high. You know your players are good athletes--you have
            access to the best and plenty of them. But you don't really know good strategies of the game, so you
            don't quite know how to use your players. For instance, is it better to keep your quarterback fresh by
            substituting often? Your kicker is not as bulky as your tackles. Is that typical of good kickers or should
            you find somebody else? And what about your linemen--can they tackle as well as block?

What makes this a nightmare is not knowing how to use your players in a high-pressure game. Unfortunately,
that situation is similar to writing a research paper if all you know are directions like these:

  Your paper must be in 12 pt. font, Times New Roman, double spaced with no more than 1 margins, and
  include a minimum of 8 total articles comprised of:

    · At least 2 peer-review articles
    · 3 (no more than 6) popular articles (magazine or newspaper)
    · 2 (no more than 4) electronic sources (website or blog)
So you know you need sources. But directions like those aren't much help with what to actually do with the
183 | 1. Thinking About Roles of Sources
sources in your paper. Even with credible sources, it's very difficult to write a persuasive paper until you learn
the roles that sources play--how you can use them--within your paper.
But who said anything about a persuasive paper? Perhaps one of the things you don't know is that with
most research papers and essays, the unstated expectation is that you will use your sources to make an
argument. That's because most scholarly writing makes an argument. You will be arguing that your answer to
your research question (your thesis) is correct, or at least reasonable.
Obviously, it's high time someone helped you learn all this!
For both professionals and student researchers, successful scholarly writing uses sources to fill various roles
within the research paper, journal article, book, poster, essay, or other assignment.
Those roles all have to do with rhetoric--the art of making a convincing argument. Putting your sources to work
for you in these roles can help you write in a more powerful, persuasive way--to, in fact, win your argument.

2. BEAM: A Solution That Might Shine

This table, created from the ideas developed by Joseph Bizup, describes the roles that sources can play (some
of the ways they can be used) in your finished assignment, such as a research paper. Bizup called his model
BEAM, an acronym that stands for background, exhibits (or evidence), argument, and method.

Background**  Writers rely on these sources for general factual  Usually secondary sources and tertiary sources,
              information. For instance, a writer could use      but, basically, just anything other than journal
              background information to introduce a setting,     articles that report original research. Some
              situation, or problem in the research paper.       examples: literature review articles, non-fiction
                                                                 books, and biographies (secondary) and field
                                                                 guides and Wikipedia (tertiary).

Exhibits or   Writers interpret and analyze sources like these   Usually primary sources. Some examples:

              agree with or disagree with. The sources are       examples of primary sources: research articles in

185 | 2. BEAM: A Solution That Might Shine
3. Using BEAM: An Example

Using sources to function in these roles is how you enter into the scholarly conversation with all the other
research and writing that has covered your topic before.
In the next few pages, you'll learn more about each role by analyzing how sources are used in the pop culture
essay cited in the Example below. Seeing how the essay's author puts his sources to work in their various roles
should help you envision how you can do the same in your own papers. The essay discusses how pop culture
affects American (and global) values.

  EXAMPLE: Manufacturing Taste

  Click on the citation below to skim through the essay. When you are finished, come back to this page and
  begin the next section on background sources.
  Booker, M. Keith. "Manufacturing Taste: The Culture Industry, Children's Culture, and the Globalization of
  American Values." Pop Culture Universe: Icons, Idols, Ideas. ABC-CLIO, 2012. Web. 19 June 2012.

BEAM: Background Sources

These are sources that should be noncontroversial--the author accepts information from these sources as
being authoritative (and expects readers to, as well). In other words, the sources (and the information gleaned
from them) are generally trusted or undisputed. That information can serve as the incontestable foundation for
your claims.
Background information is common knowledge (e.g. the sky is blue) and not necessary to be cited.
It's recommended that you cite background sources when you're unsure, but one rule of thumb suggests
finding the same undocumented information in at least 5 other credible sources. It can be difficult to make this
determination, so it's always a good idea to consult your professor.
Let's look at a statement in the first paragraph of the pop culture essay:

       Thus, the corporate giants of the American Culture Industry (themselves now mostly multinational
       conglomerates) clearly must pay attention to the demands of audiences around the world in
       formulating, producing, and promoting the specific films, television, music, and other artifacts that are
       the stuff of popular culture.

How do you know that the "corporate giants are mostly multinational conglomerates" as stated in the first
sentence? Or that the items listed are indeed the stuff of popular culture? These are examples of common
knowledge.
Looking a little deeper...
Without context, this paragraph could also be the conclusion of a paper about what corporations should do
(demonstrating the ongoing nature of knowledge itself). But the paper is not about making recommendations
to the American Cultural Industry. This is an assertion that the author uses to help set up his different argument
and is meant to be taken at face-value. So it's an example of how the same source can play different roles in
different written assignments--all depending on how writers use them.

                                                                                                                                          3. Using BEAM: An Example | 186

  ACTIVITY: Background Sources

  Which of the following would be the best example of a background source that doesn't need to be cited,
  according to the BEAM framework?

          There were a total of 39 delegates who signed the U.S. Constitution; William Jackson was the 40th,
          but served as secretary and did not represent a state.
          Thought to be limited to bat populations, the fungi responsible for the fast-spreading disease known
          as White-nose syndrome has been linked with similar infections affecting amphibians.
          Having published over 300 reports since 2000, the Pew Internet & American Life Project has been a
          trusted source for research into online behavior."

  Our Answer: There were a total of 39 delegates who signed the U.S. Constitution; William Jackson was the
  40th, but served as secretary and did not represent a state.

BEAM: Exhibit and Evidence Sources

Generally, exhibit and evidence sources are works of literature (or other media), collected data, or some
observed phenomenon, etc. that you have been asked to write about. They are what you analyze or interpret.
Looking again at the pop culture essay, the exhibits being examined are pop culture and American (as well as
global) values. Specifically, the essay is examining the relationship between the two:

       On the other hand, the international success of Toy Story 3, a film that deals with anthropomorphized
       toys and is thus essentially a consumerist fantasy of commodities come to life, also suggests that global
       distribution of the products of the American Culture Industry is beginning to have an impact on the
       tastes and values of audiences even outside the United States.
Exhibit sources are not limited to examples in the humanities; they could also be data that was collected in a
scientific experiment or by a website's user survey. They can also simply serve as examples that help support a
claim.

BEAM: Argument Sources

Argument sources provide you with the other voices in the academic conversation about your topic. Who else
has done similar research, and how should your paper respond to what they've said? Does your paper refine or
extend an existing hypothesis someone else has tested? If so, those sources belong in your paper.

187 | 3. Using BEAM: An Example
Sometimes the purpose of including an argument source is to disagree with it and definitively indicate a
different direction.
From our pop culture essay example:

       Althusser's work remains compelling, despite the fact that theorists such as Michel de Certeau and John
       Fiske have argued that individuals actually have a considerable ability to resist and oppose the messages
       conveyed to them by official ideology, in popular culture and elsewhere.
The author is taking part and taking a stand in the ongoing scholarly discussion of culture, although this
endorsement of Althusser's work could possibly be considered a method source if the argument in the article
went in a different direction.

  ACTIVITY: Argument Sources

  Which of the follow best defines an argument source in the BEAM framework?

     · It's one piece of research or scholarship that your paper is directly responding to.

  Our Answer: It's one of many voices in a larger conversation that your research paper participates in.

BEAM: Method Sources

While argument sources help you frame your paper within the larger scholarly discussion about your topic and
exhibits provide a focal point, method sources help provide underlying and sometimes implicit assumptions for
your argument or analysis.
For some research, these are literally the methods you use to collect data like a focus group or a particular
statistical analysis, and they provide justification for them. In other research, your paper might reveal a leaning
toward a major attitude or school of thought within a discipline.
As a persuasive piece of writing, the essay has this intrinsic thread of caution and warning that is summed up
in its conclusion:

       "The children's film industry might not be quite as sinister as the tobacco industry, with its efforts to
       addict children to cigarettes. [...] Meanwhile, the lives of those audiences are now being increasingly
       saturated by popular culture, making it more and more difficult for individuals to form attitudes,
       opinions, and values that are independent of the messages promulgated by the Culture Industry."
While this is a subtle example, you would generally cite or at least credit your methods and theories that frame
your analysis in your bibliography.

                                                                                                                                         3. Using BEAM: An Example | 188
4. Practice with BEAM

You've just learned about the various roles sources can play in written material. In this section you'll gain practice
identifying roles that other writers have used them for and then be asked to examine your own past work.

  ACTIVITY: A Reading Exercise

  Identifying BEAM's kinds of sources in already written materials is a good way of learning how to use them
  in your own writing assignments. For practice, look at an abstract of and two passages from Lesy, M. (2007).
  Visual Literacy. Journal of American History, 94(1), 143-153.

  Read the abstract and passages below and identify the most likely role (background, exhibit, argument, or
  method) each featured source is playing in Lesy's article. See our take on each below:

          ABSTRACT: The article reports on visual literacy and the psychological aspects of photography. The
          author offers his opinions on the complexities of photographs and reports on the various levels
          of meaning behind picture taking. Particular attention is given to the psychological aspects of
          photography and photographers. Additional article topics include the importance of historical
          photographs, the impact of the Internet and digital media on the profession, as well as the
          importance of preserving photographs.

              Passage 1

          Solving one scholarly problem - the need to sort out an image's multiple meanings - opens a clear
          view of others. No matter how mundane, utilitarian, or circumscribed a photograph's origins may
          be, an image is not a sentence. Images are forms of sensory data, processed by the right brain. No
          matter how judicious and objective a historian fancies herself, a photograph will elicit projections
          and associations in her, stir her imagination, before she even notices what is happening to her. A
          photograph "is a function, an experience, not a thing," said Minor White, a mid-twentieth-century
          photographer whom Walt Whitman would have recognized as a fellow poet. "Cameras are far more
          impartial than their owners and employers," White went on to say. "Projection and empathy [are]
          natural attributes in man...the photograph invariably functions as a mirror of at least some part of the
          viewer." SOURCE CITED: Minor White, "Equivalence: The Perennial Trend," PSA Journal, 29 July 1963),
          17. 20.

              Passage 2

          The problem is not that there are too few images, but too many. Historical photographs exist in huge
          numbers, in well-ordered collections, presided over by knowledgeable curators. More and more of
          the collections are being digitized. Overload and saturation are only a mouse click away.

          One example: in the Prints and Photographs Division of the Library of Congress there are 164,000
          black-and-white photographs made between 1935 and 1945 by photographers employed by the
          Farm Security Administration and the Office of War Information.

          "America from the Great Depression to World War 11: Photographs from the FSA-OWI, 1955-1945,"
          Library of Congress: American Memory, http://memory.loc.gov/ammem/fsowhome.html

  Our Answer:

189 | 4. Practice with BEAM
  The source referred to in Passage 1 is probably a background source. The author is offering White's definition
  as fact. It helps support one of the author's assertions about the nature of photographs.
  The source referred to in Passage 2 is an exhibit source. The author is using the Library of Congress's
  photographic archive as a self-evident example to support the claim that information overload is a potential
  problem.

Now you're ready to do role identification in a research paper you've already written yourself. (In the future, it
may be helpful to do the same as a last check on research papers you are about to turn in.)

  ACTIVITY: Self-Check

  Directions: Re-read your research paper. (If you've already gotten feedback from your professor on this
  paper, also look to see whether any of that feedback applies to the roles you gave your sources.)Then
  consider the questions below. If you can't answer "Yes" to every question, reconsider how you have used the
  sources in your paper.
  Do My Sources Have the Right Roles?

     · Have I used background information to, for instance, introduce a setting, situation, or problem in the
        paper or essay?

     · Did I cite/not cite the background information appropriately?
     · Did I avoid using journal articles that report original research for my background information?
     · Did I interpret and analyze sources as though they are exhibits or evidence in my argument?
     · Were primary sources those that played the role of exhibits and evidence?
     · Did I discuss and cite what others have written about my research question?
     · Did I include writers who both agree and disagree with what I say is my answer to the research

        question?
     · Did I avoid using tertiary sources to make my argument that my thesis is reasonable?
     · Did I make it clear where key terms, concepts, and manner of working that I used in my research were

        used first by others?
     · Were my sources for useful key terms, concepts, and manner of working secondary sources?

Glossary

abstract

      A brief summary of what a journal article is about and a quick read in order to decide whether the article
      is likely to contain information relevant to your research project. The abstract may appear in research
      databases and, sometimes, in the article itself.

academic argument

      The verbal and written argument that academics take part in while arguing that their claims about their
      research, supported by the research of others, are correct. Collectively, this argument is called the scholarly
      conversation. For professors, it takes place in journal articles, conference papers, scholarly blogs, and
      scholarly books. But academic arguments that students put forth in research paper, essay, and poster
      assignments are also part of the scholarly conversation.

academic integrity

      According to The Ohio State University, "Academic integrity is a commitment, even in the face of adversity,
      to five fundamental values: honesty, trust, fairness, respect, and responsibility. From these values flow
      principles of behavior that enable academic communities to translate ideals into action." Source: Office of
      Undergraduate Education web page

academic misconduct

      When you don't use integrity in your academic work. Such misconduct includes submitting plagiarized
      work, which is work that is not your own. See a full definition of academic misconduct in the Ohio
      State University Code of Student Conduct at https://trustees.osu.edu/sites/default/files/documents/2019/08/
      CodeStudentConduct_0.pdf.

active listening

      Skills used to encourage people, including those being interviewed, to talk more. The skills often include
      listening closely, showing that attention is being paid, maintaining eye contact, nodding and making other
      encouraging gestures, making short comments such as "Then what?," and asking follow-up questions.
      There may be different standards for active listening among cultures.

advanced search

      A way that many search tools, such as Google, Bing and many library catalogs, have of doing a search in a
      more complex way than their usual search box. Advanced search usually helps users use Boolean operators
      or to search particular fields in sources. Look for the Advance Search heading to click on the site.

alternate terms

      Alternatives to the first terms that come to mind for main ideas when developing a search statement. For
      instance, if the term we first think of is peaceful, the alternative term might be warlike. Alternative terms
      are often synonyms, anonyms, and singular and plural forms of the main concept term.

analysis

      A process that carefully examines something, looking at each part separately and together, in order to
      understand it.

193 | Glossary
argument

      In academic writing, the case you make that your answer to your research question is correct or at least the
      most reasonable answer. This kind of argument is based on evidence that you find in credible sources.

BEAM

      An acronym that stands for Background, Exhibits or Evidence, Argument, and Method or Theory. These are
      roles that a researcher/writer can use sources for in a research final project, such as a research paper, as put
      forth by Joseph Bizup.

bias

      One of the factors to be evaluated about a source to determine whether it is credible. Bias decreases
      information's credibility. Even in opinion pieces, where authors must show their opinions, authors must
      use evidence to make their argument. It's when authors don't include evidence or when they leave out
      important information that we can tell they are using their own likes and dislikes, not evidence, to shape the
      information they are sharing. That indicates bias. Other clues include: learning that the author has a vested
      interest in our cooperation with the site or issue, not linking to the original piece of information under
      discussion, including many strongly worded assertions in the text, and using many exclamation points.

bibliographic citation

      Citations, often at the end of a publication, that show where ideas or quotes contributed by others and
      used in the publication came from. These citations usually include titles, authors' names, date and place
      of publication, and other information that would help readers locate the publications. Such citations are
      usually on pages called Bibliography, References, or Works Cited. See intext citations

boolean operators

      The words AND, OR, and NOT when used with search terms to direct a search to include or exclude certain
      search results. (In some search boxes, you can use the + symbol for AND rather than the word or the -
      symbol for NOT rather than the word. In Google you can't use the word NOT and must use -.) For instance,
      if you wanted to find an article about the effects of climate change on the oceans, you might type these
      terms in the search box: "climate change" AND oceans. (Incidentally, the quotation marks tell Google to
      search for the words climate change together, as a phrase, instead of searching first for climate and then
      for change.) Boolean operators can be used to make advanced searches. See Parentheses around search
      terms in a search box.

citation

      Pointing out in what sources you found each direct quote and where/who the ideas that you paraphrased
      and summarized in your research paper, essay, or poster came from. The citing may appear at the point of
      quoting, paraphrasing, and summarizing (called in-text citations) and at the end of the document on pages
      typically called References, Bibliography, or Works Cited. Citations are an integral part of academic integrity
      and avoiding plagiarism

citation styles

      The several sets of rules about exactly how and where to make citations. Examples include Chicago style,
      the Modern Language Association style (MLA), the American Psychological Association style (APA),
      American Medical Association style (AMA), and the style of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics

                                                                                                                                                                       Glossary | 194
      Engineers (IEEE). Disciplines tend to prefer one style over another, so always ask your professors which style
      they want you to use for your research assignments. Each style appears in a manual or style guide available
      for free at libraries or for sale online. The rules change periodically, so check online for what's the latest
      edition. A good source for MLA, APA, IEEE, and Chicago styles is Purdue University OWL, although you still
      need to make sure OWL is using the latest edition.

components of an arguement

      The parts of an argument, which are, according to the authors of The Craft of Research: the question;
      claims about the question; reasons for the claims; evidence for the reasons; acknowledgements of others'
      objections, counterarguments, and alternative solutions; and responses to others' objections,
      counterarguments and alternative solutions. Collectively, the components are what make a particular
      communication an argument.

controlled vocabulary

      The collection of search terms chosen by experts to be the preferred ones used in a database. Such
      vocabulary words are sometimes called descriptors.

copyright

      The protections provided for creators of creative works, beginning in the U.S. Constitution and in the
      Copyright Act, which are intended to promote the creation of new works. Original works of authorship
      are protected, among them: students' research papers and their other original works of authorship; email;
      literary works; musical works and any lyrics; dramatic works; choreography; pictorial, graphic, and sculptural
      works, motion pictures and audiovisual works, including sound recordings; and architectural works. Rights
      granted by copyright include the right to: reproduce and distribute the work, prepare derivative works,
      perform and display the work publicly, and perform publicly a sound recording by means of digital audio
      transmission. The Ohio State University Libraries' Copyright Services is a good source to find out how to
      protect your rights as a creator and how to legally use material copyrighted by others.

Creative Commons

      Free and open licenses that make it easier to share and use copyrighted works. Creators still own the
      copyright but describe the conditions under which they will let others use their works by adopting a
      particular kind of Creative Common (CC) license. For example, perhaps the license they choose requires the
      user only to post appropriate credit (including the creator's name) in order to use it. That's a much quicker
      process than the user having to formally ask permission from the creator. When potential users of the
      works see the license, they right away know that they have the creators' permission to use the work under
      the conditions associated with that particular kind of CC license. You can read more about CC licenses on
      the CC website. You can search for works with CC licenses at CC Search, flickr, Google Images, YouTube, and
      the Noun Project.

credibility

      The degree to which a piece of information can be believed. Credibility for a source probably cannot be
      perfect or guaranteed. But if credibility is high, the information is believed to be most likely true and reader/
      viewers can have confidence in it.

195 | Glossary
critical thinking

      Asking yourself questions about information, an idea, a person, an object, or an event. The intent of the
      questions is to help you understand more clearly the item and the relationships between items.
data

      "Units of information observed, collected, or created in the course of research" (Erway, Ricky. 2013. "Starting
      the Conversation: University-wide Research Data Management Policy." Dublin, Ohio: OCLC Research.
      http://www.oclc.org/content/dam/research/publications/library/2013/2013-08.pdf). Data is often assumed to
      be numbers but they do not have to be.
data visualization

      The way data is displayed. A good display makes the data easier to understand and attracts the interest of
      viewers. But it must also not distort the meaning of the data.
database fields

      In a database's documents, a location where information can be searched. For instance, if you think the
      title of documents is where the documents are most likely to contain your search terms, you can tell the
      database to look only in the title field. You usually have several fields to choose from and can choose
      combinations of fields in which to look. You are said to have "limited" your search to the fields you choose.
database scope

      Information about the specific subject area(s), format, or date range (generally, years covered) of a
      specialized database. This information can indicate whether the information you're looking for is likely to be
      covered in that particular database.
direct quote

      Information taken word-for-word from another source and either spoken by you or incorporated into your
      written work. Quoting someone else directly is acceptable in most cases, sometimes even required. But
      you should always name the person you are quoting and the source where you found the direct quote.
discipline

      A broad academic area of study. Examples are social sciences, physical sciences, life sciences, mathematics
      and engineering, humanities, and the arts.
evaluation

      A process undertaken to prove whether something has value. When we evaluate sources, we are trying to
      figure out whether they are relevant to what we are trying to do and whether they are credible enough to
      suit our purpose. (For academic writing, they must be highly credible.)
evidence

      When doing research, the facts and reasoning for why you believe your claim in an argument is true. Most
      of the evidence students use in their research papers comes from sources

                                                                                                                                                                       Glossary | 196
fair use

      An exception to copyright that gives people permission to use a copyrighted work under certain conditions.
      The factors you should consider to determine whether your particular use would be fair use are: (1) purpose
      and character of use, including whether commercial (i.e. publishing a book) or non-commercial (i.e. using
      in a classroom assignment); (2) nature of the original material (i.e., is the work published or unpublished?
      Fact or fiction? Highly creative?); (3) amount and substantiality of the original work (are you using the entire
      work or just a portion?); (4) effect on the marketplace or on the work's value (will your use have a financial
      impact on the creator?). Even if you believe you can use a copyrighted work under Fair Use, you still need to
      provide a citation.

full-text search

      A search in which entire documents within a database are searched, as opposed to only specific fields in
      documents or metadata about each document.

in-text citations

      Pointing out in what sources you found each direct quote you quoted and ideas that you paraphrased or
      summarized in your research term paper, essay, presentation, or poster. In-text citations are made right at
      the point that you used the direct quote, paraphrase, or summarization. In-text citations usually contain
      the last name of the author you are citing and, in some cases, the date of the source you are citing and/
      or a specific page number. The sources for which you have in-text citations are listed along with their
      publication facts at the end of your essay, or research paper.

inference

      An educated guess.

information lifecycle

      After an event, the various types and formats information that get created about the event as time passes.
      Information about the event usually changes and becomes more accurate and more detailed as more
      information becomes available. In general, the order in which formats are created is: social media;
      newspaper, TV, and radio; talk shows on TV and radio; popular magazines; journal articles; books;
      government documents; print encyclopedias; and bibliographies about the event.

information needs

      The reasons you are looking for information. When you are doing an academic research project, those
      reasons include (1) to find background information, (2) to answer your research question, (3) to convince
      your audience that your answer is correct or at least the most reasonable answer, (4) to describe the context
      surrounding your research question for your audience and explain why it's important, and (5) to report what
      others have said about your question, including any different answers to your research question.

inquiry-based assignments

      College assignments that ask students to consider questions in order to solve problems or explain why
      something exists, how it works, and/or the effects it has. Students usually need to consult multiple sources
      to develop their answer or interpretation.

197 | Glossary
interior monologue

      An internal conversation that a person has with himself/herself, they/themselves.
internet

      According to the Merriam-Webster dictionary, "a global computer network providing a variety of
      information and communication facilities, consisting of interconnected networks using standardized
      communication protocols." The Internet contains the World Wide Web.
iterative searching

      Searching again and again, adjusting your search statement each time based on the results you produced
      with the previous statement(s).
journals

      Publications that come out periodically (usually quarterly) and most often contain some commentary,
      reviews of scholarly books, and scholarly research articles that report new research or reviews of previous
      scholarly research. The reviews of previous research are called literature reviews and, along with the reports
      of new research, are generally the only scholarly portions of journals and the only portions that get peer
      reviewed. Many, but not all, journals are peer reviewed, which means that experts in the field assess the
      scholarship and contributions made by submitted research articles and suggest corrections before the
      journal will be willing to publish them. Each journal tends to be focused on a specific discipline or sub-
      discipline. Sometimes professional associations make the journals they publish available to their members.
      But most journals are very expensive, and for many scholars, it is libraries that make them available. While
      journals used to be print publications, today most are digital-only publications.
keywords

      Search terms that you arrange into a search statement and type into a search box for key word searching.
KISS

      A mnemonic to help you remember a good strategy for subject searching in library catalogs and some
      specialized databases. The letters stand for: Keyword search your topic. Identify a relevant item from the
      results. Select subject terms relevant to your topic from that item's subject heading. Search using those
      subject terms. (Sometimes you can just click on a relevant item's subject headings.)
limiters

      Terms or standards you can use to narrow or focus your search in a digital database. For instance, you can
      ask many databases to search only for sources published during a particular time period or in a particular
      language.
literature

      The scholarly conversation (in research articles, conference proceedings, preprints, and scholarly books)
      about a discipline or part of a discipline.

                                                                                                                                                                       Glossary | 198
metadata

      Information that describes digital information. Without metadata, the web and databases would not be
      searchable because metadata identifies digital information and gives its location during search.

mobile technology

      Digital technology devices, such as smart phones and digital tablets, that you can use while you're on the
      go.

objective information

      Information that reflects a research finding or multiple unbiased perspectives, instead of reflecting only the
      author's own view that doesn't come from research he/she cites.

paraphrase

      In your own work, using the ideas of others by putting them in your own words. This is a way of using your
      sources when their ideas and meaning is more important than the exact language the author used and
      when you don't need to use the author's preeminent authority to bolster your argument at the moment.
      Paraphrases require in-text and bibliographic citations of the sources whose ideas you are using.

parentheses around a search term

      An advanced search technique that's useful when you have more than one kind of Boolean operator in your
      search statement. It lets you give more precise instructions to a search engine than you could otherwise
      give

peer review

      A pre-publication review provided by experts other than the author of a research or literature review article
      and the editor of the research journal to which the article has been submitted for publication. The experts
      assess the article, including making sure the article is presented in the context of what is already known,
      that the methods the researcher used are the right ones, and that the article contributes to the field by
      reporting new and important content. Based on that assessment, the editor may accept the article or turn
      it down for publication. If it is accepted, the author is usually asked to make changes. Peer review increases
      the credibility of many scholarly articles

phrase searching

      Within the search box, an instruction to a search engine (Google or BING) to search the terms enclosed by
      quotation marks in order, instead of separately. (Reminder: If you use quotation marks, there always have to
      be more than one word within them because phrases always consist of multiple words.) For instance, if you
      put Abraham Lincoln in the search box, Google would return all documents that had the word Abraham in
      them somewhere and the word Lincoln in them somewhere. Many of those documents would be irrelevant
      to your search for information about Abraham Lincoln because they are about other Abrahams or other
      Lincolns. But if you put "Abraham Lincoln" in the search box, Google or BING would return all documents
      that contain Abraham Lincoln in that order.

plagiarism

      Using the work or ideas of others as though they are your own, which means without citing them. If you

199 | Glossary
      incorporate others' ideas or work into your own by using direct quotes, paraphrases, or summaries, you
      must cite their sources in order for the use not to be considered plagiarism.

popular sources

      Sources written for and able to be understood by the general public. Usually about news and
      entertainment, popular sources are written by staff writers and reporters and are published, after approval
      from an editor, by commercial publishers. Popular sources usually contain many advertisements and
      attractive artwork. They contain no footnotes or references at the end, although substantive popular
      sources, such as news stories and long form journalism, usually refer to sources in the body of articles.

poster

      A way to communicate research findings or data in a visual format. Posters usually contain a brief
      introduction to the research question or topic, a description of the research method, and a concise
      summary of the findings, along with supporting graphics or images (charts, tables, photos, etc). The
      researcher may create a poster in addition to a more formal written report or in place of a report. Posters are
      often displayed at conferences or symposiums, and the researcher is often available to answer questions or
      discuss their research with attendees.

precision searching

      Using advanced search techniques to find the documents that are likely to give you the information you're
      looking for. Those techniques include identifying main concepts and related terms for your search terms,
      using phrase searching, using parentheses when you have multiple Boolean operators among your search
      terms, and searching iteratively.

primary source

      A term applied with different definitions, depending on the academic discipline. In the humanities and
      many other disciplines, a primary source is information that is firsthand, in its original form. We get primary
      source information without it having gone through any filter--no one translated it or told us what it meant.
      Examples of some sources that are often used as primary sources include diaries, breaking news stories,
      music and dance performances, artworks, eyewitness accounts, and journal articles that report research
      for the first time. But even those sources have to be actually used in research in order to become primary
      sources--nothing just exists as a primary source. The term primary source is used much less often in the
      sciences. When it does come up, scientists tend to use this term for the source, usually a research journal
      article, that was most important to their work.

professional sources

      Sources that were developed and published, usually by a professional association, with the intent of helping
      those working in a particular profession. Such sources may be considered credible and therefore acceptable
      in much academic writing.

public domain

      Available to the public without copyright. Publications whose copyright has timed out or that were never
      copyrighted are said to be in the public domain.

                                                                                                                                                                      Glossary | 200
publication formats

      The form a publication is in, such as book, video, newspaper article, blog, government document, journal
      article, website, etc. Connected to those forms are particular conventions associated with their creation. The
      conventions include not just what elements can be found in a form (advertisements in a newspaper but not
      a book, for instance), but also how much checking a form undergoes before publication.

publication mode

      How close to first-hand information a publication is. Publications are generally called primary sources if they
      are first-hand information. Publications about primary sources are considered secondhand information
      and are called secondary sources. Publications (such as guides, handbooks, dictionaries, and timelines) that
      are made up of third-hand information repackage firsthand and secondhand information and are said to
      be tertiary sources.

qualitative information

      Information that involves a descriptive judgment that uses words instead of numbers. Some examples are
      gender, country of origin name, and emotional state.

quantitative information

      Information that involves a measurable quantity. Examples are length, mass, temperature, and time.

reasons for claims

      Why you believe the claims you make in an argument are true.

recognition from others

      Indications that people or organizations other than the author appreciate, believe, and value a published
      work or group of works. Just like blurbs and endorsements on the back of a printed book, those indications
      include links from others to a website you are evaluating.

related terms

      Search terms that are similar in concept to others you consider using. For instance, if you were looking for
      information about arthritis, it may be helpful to use the search term joint diseases. Sometimes it can be
      helpful to look in a thesaurus for related terms.

relevance

      The degree to which a source can help you with your inquiry assignment or research project. If its content is
      related enough to your topic or research question that you can learn or quote from the source or paraphrase
      or summarize from it, it is relevant.

research

      As opposed to just compiling information on a subject, an attempt to answer questions or to solve problems
      and/or develop an expanded or revised perspective on a topic by synthesizing and interpreting information
      from multiple sources. Those multiple sources could include experimentation or other investigation (such
      as surveying and qualitative research) that varies by discipline. In doing so, new knowledge is often created.
      The sciences use the term research only when new knowledge is created.

201 | Glossary
research assignments

      Assignments that require students to answer research questions and/or solve problems by synthesizing
      ideas they've found in the literature--usually a discipline's scholarly sources--and drawing conclusions from
      several sources.

research question

      The question to be answered by a research project. Such questions cannot be answered by a simple Google
      search and require synthesizing information from several sources to find the correct or most reasonable
      answer. Most answers also result in more questions that need research.

roles played by sources

      How a writer uses each source in his/her research paper. According to Bizup's BEAM model, the writer can
      use quotes, summaries and paraphrases of materials from sources within his/her own paper in these ways:
      as background information, as evidence or an exhibition of evidence, and as sources to be agreed with or
      disagreed with. In addition, the writer could use the same method a source used earlier in order to collect
      data for the paper or the same statistical analysis used by the source. Or, the writer could identify with a
      school of thought represented by the source.

RSS feed

      Stands for Really Simple Syndication and is an easy way to stay up to date about what is being published
      on one or multiple topics. To receive ongoing links to such updated information, subscribe to RSS on the
      websites that have information you want to follow.

scholarly publishing

      The dissemination of scholarly information, usually through books, preprints, journals, and conference
      proceedings.

scholarly sources

      Sources that contain information involved in the scholarly conversation that takes place primarily among
      academics at conferences, presentations and in books, blogs, pre-prints, and journal articles.

search engines

      Huge databases of web pages that have been assembled automatically by machines, based on algorithms
      controlled by humans.

search statements

      What you type into a search box. Search statements may include search terms (preferably, nouns), along
      with devices you can use to give precise instructions for searching: symbols you might use to truncate the
      search terms, a Boolean operator(s), parentheses if you're using multiple Boolean operators, and quotation
      marks around any multiple-word phrases that you're using. See search terms; truncation; Boolean
      operators; parentheses around search terms in a search box

search strategy

      A plan for searching in an intentional way: thinking and doing what it takes to find the best results.

                                                                                                                                                                      Glossary | 202
      Search strategies may be very simple for unimportant searches. But for important searches, such as finding
      sources for a research project, such a plan would involve deciding where to look (sometimes based on
      who else would need this information so you can look where they would look) and deciding what search
      statements to use. It also would involve, based on your evaluation of what you find with each search,
      deciding how you next need to change your search terms to search again and again.

search terms

      The words you organize to make a search statement that you type into a search box

search tools

      Web-based programs that do online searches to meet a user's request. A few may be internet directories,
      but nearly all are search engines or metasearch engines. Directories are lists or catalogs of websites that
      experts have put into categories. Search engines, such as Google and Bing, are huge databases of web
      pages that have been assembled automatically by machines. (Huge though Google and Bing may be,
      many if not most web pages are not available to those search engines.) Metasearch engines use multiple
      search engines and/or directories for data and then summarize the results for the user. Skyscanner.com
      and Kayak.com are examples of metasearch engines. Despite the fact that machines using algorithms are
      involved in most search tools, it is humans that are responsible for the algorithms and any consequential
      discrimination, injustice, and misinformation.

secondary sources

      Sources that provide second-hand information. That is, they are not the original information but are about
      the original information. For instance, such sources are not a novel (the original, first-hand information),
      but are such sources as a book review of the novel or promo copy that tells readers about the novel
      (both second-hand information about the first-hand information). Another example: an analysis (secondary
      source) of a piece of legislation (primary source) that appears in a newspaper. One last example: subsequent
      news coverage of an event (secondary source) after the initial reporting on the event (primary source) was
      published by the news outlet.

source's neighborhood

      The characteristics of a source found on the Internet that collectively tell you what the source is intended
      to do and how much you should trust its information, effectively determined by the author or publisher's
      purpose in publishing the source. Did they intend to inform/educate, persuade, sell, or entertain? When it
      comes to assessing a source's credibility, it can be helpful to think that sources that do the same things
      are clustered in the same neighborhood, just as they intend to be in the physical world. And we can accord
      digital sources the same credibility that we would a school, an advocacy organization, a store, or a movie
      theatre in the physical world.

sources

      People whom you interview or published texts, images, and data that contain information that a researcher
      or journalist uses to study something and come to conclusions.

specialized databases

      Collections of information on one or more specific subject areas that are searchable. Some are broad and
      others are narrow in the subject matter they cover, which is often delineated in a section called "scope."
      Those databases associated with university libraries are generally intended for academic research, and the

203 | Glossary
      information searched for is in academic journal articles. Academic libraries often have hundreds, if not
      thousands, of these databases. Academic Search Complete, Scopus, and JSTOR are examples of specialized
      databases. Also called and library databases.

subject heading searching

      A method of searching that can be used in library catalogs and other databases that are said to have
      a "controlled vocabulary." Controlled vocabulary databases tag individual documents using chosen
      vocabulary words so that the documents can be found. To use this method, follow these steps: Keyword
      search your topic. Identify a relevant item from the results. Select subject terms relevant to your topic
      from that item's subject heading, which uses the tags. Search by using those subject headings. The ERIC
      database for education is an example of one in which you can use subject searching.

subjective

      A characteristic of some information that makes it the opposite of objective information. Subjective
      information is the view of one person or one organization and states things in a definite way, even though
      there may be multiple perspectives or research findings that it doesn't take into consideration.

substantive popular sources

      A subset of popular sources. Sources that are intended for a college-educated or otherwise prepared
      audience. Such sources are complex and thorough and from a credible publisher, yet easily available to
      nearly everyone.

summarize

      One of the techniques you can use to integrate material from a source into your research paper.
      Summarizing what a source says lets you make another author's long text piece shorter for your reader, yet
      still retains the author's meaning. Your summaries require citations to give credit and avoid plagiarism.

synthesis

      Combining ideas and perspectives to create a new way of thinking about something. Synthesis is generally
      thought of as the opposite of analysis, although analysis is often necessary in order to synthesize. Synthesis
      is different from summarization because summarization makes a shorter, concise version of something
      that exists, while synthesis makes something new.

tertiary sources

      Sources that provide third-hand information. That is, they are not the original or primary source (say, a
      novel) and are not second-hand information (such as a book review of that novel), which is always about
      the original source and usually by someone other than the creator of the original source. Instead, tertiary
      sources abstract, compile, digest, or otherwise organize primary and secondary sources. Examples are
      dictionaries, encyclopedias, guides, and handbooks. Tertiary sources are those you usually wouldn't read
      from beginning to end.

thesaurus

      The collection of words that can be used to search in databases with a controlled vocabulary. Library
      collections usually have controlled vocabularies. Also, online or print collections of synonyms where you can

                                                                                                                                                                      Glossary | 204
      look for additional search terms when you are searching in databases or search engines without controlled
      vocabularies.
thesis
      The answer to your research question in your research project.
truncation
      A search technique that enables the searcher to widen the range of documents found by a search
      statement. Unlike what you might think, that happens by shortening a search term to the point its letters
      and a symbol (usually ? or *) tell the database or search engine to search for more words than the word stem
      left in the search statement would seem to indicate. For instance, if you truncated the word observation
      into a word stem like observ and added the symbol *, using that as a search term would get you documents
      that include the words observe, observes, observer, observers, observing, observation, observatory, etc. The
      symbols ? and * used for truncation are often called wildcards.
web search engines
      Huge databases of web pages that have been assembled automatically by machines that choose the
      webpages and their order according to algorithms. Google and Bing are examples. Humans write the
      algorithms and ultimately determine which web pages are included in the databases that search engines
      search.
wildcard
      Used in the advanced search technique called truncation, a question mark or asterisk that takes the place
      of a letter or letters within in a key word search term to broaden the search.
world wide web
      According to Merriam-Webster dictionary, "a part of the Internet accessed through a graphical user
      interface and containing documents often connected by hyperlinks." The WWW is within the Internet.

Chapter 1: Christine tells how a narrower topic helped her

The process of narrowing down a research topic has always been rather difficult for me. I would think of a vague
and broad research question and find myself drowning in sources and things I wanted to include in my piece. I
have had a rather recent experience with this in the comparative studies course that I am currently taking this
semester.
This class is based on readings and movies to further understand injustices in the world. There was a large unit
on the sexualization of women in every form of media. I found that to be an interesting topic and decided I
wanted to write my final paper on that. Due to the knowledge I have learned from this course, I thought it would
be wise to start a research log. Throughout the process of finding research that matched my topic, I discovered
that my topic was far too broad, I had too many routes to take and the information was utterly overwhelming.
Each topic I broke my research down into could have been its research question. I noticed this throughout my
completion of the research log and I was stressed out because I did not know what to do. I then looked at all my
topics and decided to change my research question to a smaller umbrella of my research.
My new topic focused on the effect of sexualizing women in the media on young women's development.
This decision changed the entire process of my research and I created a new research log with this topic.
Instead, I separated my ideas into understanding the abundance of women who suffered from eating disorders,
hypersexualization, and depression from this issue of oversexualizing women. I discovered groundbreaking
statistics and many case studies that relate directly back to my research question.
The narrowing of my topic from a general to a more specific idea led me to a plethora of fantastic research
that broke down and showed the problem with this issue and the effect that it has on developing and growing
young women. Not only did I learn more about something I found remarkably interesting, but I was able to
create enhanced and more focused research when I narrowed down my topic.
I just submitted my final project proposal and received supportive feedback from my professor. In the
comments, she expressed joy that I took the initiative to break down and narrow my research topic further and
the ability to hone in on a simpler idea.
I feel that narrowing a research topic down is vital when attacking a college-level piece because it takes away
the overwhelming feeling of having too many sources and not a concrete idea that you want to stick to. My
experience with college research has only begun this semester. However, I feel I learned a groundbreaking
amount of information throughout my experiences, and narrowing down a research topic makes research way
more approachable and allows students to become more successful.

Chapter 12: Tra `Vaysha talks about fair use and cartoons

The creativity of human beings is beyond comprehension sometimes. A big part of my childhood, like others
I am sure, was me sitting in front of the TV watching cartoon, after cartoon, after cartoon. I was amazed that
such stories, characters, and worlds could be brought into existence through someone getting them from their
imagination into a tangible form on the screen.
These stories, characters, and worlds had such a profound impact on me that when I got the chance, and found
friends that shared in my love of cartoons, we got together and decided to write scripts and make videos about
those stories, characters, and worlds and post them on YouTube so the world could share in our love with them.
And while that was a noble thought and I have no regrets, we were hit with so many copyright infringements
claims on the site, for using someone else's work without their permission. Luckily enough for us, we were able
to make a fair use argument.
Fair use is both a right and an affirmative defense when someone or something brings a copyright
infringement case against you. To determine if your use of someone else's work is fair use, you must first do a
fair use analysis using the four factors of fair use.
1.) You look at the purpose of the use, did you use it for educational purposes? Or did you use it for a commercial
purpose? Also, did you transform the original work?
2.) What was the nature of the original work you used, was it fact or fiction? Was it published or unpublished?
3.) What amount of the original work did you use, did you use the entire work, just a portion of it, did you use
the most important part of it?
4.) Finally, ask yourself, does your work have a financial effect on the market place of the original work? I know
that sounds like a lot but it's so important. There are no hard percentages and numbers allocated that tell
you how much of each you can have, it's a nuanced case- by-case decision, so use your best judgment in
determining fair use.
In the case of me and my friends, we used stills and clips of other authors work, and while we have a better
understanding of fair use, we always have a fair use analysis ready to go for each of our videos, just in case. Fair
use can be applied both in and out of the classroom, and while it's not a green light to infringe upon huge
sections of someone's work, it is a tool to keep creativity and innovation alive and well. Fair use is my friend, fair
use is your friend, so please use it.

                                                                                                                                                  Transcript: Tra'Vaysha | 208
Transcript: The Information Lifecycle

What happens to the information once an event occurs? This is the information life cycle zone.
Information starts with an event. For example, a highly evolved talking mutant reptiles walks out of Lake Mead
Las Vegas, Nevada. Moments later, images are posted on social media, tweets of fear, people may be scared at
first.
Later that day, a news crew is on the scene talking to witnesses and checking facts for TV and radio. News
coverage continues in the following days. Mutant is on talk show `Good Morning America'. People begin to see
the mutant integrating into human society. A week or so after the event popular magazines begin to do in
depth
pieces on the mutant.
Given more time, researches begin to publish academic journal articles on very specific topics like:

  · Diseases in Mutants
  · The Environmental Impacts of Mutations
  · Green and Yellow Fashion Trends
During the year following the event, books and government publications address different topics related to the
mutant like water treatment at the mutant habitat, the economic impact of medical mutation technology, and
mutant culture.
Years after the first mutant is discovered, reference books like encyclopedias and bibliographies
include entries on the event, what followed, and how researchers of different types
have studied the mutants.
There may be bibliographies published that bring together lists of all the information published about the
mutant.
And all this time the conversation never really stopped nor did news stories about the mutant in society.
We have reached the end of the information life cycle.

Chapter 3: Gabe talks about planning his sources

Coming into college I didn't really know what it took to research or really do anything at such a high level yet.
When I got to college, I had to write multiple research essays about difficult topics.
I would like to think that I have pretty bright and intuitive ideas. My thought process was never an issue, finding
reliable and academic sources has always been something I have struggled with. During this process of finding
specific articles to back up my research has been a long and difficult journey. I have read through many articles
trying to find the ones I want to use when I am finished with my research, but how do I know if my audience
will engage with those articles and if they are scholarly enough?
Well, what I found that helped me was using the Ohio State library website and Google Scholar to track down
some very detailed and interesting articles that are directed towards my research question.
Specifically, I wanted to address planning your sources. My planning my sources was in the research log which
helped me overview all my sources and depict which ones were the best academic resources and which were
the best secondary source resources.
What makes a source credible is that it is peer reviewed by other credible/notable authors. You can find this out
by researching the authors and seeing their accomplishments and where they went to school to see if they are
scholarly and therefore a good author to learn from. I realized that I need 1-2 academic resources and at least
1-2 secondary sources like Ted Talks or news articles.
This has been a big help with my research journey because this way I can find all the information I need, and it
makes the research journey more enjoyable.

Chapter 4: Riley talks about using main concepts as search terms

For me, finding sources can be one of the hardest parts about my research process. I'll often struggle to find a
source that is specific towards my topic and that is typically because my searches are not specific enough.
I had never heard of the term precision searching before coming to OSU. After reading this chapter and putting
it into practice with my papers, it almost seemed like second nature to conduct my research through precision
searching.
Sometimes I like to write my research question down on a piece of paper and either highlight or underline the
main concepts. Then I make a list of alternative and related terms to the main concepts so I that I can keep track
of the different search terms I can use.
Another super-important thing in this chapter are search statements. I had no idea how to use the symbols like
question mark and asterisk to help advance my searching.
I found it helpful to write down what the quotation marks, question mark, parentheses, and exclamation marks
are used for on a sticky note, so I that have easy access to them when I write my future papers.

Chapter 7: Riley talks about when and why to cite

Citations are so important. But they can also be a little tricky. When are you supposed to cite? When can you
get away with not citing?
I often times get confused when paraphrasing or summarizing because if I am paraphrasing, then that's my
own work. Right? The answer is actually no.
I've seen many people get tripped up in paraphrasing. But the reality is that you should always cite. It's really
common for people to unintentionally plagiarize because they are unaware of the rules of citation.
There are many reasons to cite, but the one that I have always considered most important is to avoid academic
misconduct.
I wasn't really aware of the of the other reasons for citing until reading this chapter. But they all make so much
sense. By citing a source, you are simultaneously proving credibility and also advancing further research. You
are also giving credit where credit is due.
I don't know about you, but I know I would want to be credited if someone was using my work.
While citing can be tedious, it is so helpful to everyone in the research community.

                                                                                                                                                            Transcript: Riley | 212

Chapter 1: Raul talks about how a narrower topic helped him

Originally I had a very hard time narrowing down my research because I had a lot of interests and there's a lot
of things I wanted to dive into. So, originally, I chose to focus on the Columbus Crew because soccer is a very
big part of my life. But as I went into the research, I realized that it was very dull and I didn't have any desire to
research anymore.
So I had to make a quick change of adjustment and I started researching religion and sports, which very much
aligned with what I wanted to do and, honestly, making that switch from the Columbus Crew to faith and
athletic performance was crucial and pivotal to my research because I because I was able to enjoy the research
more and I could research more effectively.
This brings up, and this brings us, into subtopic 3, the influence of a research question. I think that it is very
important that you pick a research question and topic that really interests you, because what I've found from
research is that if you do not like the topic and you're only doing it because you know that there's information
on the topic, you still will not find good information, no matter how much information is out there.
If you don't have a passion for the research, you won't take good notes. You won't really be able to unless you
research, because your heart is not in the research. So my biggest piece of advice is to really sit down and find
the topic that you know you will be able to spend time on and give good research. Because it will only benefit
you in the end.

Chapter 4: Jaylon gives search statement tips

Researching now adays can be long, frustrating, and tedious for numerous reasons! There is an abundance of
sources and material that are on the Internet that finding exactly what you are looking for can be a difficult
task. This is why precision searching and your search statements matter more than you might think.
During the searching process of research there is a point where you move from just identifying a main concept
to creating deeper and more complicated search statement. Here are a couple of tips and real-life examples
that can strengthen your precision searching skills.
The first useful skill that researchers, like yourself, can use when searching are quotation marks around phrases.
Putting quotation marks around phrases tells the search engine to only give sources that contain that exact
phrase.
A good example of this would be the "United States", when put into quotations only sources with the "United
States" will come up, but if you didn't use quotations then sources that contain sentences like "the states that
are united..." This is important to just make 100% that what you are looking for is what you are going to find.
Another useful skill to have when researching is the wildcard. The wildcard on the keyboard is "shift-8" and
when used correctly it can make help you search for a plethora of material with one search.
A good example of this is if a student was making a presentation over knitting. They could type in their
search engine "Knitting instruct*" with an asterisk at the end. Their results could contain results from knitting
instructors to knitting instructions. The last useful tip we will touch on today to improve your precision searching
is the use of Boolean operators to include or exclude subsets of sources.
The three Boolean operators are AND, OR, and NOT. AND is the simplest and is automatically used in most
common search engines like Bing and Google. If your main idea contains two or more ideas then the Boolean
AND will search for information containing sources with both terms combined.
A good example of this would be if a student were researching a topic about the recent testosterone levels of
men, they could search testosterone levels and men.
The OR Boolean will bring back sources that contain at least one of the terms you searched. If a law student
were looking for cases about death penalty or life with no parole", then a simple OR between these two terms
will give results that contain just one of those terms.
The last type of Boolean is the NOT Boolean. Using NOT, or the "minus" sign, with whatever term you want
to exclude from your search directly after a term or phrase will give you material which does not contain that
specific term.
An example of this would be Fighting Movies -Rocky. This would give you tons of information over fighting
movies but none about Rocky!

                                                                                                                                                         Transcript: Jaylon | 214

Chapter 9: Liam argues for writing your thesis after you have evidence

Hi, my name is Liam and I've decided to focus on chapter nine. The text about making arguments, mainly
because since I've gotten to OSU, I've found that I've had trouble creating a good thesis for which I can build
an essay upon and construct body paragraphs on. I found that like, if I do the thesis first, I almost get fixed on
the idea or whatever that it says, and I start searching for evidence that isn't there. Instead of searching for good
evidence that is there that proves a similar point, but just stated in a different way and I'm really just having
trouble building a blueprint for an argument.
I think a good way that I can fix this is doing the body paragraphs first and then writing the thesis at the end so
that it incorporates everything that I've done.
That includes evidence that I would actually want to use. One class, one specific stories from my comparative
studies class, where I had to write an essay about a text called shooting an elephant. I got like so focused on my
thesis about the power dynamic and power struggle between, between groups that are being oppressed and
the people that are doing the oppressing. And I just had trouble finding good evidence based on that one idea
and didn't really think about other, other evidence that would support that idea, but just in different ways.
And I think it's also important to order your evidence in a way that makes sense and kind of have them build
upon each other so that each one has a purpose and gives the reader a good way of seeing the progress of your
argument and gives them a nice ending to it.

Chapter 8: Riley talks about where she gets help when citing

I primarily used MLA format for citations while I was in high school, so learning about different citation formats
is a little difficult for me. The format you use can affect the way you write your in-text citations, as well as your
bibliography page.
I found the graphic provided in Choosing & Using Sources that highlights differences in citation styles to be
super-helpful. I frequently look it over when citing sources in my own research papers.
I also use Purdue OWL all the time. Purdue University's resource is extremely useful and provides explanations
for how to cite very specific sources. I also frequently contact my subject librarian to help me with citations.
To be honest, I struggle with citing because of the intricacies involved in it. Depending on what kind of source
you're citing, the rules for the citation can be difficult.
I often run into situations where I am trying to cite an article without an author or trying to cite FBI records, and
it can get confusing.
I've found Choosing & Using Sources to be a helpful reminder in how to properly cite so that you can (1) avoid
getting in trouble and (2) give credit where credit is due.

                                                                                                                                                            Transcript: Riley | 216

Chapter 11: Riley notes that copyright motivates creators

To be completely honest, I knew absolutely nothing about copyright before reading this chapter. The term was
always something that I heard in passing, but I never took the time to actually think about what it meant.
Reading this chapter helped me understand the importance of copyright law and how it helps to motivate
creators to do more research and create more content by allowing them to profit from it.
One of the most difficult things for me is making the distinction between what is covered by copyright and what
isn't. The trickiest for me is the fact that a work is not protected by copyright forever and does eventually re-
enter public domain. From the description in the textbook, it looks like copyright lasts for a long time, but the
idea that it does eventually end surprised me a little.
Another thing that I found to be surprising was the criminal punishments for infringing on copyright law.
Apparently, you can be criminally prosecuted! I bet that doesn't happen very often - or maybe only if there is a
lot of money being lost by the copyright holder.
