Introduction

JENN KEPKA

There are hundreds of wonderful, free writing resources available online, yet
most college writing classes in Oregon still use expensive textbooks. This
book is the result of an exploration into why this is still true: what does it
take to replace those comfortable, paper texts with something much less
expensive and yet equally valuable?

   The answer has been that it takes input: from composition instructors,
from librarians, from those who have collected and composed texts before,
and from students, who have been frustrated by textbook prices for longer
than most instructors have been paying attention.

   The goals of this book are simple: To provide a low-cost, high-value
resource that addresses the major outcomes of Writing 121 statewide. To that
end, inside you'll find discussions on how to analyze writing assignments and
readings; how to get started writing an essay; how to research ethically and
thoroughly; and how to use different genres of writing to accomplish your
goals.

   This book collects freely available works under a Creative Commons
license. All works here are adaptable; all works here are printable and
downloadable for free. This book is what any instructor or student will make
of it: it can be cut down to only include certain chapters or expanded to
include examples as necessary.

   This is also very much a living text. As its coordinator/collector/editor,
I would welcome suggestions on its improvement, from minor line-edits to
major revisions. Contact me any time at coordinator@oregonwrites.org to
get involved -- and student writers, that invitation is certainly open to you,
as well!

   All-in-all, I hope this text serves as a starting point for conversations about
and in writing. Welcome to College Composition!

                                                                                                Introduction | ix

PART 1: SITUATION AND
ANALYSIS

The process of preparing to write is as important as the drafting process
itself; in many cases, it's more important. Yet this is the process that most of
us will skip when in a rush, preferring to dive directly into the writing part of
any given writing assignment.
Here, through a few excellent readings, we'll look at the value of starting
early; of considering a college writing assignment thoroughly to avoid the
misunderstandings that lead to costly rewrites and failing grades; and of
considering your audience and final purpose before pen (or keyboard)
connects to paper.
Our first section on pre-writing also serves as a review of active reading,
the most critical skill for college (and daily life) survival that we teach.

                                                                           Part 1: Situation and Analysis | 1

Understanding the Assignment

AMY GUPTILL

     Learning Objectives

         · Understand assignment parameters
         · Understand the rhetorical situation

Writing for whom? Writing for what?

The first principle of good communication is knowing your audience. This is
where writing papers for class gets kind of weird. As Peter Elbow explains:

       When you write for a teacher you are usually swimming against
       the stream of natural communication. The natural direction of
       communication is to explain what you understand to someone who
       doesn't understand it. But in writing an essay for a teacher your
       task is usually to explain what you are still engaged in trying to
       understand to someone who understands it better.
Often when you write for an audience of one, you write a letter or email.
But college papers aren't written like letters; they're written like articles for
a hypothetical group of readers that you don't actually know much about.
There's a fundamental mismatch between the real-life audience and the form
your writing takes. It's kind of bizarre, really.
   It helps to remember the key tenet of the university model: you're a

                                                                      What Does the Professor Want? | 3
junior scholar joining the academic community. Academic papers, in which
scholars report the results of their research and thinking to one another, are
the lifeblood of the scholarly world, carrying useful ideas and information
to all parts of the academic corpus. Unless there is a particular audience
specified in the assignment, you would do well to imagine yourself writing
for a group of peers who have some introductory knowledge of the field but
are unfamiliar with the specific topic you're discussing. Imagine them being
interested in your topic but also busy; try to write something that is well
worth your readers' time. Keeping an audience like this in mind will help
you distinguish common knowledge in the field from that which must be
defined and explained in your paper. Understanding your audience like this
also resolve the audience mismatch that Elbow describes. As he notes, "You
don't write to teachers, you write for them."

     Student Advice

        Don't be scared whenever you are given an assignment.
     Professors know what it was like to be in college and write all kinds
     of papers. They aren't trying to make your lives difficult, but it is
     their jobs to make us think and ponder about many things. Take
     your time and enjoy the paper. Make sure you answer the question
     being asked rather than rant on about something that is irrelevant
     to the prompt. -- Timothée Pizarro

Another basic tenet of good communication is clarifying the purpose of
the communication and letting that purpose shape your decisions. Your
professor wants to see you work through complex ideas and deepen your
knowledge through the process of producing the paper. Each
assignment--be it an argumentative paper, reaction paper, reflective paper,
lab report, discussion question, blog post, essay exam, project proposal, or
what have you--is ultimately about your learning. To succeed with writing
assignments (and benefit from them) you first have to understand their
learning-related purposes. As you write for the hypothetical audience of

4 | What Does the Professor Want?
peer junior scholars, you're demonstrating to your professor how far you've
gotten in analyzing your topic.

Professors don't assign writing lightly. Grading student writing is generally
the hardest, most intensive work instructors do. With every assignment they
give you, professors assign themselves many, many hours of demanding and
tedious work that has to be completed while they are also preparing for
each class meeting, advancing their scholarly and creative work, advising
students, and serving on committees. Often, they're grading your papers
on evenings and weekends because the conventional work day is already
saturated with other obligations. You would do well to approach every
assignment by putting yourself in the shoes of your instructor and asking
yourself, "Why did she give me this assignment? How does it fit into the
learning goals of the course? Why is this question/topic/problem so
important to my professor that he is willing to spend evenings and weekends
reading and commenting on several dozen novice papers on it?"

   Most instructors do a lot to make their pedagogical (teaching) goals and
expectations transparent to students: they explain the course learning goals
associated with assignments, provide grading rubrics in advance, and
describe several strategies for succeeding. Other professors ... not so much.
Some students perceive more open-ended assignments as evidence of a lazy,
uncaring, or even incompetent instructor. Not so fast! Professors certainly
vary in the quantity and specificity of the guidelines and suggestions they
distribute with each writing assignment. Some professors make a point to
give very few parameters about an assignment--perhaps just a topic and a
length requirement--and they likely have some good reasons for doing so.
Here are some possible reasons:

   They figured it out themselves when they were students. Unsurprisingly,
your instructors were generally successful students who relished the culture
and traditions of higher education so much that they strove to build an
academic career. The current emphasis on student-centered instruction is
relatively recent; your instructors much more often had professors who
adhered to the classic model of college instruction: they gave lectures
together with, perhaps, one or two exams or papers. Students were on
their own to learn the lingo and conventions of each field, to identify the
key concepts and ideas within readings and lectures, and to sleuth out
instructors' expectations for written work. Learning goals, rubrics, quizzes,
and preparatory assignments were generally rare.

                                                                      What Does the Professor Want? | 5
   They think figuring it out yourself is good for you. Because your
professors by and large succeeded in a much less supportive environment,
they appreciate how learning to thrive in those conditions gave them life-
long problem-solving skills. Many think you should be able to figure it out
yourself and that it would be good practice for you to do so. Even those who
do include a lot of guidance with writing assignments sometimes worry that
they're depriving you of an important personal and intellectual challenge.
Figuring out unspoken expectations is a valuable skill in itself.

   They're egg-heads. Many of your instructors have been so immersed in
their fields that they may struggle to remember what it was like to encounter
a wholly new discipline for the first time. The assumptions, practices, and
culture of their disciplines are like the air they breathe; so much so that it
is hard to describe to novices. They may assume that a verb like "analyze"
is self-evident, forgetting that it can mean very different things in different
fields. As a student, you voluntarily came to study with the scholars, artists,
and writers at your institution. Rightly or wrongly, the burden is ultimately
on you to meet them where they are.

   Professors value academic freedom; that is, they firmly believe that their
high-level expertise in their fields grants them the privilege of deciding what
is important to focus on and how to approach it. College professors differ
in this way from high school teachers who are usually obligated to address
a defined curriculum. Professors are often extremely wary of anything that
seems to threaten academic freedom. Some see specified learning goals and
standardized rubrics as the first step in a process that would strip higher
education of its independence, scholarly innovation, and sense of discovery.
While a standardized set of expectations and practices might make it easier
to earn a degree, it's also good to consider the benefits of the more flexible
and diversified model.

   It is understandably frustrating when you feel you don't know how to
direct your efforts to succeed with an assignment. However, except for rare
egregious situations, you would do well to assume the best of your instructor
and to appreciate the diversity of learning opportunities you have access to
in college. Like one first-year student told Keith Hjortshoj, "I think that every
course, every assignment, is a different little puzzle I have to solve. What
do I need to do here? When do I need to do it, and how long will it take?
What does this teacher expect of me?" The transparency that you get from
some professors--along with guides like this one--will be a big help to you
in situations where you have to be scrappier and more pro-active, piecing

6 | What Does the Professor Want?
together the clues you get from your professors, the readings, and other
course documents.

The prompt: what does "analyze" mean anyway?

Often, the handout or other written text explaining the assignment--what
professors call the assignment prompt--will explain the purpose of the
assignment, the required parameters (length, number and type of sources,
referencing style, etc.), and the criteria for evaluation. Sometimes,
though--especially when you are new to a field--you will encounter the
baffling situation in which you comprehend every single sentence in the
prompt but still have absolutely no idea how to approach the assignment. No
one is doing anything wrong in a situation like that. It just means that further
discussion of the assignment is in order. Here are some tips:

   Focus on the verbs. Look for verbs like "compare," "explain," "justify,"
"reflect" or the all-purpose "analyze." You're not just producing a paper as an
artifact; you're conveying, in written communication, some intellectual work
you have done. So the question is, what kind of thinking are you supposed to
do to deepen your learning?

   Put the assignment in context. Many professors think in terms of
assignment sequences. For example, a social science professor may ask you
to write about a controversial issue three times: first, arguing for one side
of the debate; second, arguing for another; and finally, from a more
comprehensive and nuanced perspective, incorporating text produced in the
first two assignments. A sequence like that is designed to help you think
through a complex issue. Another common one is a scaffolded research
paper sequence: you first propose a topic, then prepare an annotated
bibliography, then a first draft, then a final draft, and, perhaps, a reflective
paper. The preparatory assignments help ensure that you're on the right
track, beginning the research process long before the final due date, and
taking the time to consider recasting your thesis, finding additional sources,
or reorganizing your discussion.5If the assignment isn't part of a sequence,
think about where it falls in the semester, and how it relates to readings and
other assignments. Are there headings on the syllabus that indicate larger
units of material? For example, if you see that a paper comes at the end of a
three-week unit on the role of the Internet in organizational behavior, then

                                                                      What Does the Professor Want? | 7
your professor likely wants you to synthesize that material in your own way.
You should also check your notes and online course resources for any other
guidelines about the workflow. Maybe you got a rubric a couple weeks ago
and forgot about it. Maybe your instructor posted a link about "how to make
an annotated bibliography" but then forgot to mention it in class.

   Try a free-write. When I hand out an assignment, I often ask students
to do a five-minute or ten-minute free-write. A free-write is when you just
write, without stopping, for a set period of time. That doesn't sound very
"free;" it actually sounds kind of coerced. The "free" part is what you write--it
can be whatever comes to mind. Professional writers use free-writing to
get started on a challenging (or distasteful) writing task or to overcome
writers block or a powerful urge to procrastinate. The idea is that if you just
make yourself write, you can't help but produce some kind of useful nugget.
Thus, even if the first eight sentences of your free write are all variations
on "I don't understand this" or "I'd really rather be doing something else,"
eventually you'll write something like "I guess the main point of this is
..." and--booyah!--you're off and running. As an instructor, I've found that
asking students to do a brief free-write right after I hand out an assignment
generates useful clarification questions. If your instructor doesn't make time
for that in class, a quick free-write on your own will quickly reveal whether
you need clarification about the assignment and, often, what questions to
ask.

   Ask for clarification the right way. Even the most skillfully crafted
assignments may need some verbal clarification, especially because students'
familiarity with the field can vary enormously. Asking for clarification is a
good thing. Be aware, though, that instructors get frustrated when they
perceive that students want to skip doing their own thinking and instead
receive an exact recipe for an A paper. Go ahead and ask for clarification,
but try to convey that you want to learn and you're ready to work.In general,
avoid starting a question with "Do we have to ..." because I can guarantee
that your instructor is thinking, "You don't have to do crap. You're an adult.
You chose college. You chose this class. You're free to exercise your right to
fail." Similarly, avoid asking the professor about what he or she "wants." You're
not performing some service for the professor when you write a paper. What
they "want" is for you to really think about the material.

Rubrics as road maps

If a professor provides a grading rubric with an assignment prompt, thank
your lucky stars (and your professor). If the professor took the trouble to
prepare and distribute it, you can be sure that he or she will use it to grade
your paper. He or she may not go over it in class, but it's the clearest possible
statement of what the professor is looking for in the paper. If it's wordy, it
may seem like those online "terms and conditions" that we routinely accept
without reading. But you really should read it over carefully before you
begin and again as your work progresses. A lot of rubrics do have some
useful specifics. Mine, for example, often contain phrases like "makes at least
six error-free connections to concepts or ideas from the course," or "gives
thorough consideration to at least one plausible counter-argument." Even
less specific criteria (such as "incorporates course concepts" and "considers
counter-arguments") will tell you how you should be spending your writing
time.

   Even the best rubrics aren't completely transparent. They simply can't be.
Even well-written, nationally admired rubrics may still seem kind of vague.

                                                                      What Does the Professor Want? | 9
Take, for example, the Association of American Universities and Colleges
critical thinking rubric as an example, what is the real difference between
"demonstrating a thorough understanding of context, audience, and
purpose" and "demonstrating adequate consideration" of the same? It
depends on the specific context. So how can you know whether you've
done that? A big part of what you're learning, through feedback from your
professors, is to judge the quality of your writing for yourself. Your future
bosses are counting on that. At this point, it is better to think of rubrics as
roadmaps, displaying your destination, rather than a GPS system directing
every move you make.

   Behind any rubric is the essential goal of higher education: helping you
take charge of your own learning, which means writing like an independently
motivated scholar. Are you tasked with proposing a research paper topic?
Don't just tell the professor what you want to do, convince him or her of
the salience of your topic, as if you were a scholar seeking grant money.
Is it a reflection paper? Then outline both the insights you've gained and
the intriguing questions that remain, as a scholar would. Are you writing
a thesis-driven analytical paper? Then apply the concepts you've learned
to a new problem or situation. Write as if your scholarly peers around
the country are eagerly awaiting your unique insights. Descriptors like
"thoroughness" or "mastery" or "detailed attention" convey the vision of
student writers making the time and rigorous mental effort to offer
something new to the ongoing, multi-stranded academic conversation. What
your professor wants, in short, is critical thinking.

What's critical about critical thinking?

Critical thinking is one of those terms that has been used so often and in
so many different ways that if often seems meaningless. It also makes one
wonder, is there such a thing as uncritical thinking? If you aren't thinking
critically, then are you even thinking?

   Despite the prevalent ambiguities, critical thinking actually does mean
something. The Association of American Colleges and Universities usefully
defines it as "a habit of mind characterized by the comprehensive
exploration of issues, ideas, artifacts, and events before accepting or
formulating an opinion or conclusion."

10 | What Does the Professor Want?
   That definition aligns with the best description of critical thinking I ever
heard; it came from my junior high art teacher, Joe Bolger. He once asked
us, "What color is the ceiling?" In that withering tween tone, we reluctantly
replied, "Whiiiite." He then asked, "What color is it really?" We deigned to
aim our pre-adolescent eyes upwards, and eventually began to offer more
accurate answers: "Ivory?" "Yellow-ish tan." "It's grey in that corner."

   After finally getting a few thoughtful responses, Mr. Bolger said something
like, "Making good art is about drawing what you see, not what you think
you're supposed to see." The AAC&U definition, above, essentially amounts to
the same thing: taking a good look and deciding what you really think rather
than relying on the first idea or assumption that comes to mind.

   The critical thinking rubric produced by the AAC&U describes the relevant
activities of critical thinking in more detail. To think critically, one must ...

 1. "clearly state and comprehensively describe the issue or problem"
2. "independently interpret and evaluate sources"
3. "thoroughly analyze assumptions behind and context of your own or

      others' ideas"
4. "argue a complex position and one that takes counter-arguments into

      account"
5. "arrive at logical and well informed conclusions"

While you are probably used to providing some evidence for your claims,
you can see that college-level expectations go quite a bit further. When
professors assign an analytical paper, they don't just want you to formulate a
plausible-sounding argument. They want you to dig into the evidence, think
hard about unspoken assumptions and the influence of context, and then
explain what you really think and why.

   Interestingly, the AAC&U defines critical thinking as a "habit of mind"
rather than a discrete achievement. And there are at least two reasons to
see critical thinking as a craft or art to pursue rather than a task to check
off. First, the more you think critically, the better you get at it. As you get
more and more practice in closely examining claims, their underlying logic,
and alternative perspectives on the issue, it'll begin to feel automatic. You'll
no longer make or accept claims that begin with "Everyone knows that ..." or
end with "That's just human nature." Second, just as artists and craftspersons
hone their skills over a lifetime, learners continually expand their critical
thinking capacities, both through the feedback they get from others and

                                                                     What Does the Professor Want? | 11
their own reflections. Artists of all kinds find satisfaction in continually
seeking greater challenges. Continual reflection and improvement is part of
the craft.

   Critical thinking is hard work. Even those who actively choose to do it
experience it as tedious, difficult, and sometimes surprisingly emotional.
Nobel-prize winning psychologist Daniel Kahneman explains that our brains
aren't designed to think; rather, they're designed to save us from having
to think. Our brains are great at developing routines and repertoires that
enable us to accomplish fairly complex tasks like driving cars, choosing
groceries, and having a conversation without thinking consciously and
thoroughly about every move we make. Kahneman calls this "fast thinking."
"Slow thinking," which is deliberate and painstaking, is something our brains
seek to avoid. That built-in tendency can lead us astray. Kahneman and his
colleagues often used problems like this one in experiments to gauge how
people used fast and slow thinking in different contexts:

  · A bat and ball cost $1.10.
  · The bat costs one dollar more than the ball.
  · How much does the ball cost?

Most people automatically say the ball costs $0.10. However, if the bat costs
$1 more, than the bat would cost $1.10 leading to the incorrect total of
$1.20. The ball costs $0.05. Kahneman notes, "Many thousands of university
students have answered the bat-and-ball puzzle, and the results are
shocking. More than 50% of students at Harvard, MIT, and Princeton gave
the intuitive--incorrect--answer." These and other results confirm that
"many people are overconfident, prone to place too much faith in their
intuitions." Thinking critically--thoroughly questioning your immediate
intuitive responses--is difficult work, but every organization and business in
the world needs people who can do that effectively. Some students assume
that an unpleasant critical thinking experience means that they're either
doing something wrong or that it's an inherently uninteresting (and
oppressive) activity. While we all relish those times when we're pleasantly
absorbed in a complex activity (what psychologist Mihaly Czikszentmihalyi
calls "flow"), the more tedious experiences can also bring satisfaction, sort of
like a good work-out.

   Critical thinking can also be emotionally challenging, researchers have
found. Facing a new realm of uncertainty and contradiction without relying

12 | What Does the Professor Want?
on familiar assumptions is inherently anxiety-provoking because when
you're doing it, you are, by definition, incompetent. Recent research has
highlighted that both children and adults need to be able to regulate their
own emotions in order to cope with the challenges of building competence
in a new area. The kind of critical thinking your professors are looking
for--that is, pursuing a comprehensive, multi-faceted exploration in order to
arrive at an arguable, nuanced argument--is inevitably a struggle and it may
be an emotional one. Your best bet is to find ways to make those processes
as efficient, pleasant, and effective as you can.

   The demands students face are not just from school. Professional working
roles demand critical thinking, as 81% of major employers reported in an
AAC&U-commissioned survey, and it's pretty easy to imagine how critical
thinking helps one make much better decisions in all aspects of life. Embrace
it. And just as athletes, artists, and writers sustain their energy and
inspiration for hard work by interacting with others who share these
passions, look to others in the scholarly community-- your professors and
fellow students--to keep yourself engaged in these ongoing intellectual
challenges. While writing time is often solitary, it's meant to plug you into a
vibrant academic community. What your professors want, overall, is for you
to join them in asking and pursuing important questions about the natural,
social, and creative worlds.

Backpacks v. Briefcases: Steps
Toward Rhetorical Analysis

LAURA BOLIN CAROL

     Learning Objectives

         · Define Rhetorical Analysis and the rhetorical triangle
         · Identify how rhetoric is used in writing and media
         · Implement rhetorical analysis in your own reading and

             writing

First Impressions

Imagine the first day of class in first year composition at your university. The
moment your professor walked in the room, you likely began analyzing her
and making assumptions about what kind of teacher she will be. You might
have noticed what kind of bag she is carrying--a tattered leather satchel? a
hot pink polka-dotted backpack? a burgundy brief case? You probably also
noticed what she is wearing--trendy slacks and an untucked striped shirt? a
skirted suit? jeans and a tee shirt?

   It is likely that the above observations were only a few of the observations
you made as your professor walked in the room. You might have also noticed
her shoes, her jewelry, whether she wears a wedding ring, how her hair is
styled, whether she stands tall or slumps, how quickly she walks, or maybe
even if her nails are done. If you don't tend to notice any of these things
about your professors, you certainly do about the people around you--your
roommate, others in your residence hall, students you are assigned to work
14 | Backpacks v. Briefcases
with in groups, or a prospective date. For most of us, many of the people we
encounter in a given day are subject to this kind of quick analysis.

   Now as you performed this kind of analysis, you likely didn't walk through
each of these questions one by one, write out the answer, and add up the
responses to see what kind of person you are interacting with. Instead, you
quickly took in the information and made an informed, and likely somewhat
accurate, decision about that person. Over the years, as you have interacted
with others, you have built a mental database that you can draw on to make
conclusions about what a person's looks tell you about their personality.
You have become able to analyze quickly what people are saying about
themselves through the way they choose to dress, accessorize, or wear their
hair.

   We have, of course, heard that you "can't judge a book by its cover," but,
in fact, we do it all the time. Daily we find ourselves in situations where
we are forced to make snap judgments. Each day we meet different people,
encounter unfamiliar situations, and see media that asks us to do, think, buy,
and act in all sorts of ways. In fact, our saturation in media and its images
is one of the reasons why learning to do rhetorical analysis is so important.
The more we know about how to analyze situations and draw informed
conclusions, the better we can become about making savvy judgments about
the people, situations and media we encounter.

Implications of Rhetorical Analysis

Media is one of the most important places where this kind of analysis needs
to happen. Rhetoric--the way we use language and images to persuade--is
what makes media work. Think of all the media you see and hear every day:
Twitter, television shows, web pages, billboards, text messages, podcasts.
Even as you read this chapter, more ways to get those messages to you
quickly and in a persuasive manner are being developed. Media is constantly
asking you to buy something, act in some way, believe something to be
true, or interact with others in a specific manner. Understanding rhetorical
messages is essential to help us to become informed consumers, but it also
helps evaluate the ethics of messages, how they affect us personally, and how
they affect society.

   Take, for example, a commercial for men's deodorant that tells you that

                                                                                 Backpacks v. Briefcases | 15
you'll be irresistible to women if you use their product. This campaign
doesn't just ask you to buy the product, though. It also asks you to trust the
company's credibility, or ethos, and to believe the messages they send about
how men and women interact, about sexuality, and about what constitutes
a healthy body. You have to decide whether or not you will choose to buy
the product and how you will choose to respond to the messages that the
commercial sends.

   Or, in another situation, a Facebook group asks you to support health care
reform. The rhetoric in this group uses people's stories of their struggles
to obtain affordable health care. These stories, which are often heart-
wrenching, use emotion to persuade you--also called pathos. You are asked
to believe that health care reform is necessary and urgent, and you are asked
to act on these beliefs by calling your congresspersons and asking them to
support the reforms as well.

   Because media rhetoric surrounds us, it is important to understand how
rhetoric works. If we refuse to stop and think about how and why it
persuades us, we can become mindless consumers who buy into arguments
about what makes us value ourselves and what makes us happy. For example,
research has shown that only 2% of women consider themselves beautiful
("Campaign"), which has been linked to the way that the fashion industry
defines beauty. We are also told by the media that buying more stuff can
make us happy, but historical surveys show that US happiness peaked in
the 1950s, when people saw as many advertisements in their lifetime as the
average American sees in one year (Leonard).

   Our worlds are full of these kinds of social influences. As we interact with
other people and with media, we are continually creating and interpreting
rhetoric. In the same way that you decide how to process, analyze or ignore
these messages, you create them. You probably think about what your
clothing will communicate as you go to a job interview or get ready for a
date. You are also using rhetoric when you try to persuade your parents to
send you money or your friends to see the movie that interests you. When
you post to your blog or tweet you are using rhetoric. In fact, according
to rhetorician Kenneth Burke, rhetoric is everywhere: "wherever there is
persuasion, there is rhetoric. And wherever there is `meaning,' there is
`persuasion.' Food eaten and digested is not rhetoric. But in the meaning of
food there is much rhetoric, the meaning being persuasive enough for the
idea of food to be used, like the ideas of religion, as a rhetorical device of
statesmen" (71-72). In other words, most of our actions are persuasive in

16 | Backpacks v. Briefcases
nature. What we choose to wear (tennis shoes vs. flip flops), where we shop
(Whole Foods Market vs. Wal-Mart), what we eat (organic vs. fast food), or
even the way we send information (snail mail vs. text message) can work to
persuade others.

   Chances are you have grown up learning to interpret and analyze these
types of rhetoric. They become so commonplace that we don't realize how
often and how quickly we are able to perform this kind of rhetorical analysis.
When your teacher walked in on the first day of class, you probably didn't
think to yourself, "I think I'll do some rhetorical analysis on her clothing and
draw some conclusions about what kind of personality she might have and
whether I think I'll like her." And, yet, you probably were able to come up with
some conclusions based on the evidence you had.

   However, when this same teacher hands you an advertisement,
photograph or article and asks you to write a rhetorical analysis of it, you
might have been baffled or felt a little overwhelmed. The good news is
that many of the analytical processes that you already use to interpret the
rhetoric around you are the same ones that you'll use for these assignments.

The Rhetorical Situation, Or Discerning Context

One of the first places to start is context. Rhetorical messages always occur
in a specific situation or context. The president's speech might respond to
a specific global event, like an economic summit; that's part of the context.
You choose your clothing depending on where you are going or what you
are doing; that's context. A television commercial comes on during specific
programs and at specific points of the day; that's context. A billboard is
placed in a specific part of the community; that's context, too.

   In an article called "The Rhetorical Situation," Lloyd Bitzer argues that
there are three parts to understanding the context of a rhetorical moment:
exigence, audience and constraints. Exigence is the circumstance or
condition that invites a response; "imperfection marked by urgency; it is a
defect, an obstacle, something waiting to be done, a thing which is other
than it should be" (Bitzer 304). In other words, rhetorical discourse is usually
responding to some kind of problem. You can begin to understand a piece's
exigence by asking, "What is this rhetoric responding to?" "What might have

                                                                                 Backpacks v. Briefcases | 17
happened to make the rhetor (the person who creates the rhetoric) respond
in this way?"

   The exigence can be extremely complex, like the need for a new Supreme
Court justice, or it can be much simpler, like receiving an email that asks
you where you and your friends should go for your road trip this weekend.
Understanding the exigence is important because it helps you begin to
discover the purpose of the rhetoric. It helps you understand what the
discourse is trying to accomplish.

   Another part of the rhetorical context is audience, those who are the
(intended or unintended) recipients of the rhetorical message. The audience
should be able to respond to the exigence. In other words, the audience
should be able to help address the problem. You might be very frustrated
with your campus's requirement that all first-year students purchase a meal
plan for on-campus dining. You might even send an email to a good friend
back home voicing that frustration. However, if you want to address the
exigence of the meal plans, the most appropriate audience would be the
person/office on campus that oversees meal plans. Your friend back home
cannot solve the problem (though she may be able to offer sympathy or give
you some good suggestions), but the person who can change the meal plan
requirements is probably on campus. Rhetors make all sorts of choices based
on their audience. Audience can determine the type of language used, the
formality of the discourse, the medium or delivery of the rhetoric, and even
the types of reasons used the make the rhetor's argument. Understanding
the audience helps you begin to see and understand the rhetorical moves
that the rhetor makes.

   The last piece of the rhetorical situation is the constraints. The constraints
of the rhetorical situation are those things that have the power to "constrain
decision and action needed to modify the exigence" (Bitzer 306). Constraints
have a lot to do with how the rhetoric is presented. Constraints can be
"beliefs, attitudes, documents, facts, traditions, images, interests, motives"
(Bitzer 306). Constraints limit the way the discourse is delivered or
communicated. Constraints may be something as simple as your instructor
limiting your proposal to one thousand words, or they may be far more
complex like the kinds of language you need to use to persuade a certain
community.

   So how do you apply this to a piece of rhetoric? Let's say you are flipping
through a magazine, and you come across an advertisement that has a large
headline that reads "Why Some People Say `D'OH' When You Say `Homer'"

18 | Backpacks v. Briefcases
("Why"). This ad is an Ad Council public service announcement (PSA) to
promote arts education and is sponsored by Americans for the Arts and
NAMM, the trade association of the international music products industry.

   Since you want to understand more about what this ad means and what it
wants you to believe or do, you begin to think about the rhetorical situation.
You first might ask, "what is the ad responding to? What problem does
it hope to address?" That's the exigence. In this case, the exigence is the
cutting of arts funding and children's lack of exposure to the arts. According
to the Ad Council's website, "the average kid is provided insufficient time to
learn and experience the arts. This PSA campaign was created to increase
involvement in championing arts education both in and out of school"
("Arts"). The PSA is responding directly to the fact that kids are not getting
enough arts education.

   Then you might begin to think about to whom the Ad Council targeted the
ad. Unless you're a parent, you are probably not the primary audience. If you
continued reading the text of the ad, you'd notice that there is information
to persuade parents that the arts are helpful to their children and to let them
know how to help their children become more involved with the arts. The
ad tells parents that "the experience will for sure do more than entertain
them. It'll build their capacity to learn more. In fact, the more art kids get,
the smarter they become in subjects like math and science. And that's reason
enough to make a parent say, `D'oh!,' For Ten Simple Ways to instill art in
your kids' lives visit AmericansForTheArts.org" ("Why"). Throughout the text
of the ad, parents are told both what to believe about arts education and how
to act in response to the belief.

   There also might be a secondary audience for this ad--people who are
not the main audience of the ad but might also be able to respond to
the exigence. For example, philanthropists who could raise money for arts
education or legislators who might pass laws for arts funding or to require
arts education in public schools could also be intended audiences for this ad.

   Finally, you might want to think about the constraints or the limitations on
the ad. Sometimes these are harder to get at, but we can guess a few things.
One constraint might be the cost of the ad. Different magazines charge
differently for ad space as well as placement within the magazine, so the Ad
Council could have been constrained by how much money they wanted to
spend to circulate the ad. The ad is also only one page long, so there might
have been a limitation on the amount of space for the ad. Finally, on the Ad
Council's webpage, they list the requirements for organizations seeking the

                                                                                 Backpacks v. Briefcases | 19
funding and support of the Ad Council. There are twelve criteria, but here
are a few:

 1. The sponsor organization must be a private non-profit 501(c)3
      organization, private foundation, government agency or coalition of
      such groups.

2. The issue must address the Ad Council's focus on Health & Safety,
      Education, or Community. Applications which benefit children are
      viewed with favor--as part of the Ad Council's Commitment to Children.

3. The issue must offer a solution through an individual action.
4. The effort must be national in scope, so that the message has relevance

      to media audiences in communities throughout the nation. ("Become")

Each of these criteria helps to understand the limitations on both who can
participate as rhetor and what can be said.

   The exigence, audience and constraints are only one way to understand
the context of a piece of rhetoric, and, of course, there are other ways to
get at context. Some rhetoricians look at subject, purpose, audience and
occasion. Others might look at the "rhetorical triangle" of writer, reader, and
purpose.

   An analysis using the rhetorical triangle would ask similar questions about
audience as one using the rhetorical situation, but it would also ask
questions about the writer and the purpose of the document. Asking
questions about the writer helps the reader determine whether she or he is
credible and knowledgeable. For example, the Ad Council has been creating
public service announcements since 1942 ("Loose Lips Sink Ships," anyone?)
and is a non-profit agency. They also document their credibility by showing
the impact of their campaigns in several ways: "Destruction of our forests
by wildfires has been reduced from 22 million acres to less than 8.4 million
acres per year, since our Forest Fire Prevention campaign began" and "6,000
Children were paired with a mentor in just the first 18 months of our
mentoring campaign" ("About"). Based on this information, we can assume
that the Ad Council is a credible rhetor, and whether or not we agree with
the rhetoric they produce, we can probably assume it contains reliable
information. Asking questions about the next part of the rhetorical triangle,
the purpose of a piece of rhetoric, helps you understand what the rhetor
is trying to achieve through the discourse. We can discern the purpose by
asking questions like "what does the rhetor want me to believe after seeing

20 | Backpacks v. Briefcases
this message?" or "what does the rhetor want me to do?" In some ways,
the purpose takes the exigence to the next step. If the exigence frames the
problem, the purpose frames the response to that problem.

   The rhetorical situation and rhetorical triangle are two ways to begin to
understand how the rhetoric functions within the context you find it. The
key idea is to understand that no rhetorical performance takes place in a
vacuum. One of the first steps to understanding a piece of rhetoric is to look
at the context in which it takes place. Whatever terminology you (or your
instructor) choose, it is a good idea to start by locating your analysis within
a rhetorical situation.

The Heart of the Matter--The Argument

The rhetorical situation is just the beginning of your analysis, though. What
you really want to understand is the argument--what the rhetor wants you
to believe or do and how he or she goes about that persuasion. Effective
argumentation has been talked about for centuries. In the fourth century
BCE, Aristotle was teaching the men of Athens how to persuade different
kinds of audiences in different kinds of rhetorical situations. Aristotle
articulated three "artistic appeals" that a rhetor could draw on to make a
case--logos, pathos, and ethos.

   Logos is commonly defined as argument from reason, and it usually
appeals to an audience's intellectual side. As audiences we want to know
the "facts of the matter," and logos helps present these--statistics, data, and
logical statements. For example, on our Homer ad for the arts, the text tells
parents that the arts will "build their capacity to learn more. In fact, the
more art kids get, the smarter they become in subjects like math and science"
("Why"). You might notice that there aren't numbers or charts here, but
giving this information appeals to the audience's intellectual side.

   That audience can see a continuation of the argument on the Ad Council's
webpage, and again much of the argument appeals to logos and draws on
extensive research that shows that the arts do these things:

  · Allow kids to express themselves creatively and bolster their self-
      confidence.

  · Teach kids to be more tolerant and open.

                                                                                 Backpacks v. Briefcases | 21
  · Improve kids' overall academic performance.
  · Show that kids actively engaged in arts education are likely to have

      higher SAT scores than those with little to no arts involvement.
  · Develop skills needed by the 21st century workforce: critical thinking,

      creative problem solving, effective communication, teamwork and
      more.
  · Keep students engaged in school and less likely to drop out. ("Arts")

Each bullet above is meant to intellectually persuade parents that they need
to be more intentional in providing arts education for their children.

   Few of us are persuaded only with our mind, though. Even if we
intellectually agree with something, it is difficult to get us to act unless we
are also persuaded in our heart. This kind of appeal to emotion is called
pathos. Pathetic appeals (as rhetoric that draws on pathos is called) used
alone without logos and ethos can come across as emotionally manipulative
or overly sentimental, but are very powerful when used in conjunction with
the other two appeals.

   Emotional appeals can come in many forms--an anecdote or narrative,
an image such as a photograph, or even humor. For example, on their web
campaign, People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) uses an image
of a baby chick and of Ronald McDonald wielding a knife to draw attention
to their Chicken McCruely UnHappy Meal. These images are meant to evoke
an emotional response in the viewer and, along with a logos appeal with
the statistics about how cruelly chickens are treated, persuade the viewer to
boycott McDonalds.

   Pathos can also be a very effective appeal if the rhetor has to persuade
the audience in a very short amount of time, which is why it is used heavily
in print advertisements, billboards, or television commercials. An investment
company will fill a 30-second commercial with images of families and
couples enjoying each other, seeming happy, and surrounded by wealth to
persuade you to do business with them.

   The 30-second time spot does not allow them to give the 15-year growth
of each of their funds, and pathetic appeals will often hold our interest much
longer than intellectual appeals.

   The ad promoting the importance of art uses humor to appeal to the
audience's emotional side. By comparing the epic poet Homer to Homer
Simpson and his classic "d'oh!" the ad uses humor to draw people into their
argument about the arts. The humor continues as they ask parents if their

22 | Backpacks v. Briefcases
kids know the difference between the Homers, "The only Homer some kids
know is the one who can't write his own last name" ("Why"). The ad also
appeals to emotion through its language use (diction), describing Homer as
"one very ancient dude," and describing The Odyssey as "the sequel" to The
Iliad. In this case, the humor of the ad, which occurs in the first few lines,
is meant to draw the reader in and help them become interested in the
argument before the ad gets to the logos, which is in the last few lines of the
ad.

   The humor also makes the organization seem real and approachable,
contributing to the ethos. The humor might lead you to think that Americans
for the Arts is not a stuffy bunch of suits, but an organization you can relate
to or one that has a realistic understanding of the world. Ethos refers to the
credibility of the rhetor--which can be a person or an organization. A rhetor
can develop credibility in many ways. The tone of the writing and whether
that tone is appropriate for the context helps build a writer's ethos, as does
the accuracy of the information or the visual presentation of the rhetoric.

   In the Homer ad, the ethos is built in several ways. The simple, humorous
and engaging language, such as "Greek Gods. Achilles Heel. Trojan Horse.
All of these icons are brought to us by one very ancient dude--Homer. In
The Iliad and its sequel, The Odyssey, he presented Greek mythology in
everyday language" ("Why") draws the audience in and helps the tone of the
ad seem very approachable. Also, the knowledge of Greek mythology and
the information about how the arts help children--which also contribute to
the logos appeal--make the ad seem credible and authoritative. However,
the fact that the ad does not use too many statistics or overly technical
language also contributes to the ethos of the ad because often sounding too
intellectual can come across as pompous or stuffy.

   Aristotle's artistic appeals are not the only way to understand the
argument of rhetoric. You might choose to look at the claim or the unstated
assumptions of a piece; someone else might consider the visual appeal of
the rhetoric, like the font, page layout, types of paper, or images; another
person might focus on the language use and the specific word choice and
sentence structure of a piece. Logos, pathos, and ethos can provide a nice
framework for analysis, but there are numerous ways to understand how a
piece of rhetoric persuades (or fails to persuade).

   Looking at the context and components of a piece of rhetoric often isn't
enough, though, because it is important to draw conclusions about the
rhetoric--does it successfully respond to the exigence? Is it an ethical

                                                                                Backpacks v. Briefcases | 23
approach? Is it persuasive? These kinds of questions let you begin to create
your own claims, your own rhetoric, as you take a stand on what other
people say, do, or write.

Beginning to Analyze

Once you have established the context for the rhetoric you are analyzing,
you can begin to think about how well it fits into that context. You've
probably been in a situation where you arrived way underdressed for an
occasion. You thought that the dinner was just a casual get together with
friends; it turned out to be a far more formal affair, and you felt very out of
place. There are also times when discourse fails to respond to the situation
well--it doesn't fit. On the other hand, successful discourses often respond
very well to the context. They address the problem, consider the audience's
needs, provide accurate information, and have a compelling claim. One of
the reasons you work to determine the rhetorical situation for a piece of
discourse is to consider whether it works within that context. You can begin
this process by asking questions like:

  · Does the rhetoric address the problem it claims to address?
  · Is the rhetoric targeted at an audience who has the power to make

      change?
  · Are the appeals appropriate to the audience?
  · Does the rhetor give enough information to make an informed

      decision?
  · Does the rhetoric attempt to manipulate in any way (by giving

      incomplete/inaccurate information or abusing the audience's
      emotions)?
  · What other sub-claims do you have to accept to understand the
      rhetor's main claim? (For example, in order to accept the Ad Council's
      claim that the arts boost math and science scores, you first have to
      value the boosting of those scores.)
  · What possible negative effects might come from this rhetoric?

Rhetorical analysis asks how discourse functions in the setting in which it
is found. In the same way that a commercial for denture cream seems very

24 | Backpacks v. Briefcases
out of place when aired during a reality television show aimed at teenagers,
rhetoric that does not respond well to its context often fails to persuade. In
order to perform analysis, you must understand the context and then you
must carefully study the ways that the discourse does and does not respond
appropriately to that context.

   The bottom line is that the same basic principles apply when you look
at any piece of rhetoric (your instructor's clothing, an advertisement, the
president's speech): you need to consider the context and the argument. As
you begin to analyze rhetoric, there are lots of different types of rhetoric you
might encounter in a college classroom, such as a:

  · Political cartoon
  · Wikipedia entry
  · Scholarly article
  · Bar Graph
  · Op-Ed piece in the newspaper
  · Speech
  · YouTube video
  · Book chapter
  · Photograph
  · PowerPoint Presentation

All of the above types of discourse try to persuade you. They may ask you
to accept a certain kind of knowledge as valid, they may ask you to believe
a certain way, or they may ask you to act. It is important to understand
what a piece of rhetoric is asking of you, how it tries to persuade you,
and whether that persuasion fits within the context you encounter it in.
Rhetorical analysis helps you answer those questions.

Implications of Rhetorical Analysis, Or Why Do This
Stuff Anyway?

So you might be wondering if you know how to do this analysis already--you

need to know how to do more formal analysis? How does this matter outside
a college classroom?

   Well, first of all, much of the reading and learning in college requires some
level of rhetorical analysis: as you read a textbook chapter to prepare for
a quiz, it is helpful to be able to distill the main points quickly; when you
read a journal article for a research paper, it is necessary to understand
the scholar's thesis; when you watch a video in class, it is useful to be
able to understand how the creator is trying to persuade you. But college
is not the only place where an understanding of how rhetoric works is
important. You will find yourself in many situations--from boardrooms to
your children's classrooms or churches to city council meetings where you
need to understand the heart of the arguments being presented.

   One final example: in November 2000, Campbell's Soup Company
launched a campaign to show that many of their soups were low in calories
and showed pre-pubescent girls refusing to eat because they were "watching
their weight." A very small organization called Dads and Daughters, a group
that fights advertising that targets girls with negative body images,
contacted Campbell's explaining the problems they saw in an ad that
encouraged young girls to be self-conscious about their weight, and asked
Campbell's to pull the ad. A few days later, Campbell's Vice President for
Marketing and Corporate Communications called. One of the dads says, "the
Vice President acknowledged he had received their letter, reviewed the ad
again, saw their point, and was pulling the ad," responding to a "couple
of guys writing a letter" ("Media"). Individuals who understand rhetorical
analysis and act to make change can have a tremendous influence on their
world.

Murder! Rhetorically Speaking

JANET BOYD

     Learning Objectives

         · Find the rhetorical situation by/after reading a piece
         · Identify and use tone, voice, and style in your own work
         · Recognize the consequence of tone, voice, and style in the

             works of others

The college where I first started teaching writing called its freshman
composition course "Logic and Rhetoric" after two of the three arts of
discourse in the classical tradition (the third being grammar).* While the
students could easily explain what logic is, they struggled with the definition
of rhetoric; most of their responses were more or less a politer version of
this succinct definition offered by one brave student: "bullshit." While I was
surprised that he dared say such a word in class, and I am equally surprised
that our publishers have so kindly agreed to print it, this offensive word so
directly and memorably brings us to the crux of the matter: that choosing
how to express your meaning is every bit as important as the message itself,
which is really what rhetoric is. Every time you go to write anything (and
every time you open your mouth), whether actively conscious of the purpose
or not, you are making decisions about which words to use and what tone
to establish as you order your thoughts based upon what is appropriate for
your intended audience in that context.

   Determined as I was to enlighten the class about the more positive and
powerful aspects of rhetoric, we used no textbook in the program that could
edify us. This turned out to be a good thing, for, out of necessity, I invented
a simple, little exercise for them that you will participate in here, now,
and dazzle yourself with the rhetorical skills you already possess, skills that

28 | Murder! Rhetorically Speaking
are crucial for your development as an academic writer. For purposes of
comparison, I have also included responses from other student writers for
you to consider--all of whom surprised themselves with their own rhetorical
range and ability. First, I will give you five simple facts, nothing but the facts,
as I did my students:

          Who: Mark Smith
          What: Murdered
          Where: Parking garage
          When: June 6, 2010; 10:37 p.m.
          How: Multiple stab wounds

You might read such straightforward facts in a short newspaper article or
hear them in a brief news report on the radio; if the person was not famous,
the narrative might sound like this: Mark Smith was found stabbed to death
at 10:37 p.m. on June 6th, in the local parking garage. Next, imagine that
you are the detective called out to investigate the crime scene, which will,
of course, demand that you also write and file a report of your findings. (In
fact, many people who go into law enforcement are shocked to discover how
much writing such a job regularly entails.)

   Take a moment to visualize the five facts, and then pick up a pen or turn to
your keyboard and write for five or so minutes as if you were that detective.
In writing up the case (whoops, I have given you a clue), you may add or
invent as many details as you see fit, but you may not alter the given facts. Go
ahead. Get started on writing your report of the murder scene. Then come
back and read the next section.

Getting in Touch with Your Inner Detective

Welcome back. While it is usually the detective who asks all the questions,

                                                                      Murder! Rhetorically Speaking | 29
we will proceed first with me grilling you not about the murder but about
your report:

  · How does it begin? Where does it end?
  · What types of details did you find yourself adding? Why? What details

      did you omit? Why?
  · What kind of words did you choose?
  · What tone did you take? (I will admit, tone can be a tricky thing to

      describe; it is best done by searching for a specific adjective that
      describes a feeling or an attitude such as "pretentious," "somber,"
      "buoyant," "melancholic," "didactic," "humorous," etc.).
  · How did you order your information?
  · And, since I am working under the assumption that no undergraduates
      have yet had careers in law enforcement, how did you know how to
      write like a detective would in the first place?

The answer I get to my last question invariably is "from television, of course,"
nowadays particularly from shows such as the fictitious CSI: Crime Scene
Investigation and reality-based The First 48. From such shows, and from
detective movies or fiction, we get a glimpse not only into the work
detectives are likely to do but also the language they choose. Gradually, and
ever so subtly, we internalize this detectivespeak, which is more than just
the jargon they use. Jargon is the terminology used by those in a particular
profession or group to facilitate clear and precise communication, but this
rhetorical tool is not limited just to the professional world. For example,
anyone who participates in a sport uses the lingo specific to that sport,
which is learned by doing. Doctors use medical jargon and lawyers use
legal jargon, and they go to school specifically to learn the terms and
abbreviations of their professions; so do detectives.

   If you use any kind of slang words, you, too, use jargon, but if you studied
these words in a book, they are probably not very hip or at least not very au
courant. For slang is different in that it maintains a currency in a dual sense:
it strives to be current, and it circulates among a select network of users.
Jargon does not fall victim to fashion so easily as slang does, but it does have
a similar effect in that they both exclude those outside of the community
who do not understand the meanings of the words. And so purposefully in
the case of slang and not necessarily purposefully in the case of jargon, the
initiated constitute an "insiders club" for whom they themselves are their

30 | Murder! Rhetorically Speaking
intended and best audience. When you write an academic paper, you are
practicing how to use the jargon you have internalized through studying that
discipline as you write for professors and students within that field.

   Getting back to the detective writing . . . although you probably didn't
think much about whom your audience would be, who would read such a
report, when you got started you probably had no problem deciding how to
begin your narrative: Am I right that it starts with you arriving at the crime
scene, and that you wrote in first person? Every piece of writing needs a
starting point and a perspective, it is true, and the demands of the genre--in
this instance the reports of detectives--shaped the very first words of your
response. This is why I say with confidence that you worked your magic
with more than just detective jargon. As much as I am aware of my audience
here--so much so that I am trying to engage in dialog with you through
my casual tone, my informal language, and my addressing you directly by
asking you questions and anticipating your responses--ultimately the format
dictates that our "conversation" remain one-sided.

   As much as I wish I could chat with you about the report you wrote, I
cannot. Instead, I offer you here the "detective reports" of students much like
you, students taking freshman composition classes who were given just the
five facts about the murder, to present some rhetoric in action.

   "I arrived at the crime scene at roughly 22:45 (10:45) p.m.," writes Jeannette
Olsavsky; "headquarters had received a phone call at 10:37 p.m. about a dead
body lying stabbed in the parking garage on Franklin Ave." Ilya Imyanitov
starts his report with: "My partner and I received a phone call at 11:02 p.m.
from dispatch that a body was found in the parking garage on 34th and 5th.
We were the first to arrive on the scene." Here's one more example: "On
Saturday, June 6th, at 10:37 p.m., the Montclair Police Department received
an anonymous call regarding a body found in the Hawk Parking Garage.
Detectives Dan Barry, Randy Johnson, and I, Tamara Morales, were called
to the scene. Upon arrival, we noted the cadaver was facing down and had
multiple stab wounds."

   Did you notice all of the things that these reports do similarly? Mere
coincidence? I think not. They obey the conventions of the genre (which is
a word we will gradually define). All of these opening sentences note some
kind of phone call that gets them to the scene of the crime, all of them
establish more specifically the location, all of them note precise times (which
could be of significance), all of them are in first person, and two of our
detectives work with partners. While the similarities continue to multiply

                                                                       Murder! Rhetorically Speaking | 31
as the three reports unfold, we can discern from these few sentences alone
that writers attend to how they order their information and that writers can
aspire towards objectivity even when writing in the first person.

   Since detectives are trained observers who search for clues to aid in the
investigation of a crime, they provide written, first-hand accounts of the
tangible evidence they find. They also speculate as to what might have
motivated the criminal to perpetrate the crime. In short, detectives have
an agenda: in their reports, our three student-detectives try to identify
the victim, establish injuries and cause of death, and look for signs of foul
play. They also hope to interview witnesses to corroborate their findings,
and one lucky detective does. Detective Imyanitov "took down a statement
from the [garage] attendant, Michael Portnick." Portnick "states that he was
making his rounds as usual," and "he remembers checking his phone" when
"he discovered a body that appeared to be stabbed to death." Why such
hesitation, Detective Imyanitov? You can tell from the verbs he uses (such
as Portnick "states" and "remembers," and the body "appeared") that he is
recording a version of the events he has not yet verified, and so he infuses
his narrative with words that establish room for doubt. Through his diction,
or choice of words, Imyanitov establishes a tone for his report that is formal,
objective, inquisitive, and tentative all at the same time. Not surprisingly,
Olsavsky's and Morales's reports adopt much the same tone, and all three
also end the same way: with the call for a "full investigation" to ensue based
on the preliminary findings.

   These three detective reports, in fact all the detective reports I've ever
collected from students, discuss to some degree the nature of the fatal
wounds Mark Smith received. Now shift gears slightly to imagine that you
are the coroner who is on duty in the city morgue when Mark's body arrives.
The coroner must do a full examination of the corpse and, what else, write up
a report (trust me, there are few jobs out there that do not require writing).
Visualize yourself in your new occupation, recall the "five facts," and then
take five minutes to write up your findings as a coroner might (remember,
you may add or invent as many details as you like, but you may not alter the
given facts). Really--go, write, and come back.

32 | Murder! Rhetorically Speaking
Cultivating Your Inner Coroner

Your first thoughts probably weren't so much about audience this time,
either; you were probably thinking hard about jargon, though. You know
(from CSI or elsewhere) that coroners use very specific terminology that
allows for precise and concise description, so to write a plausible report you
had to muster up as many factual and pseudo-medical words as possible.
In other words, your freedom to select words--to choose your diction--was
limited greatly by the jargon of this profession, which means that the tone
was also mostly dictated. Because a detective and a coroner have similar
agendas in that they report causes, effects, and facts, and because they
often present to similar audiences, their reports often assume a similar tone
that is informative, authoritative, and forensic. But the tone of the coroner's
report is ultimately much more technical and is prescribed by the medical
community. Every discipline has its own range of acceptable jargon, diction,
and tone to be learned and applied.

   So how does your report read? If it is like that of my students, you began
it much like you did your detective report with the five, simple facts relating
to the crime. After that, however, it diverges. It becomes focused on the
body alone and for good reason--that's all you've got to look at! Here I'd
like to answer some relevant questions I asked but never addressed with
regard to your detective report: what details did you include or omit and
why? Of course the coroner cannot and does not include details about the
parking garage, but what would stop him/her from recording whether Mark
Smith was handsome or not, or whether the tattoo on Smith's calf was cool
or comical, or whether he reminded the coroner of his/her brother-in-
law? You think this a dumb question, I know, because such subjectivity and
personal observations do not belong in an official, objective report. Perhaps
the question is dumb, but thinking about why it is dumb is not: even though
you are not a real coroner (you just play one here) you have an awareness not
only of what the genre demands but also what it rejects. You have a sense
of what is appropriate in this context, and in many, many other rhetorical
contexts, including when you assume the role of a student writing an essay
(we are getting closer to a definition of genre).

   What surprises me most about all the times I've asked students to write
like coroners do is not that they can, even though this is the most difficult
exercise in the group, but that they do not include the simplest

                                                                      Murder! Rhetorically Speaking | 33
information--a basic, physical description of Mark Smith. They tend to jump
right into gory descriptions of what got him to the morgue but not anything
like "The subject is a Caucasian male, is in his early thirties, about five feet,
ten inches tall and 175 pounds; he has brown eyes and shoulder-length, dark
brown hair. He has a birthmark on his left forearm and a two-inch scar in the
vicinity of where his appendix would be." Maybe students are just too eager
to cover the "five facts" I have presented them; or maybe it is that they are
not so eager to ponder Mark Smith as a real but dead person with personal
features; or both.

   After reporting the five facts in the first sentence of his coroner's report,
and adding that Mark Smith was found by an off-duty police officer, Brett
Magura writes:

       After post-mortem evaluation, it can be seen that only one of the
       six stab wounds was fatal. This stab came from behind, through
       the back and in between the ribs, puncturing the heart and causing
       internal bleeding. The fatal blow appeared to follow an effort to run
       away after the first five wounds occurred to the hands and arms.
       The wounds on the hands and arms are determined to be defensive
       wounds.

Magura concludes his report with the contents of Smith's stomach and a
blood-alcohol level assessment. Like many students, Magura identifies the
locations of the wounds and the exact cause of death, and like many students
he admirably gropes for the words that coroners use. Instead of "back" or
"behind," he might have substituted "posterior" and thrown in some words
like "anterior" or "lateral" or "laceration," I would venture, but his report is on
target even if his and my jargon would benefit from some medical schooling.

   Lecille Desampardo is the only student I've known to give the report
a case number, "Murder Case #123," which immediately suggests that her
report is official and conforms to standards we would also find in Cases 1
through 122. Even better, one could easily keep track of and even reference
such a report, which would be important if it should be needed as forensic
evidence. Desampardo finds "remnants of some kind of black grease" in
the stab wounds, and upon the miracles of further lab testing links it to
the "Nissan Pathfinder owned by the victim." Coupled with the "irregular
shape" of the stab wounds, the murder weapon was a "monkey wrench" she
concludes. What kind of weapon did you deduce killed Mark Smith? Was it a

34 | Murder! Rhetorically Speaking
hunting knife or a butcher's knife or scissors or something else? Does your
report work to support that assumption? Chances are you found yourself
knowing exactly what content to include but were frustrated at not having
the 94 Janet Boyd exact words you desired at your disposal. In this rhetorical
instance, you even know what it is you don't know (which, unfortunately, can
also be the case when you are first learning academic writing).

   On the other hand, perhaps these words came easy for Kristin Flynn who
writes,

       Mark Smith was an amazing father, husband and good friend. His
       unfortunate murder and untimely demise come as a shock to all who
       knew him. Mark and I go way back [ . . . ]. His memory will be forever
       treasured, and it is truly a shame to have to say goodbye to him today.

Wait a minute? What happened to the knife, the parking garage, and the stab
wounds? One would hope that such graphic details wouldn't make their way
into a eulogy.

   Yes, the next exercise I want you to write is a short eulogy for Mark Smith,
which is a speech of remembrance delivered at a funeral. This exercise is
perhaps one of the easier ones to write, but that is only if you liked Mark
Smith and can write in honesty; imagine how difficult it would be if you
didn't like him? So return now to the "five facts," invent the details that you
need, and work for five minutes or so to fulfill the rhetorical demands of the
genre of the eulogy (which I hope you'll never get much practice in).

Learning How to Say Goodbye

Many students get flustered with this exercise because they feel compelled
to include all "five facts" while they intuitively know that an actual eulogy
would not; the instructions I give require no such thing. I write "intuitively"
here because, again, I cannot imagine that many of you are trained to write
eulogies, and so you proceeded based on the knowledge you have
internalized from your religion or culture. The example of the eulogy
highlights very well the decisions all writers must make about what to
include and what to omit based upon the expectations of the audience
for whom they write (including an academic audience). You were probably

                                                                      Murder! Rhetorically Speaking | 35
rather surprised to read just on the heels of the coroners' reports an excerpt
of the eulogy Flynn penned because you were expecting more blood and
guts. It is a good time to admit that I did this on purpose, and that in my
classes I aim for this element of surprise as well; my students don't know
that they have been assigned different writing tasks relating to the facts of
Mark Smith's murder, and when they read them aloud without identifying
the piece the contrasts stand sharp. After only a few sentences, though,
the students recognize what genre it is they hear because of the various
rhetorical cues they so quickly discern.

   So what did you include in your eulogy? Of the five facts, you probably
mentioned Mark Smith by his whole name at first, and thereafter by his first
name to foster a sense of familiarity, and then did your best to avoid the
other four facts entirely, facts the detectives must write about so extensively.
Flynn mentions the "unfortunate murder" in her eulogy, which could be
considered daring, but she does so to commiserate with others in their
sense of "shock." Notice, though, that she doesn't say that Mark Smith "died"
or "croaked" or was "offed"; okay, clearly "croaked" and "offed" are too
indelicate, but why not "died," which seems innocuous enough? She writes of
Mark's "untimely demise," which is a euphemism.

   When people replace a word that can be considered offensive,
discomforting, or controversial with another term to make it seem less so,
they have chosen a euphemism. Death provides an excellent example of
something that makes us uncomfortable, and so we have many euphemistic
synonyms for dying such as "to pass on," "to leave this world," "to be with
God," "to breathe one's last," and "to go to a better place." Interestingly
enough, we have many irreverent synonyms for dying in addition to "croak,"
such as "to kick the bucket," "to bite the big one," "to push up the daisies,"
or "to buy the farm," which are colloquial and try to bring humor to this
bothersome subject. Colloquial refers to language that is informal and
usually spoken but not written (such as "ain't" and "gonna"). These particular
death colloquialisms can also be considered dysphemisms in that they
exaggerate rather than soften what could be offensive. While colloquialisms
and dysphemisms usually do not belong in academic writing, euphemism
can serve its purpose depending on your tone.

   But enough talk about talk. Let's get back to the writing. Adi Baruch wrote
her eulogy in the form of letter (also known as an epistle) to Mark Smith,
which is a bit of a departure from the genre in its strictest sense, but

36 | Murder! Rhetorically Speaking
she nevertheless avoids mentioning anything about the murder while still
conveying that he has, well, left us:

       Whoever knew quite how cruel life could be? Surely, neither you nor
       I. We've known each other for the past ten years, always growing
       closer. Unfortunately enough, for me and many others, your life has
       come to an end. We can no longer continue to make great memories
       together. . . . Your memory will live on with every life you've ever
       touched.

Does your eulogy sound like this? Is it written in first-person, is it evasive
of specifics but generally positive, is the diction a bit stilted and the tone
sentimental, wistful, and poignant? Does yours, like hers, eventually end with
saying good-bye to the deceased (aka the dead person)?

   Or does your eulogy sound more like this one from Micheal Lynch:

       For those of you who knew Mark Smith as I did, I am sure you are
       not the least bit surprised to hear that he was murdered and quite
       violently with multiple stab wounds. Mark was our friend and our
       benefactor, but of course we all know he was a low-life criminal. With
       the number of enemies Mark made, I'm sure that the only surprise is
       that it took them until 10:37 p.m. on Saturday, June 6th to catch up
       with his sorry butt. It is ironic, you must agree, that he "bought it" in
       a parking garage since the only thing he ever did in a parking garage
       is rip off the things that everybody who parked there had brought!
       Yes, we'll miss you Mark and those little surprises he used to bring to
       each of us. Rest in peace, buddy!

When we read this one aloud in class, much laughter broke out. Why is
it funny? Because it runs contrary to our established expectations, and
incongruity is often a source of humor. The students recognized that while
Lynch conforms to the rhetorical conventions of eulogy-- he writes in first-
person, remembers the deceased fondly, and says goodbye--he also works
against the conventions of the genre in terms of content, diction, and tone.
In short, this incongruity makes the piece ironic, which Lynch might be
trying to flag when he points to the situational irony of the location of the
murder.

   I imagine that Lynch, like many students, assumed he had to work in all
"five-facts" and saw his way to a very creative solution; knowing that such

                                                                       Murder! Rhetorically Speaking | 37
facts don't belong in a eulogy and wanting to respond to the assignment
as he interpreted it, Lynch turned the genre on its head. He showed savvy
in writing it and his classmates in laughing at it, for they all recognized
how much one can push or play with a given genre and still maintain its
identifiable qualities. The content is graphic, the diction is crass, and the
tone is irreverent. Nonetheless, it remains a eulogy, one that would likely get
recited among friends (but not family) with shots of whiskey in hand.

   Herein we might find our definition of genre, which by necessity remains
perpetually loose: when the traits or attributes considered normal to or
typical of a particular kind of creative piece, such as in literature, film, or
music, make it that kind and not another. For example, we know horror
films when we see them and we recognize classical music when we hear it
because we can classify these things according to the conventions of their
genres. And we can identify the genre of the piece I am writing for you as an
expository essay with its thesis, its body paragraphs of support and detail,
and, as you will see, its conclusion, even if my tone is playful.

   Whether or not Mark Smith was a low-life, petty thief as Lynch makes him
out to be, the person who murdered him is most definitely a criminal, which
brings us to our last rhetorical scenario. Your final task is to write a closing
argument as if you were the prosecutor addressing the jury who will find the
accused murderer guilty or not. Go ahead. Put on a suit and become a lawyer
(in this profession, if you are not off researching you are usually writing), and
then come back to see how your closing argument compares with the others.

Learning to Love Your Inner Lawyer

Notice how I kindly provided a big clue to get you started, since you've had
so much to think about already. When you wrote the eulogy I did not call
attention to the fact that your audience was friends and family, for whom you
wrote nonetheless, but here I do remind you that you were to address the
jury. This is your signal not to soften the blow of the loss of Mark Smith for
your audience, as you did in the eulogy, but to write it big, to write it bold . . .
perhaps to the point where you could be accused of exaggeration (in writing
aka hyperbole). You must play upon your audience's heartstrings here, too, of
course, but you must balance it with cold, hard, irrefutable facts as per the
genre's demands. How did you begin?

38 | Murder! Rhetorically Speaking
   Despite my clue, only some of your peers start their closing arguments as
Christopher Traina and Ricardo Ataide did with the requisite and respectful
"ladies and gentlemen of the jury" (Traina did admit that both of his parents
are attorneys, but it is unlikely he attends any of the closing arguments they
might make!). What effect does this address have? It alerts the members
of the jury that what follows is directed specifically to them, reminds them
of their important role, and helps to establish a rapport between them and
the attorney. The closing argument is a good example of how the different
rhetorical tools available carry different weight given the rhetorical
situation.

   Although awareness of audience is always hugely important when one
goes to write anything, a direct address is not, which we see with the lack
thereof in the detective's and coroner's reports. They write for an implied
audience (as you do in your academic writing), which is more often than
not comprised of attorneys and, funnily enough, eventually of judges and
juries (which is why their work is ultimately forensic). Furthermore, when
it comes time to communicate to the jury how Mark Smith was murdered,
the attorney would do best to translate the medical jargon of the coroner's
report into layperson's terms, or language for people who are not experts;
plain, simple diction would prevail over sophisticated jargon in this context.
And while the detective's and the coroner's reports should be devoid of
emotion, just as the eulogy should be saturated with it, the attorney aims
to persuade the jury with both objective facts, what Aristotle calls logos,
and simmering emotion, what he calls pathos; and lastly, depending on the
lawyer, the jury will also likely be persuaded by his/her ethos, or credible
character.

   Appealing to his jury in first person, Traina states for "what reasons" the
"accused" committed the "heinous murder . . . you and I will never know.
But I do ask you to do what is right. That is when you go to deliberate,
you remember the grieving family. Remember the horrendous photos.
Remember the lack of emotion on the accused's face. You must remember
all of these facts, find the defendant guilty, and put him in jail where he
will not be a danger to society. I thank you for your time and hope for
your diligence in [reaching] your verdict." Traina charges the jury with the
moral duty to do what is right based on the evidence provided while he also
beseeches them--in short sentences of parallel form that one can imagine
him articulating very slowly and deliberately--to dwell not only on the
family's agony but on the defendant's lack of remorse. This appeal to emotion

                                                                      Murder! Rhetorically Speaking | 39
(aka pathos) doesn't alter the facts per se, but it provides a less than neutral
lens, a bias, through which the attorney hopes the jury will view them
(although in academic writing one is often encouraged to avoid such bias).
The tone Traina establishes is one full of urgency and gravity for the case and
also of reverence for the jury, whom he thanks at the end and so maintains
the rapport he initially established.

   You might find that your closing argument reads so much like Traina's
that they can be considered "generic" closing arguments. Or maybe you
went the route that Ataide did, which is to highlight the significant points
of the investigation as you constructed a summary-- a conclusion. Ataide
looked a bit at the criminal mind of the defendant who "harbored feelings
of despair and hatred for quite some time" before murdering his former
professor, all of which are documented "in his emails and Twitter updates."
Ataide concludes his argument by directly reminding the jury that while the
professor "will never again teach a class, you have the opportunity to teach
the accused, Lucas Brown, a lesson here today. A conviction should be your
only choice." This clever twist on teaching a lesson provides eloquent closure
to his argument.

   Or perhaps you, like Chelsea Vick, felt mounting drama to be the most
persuasive approach. She tells the jury that "the defendant has not only
physically stabbed my client Mark Smith; he has stabbed the judicial system.
Every entrance wound on my victim's body is another blow to the system our
government runs on." She, like Traina, conjures up fear with the prospect of
returning such a person to the streets, and she, too, "leaves you [the jury] to
deliberate whether to send a murderer to jail or to another parking garage."

   By making reference to the "system our government runs on," Vick plays
with the sometimes subtle line between the connotation and denotation of
words. What a word denotes is its literal definition or what you would find
should you look it up in the dictionary, but words have connotations, too,
which are the emotional associations, positive or negative, we bring to them.
While an apple pie denotes a dessert made of sliced apples and sugar baked
in a single or double flour crust, in the United States it can also conjure up
positive emotions about home and/or patriotism about country. We imagine
apple pies to be lovingly-baked by apron-clad moms who raise citizens who
are, well, as the saying goes, "as American as apple pie." Vick's comment that
the defendant has metaphorically "stabbed the judicial system" in addition
to Mark Smith is meant to produce negative connotations beyond the actual

40 | Murder! Rhetorically Speaking
murder; she conjures up the looming threat that our entire way of life would
be at stake should the jury do anything other than convict the defendant.

   If we envision in our minds the passionate delivery of these closing
arguments, we might imagine that we have finally come close to the first
definition of "rhetoric" that the American Heritage Dictionary online offers
us, which is "the art or study of using language effectively and persuasively,"
rather than that one-word definition my brave student once proffered. Yes,
our attorneys all did perform admirably in their endeavors to persuade the
jury with their words, but we find examples of effective rhetoric in all of the
writing scenarios we have considered.

   Here I offer my definition: rhetoric is what allows you to write (and speak)
appropriately for a given situation, one that is determined by the
expectations of your audience, implied or acknowledged, whether you are
texting, writing a love letter, or bleeding a term paper. When you go to write,
you might not always be actively aware of your audience as an audience. You
may not even consciously realize that you are enacting certain rhetorical
strategies while rejecting others. But each time you write you will find
yourself in a rhetorical situation, in other words within a context or genre,
that nudges you to choose the right diction or even jargon and to strike the
right tone.

   In this essay, I put you in three rhetorical situations for which you have no
formal training--writing hypothetically as if you were a detective, a coroner,
and a lawyer--and you knew what to do, as you did with the eulogy. This
shows the extent to which we absorb and internalize our rhetorical tools
by watching media, reading books, and participating in our culture. More
importantly, you can now see that when I told you at the beginning that you
are already in possession of the rhetorical skills necessary for mastering the
genre of academic writing and that you need only apply them, I wasn't just
feeding you a bunch of bull.

PART 2: THE WRITING
PROCESS

Getting started with writing can take many forms. Some writers start with
a question they want to answer; others take a prompt or an assignment and
build an outline. Many of us have experience with free-writing or journal
writing as a way to get words on the page.

   This section addresses both the nuts-and-bolts planning aspects of
getting started with writing and the higher level demands of figuring out
how to structure an essay so that it meets with college writing expectations.
It begins a longer discussion, as well, on how to find good information on
which to base your arguments and explorations, a discussion we'll continue
in the research section.

         · Construct an essay from an arguable thesis

Moving beyond the five-paragraph theme

As an instructor, I've noted that a number of new (and sometimes not-so-
new) students are skilled wordsmiths and generally clear thinkers but are
nevertheless stuck in a high-school style of writing. They struggle to let
go of certain assumptions about how an academic paper should be. The
essay portion of the SAT is a representative artifact of the writing skills that
K-12 education imparts. Some students who have mastered that form, and
enjoyed a lot of success from doing so, assume that college writing is simply
more of the same. The skills that go into a very basic kind of essay--often
called the five-paragraph theme--are indispensable. If you're good at the
five-paragraph theme, then you're good at identifying a clear and consistent
thesis, arranging cohesive paragraphs, organizing evidence for key points,
and situating an argument within a broader context through the intro and
conclusion.

   In college you need to build on those essential skills. The five-paragraph
theme, as such, is bland and formulaic; it doesn't compel deep thinking. Your
professors are looking for a more ambitious and arguable thesis, a nuanced

                             Constructing the Thesis and Argument from the Ground Up | 45
   and compelling argument, and real-life evidence for all key points, all in an
   organically1 structured paper.

      Figures 3.1 and 3.2 contrast the standard five-paragraph theme and the
   organic college paper:

                                                                                                       Figure 3.1

   The five-paragraph theme, outlined in Figure 3.1 is probably what you're
   used to: the introductory paragraph starts broad and gradually narrows to
   a thesis, which readers expect to find at the very end of that paragraph. In
   this idealized format, the thesis invokes the magic number of three: three
   reasons why a statement is true. Each of those reasons is explained and

1. "Organic" here doesn't mean "pesticide-free" or containing
  carbon; it means the paper grows and develops, sort of like a
  living thing.

   46 | Constructing the Thesis and Argument from the Ground Up
justified in the three body paragraphs, and then the final paragraph restates
the thesis before gradually getting broader. This format is easy for readers to
follow, and it helps writers organize their points and the evidence that goes
with them. That's why you learned this format.

                                                                                                   Figure 3.2: The
                                                                                                   "organic"
                                                                                                   college paper

Figure 3.2, in contrast, represents a paper on the same topic that has the
more organic form expected in college. The first key difference is the thesis.
Rather than simply positing a number of reasons to think that something is
true, it puts forward an arguable statement: one with which a reasonable
person might disagree. An arguable thesis gives the paper purpose. It
surprises readers and draws them in. You hope your reader thinks, "Huh.
Why would they come to that conclusion?" and then feels compelled to
read on. The body paragraphs, then, build on one another to carry out this
ambitious argument. In the classic five-paragraph theme (Figure 3.1) it hardly

                             Constructing the Thesis and Argument from the Ground Up | 47
matters which of the three reasons you explain first or second. In the more
organic structure (Figure 3.2) each paragraph specifically leads to the next.

   The last key difference is seen in the conclusion. Because the organic
essay is driven by an ambitious, non-obvious argument, the reader comes
to the concluding section thinking "OK, I'm convinced by the argument.
What do you, author, make of it? Why does it matter?" The conclusion of an
organically structured paper has a real job to do. It doesn't just reiterate the
thesis; it explains why the thesis matters.

   The substantial time you spent mastering the five-paragraph form in
Figure 3.1 was time well spent; it's hard to imagine anyone succeeding with
the more organic form without the organizational skills and habits of mind
inherent in the simpler form. But if you assume that you must adhere rigidly
to the simpler form, you're blunting your intellectual ambition. Your
professors will not be impressed by obvious theses, loosely related body
paragraphs, and repetitive conclusions. They want you to undertake an
ambitious independent analysis, one that will yield a thesis that is somewhat
surprising and challenging to explain.

The three-story thesis: from the ground up

You have no doubt been drilled on the need for a thesis statement and its
proper location at the end of the introduction. And you also know that all of
the key points of the paper should clearly support the central driving thesis.
Indeed, the whole model of the five-paragraph theme hinges on a clearly
stated and consistent thesis. However, some students are surprised--and
dismayed--when some of their early college papers are criticized for not
having a good thesis. Their professor might even claim that the paper doesn't
have a thesis when, in the author's view it clearly does. So, what makes a
good thesis in college?

   A good thesis is non-obvious. High school teachers needed to make sure
that you and all your classmates mastered the basic form of the academic
essay. Thus, they were mostly concerned that you had a clear and consistent
thesis, even if it was something obvious like "sustainability is important." A
thesis statement like that has a wide-enough scope to incorporate several
supporting points and concurring evidence, enabling the writer to
demonstrate his or her mastery of the five-paragraph form. Good enough!

48 | Constructing the Thesis and Argument from the Ground Up
   When they can, high school teachers nudge students to develop arguments
   that are less obvious and more engaging. College instructors, though, fully
   expect you to produce something more developed.

      A good thesis is arguable. In everyday life, "arguable" is often used as a
   synonym for "doubtful." For a thesis, though, "arguable" means that it's worth
   arguing: it's something with which a reasonable person might disagree. This
   arguability criterion dovetails with the non-obvious one: it shows that the
   author has deeply explored a problem and arrived at an argument that
   legitimately needs 3, 5, 10, or 20 pages to explain and justify. In that way, a
   good thesis sets an ambitious agenda for a paper. A thesis like "sustainability
   is important" isn't at all difficult to argue for, and the reader would have
   little intrinsic motivation to read the rest of the paper. However, an arguable
   thesis like "sustainability policies will inevitably fail if they do not incorporate
   social justice," brings up some healthy skepticism. Thus, the arguable thesis
   makes the reader want to keep reading.

      A good thesis is well specified. Some student writers fear that they're
   giving away the game if they specify their thesis up front; they think that a
   purposefully vague thesis might be more intriguing to the reader. However,
   consider movie trailers: they always include the most exciting and poignant
   moments from the film to attract an audience. In academic papers, too, a
   well specified thesis indicates that the author has thought rigorously about
   an issue and done thorough research, which makes the reader want to keep
   reading. Don't just say that a particular policy is effective or fair; say what
   makes it is so. If you want to argue that a particular claim is dubious or
   incomplete, say why in your thesis.

      A good thesis includes implications. Suppose your assignment is to write
   a paper about some aspect of the history of linen production and trade, a
   topic that may seem exceedingly arcane. And suppose you have constructed
   a well supported and creative argument that linen was so widely traded in
   the ancient Mediterranean that it actually served as a kind of currency2.

   World Trade from Ancient Times to the Present. Armonk: M.E.
   Sharpe, 2005.

                                 Constructing the Thesis and Argument from the Ground Up | 49
   That's a strong, insightful, arguable, well specified thesis. But which of these
   thesis statements do you find more engaging?

              Version A:
              Linen served as a form of currency in the ancient
           Mediterranean world, connecting rival empires through circuits
           of trade.
              Version B:
              Linen served as a form of currency in the ancient
           Mediterranean world, connecting rival empires through circuits
           of trade. The economic role of linen raises important questions
           about how shifting environmental conditions can influence
           economic relationships and, by extension, political conflicts.

   Putting your claims in their broader context makes them more interesting
   to your reader and more impressive to your professors who, after all, assign
   topics that they think have enduring significance. Finding that significance
   for yourself makes the most of both your paper and your learning.

      How do you produce a good, strong thesis? And how do you know when
   you've gotten there? Many instructors and writers find useful a metaphor
   based on this passage by Oliver Wendell Holmes Sr.3:

           There are one-story intellects, two-story intellects, and three-story
           intellects with skylights. All fact collectors who have no aim beyond
           their facts are one-story men. Two-story men compare, reason,
           generalize using the labor of fact collectors as their own. Three-story
           men idealize, imagine, predict--their best illumination comes from
           above the skylight.

3. Oliver Wendell Holmes Sr., The Poet at the Breakfast Table (New
   York: Houghton & Mifflin, 1892)

    50 | Constructing the Thesis and Argument from the Ground Up
   One-story theses state inarguable facts. Two-story theses bring in an
   arguable (interpretive or analytical) point. Three-story theses nest that point
   within its larger, compelling implications4.

      The biggest benefit of the three-story metaphor is that it describes a
   process for building a thesis. To build the first story, you first have to get
   familiar with the complex, relevant facts surrounding the problem or
   question. You have to be able to describe the situation thoroughly and
   accurately. Then, with that first story built, you can layer on the second
   story by formulating the insightful, arguable point that animates the analysis.
   That's often the most effortful part: brainstorming, elaborating and
   comparing alternative ideas, finalizing your point. With that specified, you
   can frame up the third story by articulating why the point you make matters
   beyond its particular topic or case.

     we go again!" But after learning about the three story thesis, I never
     had a problem with writing another thesis. In fact, I look forward to
     being asked on a paper to create a thesis.

                                                                             Timothée Pizarro

For example, imagine you have been assigned a paper about the impact of
online learning in higher education. You would first construct an account
of the origins and multiple forms of online learning and assess research
findings about its use and effectiveness. If you've done that well, you'll
probably come up with a well considered opinion that wouldn't be obvious to
readers who haven't looked at the issue in depth. Maybe you'll want to argue
that online learning is a threat to the academic community. Or perhaps you'll
want to make the case that online learning opens up pathways to college
degrees that traditional campus-based learning does not. In the course of
developing your central, argumentative point, you'll come to recognize its
larger context; in this example, you may claim that online learning can
serve to better integrate higher education with the rest of society, as online
learners bring their educational and career experiences together. To outline
this example:

  · First story: Online learning is becoming more prevalent and takes many
      different forms.

  · Second story: While most observers see it as a transformation of higher
      education, online learning is better thought of an extension of higher
      education in that it reaches learners who aren't disposed to participate
      in traditional campus-based education.

  · Third story: Online learning appears to be a promising way to better
      integrate higher education with other institutions in society, as online
      learners integrate their educational experiences with the other realms
      of their life, promoting the freer flow of ideas between the academy
      and the rest of society.

52 | Constructing the Thesis and Argument from the Ground Up
Here's another example of a three-story thesis:5

  · First story: Edith Wharton did not consider herself a modernist writer,
      and she didn't write like her modernist contemporaries.

  · Second story: However, in her work we can see her grappling with both
      the questions and literary forms that fascinated modernist writers of
      her era. While not an avowed modernist, she did engage with
      modernist themes and questions.

  · Third story: Thus, it is more revealing to think of modernism as a
      conversation rather than a category or practice.

Here's one more example:

  · First story: Scientists disagree about the likely impact in the U.S. of the
      light brown apple moth (LBAM), an agricultural pest native to Australia.

  · Second story: Research findings to date suggest that the decision to
      spray pheromones over the skies of several southern Californian
      counties to combat the LBAM was poorly thought out.

  · Third story: Together, the scientific ambiguities and the controversial
      response strengthen the claim that industrial-style approaches to pest
      management are inherently unsustainable.

A thesis statement that stops at the first story isn't usually considered a
thesis. A two-story thesis is usually considered competent, though some
two-story theses are more intriguing and ambitious than others. A
thoughtfully crafted and well informed three-story thesis puts the author on
a smooth path toward an excellent paper.

        The concept of a three-story thesis framework was the most
     helpful piece of information I gained from the writing component of
     [this course]. The first time I utilized it in a college paper, my
     professor included "good thesis" and "excellent introduction" in her
     notes and graded it significantly higher than my previous papers.
     You can expect similar results if you dig deeper to form three-story
     theses. More importantly, doing so will make the actual writing of
     your paper more straightforward as well. Arguing something
     specific makes the structure of your paper much easier to design.

Three-story theses and the organically structured
argument

The three-story thesis is a beautiful thing. For one, it gives a paper authentic
momentum. The first paragraph doesn't just start with some broad, vague
statement; every sentence is crucial for setting up the thesis. The body
paragraphs build on one another, moving through each step of the logical
chain. Each paragraph leads inevitably to the next, making the transitions
from paragraph to paragraph feel wholly natural. The conclusion, instead of
being a mirror-image paraphrase of the introduction, builds out the third
story by explaining the broader implications of the argument. It offers new
insight without departing from the flow of the analysis.

   I should note here that a paper with this kind of momentum often reads
like it was knocked out in one inspired sitting. But in reality, just like
accomplished athletes and artists, masterful writers make the difficult thing
look easy. As writer Anne Lamott notes, reading a well written piece feels like

54 | Constructing the Thesis and Argument from the Ground Up
   its author sat down and typed it out, "bounding along like huskies across the
   snow." However, she continues,

           This is just the fantasy of the uninitiated. I know some very great
           writers, writers you love who write beautifully and have made a
           great deal of money, and not one of them sits down routinely feeling
           wildly enthusiastic and confident. Not one of them writes elegant
           first drafts. All right, one of them does, but we do not like her very
           much.6

   Experienced writers don't figure out what they want to say and then write it.
   They write in order to figure out what they want to say.

      Experienced writers develop theses in dialog with the body of the essay.
   An initial characterization of the problem leads to a tentative thesis, and
   then drafting the body of the paper reveals thorny contradictions or critical
   areas of ambiguity, prompting the writer to revisit or expand the body of
   evidence and then refine the thesis based on that fresh look. The revised
   thesis may require that body paragraphs be reordered and reshaped to fit
   the emerging three-story thesis. Throughout the process, the thesis serves
   as an anchor point while the author wades through the morass of facts and
   ideas. The dialogue between thesis and body continues until the author is
   satisfied or the due date arrives, whatever comes first. It's an effortful and
   sometimes tedious process. Novice writers, in contrast, usually oversimplify
   the writing process. They formulate some first-impression thesis, produce
   a reasonably organized outline, and then flesh it out with text, never taking
   the time to reflect or truly revise their work. They assume that revision is a
   step backward when, in reality, it is a major step forward.

     Student Reflection

        Everyone has a different way that they like to write. For instance, I
     like to pop my earbuds in, blast dubstep music and write on a white
     board. I like using the white board because it is a lot easier to revise
     and edit while you write. After I finish writing a paragraph that I am
     completely satisfied with on the white board, I sit in front of it with
     my laptop and just type it up.

                                                                               Kaethe Leonard

Another benefit of the three-story thesis framework is that it demystifies
what a "strong" argument is in academic culture. In an era of political
polarization, many students may think that a strong argument is based on a
simple, bold, combative statement that is promoted it in the most forceful
way possible. "Gun control is a travesty!" "Shakespeare is the best writer
who ever lived!" When students are encouraged to consider contrasting
perspectives in their papers, they fear that doing so will make their own
thesis seem mushy and weak. However, in academics a "strong" argument
is comprehensive and nuanced, not simple and polemical. The purpose of
the argument is to explain to readers why the author--through the course
of his or her in-depth study--has arrived at a somewhat surprising point. On
that basis, it has to consider plausible counter-arguments and contradictory
information. Academic argumentation exemplifies the popular adage about
all writing: show, don't tell. In crafting and carrying out the three-story
thesis, you are showing your reader the work you have done.

   The model of the organically structured paper and the three-story thesis
framework explained here is the very foundation of the paper itself and the
process that produces it. The subsequent chapters, focusing on sources,
paragraphs, and sentence-level wordsmithing, all follow from the notion that
you are writing to think and writing to learn as much as you are writing to
communicate. Your professors assume that you have the self-motivation and
organizational skills to pursue your analysis with both rigor and flexibility;

56 | Constructing the Thesis and Argument from the Ground Up
that is, they envision you developing, testing, refining and sometimes
discarding your own ideas based on a clear-eyed and open-minded
assessment of the evidence before you.

Other resources

The Writing Center at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill offers
an excellent, readable run-down on the five-paragraph theme, why most
college writing assignments want you to go beyond it, and those times when
the simpler structure is actually a better choice.

   There are many useful websites that describe good thesis statements
and provide examples. Those from the writing centers at Hamilton College,
Purdue University, and Clarkson University are especially helpful.

information and come up with more questions about your topic. In this
chapter you will learn how to identify your information need so that you can
begin your research, but it is likely that you will also revisit some of the ideas
in this chapter to make sure you are actually meeting that need with your
research findings. A person proficient in the Identify pillar is expected to be
able to identify a personal need for information. They understand:

  · That new information and data is constantly being produced and that
      there is always more to learn

  · That being information literate involves developing a learning habit so
      new information is being actively sought all the time

  · That ideas and opportunities are created by investigating/seeking
      information

  · The scale of the world of published and unpublished information and

  · Identify a lack of knowledge in a subject area
  · Identify a search topic/question and define it using simple terminology
  · Articulate current knowledge on a topic
  · Recognize a need for information and data to achieve a specific end and

Scenario

Norm Allknow was having trouble. He had been using computers since he
was five years old and thought he knew all there was to know about them. So,
when he was given an assignment to write about the impact of the Internet
on society, he thought it would be a breeze. He would just write what he
knew, and in no time the paper would be finished. In fact, Norm thought the
paper would probably be much longer than the required ten pages. He spent
a few minutes imagining how impressed his teacher was going to be, and
then sat down to start writing. He wrote about how the Internet had helped
him to play online games with his friends, and to keep in touch with distant

                                                                                                       Identify | 61
relatives, and even to do some homework once in a while. Soon he leaned
back in his chair and looked over what he had written. It was just half a page
long and he was out of ideas.

Identifying a Personal Need for Information

One of the first things you need to do when beginning any information-
based project is to identify your personal need for information. This may
seem obvious, but it is something many of us take for granted. We may
mistakenly assume, as Norm did in the above example, that we already
know enough to proceed. Such an assumption can lead us to waste valuable
time working with incomplete or outdated information. Information literacy
addresses a number of abilities and concepts that can help us to determine
exactly what our information needs are in various circumstances. These are
discussed below, and are followed by exercises to help develop your fluency
in this area.

Understanding the Context of an Information Need

When you realize that you have an information need it may be because you
thought you knew more than you actually do, or it may be that there is
simply new information you were not aware of. One of the most important
things you can do when starting to research a topic is to scan the existing
information landscape to find out what is already out there. We'll get into
more specific strategies for accessing different types of information later in
the book, particularly in the Gather chapter, but for now it pays to think
more broadly about the information environment in which you are
operating.

   For instance, any topic you need information about is constantly evolving
as new information is added to what is known about the topic. Trained
experts, informed amateurs, and opinionated laypeople are publishing in
traditional and emerging formats; there is always something new to find out.
The scale of information available varies according to topic, but in general it's
safe to say that there is more information accessible now than ever before.

62 | Identify
   Due to the extensive amount of information available, part of becoming
more information literate is developing habits of mind and of practice that
enable you to continually seek new information and to adapt your
understanding of topics according to what you find. Because of the widely
varying quality of new information, evaluation is also a key element of
information literacy, and will be addressed in the Evaluate chapter of this
book.

   Finally, while you are busy searching for information on your current topic,
be sure to keep your mind open for new avenues or angles of research that
you haven't yet considered. Often the information you found for your initial
need will turn out to be the pathway to a rich vein of information that can
serve as raw material for many subsequent projects.

   When you understand the information environment where your
information need is situated, you can begin to define the topic more clearly
and you can begin to understand where your research fits in with related
work that precedes it. Your information literacy skills will develop against
this changing background as you use the same underlying principles to do
research on a variety of topics.

From Information Need to Research Question

Norm was abruptly confronted by his lack of knowledge when he realized
that he had nothing left to say on his topic after writing half a page. Now that
he is aware of that shortcoming, he can take steps to rectify it.

   Your own lack of knowledge may become apparent in other ways. When
reading an article or textbook, you may notice that something the author
refers to is completely new to you. You might realize while out walking that
you can't identify any of the trees around your house. You may be assigned a
topic you have never heard of.

                                                                                                      Identify | 63
     Exercise: Identifying What You Don't Know

        Wherever you are, look around you. Find one thing in your
     immediate field of view that you can't explain.

        What is it that you don't understand about that thing?
        What is it that you need to find out so that you can understand it?
        How can you express what you need to find out?

For example: You can't explain why your coat repels water. You know that
it's plastic, and that it's designed to repel water, but can't explain why this
happens. You need to find out what kind of plastic the coat is made of and
the chemistry or physics of that plastic and of water that makes the water
run off instead of soaking through. (The terminology in your first explanation
would get more specific once you did some research.)

   All of us lack knowledge in countless areas, but this isn't a bad thing. Once
we step back and acknowledge that we don't know something, it opens up
the possibility that we can find out all sorts of interesting things, and that's
when the searching begins.

   Taking your lack of knowledge and turning it into a search topic or
research question starts with being able to state what your lack of
knowledge is. Part of this is to state what you already know. It's rare that
you'll start a search from absolute zero. Most of the time you've at least heard
something about the topic, even if it is just a brief reference in a lecture or
reading. Taking stock of what you already know can help you to identify any
erroneous assumptions you might be making based on incomplete or biased
information. If you think you know something, make sure you find at least
a couple of reliable sources to confirm that knowledge before taking it for
granted. Use the following exercise to see if there is anything that needs to
be supported with background research before proceeding.

64 | Identify
     Exercise: Taking Stock of What You Already
   Know

        As discussed above, part of identifying your own information need
     is giving yourself credit for what you already know about your topic.
     Construct a chart using the following format to list whatever you
     already know about the topic.

        Name your topic at the top.
        In the first column, list what you know about your topic.
        In the second column, briefly explain how you know this (heard it
     from the professor, read it in the textbook, saw it on a blog, etc.).
        In the last column, rate your confidence in that knowledge. Are
     you 100% sure of this bit of knowledge, or did you just hear it
     somewhere and assume it was right?
        When you've looked at everything you think you know about the
     topic and why, step back and look at the chart as a whole. How
     much do you know about the topic, and how confident are you
     about it? You may be surprised at how little or how much you
     already know, but either way you will be aware of your own
     background on the topic.

This self-awareness is key to becoming more information literate. This
exercise gives you a simple way to gauge your starting point, and may help
you identify specific gaps in your knowledge of your topic that you will need
to fill as you proceed with your research. It can also be useful to revisit the
chart as you work on your project to see how far you've progressed, as well
as to double check that you haven't forgotten an area of weakness.

   Once you've clearly stated what you do know, it should be easier to state
what you don't KWHL1 know. Keep in mind that you are not attempting to
state everything you don't know. You are only stating what you don't know in

                                                                                                      Identify | 65
terms of your current information need. This is where you define the limits
of what you are searching for. These limits enable you to meet both size
requirements and time deadlines for a project. If you state them clearly, they
can help to keep you on track as you proceed with your research. You can
learn more about this in the Scope chapter of this book.

   One useful way to keep your research on track is with a "KWHL" chart.
This type of chart enables you to state both what you know and what you
want to know, as well as providing space where you can track your planning,
searching and evaluation progress. For now, just fill out the first column,
but start thinking about the gaps in your knowledge and how they might
inform your research questions. You will learn more about developing these
questions and the research activities that follow from them as you work
through this book.

   Defining a research question can be more difficult than it seems. Your
initial questions may be too broad or too narrow. You may not be familiar
with specialized terminology used in the field you are researching. You may
not know if your question is worth investigating at all.

   These problems can often be solved by a preliminary investigation of
existing published information on the topic. As previously discussed, gaining
a general understanding of the information environment helps you to situate
your information need in the relevant context and can also make you aware
of possible alternative directions for your research. On a more practical note,
however, reading through some of the existing information can also provide
you with commonly used terminology, which you can then use to state your
own research question, as well as in searches for additional information.
Don't try to reinvent the wheel, but rely on the experts who have laid the
groundwork for you to build upon.

   Once you have identified your own lack of knowledge, investigated the
existing information on the topic, and set some limits on your research based
on your current information need, write out your research question or state
your thesis. The next exercise will help you transform the question you have
into an actual thesis statement. You'll find that it's not uncommon to revise
your question or thesis statement several times in the course of a research
project. As you become more and more knowledgeable about the topic, you
will be able to state your ideas more clearly and precisely, until they almost
perfectly reflect the information you have found.

 Exercise: Research Question/Thesis Statement/
Search Terms

   Since this chapter is all about determining and expressing your
information need, let's follow up on thinking about that with a
practical exercise. Follow these steps to get a better grasp of exactly
what you are trying to find out, and to identify some initial search
terms to get you started.

   1. Whatever project you are currently working on, there
        should be some question you are trying to answer. Write your
        current version of that question here.

   2. Now write your proposed answer to your question. This
        may be the first draft of your thesis statement which you will
        attempt to support with your research, or in some cases, the
        first draft of a hypothesis that you will go on to test
        experimentally. It doesn't have to be perfect at this point, but
        based on your current understanding of your topic and what
        you expect or hope to find is the answer to the question you
        asked.

   3. Look at your question and your thesis/hypothesis, and
        make a list of the terms common to both lists (excluding "the",
        "and", "a", etc.). These common terms are likely the important
        concepts that you will need to research to support your
        thesis/hypothesis. They may be the most useful search terms
        overall or they may only be a starting point.

   If none of the terms from your question and thesis/hypothesis
lists overlap at all, you might want to take a closer look and see if
your thesis/hypothesis really answers your research question. If
not, you may have arrived at your first opportunity for revision.
Does your question really ask what you're trying to find out? Does
your proposed answer really answer that question? You may find

                                                                                                Identify | 67
     that you need to change one or both, or to add something to one or
     both to really get at what you're interested in. This is part of the
     process, and you will likely discover that as you gather more
     information about your topic, you will find other ways that you want
     to change your question or thesis to align with the facts, even if they
     are different from what you hoped.

A Wider View

While the identification of an information need is presented in this chapter
as the first step in the research process, many times the information need
you initially identified will change as you discover new information and
connections. Other chapters in this book deal with finding, evaluating, and
managing information in a variety of ways and formats. As you become more
skilled in using different information resources, you will likely find that the
line between the various information literacy skills becomes increasingly
blurred, and that you will revisit your initial ideas about your topic in
response to both the information you're finding and what you're doing with
what that information.

   Continually think about your relationship to the information you find.
Why are you doing things the way you are? Is it really the best way for
your current situation? What other options are there? Keeping an open
mind about your use of information will help you to ensure that you take
responsibility for the results of that use, and will help you to be more
successful in any information-intensive endeavor.

     Learning Objectives

         · Understand the elements of a strong, clear thesis statement
         · Revise a thesis statement to make it clearer

Have you ever known a person who was not very good at telling stories?
You probably had trouble following his train of thought as he jumped around
from point to point, either being too brief in places that needed further
explanation or providing too many details on a meaningless element. Maybe
he told the end of the story first, then moved to the beginning and later
added details to the middle. His ideas were probably scattered, and the story
did not flow very well. When the story was over, you probably had many
questions.

   Just as a personal anecdote can be a disorganized mess, an essay can fall
into the same trap of being out of order and confusing. That is why writers
need a thesis statement to provide a specific focus for their essay and to
organize what they are about to discuss in the body.

   Just like a topic sentence summarizes a single paragraph, the thesis
statement summarizes an entire essay. It tells the reader the point you want
to make in your essay, while the essay itself supports that point. It is like
a signpost that signals the essay's destination. You should form your thesis
before you begin to organize an essay, but you may find that it needs revision
as the essay develops.

                                                                 Developing a Strong, Clear Thesis | 69
Elements of a Thesis Statement

For every essay you write, you must focus on a central idea. This idea stems
from a topic you have chosen or been assigned or from a question your
teacher has asked. It is not enough merely to discuss a general topic or
simply answer a question with a yes or no. You have to form a specific
opinion, and then articulate that into a controlling idea--the main idea upon
which you build your thesis.

   Remember that a thesis is not the topic itself, but rather your
interpretation of the question or subject. For whatever topic your professor
gives you, you must ask yourself, "What do I want to say about it?" Asking
and then answering this question is vital to forming a thesis that is precise,
forceful and confident.

   A thesis is one sentence long and appears toward the end of your
introduction. It is specific and focuses on one to three points of a single
idea--points that are able to be demonstrated in the body. It forecasts the
content of the essay and suggests how you will organize your information.
Remember that a thesis statement does not summarize an issue but rather
dissects it.

A Strong Thesis Statement

A strong thesis statement contains the following qualities.
   Specificity. A thesis statement must concentrate on a specific area of a

general topic. As you may recall, the creation of a thesis statement begins
when you choose a broad subject and then narrow down its parts until you
pinpoint a specific aspect of that topic. For example, health care is a broad
topic, but a proper thesis statement would focus on a specific area of that
topic, such as options for individuals without health care coverage.

   Precision. A strong thesis statement must be precise enough to allow for
a coherent argument and to remain focused on the topic. If the specific
topic is options for individuals without health care coverage, then your
precise thesis statement must make an exact claim about it, such as that
limited options exist for those who are uninsured by their employers. You

70 | Developing a Strong, Clear Thesis
must further pinpoint what you are going to discuss regarding these limited
effects, such as whom they affect and what the cause is.

   Ability to be argued. A thesis statement must present a relevant and
specific argument. A factual statement often is not considered arguable. Be
sure your thesis statement contains a point of view that can be supported
with evidence.

   Ability to be demonstrated. For any claim you make in your thesis, you
must be able to provide reasons and examples for your opinion. You can
rely on personal observations in order to do this, or you can consult outside
sources to demonstrate that what you assert is valid. A worthy argument is
backed by examples and details.

   Forcefulness. A thesis statement that is forceful shows readers that you
are, in fact, making an argument. The tone is assertive and takes a stance
that others might oppose.

   Confidence. In addition to using force in your thesis statement, you must
also use confidence in your claim. Phrases such as I feel or I believe actually
weaken the readers' sense of your confidence because these phrases imply
that you are the only person who feels the way you do. In other words, your
stance has insufficient backing. Taking an authoritative stance on the matter
persuades your readers to have faith in your argument and open their minds
to what you have to say.

          Tip
          Even in a personal essay that allows the use of first person,
       your thesis should not contain phrases such as in my opinion or I
       believe. These statements reduce your credibility and weaken
       your argument. Your opinion is more convincing when you use a
       firm attitude.

                                                                  Developing a Strong, Clear Thesis | 71
Examples of Appropriate Thesis Statements

Each of the following thesis statements meets several of the following
requirements:

  · Specificity
  · Precision
  · Ability to be argued
  · Ability to be demonstrated
  · Forcefulness
  · Confidence

     Examples

        Ex: The societal and personal struggles of Troy Maxon in the play
     Fences symbolize the challenge of black males who lived through
     segregation and integration in the United States.

        Ex: Closing all American borders for a period of five years is one
     solution that will tackle illegal immigration.

        Ex: Shakespeare's use of dramatic irony in Romeo and Juliet spoils
     the outcome for the audience and weakens the plot.

        Ex: J. D. Salinger's character in Catcher in the Rye, Holden
     Caulfield, is a confused rebel who voices his disgust with phonies,
     yet in an effort to protect himself, he acts like a phony on many
     occasions.

        Ex: Compared to an absolute divorce, no-fault divorce is less
     expensive, promotes fairer settlements, and reflects a more realistic
     view of the causes for marital breakdown.

        Ex: Exposing children from an early age to the dangers of drug
     abuse is a sure method of preventing future drug addicts.

72 | Developing a Strong, Clear Thesis
        Ex: In today's crumbling job market, a high school diploma is not
     significant enough education to land a stable, lucrative job.

          Tip
          You can find thesis statements in many places, such as in the
       news; in the opinions of friends, coworkers or teachers; and even
       in songs you hear on the radio. Become aware of thesis
       statements in everyday life by paying attention to people's
       opinions and their reasons for those opinions. Pay attention to
       your own everyday thesis statements as well, as these can
       become material for future essays.

Now that you have read about the contents of a good thesis statement and
have seen examples, take a look at the pitfalls to avoid when composing your
own thesis:

A thesis is weak when it is simply a declaration of your
subject or a description of what you will discuss in your
essay.

Ex: Weak thesis statement: My paper will explain why imagination is more
important than knowledge.

A thesis is weak when it makes an unreasonable or
outrageous claim or insults the opposing side.

Ex: Weak thesis statement: Religious radicals across America are trying to
legislate their Puritanical beliefs by banning required high school books.

A thesis is weak when it contains an obvious fact or
something that no one can disagree with or provides a
dead end.

Ex: Weak thesis statement: Advertising companies use sex to sell their products.

A thesis is weak when the statement is too broad.

Ex: Weak thesis statement: The life of Abraham Lincoln was long and
challenging.

WRITING AT WORK

Often in your career, you will need to ask your boss for something through
an e-mail. Just as a thesis statement organizes an essay, it can also organize
your e-mail request. While your e-mail will be shorter than an essay, using
a thesis statement in your first paragraph quickly lets your boss know what
you are asking for, why it is necessary, and what the benefits are. In short
body paragraphs, you can provide the essential information needed to
expand upon your request.

74 | Developing a Strong, Clear Thesis
Thesis Statement Revision

Your thesis will probably change as you write, so you will need to modify
it to reflect exactly what you have discussed in your essay. Remember that
your thesis statement begins as a working thesis statement, an indefinite
statement that you make about your topic early in the writing process for
the purpose of planning and guiding your writing.

   Working thesis statements often become stronger as you gather
information and form new opinions and reasons for those opinions. Revision
helps you strengthen your thesis so that it matches what you have expressed
in the body of the paper.

          TIP
          The best way to revise your thesis statement is to ask
       questions about it and then examine the answers to those
       questions. By challenging your own ideas and forming definite
       reasons for those ideas, you grow closer to a more precise point
       of view, which you can then incorporate into your thesis
       statement.

Ways to Revise Your Thesis

You can cut down on irrelevant aspects and revise your thesis by taking the
following steps:

   1. Pinpoint and replace all nonspecific words, such as people, everything,
society, or life, with more precise words in order to reduce any vagueness.

   Working thesis: Young people have to work hard to succeed in life.
   Revised thesis: Recent college graduates must have discipline and
persistence in order to find and maintain a stable job in which they can use
and be appreciated for their talents.
   The revised thesis makes a more specific statement about success and

                                                                  Developing a Strong, Clear Thesis | 75
what it means to work hard. The original includes too broad a range of
people and does not define exactly what success entails. By replacing those
general words like people and work hard, the writer can better focus his or
her research and gain more direction in his or her writing.

   2. Clarify ideas that need explanation by asking yourself questions that
narrow your thesis.

   Working thesis: The welfare system is a joke.
   Revised thesis: The welfare system keeps a socioeconomic class from
gaining employment by alluring members of that class with unearned
income, instead of programs to improve their education and skill sets.
   A joke means many things to many people. Readers bring all sorts of
backgrounds and perspectives to the reading process and would need
clarification for a word so vague. This expression may also be too informal
for the selected audience. By asking questions, the writer can devise a more
precise and appropriate explanation for joke. The writer should ask himself
or herself questions similar to the 5WH questions. (Who? What? Where?
When? Why? and How? are the 5WH questions). By incorporating the
answers to these questions into a thesis statement, the writer more
accurately defines his or her stance, which will better guide the writing of
the essay.
   3. Replace any linking verbs with action verbs. Linking verbs are forms of
the verb to be, a verb that simply states that a situation exists.
   Working thesis: Kansas City schoolteachers are not paid enough.
   Revised thesis: The Kansas City legislature cannot afford to pay its
educators, resulting in job cuts and resignations in a district that sorely
needs highly qualified and dedicated teachers.
   The linking verb in this working thesis statement is the word are. Linking
verbs often make thesis statements weak because they do not express
action. Rather, they connect words and phrases to the second half of the
sentence. Readers might wonder, "Why are they not paid enough?" But this
statement does not compel them to ask many more questions. The writer
should ask himself or herself questions in order to replace the linking verb
with an action verb, thus forming a stronger thesis statement, one that takes
a more definitive stance on the issue:

  · Who is not paying the teachers enough?
  · What is considered "enough"?
  · What is the problem?

76 | Developing a Strong, Clear Thesis
  · What are the results

4. Omit any general claims that are hard to support.
   Working thesis: Today's teenage girls are too sexualized.
   Revised thesis: Teenage girls who are captivated by the sexual images

on MTV are conditioned to believe that a woman's worth depends on her
sensuality, a feeling that harms their self-esteem and behavior.

   It is true that some young women in today's society are more sexualized
than in the past, but that is not true for all girls. Many girls have strict
parents, dress appropriately, and do not engage in sexual activity while in
middle school and high school. The writer of this thesis should ask the
following questions:

  · Which teenage girls?
  · What constitutes "too" sexualized?
  · Why are they behaving that way?
  · Where does this behavior show up?
  · What are the repercussions?

WRITING AT WORK

In your career you may have to write a project proposal that focuses on a
particular problem in your company, such as reinforcing the tardiness policy.
The proposal would aim to fix the problem; using a thesis statement would
clearly state the boundaries of the problem and tell the goals of the project.
After writing the proposal, you may find that the thesis needs revision to
reflect exactly what is expressed in the body. Using the techniques from this
chapter would apply to revising that thesis.

                                                                  Developing a Strong, Clear Thesis | 77
     Key Takeaways

         · Proper essays require a thesis statement to provide a
             specific focus and suggest how the essay will be organized.

         · A thesis statement is your interpretation of the subject, not
             the topic itself.

         · A strong thesis is specific, precise, forceful, confident, and is
             able to be demonstrated.

         · A strong thesis challenges readers with a point of view that
             can be debated and can be supported with evidence.

         · A weak thesis is simply a declaration of your topic or
             contains an obvious fact that cannot be argued.

         · Depending on your topic, it may or may not be appropriate
             to use first person point of view.

         · Revise your thesis by ensuring all words are specific, all
             ideas are exact, and all verbs express action.

Organizing Your Writing

WRITING FOR SUCCESS

     Learning Objectives

         · Understand how and why organizational techniques help
             writers and readers stay focused.

         · Assess how and when to use chronological order to
             organize an essay.

         · Recognize how and when to use order of importance to
             organize an essay.

         · Determine how and when to use spatial order to organize
             an essay.

The method of organization you choose for your essay is just as important
as its content. Without a clear organizational pattern, your reader could
become confused and lose interest. The way you structure your essay helps
your readers draw connections between the body and the thesis, and the
structure also keeps you focused as you plan and write the essay. Choosing
your organizational pattern before you outline ensures that each body
paragraph works to support and develop your thesis.

   This section covers three ways to organize body paragraphs:

  · Chronological order
  · Order of importance
  · Spatial order

When you begin to draft your essay, your ideas may seem to flow from your
mind in a seemingly random manner. Your readers, who bring to the table

                                                                               Organizing Your Writing | 79
different backgrounds, viewpoints, and ideas, need you to clearly organize
these ideas in order to help process and accept them.

   A solid organizational pattern gives your ideas a path that you can follow
as you develop your draft. Knowing how you will organize your paragraphs
allows you to better express and analyze your thoughts. Planning the
structure of your essay before you choose supporting evidence helps you
conduct more effective and targeted research.

CHRONOLOGICAL ORDER

Chronological arrangement (also called "time order,") has the following
purposes:

  · To explain the history of an event or a topic
  · To tell a story or relate an experience
  · To explain how to do or to make something
  · To explain the steps in a process

Chronological order is mostly used in expository writing, which is a form
of writing that narrates, describes, informs, or explains a process. When
using chronological order, arrange the events in the order that they actually
happened, or will happen if you are giving instructions. This method requires
you to use words such as first, second, then, after that, later, and finally.
These transition words guide you and your reader through the paper as you
expand your thesis.

   For example, if you are writing an essay about the history of the airline
industry, you would begin with its conception and detail the essential
timeline events up until present day. You would follow the chain of events
using words such as first, then, next, and so on.

WRITING AT WORK

At some point in your career you may have to file a complaint with your
human resources department. Using chronological order is a useful tool in
describing the events that led up to your filing the grievance. You would

80 | Organizing Your Writing
logically lay out the events in the order that they occurred using the key
transition words. The more logical your complaint, the more likely you will
be well received and helped.

     Exercise 1

        Choose an accomplishment you have achieved in your life. The
     important moment could be in sports, schooling, or extracurricular
     activities. On your own sheet of paper, list the steps you took to
     reach your goal. Try to be as specific as possible with the steps you
     took. Pay attention to using transition words to focus your writing.

Keep in mind that chronological order is most appropriate for the following
purposes:

  · Writing essays containing heavy research
  · Writing essays with the aim of listing, explaining, or narrating
  · Writing essays that analyze literary works such as poems, plays, or

      books

          TIP
          When using chronological order, your introduction should
       indicate the information you will cover and in what order, and
       the introduction should also establish the relevance of the
       information. Your body paragraphs should then provide clear
       divisions or steps in chronology. You can divide your paragraphs
       by time (such as decades, wars, or other historical events) or by

                                                                               Organizing Your Writing | 81
       the same structure of the work you are examining (such as a
       line-by-line explication of a poem).

     Exercise 2

        On a separate sheet of paper, write a paragraph that describes a
     process you are familiar with and can do well. Assume that your
     reader is unfamiliar with the procedure. Remember to use the
     chronological key words, such as first, second, then, and finally.

ORDER OF IMPORTANCE

Order of importance is best used for the following purposes:
  · Persuading and convincing
  · Ranking items by their importance, benefit, or significance
  · Illustrating a situation, problem, or solution

Most essays move from the least to the most important point, and the
paragraphs are arranged in an effort to build the essay's strength.
Sometimes, however, it is necessary to begin with your most important
supporting point, such as in an essay that contains a thesis that is highly
debatable. When writing a persuasive essay, it is best to begin with the most
important point because it immediately captivates your readers and compels
them to continue reading.

   For example, if you were supporting your thesis that homework is
detrimental to the education of high school students, you would want to

82 | Organizing Your Writing
present your most convincing argument first, and then move on to the less
important points for your case.

   Some key transitional words you should use with this method of
organization are most importantly, almost as importantly, just as
importantly, and finally.

WRITING AT WORK

During your career, you may be required to work on a team that devises
a strategy for a specific goal of your company, such as increasing profits.
When planning your strategy you should organize your steps in order of
importance. This demonstrates the ability to prioritize and plan. Using the
order of importance technique also shows that you can create a resolution
with logical steps for accomplishing a common goal.

     Exercise 3

        On a separate sheet of paper, write a paragraph that discusses a
     passion of yours. Your passion could be music, a particular sport,
     filmmaking, and so on. Your paragraph should be built upon the
     reasons why you feel so strongly. Briefly discuss your reasons in the
     order of least to greatest importance.

SPATIAL ORDER

Spatial order is best used for the following purposes:
  · Helping readers visualize something as you want them to see it
  · Evoking a scene using the senses (sight, touch, taste, smell, and sound)

                                                                              Organizing Your Writing | 83
  · Writing a descriptive essay

Spatial order means that you explain or describe objects as they are arranged
around you in your space, for example in a bedroom. As the writer, you
create a picture for your reader, and their perspective is the viewpoint from
which you describe what is around you.

   The view must move in an orderly, logical progression, giving the reader
clear directional signals to follow from place to place. The key to using this
method is to choose a specific starting point and then guide the reader to
follow your eye as it moves in an orderly trajectory from your starting point.

   Pay attention to the following student's description of her bedroom and
how she guides the reader through the viewing process, foot by foot.

   The paragraph incorporates two objectives you have learned in this
chapter: using an implied topic sentence and applying spatial order. Often in
a descriptive essay, the two work together.

   The following are possible transition words to include when using spatial
order:

  · Just to the left or just to the right
  · Behind
  · Between
  · On the left or on the right
  · Across from
  · A little further down
  · To the south, to the east, and so on
  · A few yards away
  · Turning left or turning right

     Key Takeaways

         · The way you organize your body paragraphs ensures you
             and your readers stay focused on and draw connections to,

84 | Organizing Your Writing
     your thesis statement.
  · A strong organizational pattern allows you to articulate,

     analyze, and clarify your thoughts.
  · Planning the organizational structure for your essay before

     you begin to search for supporting evidence helps you
     conduct more effective and directed research.
  · Chronological order is most commonly used in expository
     writing. It is useful for explaining the history of your subject,
     for telling a story, or for explaining a process.
  · Order of importance is most appropriate in a persuasion
     paper as well as for essays in which you rank things, people, or
     events by their significance.
  · Spatial order describes things as they are arranged in space
     and is best for helping readers visualize something as you
     want them to see it; it creates a dominant impression.

Writing Body Paragraphs

UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA

     Learning Objectives

         · Select Primary Support related to your thesis
         · Support your topic sentence

If your thesis gives the reader a roadmap to your essay, then body
paragraphs should closely follow that map. The reader should be able to
predict what follows your introductory paragraph by simply reading the
thesis statement.

   The body paragraphs present the evidence you have gathered to confirm
your thesis. Before you begin to support your thesis in the body, you must
find information from a variety of sources that support and give credit to
what you are trying to prove.

SELECT PRIMARY SUPPORT FOR YOUR THESIS

Without primary support, your argument is not likely to be convincing.
Primary support can be described as the major points you choose to expand
on your thesis. It is the most important information you select to argue for
your point of view. Each point you choose will be incorporated into the topic
sentence for each body paragraph you write. Your primary supporting points
are further supported by supporting details within the paragraphs.

86 | Writing Body Paragraphs
          TIP
          Remember that a worthy argument is backed by examples. In
       order to construct a valid argument, good writers conduct lots of
       background research and take careful notes. They also talk to
       people knowledgeable about a topic in order to understand its
       implications before writing about it.

IDENTIFY THE CHARACTERISTICS OF GOOD
PRIMARY SUPPORT

In order to fulfill the requirements of good primary support, the information
you choose must meet the following standards:

  · Be specific. The main points you make about your thesis and the
      examples you use to expand on those points need to be specific. Use
      specific examples to provide the evidence and to build upon your
      general ideas. These types of examples give your reader something
      narrow to focus on, and if used properly, they leave little doubt about
      your claim. General examples, while they convey the necessary
      information, are not nearly as compelling or useful in writing because
      they are too obvious and typical.

  · Be relevant to the thesis. Primary support is considered strong when it
      relates directly to the thesis. Primary support should show, explain, or
      prove your main argument without delving into irrelevant details. When
      faced with lots of information that could be used to prove your thesis,
      you may think you need to include it all in your body paragraphs. But
      effective writers resist the temptation to lose focus. Choose your
      examples wisely by making sure they directly connect to your thesis.

  · Be detailed. Remember that your thesis, while specific, should not be
      very detailed. The body paragraphs are where you develop the
      discussion that a thorough essay requires. Using detailed support

                                                                              Writing Body Paragraphs | 87
      shows readers that you have considered all the facts and chosen only
      the most precise details to enhance your point of view.

PREWRITE TO IDENTIFY PRIMARY SUPPORTING
POINTS FOR A THESIS STATEMENT

Recall that when you prewrite you essentially make a list of examples or
reasons why you support your stance. Stemming from each point, you
further provide details to support those reasons. After prewriting, you are
then able to look back at the information and choose the most compelling
pieces you will use in your body paragraphs.

     Exercise 1

        Choose one of the following working thesis statements. On a
     separate sheet of paper, write for at least five minutes using one of
     the prewriting techniques you learned in Chapter 8 "The Writing
     Process: How Do I Begin?".

         · Unleashed dogs on city streets are a dangerous nuisance.
         · Students cheat for many different reasons.
         · Drug use among teens and young adults is a problem.
         · The most important change that should occur at my college

             or university is
             _______________________________________
             _____.

SELECT THE MOST EFFECTIVE PRIMARY
SUPPORTING POINTS FOR A THESIS

88 | Writing Body Paragraphs
STATEMENT

After you have prewritten about your working thesis statement, you may
have generated a lot of information, which may be edited out later.
Remember that your primary support must be relevant to your thesis.
Remind yourself of your main argument, and delete any ideas that do not
directly relate to it. Omitting unrelated ideas ensures that you will use only
the most convincing information in your body paragraphs. Choose at least
three of only the most compelling points. These will serve as the topic
sentences for your body paragraphs.

     Exercise 2

        Refer to the previous exercise and select three of your most
     compelling reasons to support the thesis statement. Remember that
     the points you choose must be specific and relevant to the thesis.
     The statements you choose will be your primary support points, and
     you will later incorporate them into the topic sentences for the
     body paragraphs.

     Collaboration

        Please share with a classmate and compare your answers.

When you support your thesis, you are revealing evidence. Evidence includes
anything that can help support your stance. The following are the kinds of
evidence you will encounter as you conduct your research:

   Facts. Facts are the best kind of evidence to use because they often cannot
be disputed. They can support your stance by providing background
information on or a solid foundation for your point of view. However, some
facts may still need explanation. For example, the sentence "The most

                                                                              Writing Body Paragraphs | 89
populated state in the United States is California" is a pure fact, but it may
require some explanation to make it relevant to your specific argument.

   Judgments. Judgments are conclusions drawn from the given facts.
Judgments are more credible than opinions because they are founded upon
careful reasoning and examination of a topic.

   Testimony. Testimony consists of direct quotations from either an
eyewitness or an expert witness. An eyewitness is someone who has direct
experience with a subject; he adds authenticity to an argument based on
facts. An expert witness is a person who has extensive experience with
a topic. This person studies the facts and provides commentary based on
either facts or judgments, or both. An expert witness adds authority and
credibility to an argument.

   Personal observation. Personal observation is similar to testimony, but
personal observation consists of your testimony. It reflects what you know
to be true because you have experiences and have formed either opinions or
judgments about them. For instance, if you are one of five children and your
thesis states that being part of a large family is beneficial to a child's social
development, you could use your own experience to support your thesis.

WRITING AT WORK

In any job where you devise a plan, you will need to support the steps that
you lay out. This is an area in which you would incorporate primary support
into your writing. Choosing only the most specific and relevant information
to expand upon the steps will ensure that your plan appears well-thought-
out and precise.

          TIP
          You can consult a vast pool of resources to gather support for
       your stance. Citing relevant information from reliable sources
       ensures that your reader will take you seriously and consider
       your assertions. Use any of the following sources for your essay:

90 | Writing Body Paragraphs
       newspapers or news organization websites, magazines,
       encyclopedias, and scholarly journals, which are periodicals that
       address topics in a specialized field.

CHOOSE SUPPORTING TOPIC SENTENCES

Each body paragraph contains a topic sentence that states one aspect of
your thesis and then expands upon it. Like the thesis statement, each topic
sentence should be specific and supported by concrete details, facts, or
explanations.

   Each body paragraph should comprise the following elements.

          topic sentence + supporting details (examples, reasons, or
       arguments)

Topic sentences indicate the location and main points of the basic
arguments of your essay. These sentences are vital to writing your body
paragraphs because they always refer back to and support your thesis
statement. Topic sentences are linked to the ideas you have introduced in
your thesis, thus reminding readers what your essay is about. A paragraph
without a clearly identified topic sentence may be unclear and scattered, just
like an essay without a thesis statement.

          TIP

                                                                              Writing Body Paragraphs | 91
          Unless your teacher instructs otherwise, you should include at
       least three body paragraphs in your essay. A five-paragraph
       essay, including the introduction and conclusion, is commonly
       the standard for exams and essay assignments.

Consider the following the thesis statement:
       Author J.D. Salinger relied primarily on his personal life and belief
       system as the foundation for the themes in the majority of his works.

The following topic sentence is a primary support point for the thesis. The
topic sentence states exactly what the controlling idea of the paragraph is.
Later, you will see the writer immediately provide support for the sentence.

       Salinger, a World War II veteran, suffered from post-traumatic stress
       disorder, a disorder that influenced themes in many of his works.

     Exercise 3

        In "Exercise 2", you chose three of your most convincing points to
     support the thesis statement you selected from the list. Take each
     point and incorporate it into a topic sentence for each body
     paragraph.

        Supporting point 1:
     ___________________________________________

DRAFT SUPPORTING DETAIL SENTENCES FOR
EACH PRIMARY SUPPORT SENTENCE

After deciding which primary support points you will use as your topic
sentences, you must add details to clarify and demonstrate each of those
points. These supporting details provide examples, facts, or evidence that
support the topic sentence.

   The writer drafts possible supporting detail sentences for each primary
support sentence based on the thesis statement:

   TIP
   You have the option of writing your topic sentences in one of
three ways. You can state it at the beginning of the body
paragraph, or at the end of the paragraph, or you do not have to
write it at all. This is called an implied topic sentence. An implied
topic sentence lets readers form the main idea for themselves.
For beginning writers, it is best to not use implied topic
sentences because it makes it harder to focus your writing. Your
instructor may also want to clearly identify the sentences that
support your thesis.

   TIP
   Print out the first draft of your essay and use a highlighter to
mark your topic sentences in the body paragraphs. Make sure
they are clearly stated and accurately present your paragraphs,
as well as accurately reflect your thesis. If your topic sentence
contains information that does not exist in the rest of the
paragraph, rewrite it to more accurately match the rest of the
paragraph.

Key Takeaways

  · Your body paragraphs should closely follow the path set
     forth by your thesis statement.

                                                                     Writing Body Paragraphs | 95
         · Strong body paragraphs contain evidence that supports
             your thesis.

         · Primary support comprises the most important points you
             use to support your thesis.

         · Strong primary support is specific, detailed, and relevant to
             the thesis.

         · Prewriting helps you determine your most compelling
             primary support.

         · Evidence includes facts, judgments, testimony, and personal
             observation.

         · Reliable sources may include newspapers, magazines,
             academic journals, books, encyclopedias, and firsthand
             testimony.

         · A topic sentence presents one point of your thesis
             statement while the information in the rest of the paragraph
             supports that point.

         · A body paragraph comprises a topic sentence plus
             supporting details.

PART 3: RESEARCH

Research motivates most of our writing, whether formally or informally. It is
not, however, a natural skill. Though many of us may navigate the Internet
with ease, the type of research necessary for college writing requires skilled
practice and obeys certain rules. Here, we'll see an overview of these rules
and procedures and review the correct way to incorporate others' thoughts
in our own work.

   Within your own campus community, and with each new class, you may
find different standards and expectations for research will apply. This book
cannot cover every example; however, it should give you a basis from which
to build. As you encounter more demanding research requirements, never
hesitate to reach out to the real research experts on your campus: your
college librarians!

                                                                                          Part 3: Research | 97

Quoting, Paraphrasing, and
Avoiding Plagiarism

STEVEN D. KRAUSE

     Learning Objectives

         · Summarize, quote, and paraphrase accurately from
             readings.

         · Smoothly incorporate summary, paraphrase, and quotations
             in your writing.

         · Understand when summary, quotation, or paraphrase are
             appropriate in a research paper.

         · Avoid plagiarism.

Learning how to effectively quote and paraphrase research can be difficult
and it certainly takes practice. Hopefully, your abilities to make good use
of your research will improve as you work through the exercises in part
two and three ofThe Process of Research Writing, not to mention as you
take on other research writing experiences beyond this class. The goal of
this chapter is to introduce some basic strategies for summarizing, quoting
and paraphrasing research in your writing and to explain how to avoid
plagiarizing your research.

How to Summarize: An Overview

A summary is a brief explanation of a longer text. Some summaries, such
as the ones that accompany annotated bibliographies, are very short, just

                                              Quoting, Paraphrasing, and Avoiding Plagiarism | 99
a sentence or two. Others are much longer, though summaries are always
much shorter than the text being summarized in the first place.

   Summaries of different lengths are useful in research writing because you
often need to provide your readers with an explanation of the text you are
discussing. This is especially true when you are going to quote or paraphrase
from a source.

   Of course, the first step in writing a good summary is to do a thorough
reading of the text you are going to summarize in the first place. Beyond
that important start, there are a few basic guidelines you should follow when
you write summary material:

  · Stay "neutral" in your summarizing. Summaries provide "just the facts"
      and are not the place where you offer your opinions about the text you
      are summarizing. Save your opinions and evaluation of the evidence
      you are summarizing for other parts of your writing.

  · Don't quote from what you are summarizing. Summaries will be more
      useful to you and your colleagues if you write them in your own words.

  · Don't "cut and paste" from database abstracts. Many of the periodical
      indexes that are available as part of your library's computer system
      include abstracts of articles. Do no "cut" this abstract material and
      then "paste" it into your own annotated bibliography. For one thing,
      this is plagiarism. Second, "cutting and pasting" from the abstract
      defeats one of the purposes of writing summaries and creating an
      annotated bibliography in the first place, which is to help you
      understand and explain your research.

How to Quote and Paraphrase: An Overview

Writers quote and paraphrase from research in order to support their points
and to persuade their readers. A quote or a paraphrase from a piece of
evidence in support of a point answers the reader's question, "says who?"

   This is especially true in academic writing since scholarly readers are most
persuaded by effective research and evidence. For example, readers of an
article about a new cancer medication published in a medical journal will be
most interested in the scholar's research and statistics that demonstrate the
effectiveness of the treatment. Conversely, they will not be as persuaded

100 | Quoting, Paraphrasing, and Avoiding Plagiarism
by emotional stories from individual patients about how a new cancer
medication improved the quality of their lives. While this appeal to emotion
can be effective and is common in popular sources, these individual
anecdotes do not carry the same sort of "scholarly" or scientific value as
well-reasoned research and evidence.

   Of course, your instructor is not expecting you to be an expert on the topic
of your research paper. While you might conduct some primary research,
it's a good bet that you'll be relying on secondary sources such as books,
articles, and Web sites to inform and persuade your readers. You'll present
this research to your readers in the form of quotes and paraphrases.

   A "quote" is a direct restatement of the exact words from the original
source. The general rule of thumb is any time you use three or more words
as they appeared in the original source, you should treat it as a quote. A
"paraphrase" is a restatement of the information or point of the original
source in your own words.

   While quotes and paraphrases are different and should be used in different
ways in your research writing (as the examples in this section suggest),
they do have a number of things in common. Both quotes and paraphrases
should:

  · be "introduced" to the reader, particularly the first time you mention a
      source;

  · include an explanation of the evidence which explains to the reader
      why you think the evidence is important, especially if it is not apparent
      from the context of the quote or paraphrase; and

  · include a proper citation of the source.

The method you should follow to properly quote or paraphrase depends on
the style guide you are following in your academic writing. The two most
common style guides used in academic writing are the Modern Language
Association (MLA), and the American Psychological Association (APA). Your
instructor will probably assign one of these styles before you begin working
on your project, however, if he/she doesn't mention this, be sure to ask.

                                             Quoting, Paraphrasing, and Avoiding Plagiarism | 101
When to Quote, When to Paraphrase

The real "art" to research writing is using quotes and paraphrases from
evidence effectively in order to support your point. There are certain "rules,"
dictated by the rules of style you are following, such as the ones presented
by the MLA or the ones presented by the APA. There are certain "guidelines"
and suggestions, like the ones I offer in the previous section and the ones
you will learn from your teacher and colleagues.

   But when all is said and done, the question of when to quote and when to
paraphrase depends a great deal on the specific context of the writing and
the effect you are trying to achieve. Learning the best times to quote and
paraphrase takes practice and experience.

   In general, it is best to use a quote when:

  · The exact words of your source are important for the point you are
      trying to make. This is especially true if you are quoting technical
      language, terms, or very specific word choices.

  · You want to highlight your agreement with the author's words. If you
      agree with the point the author of the evidence makes and you like
      their exact words, use them as a quote.

  · You want to highlight your disagreement with the author's words. In
      other words, you may sometimes want to use a direct quote to indicate
      exactly what it is you disagree about. This might be particularly true
      when you are considering the antithetical positions in your research
      writing projects.

In general, it is best to paraphrase when:

  · There is no good reason to use a quote to refer to your evidence. If the
      author's exact words are not especially important to the point you are
      trying to make, you are usually better off paraphrasing the evidence.

  · You are trying to explain a particular a piece of evidence in order to
      explain or interpret it in more detail. This might be particularly true in
      writing projects like critiques.

  · You need to balance a direct quote in your writing. You need to be
      careful about directly quoting your research too much because it can
      sometimes make for awkward and difficult to read prose. So, one of the

102 | Quoting, Paraphrasing, and Avoiding Plagiarism
      reasons to use a paraphrase instead of a quote is to create balance
      within your writing.

Tips for Quoting and Paraphrasing

  · Introduce your quotes and paraphrases to your reader, especially on
      first reference.

  · Explain the significance of the quote or paraphrase to your reader.
  · Cite your quote or paraphrase properly according to the rules of style

      you are following in your essay.
  · Quote when the exact words are important, when you want to highlight

      your agreement or your disagreement.
  · Paraphrase when the exact words aren't important, when you want to

      explain the point of your evidence, or when you need to balance the
      direct quotes in your writing.

Four Examples of Quotes and Paraphrases

Here are four examples of what I mean about properly quoting and
paraphrasing evidence in your research essays. In each case, I begin with a
BAD example, or the way NOT to quote or paraphrase.

Quoting in MLA Style

Here's the first BAD example, where the writer is trying to follow the rules of
MLA style:

       There are many positive effects for advertising prescription drugs on
       television. "African-American physicians regard direct-to-consumer
       advertising of prescription medicines as one way to educate minority
       patients about needed treatment and healthcare options" (Wechsler,
       Internet).

This is a potentially good piece of information to support a research writer's
claim, but the researcher hasn't done any of the necessary work to explain

                                             Quoting, Paraphrasing, and Avoiding Plagiarism | 103
where this quote comes from or to explain why it is important for supporting
her point. Rather, she has simply "dropped in" the quote, leaving the
interpretation of its significance up to the reader.

   Now consider this revised GOOD (or at least BETTER) example of how this
quote might be better introduced into the essay:

       In her Pharmaceutical Executive article available through the Wilson
       Select Internet database, Jill Wechsler writes about one of the
       positive effects of advertising prescription drugs on television.
        "African-American physicians regard direct-to-consumer
       advertising of prescription medicines as one way to educate minority
       patients about needed treatment and healthcare options."

In this revision, it's much more clear what point the writer is trying to make
with this evidence and where this evidence comes from.

   In this particular example, the passage is from a traditional print journal
called Pharmaceutical Executive. However, the writer needs to indicate that
she actually found and read this article through Wilson Select, an Internet
database which reproduces the "full text" of articles from periodicals without
any graphics, charts, or page numbers.

   When you use a direct quote in your research, you need to the indicate
page number of that direct quote or you need to indicate that the evidence
has no specific page numbers. While it can be a bit awkward to indicate
within the text how the writer found this information if it's from the Internet,
it's important to do so on the first reference of a piece of evidence in your
writing. On references to this piece of evidence after the first reference, you
can use just the last name of the writer. For example:

       Wechsler also reports on the positive effects of advertising
       prescription drugs on television. She writes...

Paraphrasing in MLA Style

In this example, the writer is using MLA style to write a research essay for a
Literature class. Here is a BAD example of a paraphrase:

       While Gatsby is deeply in love with Daisy in The Great Gatsby, his

104 | Quoting, Paraphrasing, and Avoiding Plagiarism
       love for her is indistinguishable from his love of his possessions
       (Callahan).

There are two problems with this paraphrase. First, if this is the first or
only reference to this particular piece of evidence in the research essay, the
writer should include more information about the source of this paraphrase
in order to properly introduce it. Second, this paraphrase is actually not of
the entire article but rather of a specific passage. The writer has neglected
to note the page number within the parenthetical citation.

   A GOOD or at least BETTER revision of this paraphrase might look like this:

       John F. Callahan suggests in his article "F. Scott Fitzgerald's Evolving
       American Dream" that while Gatsby is deeply in love with Daisy in
       The Great Gatsby, his love for her is indistinguishable from his love of
       his possessions (381).

By incorporating the name of the author of the evidence the research writer
is referring to here, the source of this paraphrase is now clear to the reader.
Furthermore, because there is a page number at the end of this sentence,
the reader understands that this passage is a paraphrase of a particular
part of Callahan's essay and not a summary of the entire essay. Again, if the
research writer had introduced this source to his readers earlier, he could
have started with a phrase like "Callahan suggests..." and then continued on
with his paraphrase.

   If the research writer were offering a brief summary of the entire essay
following MLA style, he wouldn't include a page number in parentheses. For
example:

       John F. Callahan's article "F. Scott Fitzgerald's Evolving American
       Dream" examines Fitzgerald's fascination with the elusiveness of the
       American Dream in the novels The Great Gatsby, Tender is the Night,
       and The Last Tycoon.

Quoting in APA Style

Consider this BAD example in APA style, of what NOT to do when quoting
evidence:

                                             Quoting, Paraphrasing, and Avoiding Plagiarism | 105
       "If the U.S. scallop fishery were a business, its management would
       surely be fired, because its revenues could readily be increased by
       at least 50 percent while its costs were being reduced by an equal
       percentage." (Repetto, 2001, p. 84).

Again, this is a potentially valuable piece of evidence, but it simply isn't clear
what point the research writer is trying to make with it. Further, it doesn't
follow the preferred method of citation with APA style.

   Here is a revision that is a GOOD or at least BETTER example:

       Repetto (2001) concludes that in the case of the scallop industry,
       those running the industry should be held responsible for not
       considering methods that would curtail the problems of over-fishing.

         "If the U.S. scallop fishery were a business, its management would
       surely be fired, because its revenues could readily be increased by
       at least 50 percent while its costs were being reduced by an equal
       percentage" (p. 84).

This revision is improved because the research writer has introduced and
explained the point of the evidence with the addition of a clarifying sentence.
It also follows the rules of APA style. Generally, APA style prefers that the
research writer refer to the author only by last name followed immediately
by the year of publication. Whenever possible, you should begin your
citation with the author's last name and the year of publication, and, in the
case of a direct quote like this passage, the page number (including the "p.")
in parentheses at the end.

Paraphrasing in APA Style

Paraphrasing in APA style is slightly different from MLA style as well.
Consider first this BAD example of what NOT to do in paraphrasing from a
source in APA style:

       Computer criminals have lots of ways to get away with credit card
       fraud (Cameron, 2002).

The main problem with this paraphrase is there isn't enough here to
adequately explain to the reader what the point of the evidence really is.

106 | Quoting, Paraphrasing, and Avoiding Plagiarism
Remember: your readers have no way of automatically knowing why you
as a research writer think that a particular piece of evidence is useful in
supporting your point. This is why it is key that you introduce and explain
your evidence.

   Here is a revision that is GOOD or at least BETTER:

       Cameron (2002) points out that computer criminals intent on
       committing credit card fraud are able to take advantage of the fact
       that there aren't enough officials working to enforce computer
       crimes. Criminals are also able to use the technology to their
       advantage by communicating via email and chat rooms with other
       criminals.

Again, this revision is better because the additional information introduces
and explains the point of the evidence. In this particular example, the
author's name is also incorporated into the explanation of the evidence as
well. In APA, it is preferable to weave in the author's name into your essay,
usually at the beginning of a sentence. However, it would also have been
acceptable to end an improved paraphrase with just the author's last name
and the date of publication in parentheses.

How to Avoid Plagiarism in the Research Process

Plagiarism is the unauthorized or uncredited use of the writings or ideas of
another in your writing. While it might not be as tangible as auto theft or
burglary, plagiarism is still a form of theft.

   In the academic world, plagiarism is a serious matter because ideas in
the forms of research, creative work, and original thought are highly valued.
Chances are, your school has strict rules about what happens when
someone is caught plagiarizing. The penalty for plagiarism is severe,
everything from a failing grade for the plagiarized work, a failing grade for
the class, or expulsion from the institution.

   You might not be aware that plagiarism can take several different forms.
The most well known, purposeful plagiarism , is handing in an essay written
by someone else and representing it as your own, copying your essay word

                                             Quoting, Paraphrasing, and Avoiding Plagiarism | 107
for word from a magazine or journal, or downloading an essay from the
Internet.

   A much more common and less understood phenomenon is what I call
accidental plagiarism. Accidental plagiarism is the result of improperly
paraphrasing, summarizing, quoting, or citing your evidence in your
academic writing. Generally, writers accidentally plagiarize because they
simply don't know or they fail to follow the rules for giving credit to the ideas
of others in their writing.

   Both purposeful and accidental plagiarism are wrong, against the rules,
and can result in harsh punishments. Ignoring or not knowing the rules of
how to not plagiarize and properly cite evidence might be an explanation,
but it is not anexcuse.

   To exemplify what I'm getting at, consider the examples below that use
quotations and paraphrases from this brief passage:

   Those who denounce cyberculture today strangely resemble those who
criticized rock music during the fifties and sixties. Rock started out as an
Anglo-American phenomenon and has become an industry. Nonetheless,
it was able to capture the hopes of young people around the world and
provided enjoyment to those of us who listened to or played rock. Sixties
pop was the conscience of one or two generations that helped bring the
war in Vietnam to a close. Obviously, neither rock nor pop has solved global
poverty or hunger. But is this a reason to be "against" them? (ix).

   And just to make it clear that I'm not plagiarizing this passage, here is the
citation in MLA style:

     Works Cited

        Lévy, Pierre. Cyberculture. Trans. Robert Bononno. Minneapolis:
      U of Minnesota P, 2001.

Here's an obvious example of plagiarism:

108 | Quoting, Paraphrasing, and Avoiding Plagiarism
       Those who denounce cyberculture today strangely resemble those
       who criticized rock music during the fifties and sixties.

In this case, the writer has literally taken one of Lévy's sentences and
represented it as her own. That's clearly against the rules.

   Here's another example of plagiarism, perhaps less obvious:

       The same kind of people who criticize cyberculture are the same kind
       of people who criticized rock and roll music back in the fifties and
       sixties. But both cyberculture and rock music inspire and entertain
       young people.

While these aren't Lévy's exact words, they are certainly close enough to
constitute a form of plagiarism. And again, even though you might think that
this is a "lesser" form of plagiarism, it's still plagiarism.

   Both of these passages can easily be corrected to make them acceptable
quotations or paraphrases.

       In the introduction of his book Cyberculture, Pierre Lévy observes
       that "Those who denounce cyberculture today strangely resemble
       those who criticized rock music during the fifties and sixties" (ix).

          Pierre Lévy suggests that the same kind of people who criticize
       cyberculture are the same kind of people who criticized rock and roll
       music back in the fifties and sixties. But both cyberculture and rock
       music inspire and entertain young people (ix).

Note that changing these passages from examples of plagiarism to
acceptable examples of a quotation and a paraphrase is extremely easy:
properly cite your sources.

   This leads to the "golden rule" of avoiding plagiarism:

     The Golden Rule of Avoiding Plagiarism

         · Always cite your sources. If you are unsure as to whether

                                             Quoting, Paraphrasing, and Avoiding Plagiarism | 109
             you should or should not cite a particular claim or reference,
             you should probably cite your source.

Often, students are unclear as to whether or not they need to cite a piece
of evidence because they believe it to be "common knowledge" or because
they are not sure about the source of information. When in doubt about
whether or not to cite evidence in order to give credit to a source ("common
knowledge" or not), you should cite the evidence.

Plagiarism and the Internet

Sometimes, I think the ease of finding and retrieving information on the
World Wide Web makes readers think that this information does not need to
be cited. After all, it isn't a traditional source like a book or a journal; it is
available for "free." All a research writer needs to do with a web site is "cut
and paste" whatever he needs into his essay, right? Wrong!

   You need to cite the evidence you find from the Internet or the World
Wide Web the same way you cite evidence from other sources. To not do
this is plagiarism, or, more bluntly, cheating. Just because the information is
"freely" available on the Internet does not mean you can use this information
in your academic writing without properly citing it, much in the same way
that the information from library journals and books "freely" available to you
needs to be cited in order to give credit where credit is due.

   It is also not acceptable to simply download graphics from the World Wide
Web. Images found on the Internet are protected by copyright laws. Quite
literally, taking images from the Web (particularly from commercial sources)
is an offense that could lead to legal action. There are places where you can
find graphics and clip art that Web publishers have made publicly available
for anyone to use, but be sure that the Web site where you find the graphics
makes this explicit before you take graphics as your own.

   In short, you can use evidence from the Web as long as you don't plagiarize

110 | Quoting, Paraphrasing, and Avoiding Plagiarism
and as long as you properly cite it; don't take graphics from the Web unless
you know the images are in the public domain.

          This piece was originally Chapter 3 from The Process of
       Research Writing.

information.

   Of course, the technological advances of the past few
decades--particularly the rise of online media--mean that, as a twenty-first-
century student, you have countless sources of information available at your
fingertips. But how can you tell whether a source is reliable? This section
will discuss strategies for evaluating sources critically so that you can be a
media-savvy researcher.

   In this section, you will locate and evaluate resources for your paper
and begin taking notes. As you read, begin gathering print and electronic
resources, identify at least eight to ten sources by the time you finish the
chapter, and begin taking notes on your research findings.

Locating Useful Resources

When you chose a paper topic and determined your research questions, you
conducted preliminary research to stimulate your thinking. Your research
proposal included some general ideas for how to go about your research--for
instance, interviewing an expert in the field or analyzing the content of
popular magazines. You may even have identified a few potential sources.
Now it is time to conduct a more focused, systematic search for informative
primary and secondary sources.

Using Primary and Secondary Sources

Writers classify research resources in two categories: primary sources and
secondary sources.Primary sources are direct, firsthand sources of
information or data. For example, if you were writing a paper about the First
Amendment right to freedom of speech, the text of the First Amendment in
the Bill of Rights would be a primary source.

   Other primary sources include the following:

  · Research articles
  · Literary texts
  · Historical documents such as diaries or letters
  · Autobiographies or other personal accounts

Secondary sources discuss, interpret, analyze, consolidate, or otherwise
rework information from primary sources. In researching a paper about the
First Amendment, you might read articles about legal cases that involved
First Amendment rights, or editorials expressing commentary on the First
Amendment. These sources would be considered secondary sources because
they are one step removed from the primary source of information.

   The following are examples of secondary sources:

  · Magazine articles
  · Biographical books
  · Literary and scientific reviews
  · Television documentaries

                                                 Strategies for Gathering Reliable Information | 113
Your topic and purpose determine whether you must cite both primary
and secondary sources in your paper. Ask yourself which sources are most
likely to provide the information that will answer your research questions.
If you are writing a research paper about reality television shows, you will
need to use some reality shows as a primary source, but secondary sources,
such as a reviewer's critique, are also important. If you are writing about
the health effects of nicotine, you will probably want to read the published
results of scientific studies, but secondary sources, such as magazine articles
discussing the outcome of a recent study, may also be helpful.

   Once you have thought about what kinds of sources are most likely to
help you answer your research questions, you may begin your search for
print and electronic resources. The challenge here is to conduct your search
efficiently. Writers use strategies to help them find the sources that are most
relevant and reliable while steering clear of sources that will not be useful.

Finding Print Resources

Print resources include a vast array of documents and publications.
Regardless of your topic, you will consult some print resources as part
of your research. (You will use electronic sources as well, but it is not
wise to limit yourself to electronic sources only, because some potentially
useful sources may be available only in print form.) Table 11.1 "Library Print
Resources" lists different types of print resources available at public and
university libraries.

Table 11.1 Library Print Resources
   Some of these resources are also widely available in electronic format. In

addition to the resources noted in the table, library holdings may include
primary texts such as historical documents, letters, and diaries.

Writing at Work

Businesses, government organizations, and nonprofit organizations produce
published materials that range from brief advertisements and brochures
to lengthy, detailed reports. In many cases, producing these publications
requires research. A corporation's annual report may include research about
economic or industry trends. A charitable organization may use information
from research in materials sent to potential donors.

   Regardless of the industry you work in, you may be asked to assist in
developing materials for publication. Often, incorporating research in these
documents can make them more effective in informing or persuading
readers.

          Tip
          As you gather information, strive for a balance of accessible,
       easy-to-read sources and more specialized, challenging sources.
       Relying solely on lightweight books and articles written for a
       general audience will drastically limit the range of useful,
       substantial information. On the other hand, restricting oneself to
       dense, scholarly works could make the process of researching
       extremely time-consuming and frustrating.

116 | Strategies for Gathering Reliable Information
     Exercise 1

        Make a list of five types of print resources you could use to find
     information about your research topic. Include at least one primary
     source. Be as specific as possible--if you have a particular resource
     or type of resource in mind, describe it.

        To find print resources efficiently, first identify the major
     concepts and terms you will use to conduct your search--that is,
     your keywords. These will help you find sources using any of the
     following methods:

         · Using the library's online catalog or card catalog
         · Using periodicals indexes and databases
         · Consulting a reference librarian
        You probably already have some keywords in mind based on your
     preliminary research and writing. Another way to identify useful
     keywords is to visit the Library of Congress's website
     athttp://id.loc.gov/authorities. This site allows you to search for a
     topic and see the related subject headings used by the Library of
     Congress, including broader terms, narrower terms, and related
     terms. Other libraries use these terms to classify materials. Knowing
     the most-used terms will help you speed up your keyword search.

Jorge used the Library of Congress site to identify general terms he could
use to find resources about low-carb dieting. His search helped him identify
potentially useful keywords and related topics, such as carbohydrates in
human nutrition, glycemic index, and carbohydrates--metabolism. These
terms helped Jorge refine his search.

          Tip
          Knowing the right keywords can sometimes make all the
       difference in conducting a successful search. If you have trouble
       finding sources on a topic, consult a librarian to see whether you
       need to modify your search terms.

     Exercise 2

        Visit the Library of Congress's website at Library of Congress
     Subject Headings and conduct searches on a few terms related to
     your topic.

         1. Review your search results and identify six to eight
             additional terms you might use when you conduct your
             research.

        2. Print out the search results or save the results to your
             research folder on your computer or portable storage device.

Using Periodicals, Indexes, and Databases

Library catalogs can help you locate book-length sources, as well as some
types of nonprint holdings, such as CDs, DVDs, and audio books. To locate
shorter sources, such as magazine and journal articles, you will need to use
a periodical index or an online periodical database. These tools index the
articles that appear in newspapers, magazines, and journals. Like catalogs,

118 | Strategies for Gathering Reliable Information
they provide publication information about an article and often allow users
to access a summary or even the full text of the article.

   Print indexes may be available in the periodicals section of your library.
Increasingly, libraries use online databases that users can access through the
library website. A single library may provide access to multiple periodical
databases. These can range from general news databases to specialized
databases. Table 11.2 "Commonly Used Indexes and Databases" describes
some commonly used indexes and databases.

Reading Popular and Scholarly Periodicals

When you search for periodicals, be sure to distinguish among different
types. Mass-market publications, such as newspapers and popular
magazines, differ from scholarly publications in their accessibility, audience,
and purpose.

   Newspapers and magazines are written for a broader audience than
scholarly journals. Their content is usually quite accessible and easy to read.
Trade magazines that target readers within a particular industry may
presume the reader has background knowledge, but these publications are

                                                 Strategies for Gathering Reliable Information | 119
still reader-friendly for a broader audience. Their purpose is to inform and,
often, to entertain or persuade readers as well.

   Scholarly or academic journals are written for a much smaller and more
expert audience. The creators of these publications assume that most of
their readers are already familiar with the main topic of the journal. The
target audience is also highly educated. Informing is the primary purpose
of a scholarly journal. While a journal article may advance an agenda or
advocate a position, the content will still be presented in an objective style
and formal tone. Entertaining readers with breezy comments and splashy
graphics is not a priority.

   Because of these differences, scholarly journals are more challenging to
read. That doesn't mean you should avoid them. On the contrary, they can
provide in-depth information unavailable elsewhere. Because knowledgeable
professionals carefully review the content before publication, scholarly
journals are far more reliable than much of the information available in
popular media. Seek out academic journals along with other resources. Just
be prepared to spend a little more time processing the information.

Writing at Work

Periodicals databases are not just for students writing research papers. They
also provide a valuable service to workers in various fields. The owner of a
small business might use a database such as Business Source Premiere to
find articles on management, finance, or trends within a particular industry.
Health care professionals might consult databases such as MedLine to
research a particular disease or medication. Regardless of what career path
you plan to pursue, periodicals databases can be a useful tool for researching
specific topics and identifying periodicals that will help you keep up with the
latest news in your industry.

Consulting a Reference Librarian

Sifting through library stacks and database search results to find the
information you need can be like trying to find a needle in a haystack. If

120 | Strategies for Gathering Reliable Information
you are not sure how you should begin your search, or if it is yielding too
many or too few results, you are not alone. Many students find this process
challenging, although it does get easier with experience. One way to learn
better search strategies is to consult a reference librarian.

   Reference librarians are intimately familiar with the systems libraries use
to organize and classify information. They can help you locate a particular
book in the library stacks, steer you toward useful reference works, and
provide tips on how to use databases and other electronic research tools.
Take the time to see what resources you can find on your own, but if you
encounter difficulties, ask for help. Many university librarians hold virtual
office hours and are available for online chatting.

     Exercise 3

        Visit your library's website or consult with a reference librarian to
     determine what periodicals indexes or databases would be useful
     for your research. Depending on your topic, you may rely on a
     general news index, a specialized index for a particular subject area,
     or both. Search the catalog for your topic and related keywords.
     Print out or bookmark your search results.

         1. Identify at least one to two relevant periodicals, indexes, or
             databases.

        2. Conduct a keyword search to find potentially relevant
             articles on your topic.

        3. Save your search results. If the index you are using provides
             article summaries, read these to determine how useful the
             articles are likely to be.

        4. Identify at least three to five articles to review more closely.
             If the full article is available online, set aside time to read it. If
             not, plan to visit our library within the next few days to locate
             the articles you need.

          Tip
          One way to refine your keyword search is to use Boolean
       operators. These operators allow you to combine keywords, find
       variations on a word, and otherwise expand or limit your results.
       Here are some of the ways you can use Boolean operators:

            · Combine keywords with and or + to limit results to
                citations that include both keywords--for example, diet +
                nutrition.

            · Combine keywords with not or - to search for the first
                word without the second. This can help you eliminate
                irrelevant results based on words that are similar to your
                search term. For example, searching for obesity not
                childhood locates materials on obesity but excludes
                materials on childhood obesity.

            · Enclose a phrase in quotation marks to search for an
                exact phrase, such as "morbid obesity."

            · Use parentheses to direct the order of operations in a
                search string. For example, since Type II diabetes is also
                known as adult-onset diabetes, you could search (Type II
                or adult-onset) and diabetes to limit your search results to
                articles on this form of the disease.

            · Use a wildcard symbol such as #, ?, or $ after a word to
                search for variations on a term. For instance, you might
                type diabet# to search for information on diabetes and
                diabetics. The specific symbol used varies with different
                databases.

Finding and Using Electronic Resources

With the expansion of technology and media over the past few decades, a

122 | Strategies for Gathering Reliable Information
wealth of information is available to you in electronic format. Some types
of resources, such as a television documentary, may only be available
electronically. Other resources--for instance, many newspapers and
magazines--may be available in both print and electronic form. The following
are some of the electronic sources you might consult:

  · Online databases
  · CD-ROMs
  · Popular web search engines
  · Websites maintained by businesses, universities, nonprofit

      organizations, or government agencies
  · Newspapers, magazines, and journals published on the web
  · E-books
  · Audio books
  · Industry blogs
  · Radio and television programs and other audio and video recordings
  · Online discussion groups

The techniques you use to locate print resources can also help you find
electronic resources efficiently. Libraries usually include CD-ROMs, audio
books, and audio and video recordings among their holdings. You can locate
these materials in the catalog using a keyword search. The same Boolean
operators used to refine database searches can help you filter your results in
popular search engines.

Using Internet Search Engines Efficiently

When faced with the challenge of writing a research paper, some students
rely on popular search engines as their first source of information. Typing
a keyword or phrase into a search engine instantly pulls up links to dozens,
hundreds, or even thousands of related websites--what could be easier?
Unfortunately, despite its apparent convenience, this research strategy has
the following drawbacks to consider:

  · Results do not always appear in order of reliability. The first few hits
      that appear in search results may include sites whose content is not

                                                 Strategies for Gathering Reliable Information | 123
      always reliable, such as online encyclopedias that can be edited by any
      user. Because websites are created by third parties, the search engine
      cannot tell you which sites have accurate information.
  · Results may be too numerous for you to use. The amount of
      information available on the web is far greater than the amount of
      information housed within a particular library or database. Realistically,
      if your web search pulls up thousands of hits, you will not be able to
      visit every site--and the most useful sites may be buried deep within
      your search results.
  · Search engines are not connected to the results of the search. Search
      engines find websites that people visit often and list the results in order
      of popularity. The search engine, then, is not connected to any of the
      results. When you cite a source found through a search engine, you do
      not need to cite the search engine. Only cite the source.

A general web search can provide a helpful overview of a topic and may
pull up genuinely useful resources. To get the most out of a search engine,
however, use strategies to make your search more efficient. Use multiple
keywords and Boolean operators to limit your results. Click on the Advanced
Search link on the homepage to find additional options for streamlining
your search. Depending on the specific search engine you use, the following
options may be available:

  · Limit results to websites that have been updated within a particular
      time frame.

  · Limit results by language or country.
  · Limit results to scholarly works available online.
  · Limit results by file type.
  · Limit results to a particular domain type, such as .edu (school and

      university sites) or .gov (government sites). This is a quick way to filter
      out commercial sites, which can often lead to more objective results.

Use the Bookmarks or Favorites feature of your web browser to save and
organize sites that look promising.

124 | Strategies for Gathering Reliable Information
Using Other Information Sources: Interviews

With so many print and electronic media readily available, it is easy to
overlook another valuable information resource: other people. Consider
whether you could use a person or group as a primary source. For instance,
you might interview a professor who has expertise in a particular subject,
a worker within a particular industry, or a representative from a political
organization. Interviews can be a great way to get firsthand information.

   To get the most out of an interview, you will need to plan ahead. Contact
your subject early in the research process and explain your purpose for
requesting an interview. Prepare detailed questions. Open-ended questions,
rather than questions with simple yes-or-no answers, are more likely to lead
to an in-depth discussion. Schedule a time to meet, and be sure to obtain
your subject's permission to record the interview. Take careful notes and be
ready to ask follow-up questions based on what you learn.

          Tip
          If scheduling an in-person meeting is difficult, consider
       arranging a telephone interview or asking your subject to
       respond to your questions via e-mail. Recognize that any of
       these formats takes time and effort. Be prompt and courteous,
       avoid going over the allotted interview time, and be flexible if
       your subject needs to reschedule.

Evaluating Research Resources

As you gather sources, you will need to examine them with a critical eye.
Smart researchers continually ask themselves two questions: "Is this source
relevant to my purpose?" and "Is this source reliable?" The first question will
help you avoid wasting valuable time reading sources that stray too far from

                                                Strategies for Gathering Reliable Information | 125
your specific topic and research questions. The second question will help
you find accurate, trustworthy sources.

Determining Whether a Source Is Relevant

At this point in your research process, you may have identified dozens of
potential sources. It is easy for writers to get so caught up in checking out
books and printing out articles that they forget to ask themselves how they
will use these resources in their research. Now is a good time to get a little
ruthless. Reading and taking notes takes time and energy, so you will want to
focus on the most relevant sources.

   To weed through your stack of books and articles, skim their contents.
Read quickly with your research questions and subtopics in mind. Table
11.3 "Tips for Skimming Books and Articles" explains how to skim to get a
quick sense of what topics are covered. If a book or article is not especially
relevant, put it aside. You can always come back to it later if you need to.

Determining Whether a Source Is Reliable

All information sources are not created equal. Sources can vary greatly in
126 | Strategies for Gathering Reliable Information
terms of how carefully they are researched, written, edited, and reviewed
for accuracy. Common sense will help you identify obviously questionable
sources, such as tabloids that feature tales of alien abductions, or personal
websites with glaring typos. Sometimes, however, a source's reliability--or
lack of it--is not so obvious.

   To evaluate your research sources, you will use critical thinking skills
consciously and deliberately. You will consider criteria such as the type
of source, its intended purpose and audience, the author's (or authors')
qualifications, the publication's reputation, any indications of bias or hidden
agendas, how current the source is, and the overall quality of the writing,
thinking, and design.

Evaluating Types of Sources

The different types of sources you will consult are written for distinct
purposes and with different audiences in mind. This accounts for other
differences, such as the following:

  · How thoroughly the writers cover a given topic
  · How carefully the writers research and document facts
  · How editors review the work
  · What biases or agendas affect the content

A journal article written for an academic audience for the purpose of
expanding scholarship in a given field will take an approach quite different
from a magazine feature written to inform a general audience. Textbooks,
hard news articles, and websites approach a subject from different angles
as well. To some extent, the type of source provides clues about its overall
depth and reliability. Table 11.4 "Source Rankings" ranks different source
types.

                                                         rooms

   Tip

   Free online encyclopedias and wikis may seem like a great
source of information. They usually appear among the first few
results of a web search. They cover thousands of topics, and
many articles use an informal, straightforward writing style.
Unfortunately, these sites have no control system for
researching, writing, and reviewing articles. Instead, they rely on
a community of users to police themselves. At best, these sites
can be a starting point for finding other, more trustworthy
sources. Never use them as final sources.

Evaluating Credibility and Reputability

Even when you are using a type of source that is generally reliable, you will
still need to evaluate the author's credibility and the publication itself on an
individual basis. To examine the author's credibility--that is, how much you
can believe of what the author has to say--examine his or her credentials.
What career experience or academic study shows that the author has the
expertise to write about this topic?

   Keep in mind that expertise in one field is no guarantee of expertise

                                                Strategies for Gathering Reliable Information | 129
in another, unrelated area. For instance, an author may have an advanced
degree in physiology, but this credential is not a valid qualification for writing
about psychology. Check credentials carefully.

   Just as important as the author's credibility is the publication's overall
reputability. Reputabilityrefers to a source's standing and reputation as a
respectable, reliable source of information. An established and well-known
newspaper, such as the New York Times or the Wall Street Journal, is more
reputable than a college newspaper put out by comparatively inexperienced
students. A website that is maintained by a well-known, respected
organization and regularly updated is more reputable than one created by an
unknown author or group.

   If you are using articles from scholarly journals, you can check databases
that keep count of how many times each article has been cited in other
articles. This can be a rough indication of the article's quality or, at the very
least, of its influence and reputation among other scholars.

   Checking for Biases and Hidden Agendas
   Whenever you consult a source, always think carefully about the author's
or authors' purpose in presenting the information. Few sources present facts
completely objectively. In some cases, the source's content and tone are
significantly influenced by biases or hidden agendas.
   Bias refers to favoritism or prejudice toward a particular person or group.
For instance, an author may be biased against a certain political party and
present information in a way that subtly--or not so subtly--makes that
organization look bad. Bias can lead an author to present facts selectively,
edit quotations to misrepresent someone's words, and distort information.
   Hidden agendas are goals that are not immediately obvious but influence
how an author presents the facts. For instance, an article about the role
of beef in a healthy diet would be questionable if it were written by a
representative of the beef industry--or by the president of an animal-rights
organization. In both cases, the author would likely have a hidden agenda.
   As Jorge conducted his research, he read several research studies in which
scientists found significant benefits to following a low-carbohydrate diet. He
also noticed that many studies were sponsored by a foundation associated
with the author of a popular series of low-carbohydrate diet books. Jorge
read these studies with a critical eye, knowing that a hidden agenda might
be shaping the researchers' conclusions.

130 | Strategies for Gathering Reliable Information
Using Current Sources

Be sure to seek out sources that are current, or up to date. Depending on
the topic, sources may become outdated relatively soon after publication, or
they may remain useful for years. For instance, online social networking sites
have evolved rapidly over the past few years. An article published in 2002
about this topic will not provide current information. On the other hand,
a research paper on elementary education practices might refer to studies
published decades ago by influential child psychologists.

   When using websites for research, check to see when the site was last
updated. Many sites publish this information on the homepage, and some,
such as news sites, are updated daily or weekly. Many nonfunctioning links
are a sign that a website is not regularly updated. Do not be afraid to ask your
professor for suggestions if you find that many of your most relevant sources
are not especially reliable--or that the most reliable sources are not relevant.

Evaluating Overall Quality by Asking Questions

When you evaluate a source, you will consider the criteria previously
discussed as well as your overall impressions of its quality. Read carefully,
and notice how well the author presents and supports his or her statements.
Stay actively engaged--do not simply accept an author's words as truth. Ask
questions to determine each source's value. Checklist 11.1 lists ten questions
to ask yourself as a critical reader.

          Checklist 11.1
          Source Evaluation
            · Is the type of source appropriate for my purpose? Is it a

                high-quality source or one that needs to be looked at more
                critically?

                                                 Strategies for Gathering Reliable Information | 131
            · Can I establish that the author is credible and the
                publication is reputable?

            · Does the author support ideas with specific facts and
                details that are carefully documented? Is the source of the
                author's information clear? (When you use secondary
                sources, look for sources that are not too removed from
                primary research.)

            · Does the source include any factual errors or instances
                of faulty logic?

            · Does the author leave out any information that I would
                expect to see in a discussion of this topic?

            · Do the author's conclusions logically follow from the
                evidence that is presented? Can I see how the author got
                from one point to another?

            · Is the writing clear and organized, and is it free from
                errors, clichés, and empty buzzwords? Is the tone
                objective, balanced, and reasonable? (Be on the lookout for
                extreme, emotionally charged language.)

            · Are there any obvious biases or agendas? Based on what
                I know about the author, are there likely to be any hidden
                agendas?

            · Are graphics informative, useful, and easy to
                understand? Are websites organized, easy to navigate, and
                free of clutter like flashing ads and unnecessary sound
                effects?

            · Is the source contradicted by information found in other
                sources? (If so, it is possible that your sources are
                presenting similar information but taking different
                perspectives, which requires you to think carefully about
                which sources you find more convincing and why. Be
                suspicious, however, of any source that presents facts that
                you cannot confirm elsewhere.)

132 | Strategies for Gathering Reliable Information
Writing at Work

The critical thinking skills you use to evaluate research sources as a student
are equally valuable when you conduct research on the job. If you follow
certain periodicals or websites, you have probably identified publications
that consistently provide reliable information. Reading blogs and online
discussion groups is a great way to identify new trends and hot topics
in a particular field, but these sources should not be used for substantial
research.

     Exercise 4

        Use a search engine to conduct a web search on your topic. Refer
     to the tips provided earlier to help you streamline your search.
     Evaluate your search results critically based on the criteria you have
     learned. Identify and bookmark one or more websites that are
     reliable, reputable, and likely to be useful in your research.

Managing Source Information

As you determine which sources you will rely on most, it is important to
establish a system for keeping track of your sources and taking notes. There
are several ways to go about it, and no one system is necessarily superior.
What matters is that you keep materials in order; record bibliographical
information you will need later; and take detailed, organized notes.

                                                Strategies for Gathering Reliable Information | 133
Keeping Track of Your Sources

Think ahead to a moment a few weeks from now, when you've written your
research paper and are almost ready to submit it for a grade. There is just
one task left--writing your list of sources.

   As you begin typing your list, you realize you need to include the
publication information for a book you cited frequently. Unfortunately, you
already returned it to the library several days ago. You do not remember
the URLs for some of the websites you used or the dates you accessed
them--information that also must be included in your bibliography. With a
sinking feeling, you realize that finding this information and preparing your
bibliography will require hours of work.

   This stressful scenario can be avoided. Taking time to organize source
information now will ensure that you are not scrambling to find it at the
last minute. Throughout your research, record bibliographical information
for each source as soon as you begin using it. You may use pen-and-paper
methods, such as a notebook or note cards, or maintain an electronic list. (If
you prefer the latter option, many office software packages include separate
programs for recording bibliographic information.)

   Table 11.5 "Details for Commonly Used Source Types" shows the specific
details you should record for commonly used source types. Use these details
to develop a working bibliography--a preliminary list of sources that you
will later use to develop the references section of your paper. You may
wish to record information using the formatting system of the American
Psychological Association (APA) or the Modern Language Association (MLA),
which will save a step later on.

 Exercise 5

   Create a working bibliography using the format that is most
convenient for you. List at least five sources you plan to use.
Continue to add sources to your working bibliography throughout
the research process.

         Tip
         To make your working bibliography even more complete, you
      may wish to record additional details, such as a book's call
      number or contact information for a person you interviewed.

                                              Strategies for Gathering Reliable Information | 135
       That way, if you need to locate a source again, you have all the
       information you need right at your fingertips. You may also wish
       to assign each source a code number to use when taking notes (1,
       2, 3, or a similar system).

Taking Notes Efficiently

Good researchers stay focused and organized as they gather information
from sources. Before you begin taking notes, take a moment to step back
and think about your goal as a researcher--to find information that will help
you answer your research question. When you write your paper, you will
present your conclusions about the topic supported by research. That goal
will determine what information you record and how you organize it.

   Writers sometimes get caught up in taking extensive notes, so much so
that they lose sight of how their notes relate to the questions and ideas they
started out with. Remember that you do not need to write down every detail
from your reading. Focus on finding and recording details that will help you
answer your research questions. The following strategies will help you take
notes efficiently.

Use Headings to Organize Ideas

Whether you use old-fashioned index cards or organize your notes using
word-processing software, record just one major point from each source at
a time, and use a heading to summarize the information covered. Keep all
your notes in one file, digital or otherwise. Doing so will help you identify
connections among different pieces of information. It will also help you make
connections between your notes and the research questions and subtopics
you identified earlier.

136 | Strategies for Gathering Reliable Information
Know When to Summarize, Paraphrase, or Directly Quote a Source

Your notes will fall under three categories--summary notes, paraphrased
information, and direct quotations from your sources. Effective researchers
make choices about which type of notes is most appropriate for their
purpose.

  · Summary notes sum up the main ideas in a source in a few sentences or
      a short paragraph. A summary is considerably shorter than the original
      text and captures only the major ideas. Use summary notes when you
      do not need to record specific details but you intend to refer to broad
      concepts the author discusses.

  · Paraphrased notes restate a fact or idea from a source using your own
      words and sentence structure.

  · Direct quotations use the exact wording used by the original source
      and enclose the quoted material in quotation marks. It is a good
      strategy to copy direct quotations when an author expresses an idea in
      an especially lively or memorable way. However, do not rely exclusively
      on direct quotations in your note taking.

Most of your notes should be paraphrased from the original source.
Paraphrasing as you take notes is usually a better strategy than copying
direct quotations, because it forces you to think through the information in
your source and understand it well enough to restate it. In short, it helps
you stay engaged with the material instead of simply copying and pasting.
Synthesizing will help you later when you begin planning and drafting your
paper.

Maintain Complete, Accurate Notes

Regardless of the format used, any notes you take should include enough
information to help you organize ideas and locate them instantly in the
original text if you need to review them. Make sure your notes include the
following elements:

  · Heading summing up the main topic covered

                                                 Strategies for Gathering Reliable Information | 137
  · Author's name, a source code, or an abbreviated source title
  · Page number
  · Full URL of any pages buried deep in a website

Throughout the process of taking notes, be scrupulous about making sure
you have correctly attributed each idea to its source. Always include source
information so you know exactly which ideas came from which sources. Use
quotation marks to set off any words for phrases taken directly from the
original text. If you add your own responses and ideas, make sure they are
distinct from ideas you quoted or paraphrased.

   Finally, make sure your notes accurately reflect the content of the original
text. Make sure quoted material is copied verbatim. If you omit words from
a quotation, use ellipses to show the omission and make sure the omission
does not change the author's meaning. Paraphrase ideas carefully, and check
your paraphrased notes against the original text to make sure that you have
restated the author's ideas accurately in your own words.

Use a System That Works for You

There are several formats you can use to take notes. No technique is
necessarily better than the others--it is more important to choose a format
you are comfortable using. Choosing the format that works best for you
will ensure your notes are organized, complete, and accurate. Consider
implementing one of these formats when you begin taking notes:

  · Use index cards. This traditional format involves writing each note on a
      separate index card. It takes more time than copying and pasting into
      an electronic document, which encourages you to be selective in
      choosing which ideas to record. Recording notes on separate cards
      makes it easy to later organize your notes according to major topics.
      Some writers color-code their cards to make them still more organized.

  · Use note-taking software. Word-processing and office software
      packages often include different types of note-taking software.
      Although you may need to set aside some time to learn the software,
      this method combines the speed of typing with the same degree of
      organization associated with handwritten note cards.

138 | Strategies for Gathering Reliable Information
  · Maintain a research notebook. Instead of using index cards or
      electronic note cards, you may wish to keep a notebook or electronic
      folder, allotting a few pages (or one file) for each of your sources. This
      method makes it easy to create a separate column or section of the
      document where you add your responses to the information you
      encounter in your research.

  · Annotate your sources. This method involves making handwritten
      notes in the margins of sources that you have printed or photocopied.
      If using electronic sources, you can make comments within the source
      document. For example, you might add comment boxes to a PDF
      version of an article. This method works best for experienced
      researchers who have already thought a great deal about the topic
      because it can be difficult to organize your notes later when starting
      your draft.

Choose one of the methods from the list to use for taking notes. Continue
gathering sources and taking notes. In the next section, you will learn
strategies for organizing and synthesizing the information you have found.

     Key Takeaways

         · A writer's use of primary and secondary sources is
             determined by the topic and purpose of the research. Sources
             used may include print sources, such as books and journals;
             electronic sources, such as websites and articles retrieved
             from databases; and human sources of information, such as
             interviews.

         · Strategies that help writers locate sources efficiently
             include conducting effective keyword searches,
             understanding how to use online catalogs and databases,
             using strategies to narrow web search results, and consulting
             reference librarians.

         · Writers evaluate sources based on how relevant they are to

                                                Strategies for Gathering Reliable Information | 139
             the research question and how reliable their content is.
         · Skimming sources can help writers determine their

             relevance efficiently.
         · Writers evaluate a source's reliability by asking questions

             about the type of source (including its audience and purpose);
             the author's credibility, the publication's reputability, the
             source's currency, and the overall quality of the writing,
             research, logic, and design in the source.
         · In their notes, effective writers record organized, complete,
             accurate information. This includes bibliographic information
             about each source as well as summarized, paraphrased, or
             quoted information from the source.

Seven Steps of the Research
Process

CORNELL UNIVERSITY LIBRARY

     Learning Objectives

         · Find appropriate information for a college-level research
             paper.

         · Cite sources using standard citation rules.

The following seven steps outline a simple and effective strategy for finding
information for a research paper and documenting the sources you find.
Depending on your topic and your familiarity with the library, you may need
to rearrange or recycle these steps. Adapt this outline to your needs.

STEP 1: IDENTIFY AND DEVELOP YOUR TOPIC

State your topic idea as a question. For example, if you are interested in
finding out about use of alcoholic beverages by college students, you might
pose the question, "What effect does use of alcoholic beverages have on
the health of college students?" Identify the main concepts or keywords in
your question. In this case they are alcoholic beverages, health, and college
students.

                                                             Seven Steps of the Research Process | 141
STEP 2: FIND BACKGROUND INFORMATION

After you identify your research topic and some keywords that describe it,
find and read articles in subject encyclopedias, dictionaries, and handbooks.
These articles will help you understand the context (historical, cultural,
disciplinary) of your topic. They are the foundation supporting further
research. The most common background sources are subject encyclopedias
and dictionariesfrom our print and online reference collection. Class
textbooks also provide definitions of terms and background information.

   Look up your keywords in the indexes to subject encyclopedias. Read
articles in these encyclopedias to set the context for your research. Note any
relevant items in the bibliographies at the end of the encyclopedia articles.
Additional background information may be found in your lecture notes,
textbooks, and reserve readings.

          TIP: EXPLOIT BIBLIOGRAPHIES

            · Read the background information and note any useful
                sources (books, journals, magazines, etc.) listed in the
                bibliography at the end of the encyclopedia article or
                dictionary entry. The sources cited in the bibliography are
                good starting points for further research.

            · Look up these sources in our catalogs and periodical
                databases. Check the subject headings listed in the subject
                field of the online record for these books and articles. Then
                do subject searches using those subject headings to locate
                additional titles.

            · Remember that many of the books and articles you find
                will themselves have bibliographies. Check these
                bibliographies for additional useful resources for your
                research.

          By using this technique of routinely following up on sources
       cited in bibliographies, you can generate a surprisingly large

142 | Seven Steps of the Research Process
       number of books and articles on your topic in a relatively short
       time.

STEP 3: USE CATALOGS TO FIND BOOKS AND
MEDIA

Use guided keyword searching to find materials by topic or subject. Print or
write down the citation (author, title,etc.) and the location information (call
number and library). Note the circulation status. When you pull the book
from the shelf, scan the bibliography for additional sources. Watch for book-
length bibliographies and annual reviews on your subject; they list citations
to hundreds of books and articles in one subject area.

STEP 4: USE INDEXES TO FIND PERIODICAL
ARTICLES

Use periodical indexes and abstracts to find citations to articles. The indexes
and abstracts may be in print or computer-based formats or both. Choose
the indexes and format best suited to your particular topic; ask at the
reference desk of your library if you need help figuring out which index and
format will be best.

   You can find periodical articles by the article author, title, or keyword by
using periodical indexes. If the full text is not linked in the index you are
using, write down the citation from the index and search for the title of the
periodical in your library's catalog.

                                                             Seven Steps of the Research Process | 143
STEP 5: FIND INTERNET RESOURCES

Use search engines. Check to see if your class has a bibliography or research
guide created by librarians. Some search tools include:

  · Search Engines - Comparison table of recommended search engines;
      how search engines work

  · Subject Directories - Table comparing some of the best human-
      selected collections of web pages

  · Meta-Search Engines - Use at your own risk: not recommended as a
      substitute for directly using search engines

  · Invisible Web - What it is, how to find it, and its inherent ambiguity
      (searchable databases on the Web).

STEP 6: EVALUATE WHAT YOU FIND

CRITICALLY ANALYZING INFORMATION SOURCES: INITIAL
APPRAISAL

Author

  · What are the author's credentials-institutional affiliation (where he or
      she works), educational background, past writings, or experience? Is
      the book or article written on a topic in the author's area of expertise?
      You can use the various Who's Who publications for the U.S. and other
      countries and for specific subjects and the biographical information
      located in the publication itself to help determine the author's
      affiliation and credentials.

  · Has your instructor mentioned this author? Have you seen the author's
      name cited in other sources or bibliographies? Respected authors are
      cited frequently by other scholars. For this reason, always note those
      names that appear in many different sources.

  · Is the author associated with a reputable institution or organization?
      What are the basic values or goals of the organization or institution?

144 | Seven Steps of the Research Process
Date of Publication

  · When was the source published? This date is often located on the face
      of the title page below the name of the publisher. If it is not there, look
      for the copyright date on the reverse of the title page. On Web pages,
      the date of the last revision is usually at the bottom of the home page,
      sometimes every page.

  · Is the source current or out-of-date for your topic? Topic areas of
      continuing and rapid development, such as the sciences, demand more
      current information. On the other hand, topics in the humanities often
      require material that was written many years ago. At the other extreme,
      some news sources on the Web now note the hour and minute that
      articles are posted on their site.

Edition or Revision

  · Is this a first edition of this publication or not? Further editions indicate
      a source has been revised and updated to reflect changes in knowledge,
      include omissions, and harmonize with its intended reader's needs.
      Also, many printings or editions may indicate that the work has become
      a standard source in the area and is reliable. If you are using a Web
      source, do the pages indicate revision dates?

Publisher

  · Note the publisher. If the source is published by a university press, it is
      likely to be scholarly. Although the fact that the publisher is reputable
      does not necessarily guarantee quality, it does show that the publisher
      may have high regard for the source being published.

Title of Journal

  · Is this a scholarly or a popular journal? This distinction is important
      because it indicates different levels of complexity in conveying ideas. If
      you need help in determining the type of journal, see Distinguishing
      Scholarly from Non-Scholarly Periodicals. Or you may wish to check
      your journal title in the latest edition of Katz's Magazines for
      Libraries (Olin Ref Z 6941 .K21, shelved at the reference desk) for a brief

                                                             Seven Steps of the Research Process | 145
      evaluative description.

CRITICAL ANALYSIS OF THE CONTENT: CONTENT
ANALYSIS

Having made an initial appraisal, you should now examine the body of the
source. Read the preface to determine the author's intentions for the book.
Scan the table of contents and the index to get a broad overview of the
material it covers. Note whether bibliographies are included. Read the
chapters that specifically address your topic. Reading the article abstract and
scanning the table of contents of a journal or magazine issue is also useful.
As with books, the presence and quality of a bibliography at the end of the
article may reflect the care with which the authors have prepared their work.

Intended Audience

What type of audience is the author addressing? Is the publication aimed
at a specialized or a general audience? Is this source too elementary, too
technical, too advanced, or just right for your needs?

Objective Reasoning

  · Is the information covered fact, opinion, or propaganda? It is not always
      easy to separate fact from opinion. Facts can usually be verified;
      opinions, though they may be based on factual information, evolve from
      the interpretation of facts. Skilled writers can make you think their
      interpretations are facts.

  · Does the information appear to be valid and well-researched, or is it
      questionable and unsupported by evidence? Assumptions should be
      reasonable. Note errors or omissions.

  · Are the ideas and arguments advanced more or less in line with other
      works you have read on the same topic? The more radically an author
      departs from the views of others in the same field, the more carefully

146 | Seven Steps of the Research Process
      and critically you should scrutinize his or her ideas.
  · Is the author's point of view objective and impartial? Is the language

      free of emotion-arousing words and bias?

Coverage

  · Does the work update other sources, substantiate other materials you
      have read, or add new information? Does it extensively or marginally
      cover your topic? You should explore enough sources to obtain a
      variety of viewpoints.

  · Is the material primary or secondary in nature? Primary sources are the
      raw material of the research process. Secondary sources are based on
      primary sources.
         For example, if you were researching Konrad Adenauer's role in
            rebuilding West Germany after World War II, Adenauer's own
            writings would be one of many primary sources available on this
            topic. Others might include relevant government documents and
            contemporary German newspaper articles. Scholars use this
            primary material to help generate historical interpretations-a
            secondary source. Books, encyclopedia articles, and scholarly
            journal articles about Adenauer's role are considered secondary
            sources. In the sciences, journal articles and conference
            proceedings written by experimenters reporting the results of
            their research are primary documents. Choose both primary and
            secondary sources when you have the opportunity.

Writing Style

Is the publication organized logically? Are the main points clearly presented?
Do you find the text easy to read, or is it stilted or choppy? Is the author's
argument repetitive?

                                                             Seven Steps of the Research Process | 147
Evaluative Reviews

  · Locate critical reviews of books in a reviewing source, such
      as Summon's Advanced Search, Book Review Index, Book Review
      Digest, and ProQuest Research Library. Is the review positive? Is the
      book under review considered a valuable contribution to the field?
      Does the reviewer mention other books that might be better? If so,
      locate these sources for more information on your topic.

  · Do the various reviewers agree on the value or attributes of the book or
      has it aroused controversy among the critics?

     RESEARCH TIPS

         · Work from the general to the specific. Find background
             information first, then use more specific and recent sources.

         · Record what you find and where you found it. Record the
             complete citation for each source you find; you may need it
             again later.

PART 4: RHETORICAL MODES

Though there are as many ways to write a paper as there are papers, it
is helpful to categorize different types of writing under specific names or
genres. This section defines the most commonly used types (called modes)
of writing that you may encounter in college and beyond. Each describes the
way the piece is written, so that you can choose this form as a writer or
identify it quickly as a reader. Knowing each mode helps organize thinking
and writing to make concentrating on content a swifter, more instinctive
process.

WRITING FOR SUCCESS

     Learning Objectives

         · Determine the purpose and structure of the illustration
             essay.

         · Understand how to write an illustration essay.

THE PURPOSE OF ILLUSTRATION IN WRITING

To illustrate means to show or demonstrate something clearly. An effective
illustration essay clearly demonstrates and supports a point through the use
of evidence.

   The controlling idea of an essay is called a thesis. A writer can use different
types of evidence to support his or her thesis. Using scientific studies,
experts in a particular field, statistics, historical events, current events,
analogies, and personal anecdotes are all ways in which a writer can
illustrate a thesis. Ultimately, you want the evidence to help the reader
"see" your point, as one would see a good illustration in a magazine or on
a website. The stronger your evidence is, the more clearly the reader will
consider your point.

   Using evidence effectively can be challenging, though. The evidence you
choose will usually depend on your subject and who your reader is (your
audience). When writing an illustration essay, keep in mind the following:

  · Use evidence that is appropriate to your topic as well as appropriate for
      your audience.

                                                                                                Illustration | 153
  · Assess how much evidence you need to adequately explain your point
      depending on the complexity of the subject and the knowledge of your
      audience regarding that subject.

For example, if you were writing about a new communication software and
your audience was a group of English-major undergrads, you might want to
use an analogy or a personal story to illustrate how the software worked.
You might also choose to add a few more pieces of evidence to make sure
the audience understands your point. However, if you were writing about the
same subject and you audience members were information technology (IT)
specialists, you would likely use more technical evidence because they would
be familiar with the subject.

   Keeping in mind your subject in relation to your audience will increase
your chances of effectively illustrating your point.

          TIP
          You never want to insult your readers' intelligence by
       overexplaining concepts the audience members may already be
       familiar with, but it may be necessary to clearly articulate your
       point. When in doubt, add an extra example to illustrate your
       idea.

     Exercise 1

        On a separate piece of paper, form a thesis based on each of the
     following three topics. Then list the types of evidence that would
     best explain your point for each of the two audiences.

         · Topic: Combat and mental health

154 | Illustration
             Audience: family members of veterans, doctors
         · Topic: Video games and teen violence

             Audience: parents, children
         · Topic: Architecture and earthquakes

             Audience: engineers, local townspeople

THE STRUCTURE OF AN ILLUSTRATION ESSAY

The controlling idea, or thesis, belongs at the beginning of the essay.
Evidence is then presented in the essay's body paragraphs to support the
thesis. You can start supporting your main point with your strongest
evidence first, or you can start with evidence of lesser importance and
have the essay build to increasingly stronger evidence. This type of
organization--order of importance--you learned about in Chapter 8 "The
Writing Process: How Do I Begin?" and Chapter 9 "Writing Essays: From Start
to Finish".

   Words like first, second, third, currently, next, and finally all help orient
the reader and sequence evidence clearly. Because an illustration essay uses
so many examples, it is also helpful to have a list of words and phrases to
present each piece of evidence. Here is a list of examples:

  · case in point
  · for example
  · for instance
  · in particular
  · specifically
  · in this case
  · to illustrate
  · one example/another example

                                                                                                Illustration | 155
          TIP
          Vary the phrases of illustration you use. Do not rely on just
       one. Variety in choice of words and phrasing is critical when
       trying to keep readers engaged in your writing and your ideas.

WRITING AT WORK

In the workplace, it is often helpful to keep the phrases of illustration in mind
as a way to incorporate them whenever you can. Whether you are writing
out directives that colleagues will have to follow or requesting a new product
or service from another company, making a conscious effort to incorporate
a phrase of illustration will force you to provide examples of what you mean.

     Exercise 2

        On a separate sheet of paper, form a thesis based on one of the
     following topics. Then support that thesis with three pieces of
     evidence. Make sure to use a different phrase of illustration to
     introduce each piece of evidence you choose.

         · Cooking
         · Baseball
         · Work hours
         · Exercise
         · Traffic

     Collaboration

        Please share with a classmate and compare your answers. Discuss
     which topic you like the best or would like to learn more about.
     Indicate which thesis statement you perceive as the most effective.

WRITING AN ILLUSTRATION ESSAY

First, decide on a topic that you feel interested in writing about. Then create
an interesting introduction to engage the reader. The main point, or thesis,
should be stated at the end of the introduction.

   Gather evidence that is appropriate to both your subject and your
audience. You can order the evidence in terms of importance, either from
least important to most important or from most important to least
important. Be sure to fully explain all of your examples using strong, clear
supporting details. See Chapter 15 "Readings: Examples of Essays" to read a
sample illustration essay.

     Exercise 3

        On a separate sheet of paper, write a five-paragraph illustration
     essay. You can choose one of the topics from "Exercise 1" or
     "Exercise 2", or you can choose your own.

                                                                                                 Illustration | 157
     Key Takeaways

         · An illustration essay clearly explains a main point using
             evidence.

         · When choosing evidence, always gauge whether the
             evidence is appropriate for the subject as well as the audience.

         · Organize the evidence in terms of importance, either from
             least important to most important or from most important to
             least important.

         · Use time transitions to order evidence.
         · Use phrases of illustration to call out examples.

WRITING FOR SUCCESS

     Learning Objectives

         · Determine the purpose and structure of narrative writing.
         · Understand how to write a narrative essay.

THE PURPOSE OF NARRATIVE WRITING

Narration means the art of storytelling, and the purpose of narrative writing
is to tell stories. Any time you tell a story to a friend or family member
about an event or incident in your day, you engage in a form of narration. In
addition, a narrative can be factual or fictional. A factual story is one that is
based on, and tries to be faithful to, actual events as they unfolded in real
life. A fictional story is a made-up, or imagined, story; the writer of a fictional
story can create characters and events as he or she sees fit.

   The big distinction between factual and fictional narratives is based on
a writer's purpose. The writers of factual stories try to recount events as
they actually happened, but writers of fictional stories can depart from real
people and events because the writers' intents are not to retell a real-life
event. Biographies and memoirs are examples of factual stories, whereas
novels and short stories are examples of fictional stories.

                                                                                                   Narrative | 159
          TIP
          Because the line between fact and fiction can often blur, it is
       helpful to understand what your purpose is from the beginning.
       Is it important that you recount history, either your own or
       someone else's? Or does your interest lie in reshaping the world
       in your own image--either how you would like to see it or how
       you imagine it could be? Your answers will go a long way in
       shaping the stories you tell.

Ultimately, whether the story is fact or fiction, narrative writing tries to relay
a series of events in an emotionally engaging way. You want your audience to
be moved by your story, which could mean through laughter, sympathy, fear,
anger, and so on. The more clearly you tell your story, the more emotionally
engaged your audience is likely to be.

     Exercise 1

        On a separate sheet of paper, start brainstorming ideas for a
     narrative. First, decide whether you want to write a factual or
     fictional story. Then, freewrite for five minutes. Be sure to use all
     five minutes, and keep writing the entire time. Do not stop and
     think about what to write.

        The following are some topics to consider as you get going:
         · Childhood
         · School
         · Adventure
         · Work

160 | Narrative
         · Love
         · Family
         · Friends
         · Vacation
         · Nature
         · Space

THE STRUCTURE OF A NARRATIVE ESSAY

Major narrative events are most often conveyed in chronological order, the
order in which events unfold from first to last. Stories typically have a
beginning, a middle, and an end, and these events are typically organized
by time. Certain transitional words and phrases aid in keeping the reader
oriented in the sequencing of a story, such as the examples listed below:

  · after/afterward
  · as soon as
  · at last
  · currently
  · during
  · eventually
  · finally
  · later
  · next
  · now
  · since
  · still
  · until
  · when/whenever
  · while

The following are the other basic components of a narrative:

                                                                                                   Narrative | 161
  · Plot. The events as they unfold in sequence.
  · Characters. The people who inhabit the story and move it forward.

      Typically, there are minor characters and main characters. The minor
      characters generally play supporting roles to the main character, or
      theprotagonist.
  · Conflict. The primary problem or obstacle that unfolds in the plot that
      the protagonist must solve or overcome by the end of the narrative.
      The way in which the protagonist resolves the conflict of the plot
      results in the theme of the narrative.
  · Theme. The ultimate message the narrative is trying to express; it can
      be either explicit or implicit.

WRITING AT WORK

When interviewing candidates for jobs, employers often ask about conflicts
or problems a potential employee has had to overcome. They are asking
for a compelling personal narrative. To prepare for this question in a job
interview, write out a scenario using the narrative mode structure. This will
allow you to troubleshoot rough spots, as well as better understand your
own personal history. Both processes will make your story better and your
self-presentation better, too.

     Exercise 2

        Take your freewriting exercise from the last section and start
     crafting it chronologically into a rough plot summary. To read more
     about a summary, see Chapter 6 "Writing Paragraphs: Separating
     Ideas and Shaping Content". Be sure to use the time transition
     words and phrases listed above to sequence the events.

        Please share with a classmate and compare your rough plot
     summary.

162 | Narrative
WRITING A NARRATIVE ESSAY

When writing a narrative essay, start by asking yourself if you want to write
a factual or fictional story. Then freewrite about topics that are of general
interest to you.

   Once you have a general idea of what you will be writing about, you
should sketch out the major events of the story that will compose your
plot. Typically, these events will be revealed chronologically and climax at
a central conflict that must be resolved by the end of the story. The use of
strong details is crucial as you describe the events and characters in your
narrative. You want the reader to emotionally engage with the world that you
create in writing.

          TIP
          To create strong details, keep the human senses in mind. You
       want your reader to be immersed in the world that you create, so
       focus on details related to sight, sound, smell, taste, and touch as
       you describe people, places, and events in your narrative.

As always, it is important to start with a strong introduction to hook your
reader into wanting to read more. Try opening the essay with an event that
is interesting to introduce the story and get it going. Finally, your conclusion
should help resolve the central conflict of the story and impress upon your
reader the ultimate theme of the piece.

     Exercise 3

        On a separate sheet of paper, add two or three paragraphs to the

                                                                                                   Narrative | 163
     plot summary you started in the last section. Describe in detail the
     main character and the setting of the first scene. Try to use all five
     senses in your descriptions.

     Key Takeaways

         · Narration is the art of storytelling.
         · Narratives can be either factual or fictional. In either case,

             narratives should emotionally engage the reader.
         · Most narratives are composed of major events sequenced in

             chronological order.
         · Time transition words and phrases are used to orient the

             reader in the sequence of a narrative.
         · The four basic components to all narratives are plot,

             character, conflict, and theme.
         · The use of sensory details is crucial to emotionally engaging

             the reader.
         · A strong introduction is important to hook the reader. A

             strong conclusion should add resolution to the conflict and
             evoke the narrative's theme.

WRITING FOR SUCCESS

     Learning Objectives

         · Determine the purpose and structure of the description
             essay.

         · Understand how to write a description essay.

THE PURPOSE OF DESCRIPTION IN WRITING

Writers use description in writing to make sure that their audience is fully
immersed in the words on the page. This requires a concerted effort by the
writer to describe his or her world through the use of sensory details.

   As mentioned earlier in this chapter, sensory details are descriptions that
appeal to our sense of sight, sound, smell, taste, and touch. Your descriptions
should try to focus on the five senses because we all rely on these senses
to experience the world. The use of sensory details, then, provides you the
greatest possibility of relating to your audience and thus engaging them
in your writing, making descriptive writing important not only during your
education but also during everyday situations.

          TIP
          Avoid empty descriptors if possible. Empty descriptors are

166 | Description
       adjectives that can mean different things to different people.
       Good, beautiful, terrific, and nice are examples. The use of such
       words in descriptions can lead to misreads and confusion. A
       good day, for instance, can mean far different things depending
       on one's age, personality, or tastes.

WRITING AT WORK

Whether you are presenting a new product or service to a client, training
new employees, or brainstorming ideas with colleagues, the use of clear,
evocative detail is crucial. Make an effort to use details that express your
thoughts in a way that will register with others. Sharp, concise details are
always impressive.

     Exercise 1

        On a separate sheet of paper, describe the following five items in a
     short paragraph. Use at least three of the five senses for each
     description.

         · Night
         · Beach
         · City
         · Dinner
         · Stranger

                                                                                                Description | 167
THE STRUCTURE OF A DESCRIPTION ESSAY

Description essays typically describe a person, a place, or an object using
sensory details. The structure of a descriptive essay is more flexible than in
some of the other rhetorical modes. The introduction of a description essay
should set up the tone and point of the essay. The thesis should convey the
writer's overall impression of the person, place, or object described in the
body paragraphs.

   The organization of the essay may best follow spatial order, an
arrangement of ideas according to physical characteristics or appearance.
Depending on what the writer describes, the organization could move from
top to bottom, left to right, near to far, warm to cold, frightening to inviting,
and so on.

   For example, if the subject were a client's kitchen in the midst of
renovation, you might start at one side of the room and move slowly across
to the other end, describing appliances, cabinetry, and so on. Or you might
choose to start with older remnants of the kitchen and progress to the new
installations. Maybe start with the floor and move up toward the ceiling.

     Exercise 2

        On a separate sheet of paper, choose an organizing strategy and
     then execute it in a short paragraph for three of the following six
     items:

         · Train station
         · Your office
         · Your car
         · A coffee shop
         · Lobby of a movie theater
         · Mystery Option

168 | Description
                   Choose an object to describe but do not indicate it.
                      Describe it, but preserve the mystery.

WRITING A DESCRIPTION ESSAY

Choosing a subject is the first step in writing a description essay. Once
you have chosen the person, place, or object you want to describe, your
challenge is to write an effective thesis statement to guide your essay.

   The remainder of your essay describes your subject in a way that best
expresses your thesis. Remember, you should have a strong sense of how you
will organize your essay. Choose a strategy and stick to it.

   Every part of your essay should use vivid sensory details. The more you can
appeal to your readers' senses, the more they will be engaged in your essay.

     Exercise 3

        On a separate sheet of paper, choose one of the topics that you
     started in Exercise 2, and expand it into a five-paragraph essay.
     Expanding on ideas in greater detail can be difficult. Sometimes it is
     helpful to look closely at each of the sentences in a summary
     paragraph. Those sentences can often serve as topic sentences to
     larger paragraphs.

        Mystery Option: Here is an opportunity to collaborate. Please
     share with a classmate and compare your thoughts on the mystery
     descriptions. Did your classmate correctly guess your mystery
     topic? If not, how could you provide more detail to describe it and
     lead them to the correct conclusion?

                                                                                               Description | 169
     Key Takeaways

         · Description essays should describe something vividly to the
             reader using strong sensory details.

         · Sensory details appeal to the five human senses: sight,
             sound, smell, taste, and touch.

         · A description essay should start with the writer's main
             impression of a person, a place, or an object.

         · Use spatial order to organize your descriptive writing.

Research Writing and Argument:
All Writing is Argument

PAVEL ZEMILANSKY

     Learning Objectives

         · Define rhetoric and explain the term's historical context
             related to persuasive writing

         · Demonstrate the importance of research writing as a
             rhetorical, persuasive activity

This chapter is about rhetoric--the art of persuasion. Every time we write,
we engage in argument. Through writing, we try to persuade and influence
our readers, either directly or indirectly. We work to get them to change
their minds, to do something, or to begin thinking in new ways. Therefore,
every writer needs to know and be able to use principles of rhetoric. The first
step towards such knowledge is learning to see the argumentative nature of
all writing.

   I have two goals in this chapter: to explain the term rhetoric and to
give you some historical perspective on its origins and development; and
to demonstrate the importance of seeing research writing as a rhetorical,
persuasive activity.

   As consumers of written texts, we are often tempted to divide writing into
two categories: argumentative and non-argumentative. According to this
view, in order to be argumentative, writing must have the following qualities.
It has to defend a position in a debate between two or more opposing sides;
it must be on a controversial topic; and the goal of such writing must be to
prove the correctness of one point of view over another.

   On the other hand, this view goes, non-argumentative texts include

                                                                    Research Writing and Argument | 171
narratives, descriptions, technical reports, news stories, and so on. When
deciding to which category a given piece of writing belongs, we sometimes
look for familiar traits of argument, such as the presence of a thesis
statement, of "factual" evidence, and so on.

   Research writing is often categorized as "non-argumentative." This
happens because of the way in which we learn about research writing.
Most of us do that through the traditional research report, the kind which
focuses too much on information-gathering and note cards and not enough
on constructing engaging and interesting points of view for real audiences.
It is the gathering and compiling of information, and not doing something
productive and interesting with this information, that become the primary
goals of this writing exercise. Generic research papers are also often
evaluated on the quantity and accuracy of external information that they
gather, rather on the persuasive impact they make and the interest they
generate among readers.

   Having written countless research reports, we begin to suspect that all
research-based writing is non-argumentative. Even when explicitly asked to
construct a thesis statement and support it through researched evidence,
beginning writers are likely to pay more attention to such mechanics of
research as finding the assigned number and kind of sources and
documenting them correctly, than to constructing an argument capable of
making an impact on the reader.

ARGUMENTS AREN'T VERBAL FIGHTS

We often have narrow concept of the word "argument." In everyday life,
argument often implies a confrontation, a clash of opinions and
personalities, or just a plain verbal fight. It implies a winner and a loser,
a right side and a wrong one. Because of this understanding of the word
"argument," the only kind of writing seen as argumentative is the debate-like
"position" paper, in which the author defends his or her point of view against
other, usually opposing points of view.

   Such an understanding of argument is narrow because arguments come
in all shapes and sizes. I invite you to look at the term "argument" in a new
way. What if we think of "argument" as an opportunity for conversation,
for sharing with others our point of view on something, for showing others

172 | Research Writing and Argument
our perspective of the world? What if we see it as the opportunity to tell
our stories, including our life stories? What if we think of "argument" as
an opportunity to connect with the points of view of others rather than
defeating those points of view?

   Some years ago, I heard a conference speaker define argument as the
opposite of "beating your audience into rhetorical submission." I still like
that definition because it implies gradual and even gentle explanation and
persuasion instead of coercion. It implies effective use of details, and stories,
including emotional ones. It implies the understanding of argument as an
explanation of one's world view.

   Arguments then, can be explicit and implicit, or implied. Explicit
arguments contain noticeable and definable thesis statements and lots of
specific proofs. Implicit arguments, on the other hand, work by weaving
together facts and narratives, logic and emotion, personal experiences and
statistics. Unlike explicit arguments, implicit ones do not have a one-
sentence thesis statement. Instead, authors of implicit arguments use
evidence of many different kinds in effective and creative ways to build
and convey their point of view to their audience. Research is essential for
creative effective arguments of both kinds.

   To consider the many types and facets of written argumentation, consider
the following exploration activity.

WRITING ACTIVITY: ANALYZING WRITING
SITUATIONS

Working individually or in small groups, consider the following writing
situations. Are these situations opportunities for argumentative writing? If
so, what elements of argument do you see? Use your experience as a reader
and imagine the kinds of published texts that might result from these writing
situations. Apply the ideas about argument mentioned so far in this chapter,
including the "explicit" and "implicit" arguments

  · A group of scientists develops a hypothesis and conducts a series of
      experiments to test it. After obtaining the results from those
      experiments, they decide to publish their findings in a scientific journal.
      However, the data can be interpreted in two ways. The authors can use

                                                                   Research Writing and Argument | 173
      a long-standing theory with which most of his colleagues agree. But
      they can also use a newer and more ambitious theory on which there is
      no consensus in the field, but which our authors believe to be more
      comprehensive and up-to-date. Using different theories will produce
      different interpretations of the data and different pieces of writing. Are
      both resulting texts arguments? Why or why not?
  · An author wants to write a memoir. She is particularly interested in her
      relationship with her parents as a teenager. In order to focus on that
      period of her life, she decides to omit other events and time periods
      from the memoir. The finished text is a combination of stories,
      reflections, and facts. This text does not have a clear thesis statement
      or proofs. Could this "selective" memory" writing be called an
      argument? What are the reasons for your decision?
  · A travel writer who is worried about global warming goes to Antarctica
      and observes the melting of the ice there. Using her observations,
      interviews with scientists, and secondary research, she then prepares
      an article about her trip for The National Geographic magazine or a
      similar publication. Her piece does not contain a one-sentence thesis
      statement or a direct call to fight global warming. At the same time, her
      evidence suggests that ice in the Arctic melts faster than it used to.
      Does this writer engage in argument? Why or why not? What factors
      influenced your decision?
  · A novelist writes a book based on the events of the American Civil War.
      He recreates historical characters from archival research, but adds
      details, descriptions, and other characters to his book that are not
      necessarily historic. The resulting novel is in the genre known as
      "historical fiction." Like all works of fiction, the book does not have a
      thesis statement or explicit proofs. It does, however, promote a certain
      view of history, some of which is based on the author's research and
      some--on his imagination and creative license. Is this a representation
      of history, an argument, or a combination of both? Why or why not?

You can probably think of many more examples when argument in writing
is expressed through means other than the traditional thesis statement and
proofs. As you work through this book, continue to think about the nature of
argument in writing and discuss it with your classmates and your instructor.

DEFINITIONS OF RHETORIC AND THE
RHETORICAL SITUATION

The art of creating effective arguments is explained and systematized by a
discipline called rhetoric. Writing is about making choices, and knowing the
principles of rhetoric allows a writer to make informed choices about various
aspects of the writing process. Every act of writing takes places in a specific
rhetorical situation. The three most basic and important components of a
rhetorical situations are:

  · Purpose of writing
  · Intended audience,
  · Occasion, or context in which the text will be written and read

These factors help writers select their topics, arrange their material, and
make other important decisions about their work.

   Before looking closely at different definitions and components of rhetoric,
let us try to understand what rhetoric is not. In recent years, the word
"rhetoric" has developed a bad reputation in American popular culture. In the
popular mind, the term "rhetoric" has come to mean something negative and
deceptive. Open a newspaper or turn on the television, and you are likely to
hear politicians accusing each other of "too much rhetoric and not enough
substance." According to this distorted view, rhetoric is verbal fluff, used to
disguise empty or even deceitful arguments.

   Examples of this misuse abound. Here are some examples.
   A 2003 CNN news article "North Korea Talks On Despite Rhetoric"
describes the decision by the international community to continue the talks
with North Korea about its nuclear arms program despite what the author
sees as North Koreans' "rhetorical blast" at a US official taking part in the
talks. The implication here is that that, by verbally attacking the US official,
the North Koreans attempted to hide the lack of substance in their
argument. The word "rhetoric" in this context implies a strategy to deceive
or distract.
   Another example is the title of the now-defunct political website
"Spinsanity: Countering Rhetoric with Reason." The website's authors state
that "engaged citizenry, active press and strong network of fact-checking
websites and blogs can help turn the tide of deception that we now see."

                                                                   Research Writing and Argument | 175
What this statement implies, of course, is that rhetoric is "spin" and that it is
the opposite of truth.

   Rhetoric is not a dirty trick used by politicians to conceal and obscure,
but an art, which, for many centuries, has had many definitions. Perhaps
the most popular and overreaching definition comes to us from the Ancient
Greek thinker Aristotle. Aristotle defined rhetoric as "the faculty of
observing in any given case
the available means of persuasion" (Ch.2). Aristotle saw primarily as a
practical tool, indispensable for civic discourse.

ELEMENTS OF THE RHETORICAL SITUATION

When composing, every writer must take into account the conditions under
which the writing is produced and will be read. It is customary to represent
the three key elements of the rhetorical situation as a triangle of writer,
reader, and text, or, as "communicator," "audience," and "message."

   The three elements of the rhetorical situation are in a constant and
dynamic interrelation. All three are also necessary for communication
through writing to take place. For example, if the writer is taken out of this
equation, the text will not be created. Similarly, eliminating the text itself
will leave us with the reader and writer, but without any means of conveying
ideas between them, and so on.

   Moreover, changing on or more characteristics of any of the elements
depicted in the figure above will change the other elements as well. For
example, with the change in the beliefs and values of the audience, the
message will also likely change to accommodate those new beliefs, and so
on.

   In his discussion of rhetoric, Aristotle states that writing's primary purpose
is persuasion. Other ancient rhetoricians' theories expand the scope of
rhetoric by adding new definitions, purposes, and methods. For example,
another Greek philosopher and rhetorician Plato saw rhetoric as a means
of discovering the truth, including personal truth, through dialog and
discussion. According to Plato, rhetoric can be directed outward (at readers
or listeners), or inward (at the writer him or herself). In the latter case,
the purpose of rhetoric is to help the author discover something important
about his or her own experience and life.

176 | Research Writing and Argument
   The third major rhetorical school of Ancient Greece whose views have
profoundly influenced our understanding of rhetoric were the Sophists. The
Sophists were teachers of rhetoric for hire. The primary goal of their
activities was to teach skills and strategies for effective speaking and writing.
Many Sophists claimed that they could make anyone into an effective
rhetorician. In their most extreme variety, Sophistic rhetoric claims that
virtually anything could be proven if the rhetorician has the right skills.
The legacy of Sophistic rhetoric is controversial. Some scholars, including
Plato himself, have accused the Sophists of bending ethical standards in
order to achieve their goals, while others have praised them for promoting
democracy and civic participation through argumentative discourse.

   What do these various definitions of rhetoric have to do with research
writing? Everything! If you have ever had trouble with a writing assignment,
chances are it was because you could not figure out the assignment's
purpose. Or, perhaps you did not understand very well whom your writing
was supposed to appeal to. It is hard to commit to purposeless writing done
for no one in particular.

   Research is not a very useful activity if it is done for its own sake. If you
think of a situation in your own life where you had to do any kind of research,
you probably
had a purpose that the research helped you to accomplish. You could, for
example, have been considering buying a car and wanted to know which
make and model would suite you best. Or, you could have been looking for
an apartment to rent and wanted to get the best deal for your money. Or,
perhaps your family was planning a vacation and researched the best deals
on hotels, airfares, and rental cars. Even in these simple examples of research
that are far simpler than research most writers conduct, you as a researcher
were guided by some overriding purpose. You researched because you had a
purpose to accomplish.

HOW TO APPROACH WRITING TASKS
RHETORICALLY

The three main elements of rhetorical theory are purpose, audience, and
occasion. We will look at these elements primarily through the lens of
Classical Rhetoric, the rhetoric of Ancient Greece and Rome. Principles of

                                                                   Research Writing and Argument | 177
classical rhetoric (albeit some of them modified) are widely accepted across
the modern Western civilization. Classical rhetoric provides a solid
framework for analysis and production of effective texts in a variety of
situations.

PURPOSE

Good writing always serves a purpose. Texts are created to persuade,
entertain, inform, instruct, and so on. In a real writing situation, these
discrete purposes are often combined.

     Writing Activity: Analyzing Purpose

        Recall any text you wrote, in or outside of school. Think not only
     of school papers, but also of letters to relatives and friends, e-mails,
     shopping lists, online postings, and so on. Consider the following
     questions.

         · Was the purpose of the writing well defined for you in the
             assignment, or did you have to define it yourself?

         · What did you have to do in order to understand or create
             your purpose?

         · Did you have trouble articulating and fulfilling your writing
             purpose?

        Be sure to record your answers and share them with your
     classmates and/or instructor.

178 | Research Writing and Argument
AUDIENCE

The second key element of the rhetorical approach to writing is audience-
awareness. As you saw from the rhetorical triangle earlier in this chapter,
readers are an indispensable part of the rhetorical equation, and it is
essential for every writer to understand their audience and tailor his or her
message to the audience's needs.

   The key principles that every writer needs to follow in order to reach and
affect his or her audience are as follows:

  · Have a clear idea about who your readers will be.
  · Understand your readers' previous experiences, knowledge, biases, and

      expectations and how these factors can influence their reception of
      your argument.
  · When writing, keep in mind not only those readers who are physically
      present or whom you know (your classmates and instructor), but all
      readers who would benefit from or be influenced by your argument.
  · Choose a style, tone, and medium of presentation appropriate for your
      intended audience.

     Writing Activity: Analyzing Audience

        Every writer needs to consider his or her audience carefully when
     writing. Otherwise, you writing will be directed at no one in
     particular. As a result, your purpose will become unclear and your
     work will lose its effectiveness.

        Consider any recent writing task that you faced. As with all the
     exploration activities included in this chapter, do not limit yourself
     to school writing assignments. Include letters, e-mails, notes, and
     any other kinds of writing you may do.

                                                                   Research Writing and Argument | 179
         · Did you have a clearly defined audience?
         · If not, what measures did you take to define and understand

             your audience?
         · How did you know who your readers were?
         · Did your writing purpose fit what your intended audience

             needed or wanted to hear?
         · What were the best ways to appeal to your audience (both

             logical and emotional)?
         · How did your decision to use or not to use external

             research influence the reception of your argument by your
             audience?

OCCASION

Occasion is an important part of the rhetorical situation. It is a part of the
writing context that was mentioned earlier in the chapter. Writers do not
work in a vacuum. Instead, the content, form and reception of their work
by readers are heavily influenced by the conditions in society as well as
by personal situations of their readers. These conditions in which texts are
created and read affect every aspect of writing and every stage of the writing
process, from topic selection, to decisions about what kinds of arguments
used and their arrangement, to the writing style, voice, and persona which
the writer wishes to project in his or her writing. All elements of the
rhetorical situation work together in a dynamic relationship. Therefore,
awareness of rhetorical occasion and other elements of the context of your
writing will also help you refine your purpose and understand your audience
better. Similarly having a clear purpose in mind when writing and knowing
your audience will help you understand the context in which you are writing
and in which your work will be read better.

   One aspect of writing where you can immediately benefit from
understanding occasion and using it to your rhetorical advantage is the
selection of topics for your compositions. Any topic can be good or bad,

180 | Research Writing and Argument
and a key factor in deciding on whether it fits the occasion. In order to
understand whether a particular topic is suitable for a composition, it is
useful to analyze whether the composition would address an issue, or a
rhetorical exigency when created. The writing activity below can help you
select topics and issues for written arguments.

     Writing Activity: Analyzing Rhetorical Exigency

         · If you are considering a topic for a paper, think whether the
             paper would address a specific problem or issue. In other
             words, will it address a real exigency, something that needs to
             be solved or discussed?

         · Who are the people with interests and stakes in the
             problem?

         · What are your limitations? Can you hope to solve the
             problem once and for all, or should your goals be more
             modest? Why or why not?

        Share your results with your classmates and instructor.

To understand how writers can study and use occasion in order to make
effective arguments, let us examine another ancient rhetorical concept.
Kairos is one of the most fascinating terms from Classical rhetoric. It
signifies the right, or opportune moment for an argument to be made. It
is such a moment or time when the subject of the argument is particularly
urgent or important and when audiences are more likely to be persuaded
by it. Ancient rhetoricians believed that if the moment for the argument is
right, for instance if there are conditions in society which would make the
audience more receptive to the argument, the rhetorician would have more
success persuading such an audience.

   For example, as I write this text, a heated debate about the war on
terrorism and about the goals and methods of this war is going on in the US.
It is also the year of the Presidential Election, and political candidates try to

                                                                   Research Writing and Argument | 181
use the war on terrorism to their advantage when they debate each other.
These are topics of high public interested, with print media, television, radio,
and the Internet constantly discussing them. Because there is an enormous
public interest in the topic of terrorism, well-written articles and reports on
the subject will not fall on deaf ears. Simply put, the moment, or occasion,
for the debate is right, and it will continue until public interest in the subject
weakens or disappears.

RHETORICAL APPEALS

In order to persuade their readers, writers must use three types of proofs
or rhetorical appeals. They are logos, or logical appeal; pathos, or emotional
appeal; and ethos, or ethical appeal, or appeal based on the character and
credibility of the author. It is easy to notice that modern words "logical,"
"pathetic," and "ethical" are derived from those Greek words. In his
work Rhetoric, Aristotle writes that the three appeals must be used together
in every piece of persuasive discourse. An argument based on the appeal to
logic, or emotions alone will not be an effective one.

   Understanding how logos, pathos, and ethos should work together is very
important for writers wh use research. Often, research writing assignment
are written in a way that seems to emphasize logical proofs over emotional
or ethical ones. Such logical proofs in research papers typically consist
of factual information, statistics, examples, and other similar evidence.
According to this view, writers of academic papers need to be unbiased and
objective, and using logical proofs will help them to be that way.

   Because of this emphasis on logical proofs, you may be less familiar with
the kinds of pathetic and ethical proofs available to you. Pathetic appeals, or
appeals to emotions of the audience were considered by ancient rhetoricians
as important as logical proofs. Yet, writers are sometimes not easily
convinced to use pathetic appeals in their writing. As modern rhetoricians
and authors of the influential book Classical Rhetoric for the Modern
Student (1998), Edward P.J. Corbett and Robert Connors said, "People are
rather sheepish about acknowledging that their opinions can be affected by
their emotions" (86). According to Corbett, many of us think that there may
be something wrong about using emotions in argument. But, I agree with
Corbett and Connors, pathetic proofs are not only admissible in argument,

182 | Research Writing and Argument
but necessary (86-89). The most basic way of evoking appropriate emotional
responses in your audience, according to Corbett, is the use of vivid
descriptions (94).

   Using ethical appeals, or appeals based on the character of the writer,
involves establishing and maintaining your credibility in the eyes of your
readers. In other words, when writing, think about how you are presenting
yourself to your audience. Do you give your readers enough reasons to trust
you and your argument, or do you give them reasons to doubt your authority
and your credibility? Consider all the times when your decision about the
merits of a given argument was affected by the person or people making the
argument. For example, when watching television news, are you predisposed
against certain cable networks and more inclined towards others because
you trust them more?

   So, how can a writer establish a credible persona for his or her audience?
One way to do that is through external research. Conducting research and
using it well in your writing help with you with the factual proofs (logos), but
it also shows your readers that you, as the author, have done your homework
and know what you are talking about. This knowledge, the sense of your
authority that this creates among your readers, will help you be a more
effective writer.

   The logical, pathetic, and ethical appeals work in a dynamic combination
with one another. It is sometimes hard to separate one kind of proof from
another and the methods by which the writer achieved the desired rhetorical
effect. If your research contains data which is likely to cause your readers
to be emotional, it data can enhance the pathetic aspect of your argument.
The key to using the three appeals, is to use them in combination with each
other, and in moderation. It is impossible to construct a successful argument
by relying too much on one or two appeals while neglecting the others.

RESEARCH WRITING AS CONVERSATION

Writing is a social process. Texts are created to be read by others, and in
creating those texts, writers should be aware of not only their personal
assumptions, biases, and tastes, but also those of their readers. Writing,
therefore, is an interactive process. It is a conversation, a meeting of minds,
during which ideas are exchanged, debates and discussions take place and,

                                                                   Research Writing and Argument | 183
sometimes, but not always, consensus is reached. You may be familiar with
the famous quote by the 20th century rhetorician Kenneth Burke who
compared writing to a conversation at a social event. In his 1974 book The
Philosophy of Literary Form Burke writes,

   Imagine that you enter a parlor. You come late. When you arrive, others
have long preceded you, and they are engaged in a heated discussion, a
discussion too heated for them to pause and tell you exactly what it is about.
In fact, the discussion had already begun long before any of them got there,
so that no one present is qualified to retrace for you all the steps that had
gone before. You listen for a while, until you decide that you have caught
the tenor of the argument; then you put in your oar. Someone answers;
you answer him, another comes to your defense; another aligns himself
against you, to either the embarrassment of gratification of your opponent,
depending upon the quality of your ally's assistance. However, the discussion
is interminable. The hour grows late, you must depart. And you do depart,
with the discussion still vigorously in progress (110-111).

   This passage by Burke is extremely popular among writers because it
captures the interactive nature of writing so precisely. Reading Burke's
words carefully, we will notice that the interaction between readers and
writers is continuous. A writer always enters a conversation in progress.
In order to participate in the discussion, just like in real life, you need to
know what your interlocutors have been talking about. So you listen (read).
Once you feel you have got the drift of the conversation, you say (write)
something. Your text is read by others who respond to your ideas, stories,
and arguments with their own. This interaction never ends!

   To write well, it is important to listen carefully and understand the
conversations that are going on around you. Writers who are able to listen
to these conversations and pick up important topics, themes, and arguments
are generally more effective at reaching and impressing their audiences. It
is also important to treat research, writing, and every occasion for these
activities as opportunities to participate in the on-going conversation of
people interested in the same topics and questions which interest you.

   Our knowledge about our world is shaped by the best and most up-to-date
theories available to them. Sometimes these theories can be experimentally
tested and proven, and sometimes, when obtaining such proof is impossible,
they are based on consensus reached as a result of conversation and debate.
Even the theories and knowledge that can be experimentally tested (for
example in sciences) do not become accepted knowledge until most

184 | Research Writing and Argument
members of the scientific community accept them. Other members of this
community will help them test their theories and hypotheses, give them
feedback on their writing, and keep them searching for the best answers to
their questions. As Burke says in his famous passage, the interaction between
the members of intellectual communities never ends. No piece of writing, no
argument, no theory or discover is ever final. Instead, they all are subject to
discussion, questioning, and improvement.

   A simple but useful example of this process is the evolution of humankind's
understanding of their planet Earth and its place in the Universe. As you
know, in Medieval Europe, the prevailing theory was that the Earth was
the center of the Universe and that all other planets and the Sun rotated
around it. This theory was the result of the church's teachings, and thinkers
who disagreed with it were pronounced heretics and often burned. In 1543,
astronomer Nikolaus Kopernikus argued that the Sun was at the center of
the solar system and that all planets of the system rotate around the Sun.
Later, Galieo experimentally proved Kopernikus' theory with the help of a
telescope. Of course, the Earch did not begin to rotate around the Sun
with this discovery. Yet, Kopernikus' and Galileo's theories of the Universe
went against the Catholic Church's teachings which dominated the social
discourse of Medieval Europe. The Inquisition did not engage in debate
with the two scientists. Instead, Kopernikus was executed for his views and
Galileo was sentenced to house arrest for his views.

   Although in the modern world, dissenting thinkers are unlikely to suffer
such harsh punishment, the examples of Kopernikus and Galileo teach us
two valuable lessons about the social nature of knowledge. Firstly, Both
Kopernikus and Galileo tried to improve on an existing theory of the
Universe that placed our planet at the center. They did not work from
nothing but used beliefs that already existed in their society and tried to
modify and disprove those beliefs. Time and later scientific research proved
that they were right. Secondly, even after Galileo was able to prove the
structure of the Solar system experimentally, his theory did not become
widely accepted until the majority of people in society assimilated it.
Therefore, new findings do not become accepted knowledge until they
penetrate the fabric of social discourse and until enough people accept them
as true.

                                                                   Research Writing and Argument | 185

             theories, ideas, and beliefs as grounded in pre-existing
             knowledge. Therefore, when beginning a new writing project,
             writers never work "from scratch." Instead, they tap into the
             resources of their community for ideas, inspiration, and
             research leads. Keeping these statements in mind, answer the
             following questions. Apply your answers to one of the
             research projects described in this book. Be sure to record
             your answers.

         · Consider a possible research project topic. What do you
             know about your topic before you begin to write?

         · Where did this knowledge come from? Be sure to include
             both secondary sources (books, websites, etc.) and primary
             ones (people, events, personal memories). Is this knowledge
             socially created? What communities or groups or people
             created it, how, and why?

         · What parts of your current knowledge about your subject
             could be called "fact" and what parts could be called
             "opinion?"

         · How can your current knowledge about the topic help you
             in planning and conducting the research for the project?

        Share your thoughts with your classmates and instructor.

CONCLUSIONS

In this chapter, we have learned the definition of rhetoric and the basic
differences between several important rhetorical schools. We have also

186 | Research Writing and Argument
discussed how to key elements of the rhetorical situation: purpose,
audience, and context. As you work on the research writing projects
presented throughout this book, be sure to revisit this chapter often.
Everything that you have read about here and every activity you have
completed as you worked through this chapter is applicable to all research
writing projects in this book and beyond. Most school writing assignments
give you direct instructions about your purpose, intended audience, and
rhetorical occasion. Truly proficient and independent writers, however,
learn to define their purpose, audiences, and contexts of their writing, on
their own. The material in this chapter is designed to enable to become
better at those tasks.

   When you receive a writing assignment, it is very tempting to see it as just
another hoop to jump through and not as a genuine rhetorical situation, an
opportunity to influence others with your writing. It is certainly tempting
to see yourself writing only for the teacher, without a real purpose and
oblivious of the context of your writing.

   The material of this chapter as well as the writing projects presented
throughout this book are designed to help you think of writing as a
persuasive, rhetorical activity. Conducting research and incorporating its
results into your paper is a part of this rhetorical process.

Definition

WRITING FOR SUCCESS

     Learning Objectives

         · Determine the purpose and structure of the definition
             essay.

         · Understand how to write a definition essay.

THE PURPOSE OF DEFINITION IN WRITING

The purpose of a definition essay may seem self-explanatory: the purpose
of the definition essay is to simply define something. But defining terms in
writing is often more complicated than just consulting a dictionary. In fact,
the way we define terms can have far-reaching consequences for individuals
as well as collective groups.

   Take, for example, a word like alcoholism. The way in which one defines
alcoholism depends on its legal, moral, and medical contexts. Lawyers may
define alcoholism in terms of its legality; parents may define alcoholism
in terms of its morality; and doctors will define alcoholism in terms of
symptoms and diagnostic criteria. Think also of terms that people tend to
debate in our broader culture. How we define words, such asmarriage and
climate change, has enormous impact on policy decisions and even on daily
decisions. Think about conversations couples may have in which words like
commitment, respect, or love need clarification.

   Defining terms within a relationship, or any other context, can at first
be difficult, but once a definition is established between two people or a
group of people, it is easier to have productive dialogues. Definitions, then,

                                                                                                  Definition | 189
establish the way in which people communicate ideas. They set parameters
for a given discourse, which is why they are so important.

          TIP
          When writing definition essays, avoid terms that are too
       simple, that lack complexity. Think in terms of concepts, such as
       hero, immigration, or loyalty, rather than physical objects.
       Definitions of concepts, rather than objects, are often fluid and
       contentious, making for a more effective definition essay.

WRITING AT WORK

Definitions play a critical role in all workplace environments. Take the term
sexual harassment, for example. Sexual harassment is broadly defined on
the federal level, but each company may have additional criteria that define
it further. Knowing how your workplace defines and treats all sexual
harassment allegations is important. Think, too, about how your company
defines lateness, productivity, or contributions.

     Exercise 1

        On a separate sheet of paper, write about a time in your own life
     in which the definition of a word, or the lack of a definition, caused
     an argument. Your term could be something as simple as the
     category of an all-star in sports or how to define a good movie. Or it
     could be something with higher stakes and wider impact, such as a
     political argument. Explain how the conversation began, how the

190 | Definition
     argument hinged on the definition of the word, and how the
     incident was finally resolved.

        Please share with a classmate and compare your responses.

THE STRUCTURE OF A DEFINITION ESSAY

The definition essay opens with a general discussion of the term to be
defined. You then state as your thesis your definition of the term.

   The rest of the essay should explain the rationale for your definition.
Remember that a dictionary's definition is limiting, and you should not rely
strictly on the dictionary entry. Instead, consider the context in which you
are using the word. Context identifies the circumstances, conditions, or
setting in which something exists or occurs. Often words take on different
meanings depending on the context in which they are used. For example,
the ideal leader in a battlefield setting could likely be very different than
a leader in an elementary school setting. If a context is missing from the
essay, the essay may be too short or the main points could be confusing or
misunderstood.

   The remainder of the essay should explain different aspects of the term's
definition. For example, if you were defining a good leader in an elementary
classroom setting, you might define such a leader according to personality
traits: patience, consistency, and flexibility. Each attribute would be
explained in its own paragraph.

          TIP
          For definition essays, try to think of concepts that you have a
       personal stake in. You are more likely to write a more engaging
       definition essay if you are writing about an idea that has personal
       value and importance.

                                                                                                  Definition | 191
WRITING AT WORK

It is a good idea to occasionally assess your role in the workplace. You
can do this through the process of definition. Identify your role at work by
defining not only the routine tasks but also those gray areas where your
responsibilities might overlap with those of others. Coming up with a clear
definition of roles and responsibilities can add value to your résumé and
even increase productivity in the workplace.

     Exercise 2

        On a separate sheet of paper, define each of the following items in
     your own terms. If you can, establish a context for your definition.

         · Bravery
         · Adulthood
         · Consumer culture
         · Violence
         · Art

WRITING A DEFINITION ESSAY

Choose a topic that will be complex enough to be discussed at length.
Choosing a word or phrase of personal relevance often leads to a more
interesting and engaging essay.

   After you have chosen your word or phrase, start your essay with an
introduction that establishes the relevancy of the term in the chosen specific
context. Your thesis comes at the end of the introduction, and it should
clearly state your definition of the term in the specific context. Establishing

192 | Definition
a functional context from the beginning will orient readers and minimize
misunderstandings.

   The body paragraphs should each be dedicated to explaining a different
facet of your definition. Make sure to use clear examples and strong details
to illustrate your points. Your concluding paragraph should pull together all
the different elements of your definition to ultimately reinforce your thesis.

     Exercise 3

        Create a full definition essay from one of the items you already
     defined in Exercise 2" Be sure to include an interesting introduction,
     a clear thesis, a well-explained context, distinct body paragraphs,
     and a conclusion that pulls everything together.

     Key Takeaways

         · Definitions establish the way in which people communicate
             ideas. They set parameters for a given discourse.

         · Context affects the meaning and usage of words.
         · The thesis of a definition essay should clearly state the

             writer's definition of the term in the specific context.
         · Body paragraphs should explain the various facets of the

             definition stated in the thesis.
         · The conclusion should pull all the elements of the definition

             together at the end and reinforce the thesis.

                                                                                                  Definition | 193

Classification

WRITING FOR SUCCESS

     Learning Objectives

         · Determine the purpose and structure of the classification
             essay.

         · Understand how to write a classification essay.

THE PURPOSE OF CLASSIFICATION IN WRITING

The purpose of classification is to break down broad subjects into smaller,
more manageable, more specific parts. We classify things in our daily lives
all the time, often without even thinking about it. Cell phones, for example,
have now become part of a broad category. They can be classified as feature
phones, media phones, and smartphones.

   Smaller categories, and the way in which these categories are created,
help us make sense of the world. Keep both of these elements in mind when
writing a classification essay.

          TIP
          Choose topics that you know well when writing classification
       essays. The more you know about a topic, the more you can

                                                                                             Classification | 195
       break it into smaller, more interesting parts. Adding interest and
       insight will enhance your classification essays.

     Exercise 1

        On a separate sheet of paper, break the following categories into
     smaller classifications.

         · The United States
         · Colleges and universities
         · Beverages
         · Fashion

THE STRUCTURE OF A CLASSIFICATION ESSAY

The classification essay opens with an introductory paragraph that
introduces the broader topic. The thesis should then explain how that topic
is divided into subgroups and why. Take the following introductory
paragraph, for example:

   When people think of New York, they often think of only New York City.
But New York is actually a diverse state with a full range of activities to
do, sights to see, and cultures to explore. In order to better understand the
diversity of New York state, it is helpful to break it into these five separate
regions: Long Island, New York City, Western New York, Central New York,
and Northern New York.

   The underlined thesis explains not only the category and subcategory
but also the rationale for breaking it into those categories. Through this

196 | Classification
classification essay, the writer hopes to show his or her readers a different
way of considering the state.

   Each body paragraph of a classification essay is dedicated to fully
illustrating each of the subcategories. In the previous example, then, each
region of New York would have its own paragraph.

   The conclusion should bring all the categories and subcategories back
together again to show the reader the big picture. In the previous example,
the conclusion might explain how the various sights and activities of each
region of New York add to its diversity and complexity.

          TIP
          To avoid settling for an overly simplistic classification, make
       sure you break down any given topic at least three different
       ways. This will help you think outside the box and perhaps even
       learn something entirely new about a subject.

     Exercise 2

        Using your classifications from Exercise 1, write a brief paragraph
     explaining why you chose to organize each main category in the way
     that you did.

WRITING A CLASSIFICATION ESSAY

Start with an engaging opening that will adequately introduce the general
topic that you will be dividing into smaller subcategories. Your thesis should

                                                                                             Classification | 197
come at the end of your introduction. It should include the topic, your
subtopics, and the reason you are choosing to break down the topic in the
way that you are. Use the following classification thesis equation:

                 topic + subtopics + rationale for the subtopics = thesis.

The organizing strategy of a classification essay is dictated by the initial
topic and the subsequent subtopics. Each body paragraph is dedicated to
fully illustrating each of the subtopics. In a way, coming up with a strong
topic pays double rewards in a classification essay. Not only do you have a
good topic, but you also have a solid organizational structure within which
to write.

   Be sure you use strong details and explanations for each subcategory
paragraph that help explain and support your thesis. Also, be sure to give
examples to illustrate your points. Finally, write a conclusion that links all the
subgroups together again. The conclusion should successfully wrap up your
essay by connecting it to your topic initially discussed in the introduction.

     Exercise 3

        Building on Exercise 1 and Exercise 2, write a five-paragraph
     classification essay about one of the four original topics. In your
     thesis, make sure to include the topic, subtopics, and rationale for
     your breakdown. And make sure that your essay is organized into
     paragraphs that each describes a subtopic.

198 | Classification
Key Takeaways

  · The purpose of classification is to break a subject into
     smaller, more manageable, more specific parts.

  · Smaller subcategories help us make sense of the world, and
     the way in which these subcategories are created also helps us
     make sense of the world.

  · A classification essay is organized by its subcategories.

Process Analysis

WRITING FOR SUCCESS

     Learning Objectives

         · Determine the purpose and structure of the process
             analysis essay.

         · Understand how to write a process analysis essay.

THE PURPOSE OF PROCESS ANALYSIS IN
WRITING

The purpose of a process analysis essay is to explain how to do something or
how something works. In either case, the formula for a process analysis essay
remains the same. The process is articulated into clear, definitive steps.

   Almost everything we do involves following a step-by-step process. From
riding a bike as children to learning various jobs as adults, we initially needed
instructions to effectively execute the task. Likewise, we have likely had to
instruct others, so we know how important good directions are--and how
frustrating it is when they are poorly put together.

WRITING AT WORK

The next time you have to explain a process to someone at work, be mindful
of how clearly you articulate each step. Strong communication skills are

200 | Process Analysis
critical for workplace satisfaction and advancement. Effective process
analysis plays a critical role in developing that skill set.

     Exercise 1

        On a separate sheet of paper, make a bulleted list of all the steps
     that you feel would be required to clearly illustrate three of the
     following four processes:

         · Tying a shoelace
         · Parallel parking
         · Planning a successful first date
         · Being an effective communicator

THE STRUCTURE OF A PROCESS ANALYSIS
ESSAY

The process analysis essay opens with a discussion of the process and a
thesis statement that states the goal of the process.

   The organization of a process analysis essay typically follows chronological
order. The steps of the process are conveyed in the order in which they
usually occur. Body paragraphs will be constructed based on these steps. If a
particular step is complicated and needs a lot of explaining, then it will likely
take up a paragraph on its own. But if a series of simple steps is easier to
understand, then the steps can be grouped into a single paragraph.

   The time transition phrases covered in the Narration and Illustration
sections are also helpful in organizing process analysis essays (see Table 10.1
"Transition Words and Phrases for Expressing Time" and Table 10.2 "Phrases
of Illustration"). Words such as first, second, third, next, and finally are
helpful cues to orient reader and organize the content of essay.

                                                                                         Process Analysis | 201
          TIP
          Always have someone else read your process analysis to make
       sure it makes sense. Once we get too close to a subject, it is
       difficult to determine how clearly an idea is coming across.
       Having a friend or coworker read it over will serve as a good way
       to troubleshoot any confusing spots.

     Exercise 2

        Choose two of the lists you created in Exercise 1 and start writing
     out the processes in paragraph form. Try to construct paragraphs
     based on the complexity of each step. For complicated steps,
     dedicate an entire paragraph. If less complicated steps fall in
     succession, group them into a single paragraph.

WRITING A PROCESS ANALYSIS ESSAY

Choose a topic that is interesting, is relatively complex, and can be explained
in a series of steps. As with other rhetorical writing modes, choose a process
that you know well so that you can more easily describe the finer details
about each step in the process. Your thesis statement should come at the
end of your introduction, and it should state the final outcome of the process
you are describing.

   Body paragraphs are composed of the steps in the process. Each step
should be expressed using strong details and clear examples. Use time
transition phrases to help organize steps in the process and to orient

202 | Process Analysis
readers. The conclusion should thoroughly describe the result of the process
described in the body paragraphs.

     Exercise 3

        Choose one of the expanded lists from Exercise 2. Construct a full
     process analysis essay from the work you have already done. That
     means adding an engaging introduction, a clear thesis, time
     transition phrases, body paragraphs, and a solid conclusion.

     Key Takeaways

         · A process analysis essay explains how to do something, how
             something works, or both.

         · The process analysis essay opens with a discussion of the
             process and a thesis statement that states the outcome of the
             process.

         · The organization of a process analysis essay typically
             follows a chronological sequence.

         · Time transition phrases are particularly helpful in process
             analysis essays to organize steps and orient reader.

Comparison and Contrast

WRITING FOR SUCCESS

     Learning Objectives

         · Determine the purpose and structure of comparison and
             contrast in writing.

         · Explain organizational methods used when comparing and
             contrasting.

         · Understand how to write a compare-and-contrast essay.

THE PURPOSE OF COMPARISON AND
CONTRAST IN WRITING

Comparison in writing discusses elements that are similar, while contrast
in writing discusses elements that are different. A compare-and-contrast
essay, then, analyzes two subjects by comparing them, contrasting them, or
both.

   The key to a good compare-and-contrast essay is to choose two or more
subjects that connect in a meaningful way. The purpose of conducting the
comparison or contrast is not to state the obvious but rather to illuminate
subtle differences or unexpected similarities. For example, if you wanted to
focus on contrasting two subjects you would not pick apples and oranges;
rather, you might choose to compare and contrast two types of oranges
or two types of apples to highlight subtle differences. For example, Red
Delicious apples are sweet, while Granny Smiths are tart and acidic. Drawing
distinctions between elements in a similar category will increase the

                                                                           Comparison and Contrast | 205
audience's understanding of that category, which is the purpose of the
compare-and-contrast essay.

   Similarly, to focus on comparison, choose two subjects that seem at first to
be unrelated. For a comparison essay, you likely would not choose two apples
or two oranges because they share so many of the same properties already.
Rather, you might try to compare how apples and oranges are quite similar.
The more divergent the two subjects initially seem, the more interesting a
comparison essay will be.

WRITING AT WORK

Comparing and contrasting is also an evaluative tool. In order to make
accurate evaluations about a given topic, you must first know the critical
points of similarity and difference. Comparing and contrasting is a primary
tool for many workplace assessments. You have likely compared and
contrasted yourself to other colleagues. Employee advancements, pay raises,
hiring, and firing are typically conducted using comparison and contrast.
Comparison and contrast could be used to evaluate companies,
departments, or individuals.

     Exercise 1

        Brainstorm an essay that leans toward contrast. Choose one of the
     following three categories. Pick two examples from each. Then
     come up with one similarity and three differences between the
     examples.

         · Romantic comedies
         · Internet search engines
         · Cell phones

206 | Comparison and Contrast
     Exercise 2

        Brainstorm an essay that leans toward comparison. Choose one of
     the following three items. Then come up with one difference and
     three similarities.

         · Department stores and discount retail stores
         · Fast food chains and fine dining restaurants
         · Dogs and cats

THE STRUCTURE OF A COMPARISON AND
CONTRAST ESSAY

The compare-and-contrast essay starts with a thesis that clearly states the
two subjects that are to be compared, contrasted, or both and the reason
for doing so. The thesis could lean more toward comparing, contrasting, or
both. Remember, the point of comparing and contrasting is to provide useful
knowledge to the reader. Take the following thesis as an example that leans
more toward contrasting.

   Thesis statement: Organic vegetables may cost more than those that are
conventionally grown, but when put to the test, they are definitely worth
every extra penny.

   Here the thesis sets up the two subjects to be compared and contrasted
(organic versus conventional vegetables), and it makes a claim about the
results that might prove useful to the reader.

   You may organize compare-and-contrast essays in one of the following
two ways:

  · According to the subjects themselves, discussing one then the other

two subjects, it is helpful to have some phrases on hand that will cue the
reader to such analysis. See Table 10.3 "Phrases of Comparison and Contrast"
for examples.

        Create an outline for each of the items you chose in Exercise 1 & 2.
     Use the point-by-point organizing strategy for one of them, and use
     the subject organizing strategy for the other.

WRITING A COMPARISON AND CONTRAST
ESSAY

First choose whether you want to compare seemingly disparate subjects,
contrast seemingly similar subjects, or compare and contrast subjects. Once
you have decided on a topic, introduce it with an engaging opening

                                                                           Comparison and Contrast | 209
paragraph. Your thesis should come at the end of the introduction, and it
should establish the subjects you will compare, contrast, or both as well as
state what can be learned from doing so.

   The body of the essay can be organized in one of two ways: by subject or
by individual points. The organizing strategy that you choose will depend
on, as always, your audience and your purpose. You may also consider your
particular approach to the subjects as well as the nature of the subjects
themselves; some subjects might better lend themselves to one structure
or the other. Make sure to use comparison and contrast phrases to cue the
reader to the ways in which you are analyzing the relationship between the
subjects.

   After you finish analyzing the subjects, write a conclusion that summarizes
the main points of the essay and reinforces your thesis.

WRITING AT WORK

Many business presentations are conducted using comparison and contrast.
The organizing strategies--by subject or individual points--could also be
used for organizing a presentation. Keep this in mind as a way of organizing
your content the next time you or a colleague have to present something at
work.

     Exercise 4

        Choose one of the outlines you created in Exercise 3, and write a
     full compare-and-contrast essay. Be sure to include an engaging
     introduction, a clear thesis, well-defined and detailed paragraphs,
     and a fitting conclusion that ties everything together.

Key Takeaways

  · A compare-and-contrast essay analyzes two subjects by
     either comparing them, contrasting them, or both.

  · The purpose of writing a comparison or contrast essay is
     not to state the obvious but rather to illuminate subtle
     differences or unexpected similarities between two subjects.

  · The thesis should clearly state the subjects that are to be
     compared, contrasted, or both, and it should state what is to
     be learned from doing so.

  · There are two main organizing strategies for compare-and-
     contrast essays.

  · Organize by the subjects themselves, one then the other.
  · Organize by individual points, in which you discuss each

     subject in relation to each point.
  · Use phrases of comparison or phrases of contrast to signal

     to readers how exactly the two subjects are being analyzed.

WRITING FOR SUCCESS

     Learning Objectives

         · Determine the purpose and structure of persuasion in
             writing.

         · Identify bias in writing.
         · Assess various rhetorical devices.

THE PURPOSE OF PERSUASIVE WRITING

The purpose of persuasion in writing is to convince, motivate, or move
readers toward a certain point of view, or opinion. The act of trying to
persuade automatically implies more than one opinion on the subject can be
argued.

   The idea of an argument often conjures up images of two people yelling
and screaming in anger. In writing, however, an argument is very different.
An argument is a reasoned opinion supported and explained by evidence. To
argue in writing is to advance knowledge and ideas in a positive way. Written
arguments often fail when they employ ranting rather than reasoning.

212 | Persuasion
          TIP
          Most of us feel inclined to try to win the arguments we engage
       in. On some level, we all want to be right, and we want others to
       see the error of their ways. More times than not, however,
       arguments in which both sides try to win end up producing
       losers all around. The more productive approach is to persuade
       your audience to consider your opinion as a valid one, not simply
       the right one.

THE STRUCTURE OF A PERSUASIVE ESSAY

The following five features make up the structure of a persuasive essay:
  · Introduction and thesis
  · Opposing and qualifying ideas
  · Strong evidence in support of claim
  · Style and tone of language
  · A compelling conclusion

CREATING AN INTRODUCTION AND THESIS

The persuasive essay begins with an engaging introduction that presents the
general topic. The thesis typically appears somewhere in the introduction
and states the writer's point of view.

          TIP

                                                                                                Persuasion | 213
          Avoid forming a thesis based on a negative claim. For example,
       "The hourly minimum wage is not high enough for the average
       worker to live on." This is probably a true statement, but
       persuasive arguments should make a positive case. That is, the
       thesis statement should focus on how the hourly minimum wage
       is low or insufficient.

ACKNOWLEDGING OPPOSING IDEAS AND LIMITS TO YOUR
ARGUMENT

Because an argument implies differing points of view on the subject, you
must be sure to acknowledge those opposing ideas. Avoiding ideas that
conflict with your own gives the reader the impression that you may be
uncertain, fearful, or unaware of opposing ideas. Thus it is essential that you
not only address counterarguments but also do so respectfully.

   Try to address opposing arguments earlier rather than later in your essay.
Rhetorically speaking, ordering your positive arguments last allows you to
better address ideas that conflict with your own, so you can spend the rest
of the essay countering those arguments. This way, you leave your reader
thinking about your argument rather than someone else's. You have the last
word.

   Acknowledging points of view different from your own also has the effect
of fostering more credibility between you and the audience. They know from
the outset that you are aware of opposing ideas and that you are not afraid
to give them space.

   It is also helpful to establish the limits of your argument and what you
are trying to accomplish. In effect, you are conceding early on that your
argument is not the ultimate authority on a given topic. Such humility can go
a long way toward earning credibility and trust with an audience. Audience
members will know from the beginning that you are a reasonable writer,
and audience members will trust your argument as a result. For example, in
the following concessionary statement, the writer advocates for stricter gun
control laws, but she admits it will not solve all of our problems with crime:

214 | Persuasion
   Although tougher gun control laws are a powerful first step in decreasing
violence in our streets, such legislation alone cannot end these problems
since guns are not the only problem we face.

   Such a concession will be welcome by those who might disagree with this
writer's argument in the first place. To effectively persuade their readers,
writers need to be modest in their goals and humble in their approach to get
readers to listen to the ideas. Here are examples of some useful phrases of
concession:

  · although
  · granted that
  · of course
  · still
  · though
  · yet

     Exercise 1

        Try to form a thesis for each of the following topics. Remember
     the more specific your thesis, the better.

         · Foreign policy
         · Television and advertising
         · Stereotypes and prejudice
         · Gender roles and the workplace
         · Driving and cell phones
        Please share with a classmate and compare your answers. Choose
     the thesis statement that most interests you and discuss why.

                                                                                                 Persuasion | 215
BIAS IN WRITING

Everyone has various biases on any number of topics. For example, you
might have a bias toward wearing black instead of brightly colored clothes
or wearing jeans rather than formal wear. You might have a bias toward
working at night rather than in the morning, or working by deadlines rather
than getting tasks done in advance. These examples identify minor biases, of
course, but they still indicate preferences and opinions.

   Handling bias in writing and in daily life can be a useful skill. It will allow
you to articulate your own points of view while also defending yourself
against unreasonable points of view. The ideal in persuasive writing is to
let your reader know your bias, but do not let that bias blind you to the
primary components of good argumentation: sound, thoughtful evidence
and a respectful and reasonable address of opposing sides.

   The strength of a personal bias is that it can motivate you to construct a
strong argument. If you are invested in the topic, you are more likely to care
about the piece of writing. Similarly, the more you care, the more time and
effort you are apt to put forth and the better the final product will be.

   The weakness of bias is when the bias begins to take over the essay--when,
for example, you neglect opposing ideas, exaggerate your points, or
repeatedly insert yourself ahead of the subject by using I too often. Being
aware of all three of these pitfalls will help you avoid them.

THE USE OF I IN WRITING

The use of I in writing is often a topic of debate, and the acceptance of
its usage varies from instructor to instructor. It is difficult to predict the
preferences for all your present and future instructors, but consider the
effects it can potentially have on your writing.

   Be mindful of the use of I in your writing because it can make your
argument sound overly biased. There are two primary reasons:

 1. Excessive repetition of any word will eventually catch the reader's
      attention--and usually not in a good way. The use of I is no different.

2. The insertion of I into a sentence alters not only the way a sentence

216 | Persuasion
      might sound but also the composition of the sentence itself. I is often
      the subject of a sentence. If the subject of the essay is supposed to be,
      say, smoking, then by inserting yourself into the sentence, you are
      effectively displacing the subject of the essay into a secondary position.
      In the following example, the subject of the sentence is underlined:

       Smoking is bad.
          I think smoking is bad.

In the first sentence, the rightful subject, smoking, is in the subject position
in the sentence. In the second sentence, the insertion of I and think replaces
smoking as the subject, which draws attention to I and away from the topic
that is supposed to be discussed. Remember to keep the message (the
subject) and the messenger (the writer) separate.

CHECKLIST

Developing Sound Arguments

Does my essay contain the following elements?

  · An engaging introduction
  · A reasonable, specific thesis that is able to be supported by evidence
  · A varied range of evidence from credible sources
  · Respectful acknowledgement and explanation of opposing ideas
  · A style and tone of language that is appropriate for the subject and

      audience
  · Acknowledgement of the argument's limits
  · A conclusion that will adequately summarize the essay and reinforce

      the thesis

                                                                                                 Persuasion | 217
FACT AND OPINION

Facts are statements that can be definitely proven using objective data. The
statement that is a fact is absolutely valid. In other words, the statement
can be pronounced as true or false. For example, 2 + 2 = 4. This expression
identifies a true statement, or a fact, because it can be proved with objective
data.

   Opinions are personal views, or judgments. An opinion is what an
individual believes about a particular subject. However, an opinion in
argumentation must have legitimate backing; adequate evidence and
credibility should support the opinion. Consider the credibility of expert
opinions. Experts in a given field have the knowledge and credentials to
make their opinion meaningful to a larger audience.

   For example, you seek the opinion of your dentist when it comes to the
health of your gums, and you seek the opinion of your mechanic when it
comes to the maintenance of your car. Both have knowledge and credentials
in those respective fields, which is why their opinions matter to you. But the
authority of your dentist may be greatly diminished should he or she offer an
opinion about your car, and vice versa.

   In writing, you want to strike a balance between credible facts and
authoritative opinions. Relying on one or the other will likely lose more of
your audience than it gains.

          TIP
          The word prove is frequently used in the discussion of
       persuasive writing. Writers may claim that one piece of evidence
       or another proves the argument, but proving an argument is
       often not possible. No evidence proves a debatable topic one way
       or the other; that is why the topic is debatable. Facts can be
       proved, but opinions can only be supported, explained, and
       persuaded.

218 | Persuasion
     Exercise 2

        On a separate sheet of paper, take three of the theses you formed
     in Exercise 1, and list the types of evidence you might use in support
     of that thesis.

     Exercise 3

        Using the evidence you provided in support of the three theses in
     Exercise 2, come up with at least one counterargument to each.
     Then write a concession statement, expressing the limits to each of
     your three arguments.

USING VISUAL ELEMENTS TO STRENGTHEN
ARGUMENTS

Adding visual elements to a persuasive argument can often strengthen its
persuasive effect. There are two main types of visual elements: quantitative
visuals and qualitative visuals.

   Quantitative visuals present data graphically. They allow the audience
to see statistics spatially. The purpose of using quantitative visuals is to
make logical appeals to the audience. For example, sometimes it is easier to
understand the disparity in certain statistics if you can see how the disparity
looks graphically. Bar graphs, pie charts, Venn diagrams, histograms, and line
graphs are all ways of presenting quantitative data in spatial dimensions.

                                                                                                Persuasion | 219
   Qualitative visuals present images that appeal to the audience's emotions.
Photographs and pictorial images are examples of qualitative visuals. Such
images often try to convey a story, and seeing an actual example can carry
more power than hearing or reading about the example. For example, one
image of a child suffering from malnutrition will likely have more of an
emotional impact than pages dedicated to describing that same condition in
writing.

WRITING AT WORK

When making a business presentation, you typically have limited time to
get across your idea. Providing visual elements for your audience can be
an effective timesaving tool. Quantitative visuals in business presentations
serve the same purpose as they do in persuasive writing. They should make
logical appeals by showing numerical data in a spatial design. Quantitative
visuals should be pictures that might appeal to your audience's emotions.
You will find that many of the rhetorical devices used in writing are the same
ones used in the workplace.

WRITING A PERSUASIVE ESSAY

Choose a topic that you feel passionate about. If your instructor requires
you to write about a specific topic, approach the subject from an angle that
interests you. Begin your essay with an engaging introduction. Your thesis
should typically appear somewhere in your introduction.

   Start by acknowledging and explaining points of view that may conflict
with your own to build credibility and trust with your audience. Also state
the limits of your argument. This too helps you sound more reasonable and
honest to those who may naturally be inclined to disagree with your view. By
respectfully acknowledging opposing arguments and conceding limitations
to your own view, you set a measured and responsible tone for the essay.

   Make your appeals in support of your thesis by using sound, credible
evidence. Use a balance of facts and opinions from a wide range of sources,
such as scientific studies, expert testimony, statistics, and personal

220 | Persuasion
anecdotes. Each piece of evidence should be fully explained and clearly
stated.

   Make sure that your style and tone are appropriate for your subject and
audience. Tailor your language and word choice to these two factors, while
still being true to your own voice.

   Finally, write a conclusion that effectively summarizes the main argument
and reinforces your thesis.

     Exercise 4

        Choose one of the topics you have been working on throughout
     this section. Use the thesis, evidence, opposing argument, and
     concessionary statement as the basis for writing a full persuasive
     essay. Be sure to include an engaging introduction, clear
     explanations of all the evidence you present, and a strong
     conclusion.

         · To persuade a skeptical audience, you will need to use a
             wide range of evidence. Scientific studies, opinions from
             experts, historical precedent, statistics, personal anecdotes,
             and current events are all types of evidence that you might
             use in explaining your point.
         · Make sure that your word choice and writing style is
             appropriate for both your subject and your audience.
         · You should let your reader know your bias, but do not let
             that bias blind you to the primary components of good

Cause and Effect

WRITING FOR SUCCESS

     Learning Objectives

         · Determine the purpose and structure of cause and effect in
             writing.

         · Understand how to write a cause-and-effect essay.

THE PURPOSE OF CAUSE AND EFFECT IN
WRITING

It is often considered human nature to ask, "why?" and "how?" We want to
know how our child got sick so we can better prevent it from happening in
the future, or why our colleague a pay raise because we want one as well. We
want to know how much money we will save over the long term if we buy a
hybrid car. These examples identify only a few of the relationships we think
about in our lives, but each shows the importance of understanding cause
and effect.

   A cause is something that produces an event or condition; an effect is what
results from an event or condition. The purpose of the cause-and-effect
essay is to determine how various phenomena relate in terms of origins and
results. Sometimes the connection between cause and effect is clear, but
often determining the exact relationship between the two is very difficult.
For example, the following effects of a cold may be easily identifiable: a
sore throat, runny nose, and a cough. But determining the cause of the
sickness can be far more difficult. A number of causes are possible, and to
224 | Cause and Effect
complicate matters, these possible causes could have combined to cause the
sickness. That is, more than one cause may be responsible for any given
effect. Therefore, cause-and-effect discussions are often complicated and
frequently lead to debates and arguments.

          TIP
          Use the complex nature of cause and effect to your advantage.
       Often it is not necessary, or even possible, to find the exact
       cause of an event or to name the exact effect. So, when
       formulating a thesis, you can claim one of a number of causes or
       effects to be the primary, or main, cause or effect. As soon as you
       claim that one cause or one effect is more crucial than the
       others, you have developed a thesis.

     Exercise 1

        Consider the causes and effects in the following thesis
     statements. List a cause and effect for each one on your own sheet
     of paper.

         · The growing childhood obesity epidemic is a result of
             technology.

         · Much of the wildlife is dying because of the oil spill.
         · The town continued programs that it could no longer afford,

             so it went bankrupt.
         · More young people became politically active as use of the

             Internet spread throughout society.
         · While many experts believed the rise in violence was due to

             the poor economy, it was really due to the summer-long heat

                                                                                        Cause and Effect | 225
             wave.

     Exercise 2

        Write three cause-and-effect thesis statements of your own for
     each of the following five broad topics.

         · Health and nutrition
         · Sports
         · Media
         · Politics
         · History

THE STRUCTURE OF A CAUSE-AND-EFFECT
ESSAY

The cause-and-effect essay opens with a general introduction to the topic,
which then leads to a thesis that states the main cause, main effect, or
various causes and effects of a condition or event.

   The cause-and-effect essay can be organized in one of the following two
primary ways:

  · Start with the cause and then talk about the effects.
  · Start with the effect and then talk about the causes.
For example, if your essay were on childhood obesity, you could start by
talking about the effect of childhood obesity and then discuss the cause

226 | Cause and Effect
or you could start the same essay by talking about the cause of childhood
obesity and then move to the effect.

   Regardless of which structure you choose, be sure to explain each element
of the essay fully and completely. Explaining complex relationships requires
the full use of evidence, such as scientific studies, expert testimony,
statistics, and anecdotes.

   Because cause-and-effect essays determine how phenomena are linked,
they make frequent use of certain words and phrases that denote such
linkage. Here are some examples of phrases of causation:

  · as a result
  · because
  · consequently
  · hence
  · since
  · thus

The conclusion should wrap up the discussion and reinforce the thesis,
leaving the reader with a clear understanding of the relationship that was
analyzed.

          TIP
          Be careful of resorting to empty speculation. In writing,
       speculation amounts to unsubstantiated guessing. Writers are
       particularly prone to such trappings in cause-and-effect
       arguments due to the complex nature of finding links between
       phenomena. Be sure to have clear evidence to support the claims
       that you make.

     Exercise 3

        Look at some of the cause-and-effect relationships from Exercise
     2. Outline the links you listed. Outline one using a cause-then-effect
     structure. Outline the other using the effect-then-cause structure.

WRITING A CAUSE-AND-EFFECT ESSAY

Choose an event or condition that you think has an interesting cause-and-
effect relationship. Introduce your topic in an engaging way. End your
introduction with a thesis that states the main cause, the main effect, or
both.

   Organize your essay by starting with either the cause-then-effect
structure or the effect-then-cause structure. Within each section, you
should clearly explain and support the causes and effects using a full range
of evidence. If you are writing about multiple causes or multiple effects, you
may choose to sequence either in terms of order of importance. In other
words, order the causes from least to most important (or vice versa), or order
the effects from least important to most important (or vice versa).

   Use the phrases of causation when trying to forge connections between
various events or conditions. This will help organize your ideas and orient
the reader. End your essay with a conclusion that summarizes your main
points and reinforces your thesis.

228 | Cause and Effect
 Exercise 4

   Choose one of the ideas you outlined in Note 10.85 "Exercise 3"
and write a full cause-and-effect essay. Be sure to include an
engaging introduction, a clear thesis, strong evidence and examples,
and a thoughtful conclusion.

 Key Takeaways

    · The purpose of the cause-and-effect essay is to determine
        how various phenomena are related.

    · The thesis states what the writer sees as the main cause,
        main effect, or various causes and effects of a condition or
        event.

    · The cause-and-effect essay can be organized in one of
        these two primary ways:

    · Start with the cause and then talk about the effect.
    · Start with the effect and then talk about the cause.
    · Strong evidence is particularly important in the cause-and-

        effect essay due to the complexity of determining connections
        between phenomena.
    · Phrases of causation are helpful in signaling links between
        various elements in the essay.

PART 5: CRITICAL READING

Most college writing begins as a response to a reading -- whether assigned or
found. As more and more interaction moves online, we are required daily to
sort through written information with a swift and critical eye. Yet few of us
are trained in how to determine what is and is not believable. Critical reading
skills are vital to navigating college and the wider world, as this section's
reading addresses.

                                                                                Part 5: Critical Reading | 231

INTRODUCTION

Good researchers and writers examine their sources critically and actively.
They do not just compile and summarize these research sources in their
writing, but use them to create their own ideas, theories, and, ultimately,
their own, new understanding of the topic they are researching. Such an
approach means not taking the information and opinions that the sources
contain at face value and for granted, but to investigate, test, and even doubt
every claim, every example, every story, and every conclusion. It means
not to sit back and let your sources control you, but to engage in active
conversation with them and their authors. In order to be a good researcher
and writer, one needs to be a critical and active reader.

   This chapter is about the importance of critical and active reading. It
is also about the connection between critical reading and active, strong
writing. Much of the discussion you will find in this chapter in fundamental
to research and writing, no matter what writing genre, medium, or academic
discipline you read and write in. Every other approach to research writing,
every other research method and assignment offered elsewhere in this book
is, in some way, based upon the principles discussed in this chapter.

                                                                     Research and Critical Reading | 233
   Reading is at the heart of the research process. No matter what kinds
of research sources and, methods you use, you are always reading and
interpreting text. Most of us are used to hearing the word "reading" in
relation to secondary sources, such as books, journals, magazines, websites,
and so on. But even if you are using other research methods and sources,
such as interviewing someone or surveying a group of people, you are
reading. You are reading their subjects' ideas and views on the topic you are
investigating. Even if you are studying photographs, cultural artifacts, and
other non-verbal research sources, you are reading them, too by trying to
connect them to their cultural and social contexts and to understand their
meaning. Principles of critical reading which we are about to discuss in this
chapter apply to those research situations as well.

   I like to think about reading and writing as not two separate activities
but as two tightly connected parts of the same whole. That whole is the
process of learning and making of new meaning. It may seem that reading
and writing are complete opposite of one another. According to the popular
view, when we read, we "consume" texts, and when we write, we "produce"
texts. But this view of reading and writing is true only if you see reading as
a passive process of taking in information from the text and not as an active
and energetic process of making new meaning and new knowledge. Similarly,
good writing does not come from nowhere but is usually based upon, or at
least influenced by ideas, theories, and stories that come from reading. So,
if, as a college student, you have ever wondered why your writing teachers
have asked you to read books and articles and write responses to them, it
is because writers who do not read and do not actively engage with their
reading, have little to say to others.

   We will begin this chapter with the definition of the term "critical reading."
We will consider its main characteristics and briefly touch upon ways to
become an active and critical reader. Next, we will discuss the importance of
critical reading for research and how reading critically can help you become
a better researcher and make the research process more enjoyable. Also in
this chapter, a student-writer offers us an insight into his critical reading
and writing processes. This chapter also shows how critical reading can and
should be used for critical and strong writing. And, as all other chapters, this
one offers you activities and projects designed to help you implement the
advice presented here into practice.

234 | Research and Critical Reading
WHAT KIND OF READER ARE YOU?

You read a lot, probably more that you think. You read school textbooks,
lecture notes, your classmates' papers, and class websites. When school
ends, you probably read some fiction, magazines. But you also read other
texts. These may include CD liner notes, product reviews, grocery lists,
maps, driving directions, road signs, and the list can go on and on. And you
don't read all these texts in the same way. You read them with different
purposes and using different reading strategies and techniques. The first
step towards becoming a critical and active reader is examining your reading
process and your reading preferences. Therefore, you are invited to
complete the following exploration activity.

     Writing Activity: Analyzing Your Reading
   Habits

        List all the reading you have done in the last week. Include both
     "school" and "out-of school" reading. Try to list as many texts as you
     can think of, no matter how short and unimportant they might
     seem. Now, answer the following questions.

         · What was your purpose in reading each of those texts? Did
             you read for information, to pass a test, for enjoyment, to
             decide on a product you wanted to buy, and so on? Or, did you
             read to figure out some complex problem that keeps you
             awake at night?

         · You have probably come up with a list of different purposes.
             How did each of those purposes influence your reading
             strategies? Did you take notes or try to memorize what you
             read? How long did it take you to read different texts? Did you
             begin at the beginning and read till you reached the end, or
             did you browse some texts? Consider the time of day you

                                                                     Research and Critical Reading | 235
             were reading. Consider even whether some texts tired you out
             or whether you thought they were "boring." Why?
         · What did you do with the results of your reading? Did you
             use them for some practical purpose, such as buying a new
             product or finding directions, or did you use them for a less
             practical purpose, such as understanding some topic better r
             learning something about yourself and others?

        When you finish, share your results with the rest of the class and
     with your instructor.

Having answered the questions above, you have probably noticed that your
reading strategies differed depending on the reading task you were facing
and on what you planned to do with the results of the reading. If, for
example, you read lecture notes in order to pass a test, chances are you
"read for information," or "for the main" point, trying to remember as much
material as possible and anticipating possible test questions. If, on the other
hand, you read a good novel, you probably just focused on following the
story. Finally, if you were reading something that you hoped would help you
answer some personal question or solve some personal problem, it is likely
that you kept comparing and contrasting the information that you read your
own life and your own experiences.

   You may have spent more time on some reading tasks than others. For
example, when we are interested in one particular piece of information or
fact from a text, we usually put that text aside once we have located the
information we were looking for. In other cases, you may have been reading
for hours on end taking careful notes and asking questions.

   If you share the results of your investigation into your reading habits with
your classmates, you may also notice that some of their reading habits and
strategies were different from yours. Like writing strategies, approaches
to reading may vary from person to person depending on our previous
experiences with different topics and types of reading materials,
expectations we have of different texts, and, of course, the purpose with
which we are reading.

   Life presents us with a variety of reading situations which demand

236 | Research and Critical Reading
different reading strategies and techniques. Sometimes, it is important to
be as efficient as possible and read purely for information or "the main
point." At other times, it is important to just "let go" and turn the pages
following a good story, although this means not thinking about the story
you are reading. At the heart of writing and research, however, lies the
kind of reading known as critical reading. Critical examination of sources is
what makes their use in research possible and what allows writers to create
rhetorically effective and engaging texts.

KEY FEATURES OF CRITICAL READING

Critical readers are able to interact with the texts they read through
carefully listening, writing, conversation, and questioning. They do not sit
back and wait for the meaning of a text to come to them, but work hard
in order to create such meaning. Critical readers are not made overnight.
Becoming a critical reader will take a lot of practice and patience. Depending
on your current reading philosophy and experiences with reading, becoming
a critical reader may require a significant change in your whole
understanding of the reading process. The trade-off is worth it, however. By
becoming a more critical and active reader, you will also become a better
researcher and a better writer. Last but not least, you will enjoy reading and
writing a whole lot more because you will become actively engaged in both.

   One of my favorite passages describing the substance of critical and active
reading comes from the introduction to their book Ways of Reading, whose
authors David Bartholomae and Anthony Petrosky write:

       Reading involves a fair measure of push and shove. You make your
       mark on the book and it makes its mark on you. Reading is not
       simply a matter of hanging back and waiting for a piece, or its author,
       to tell you what the writing has to say. In fact, one of the difficult
       things about reading is that the pages before you will begin to speak
       only when the authors are silent and you begin to speak in their
       place, sometimes for them--doing their work, continuing their
       projects--and sometimes for yourself, following your own agenda (1).

Notice that Bartholomae and Petrosky describe reading process in pro-

                                                                      Research and Critical Reading | 237
active terms. Meaning of every text is "made," not received. Readers need
to "push and shove" in order to create their own, unique content of every
text they read. It is up the you as a reader to make the pages in front of you
"speak" by talking with and against the text, by questioning and expanding it.

   Critical reading, then, is a two-way process. As reader, you are not a
consumer of words, waiting patiently for ideas from the printed page or a
web-site to fill your head and make you smarter. Instead, as a critical reader,
you need to interact with what you read, asking questions of the author,
testing every assertion, fact, or idea, and extending the text by adding your
own understanding of the subject and your own personal experiences to
your reading.

   The following are key features of the critical approach to reading:

  · No text, however well written and authoritative, contains its own, pre-
      determined meaning.

  · Readers must work hard to create meaning from every text.
  · Critical readers interact with the texts they read by questioning them,

      responding to them, and expanding them, usually in writing.
  · To create meaning, critical readers use a variety of approaches,

      strategies, and techniques which include applying their personal
      experiences and existing knowledge to the reading process.
  · Critical readers seek actively out other texts, related to the topic of
      their investigation.

The following section is an examination of these claims about critical reading
in more detail.

TEXTS PRESENT IDEAS, NOT ABSOLUTE TRUTHS

In order to understand the mechanisms and intellectual challenges of critical
reading, we need to examine some of our deepest and long-lasting
assumptions about reading. Perhaps the two most significant challenges
facing anyone who wants to become a more active and analytical reader
is understanding that printed texts doe not contain inarguable truths and
learning to questions and talk back to those texts. Students in my writing
classes often tell me that the biggest challenge they face in trying to become

238 | Research and Critical Reading
critical readers is getting away from the idea that they have to believe
everything they read on a printed page. Years of schooling have taught many
of us to believe that published texts present inarguable, almost absolute
truths. The printed page has authority because, before publishing his or
her work, every writer goes through a lengthy process of approval, review,
revision, fact-checking, and so on. Consequently, this theory goes, what gets
published must be true. And if it is true, it must be taken at face value, not
questioned, challenged, or extended in any way.

   Perhaps, the ultimate authority among the readings materials encountered
by college belongs to the textbook. As students, we all have had to read
and almost memorize textbook chapters in order to pass an exam. We read
textbooks "for information," summarizing their chapters, trying to find "the
main points" and then reproducing these main points during exams. I have
nothing against textbook as such, in fact, I am writing one right now. And it
is certainly possible to read textbooks critically and actively. But, as I think
about the challenges which many college students face trying to become
active and critical readers, I come to the conclusion that the habit to read
every text as if they were preparing for an exam on it, as if it was a source of
unquestionable truth and knowledge prevents many from becoming active
readers.

   Treating texts as if they were sources of ultimate and unquestionable
knowledge and truth represents the view of reading as consumption.
According to this view, writers produce ideas and knowledge, and we,
readers, consume them. Of course, sometimes we have to assume this stance
and read for information or the "main point" of a text. But it is critical
reading that allows us to create new ideas from what we read and to become
independent and creative learners.

   Critical reading is a collaboration between the reader and the writer. It
offers readers the ability to be active participants in the construction of
meaning of every text they read and to use that meaning for their own
learning and self-fulfillment. Not even the best researched and written text
is absolutely complete and finished. Granted, most fields of knowledge have
texts which are called "definitive." Such texts usually represent our best
current knowledge on their subjects. However, even the definitive works get
revised over time and they are always open to questioning and different
interpretations.

                                                                     Research and Critical Reading | 239
READING IS A RHETORICAL TOOL

To understand how the claim that every reader makes his or her meaning
from texts works, it is necessary to examine what is know as the rhetorical
theory of reading. The work that best describes and justifies the rhetorical
reading theory is Douglas Brent's 1992 book Reading as Rhetorical Invention:
Knowledge, Persuasion, and the Teaching of Research-Based Writing. I like
to apply Brent's ideas to my discussions of critical reading because I think
that they do a good job demystifying critical reading's main claims. Brent's
theory of reading is a rhetorical device puts significant substance behind the
somewhat abstract ideas of active and critical reading, explaining how the
mechanisms of active interaction between readers and texts actually work.

   Briefly explained, Brent treats reading not only as a vehicle for
transmitting information and knowledge, but also as a means of persuasion.
In fact, according to Brent, knowledge equals persuasion because, in his
words, "Knowledge is not simply what one has been told. Knowledge is what
one believes, what one accepts as being at least provisionally true." (xi). This
short passage contains two assertions which are key to the understanding
of mechanisms of critical reading. Firstly, notice that simply reading "for the
main point" will not necessarily make you "believe" what you read. Surely,
such reading can fill our heads with information, but will that information
become our knowledge in a true sense, will we be persuaded by it, or will
we simply memorize it to pass the test and forget it as soon as we pass it?
Of course not! All of us can probably recall many instances in which we read
a lot to pass a test only to forget, with relief, what we read as soon as we
left the classroom where that test was held. The purpose of reading and
research, then, is not to get as much as information out of a text as possible
but to change and update one's system of beliefs on a given subject (Brent
55-57).

   Brent further states:

       The way we believe or disbelieve certain texts clearly varies from
       one individual to the next. If you present a text that is remotely
       controversial to a group of people, some will be convinced by it and
       some not, and those who are convinced will be convinced in different
       degrees. The task of a rhetoric of reading is to explain systematically

240 | Research and Critical Reading
       how these differences arise-- how people are persuaded differently
       by texts (18).

Critical and active readers not only accept the possibility that the same
texts will have different meanings for different people, but welcome this
possibility as an inherent and indispensable feature of strong, engaged, and
enjoyable reading process. To answer his own questions about what factors
contribute to different readers' different interpretations of the same texts,
Brent offers us the following principles that I have summarized from his
book:

  · Readers are guided by personal beliefs, assumptions, and pre-existing
      knowledge when interpreting texts. You can read more on the role of
      the reader's pre-existing knowledge in the construction of meaning
      later on in this chapter.

  · Readers react differently to the logical proofs presented by the writers
      of texts.

  · Readers react differently to emotional and ethical proofs presented by
      writers. For example, an emotional story told by a writer may resonate
      with one person more than with another because the first person lived
      through a similar experience and the second one did not, and so on.

The idea behind the rhetorical theory of reading is that when we read, we
not only take in ideas, information, and facts, but instead we "update our
view of the world." You cannot force someone to update their worldview, and
therefore, the purpose of writing is persuasion and the purpose of reading
is being persuaded. Persuasion is possible only when the reader is actively
engaged with the text and understands that much more than simple retrieval
of information is at stake when reading.

   One of the primary factors that influence our decision to accept or not
to accept an argument is what Douglas Brent calls our "repertoire of
experience, much of [which] is gained through prior interaction with texts"
(56). What this means is that when we read a new text, we do not begin with a
clean slate, an empty mind. However unfamiliar the topic of this new reading
may seem to us, we approach it with a large baggage of previous knowledge,
experiences, points of view, and so on. When an argument "comes in" into
our minds from a text, this text, by itself, cannot change our view on the
subject. Our prior opinions and knowledge about the topic of the text we

                                                                      Research and Critical Reading | 241
are reading will necessarily "filter out" what is incompatible with those views
(Brent 56-57). This, of course, does not mean that, as readers, we should
persist in keeping our old ideas about everything and actively resist learning
new things. Rather, it suggests that the reading process is an interaction
between the ideas in the text in front of us and our own ideas and pre-
conceptions about the subject of our reading. We do not always consciously
measure what we read according to our existing systems of knowledge
and beliefs, but we measure it nevertheless. Reading, according to Brent, is
judgment, and, like in life where we do not always consciously examine and
analyze the reasons for which we make various decisions, evaluating a text
often happens automatically or subconsciously (59).

   Applied to research writing, Brent's theory or reading means the following:

  · The purpose of research is not simply to retrieve data, but to
      participate in a conversation about it. Simple summaries of sources is
      not research, and writers should be aiming for active interpretation of
      sources instead

  · There is no such thing as an unbiased source. Writers make claims for
      personal reasons that critical readers need to learn to understand and
      evaluate.

  · Feelings can be a source of shareable good reason for belief. Readers
      and writers need to use, judiciously, ethical and pathetic proofs in
      interpreting texts and in creating their own.

  · Research is recursive. Critical readers and researchers never stop
      asking questions about their topic and never consider their research
      finished.

ACTIVE READERS LOOK FOR CONNECTIONS
BETWEEN TEXTS

Earlier on, I mentioned that one of the traits of active readers is their
willingness to seek out other texts and people who may be able to help them
in their research and learning. I find that for many beginning researchers
and writers, the inability to seek out such connections often turns into a
roadblock on their research route. Here is what I am talking about.

   Recently, I asked my writing students to investigate some problem on

242 | Research and Critical Reading
campus and to propose a solution to it. I asked them to use both primary
(interviews, surveys, etc.) and secondary (library, Internet, etc.) research.
Conducting secondary research allows a writer to connect a local problem
he or she is investigating and a local solution he or she is proposing with a
national and even global context, and to see whether the local situation is
typical or a-typical.

   One group of students decided to investigate the issue of racial and ethnic
diversity on our campus. The lack of diversity is a "hot" issue on our campus,
and recently an institutional task force was created to investigate possible
ways of making our university more diverse.

   The students had no trouble designing research questions and finding
people to interview and survey. Their subjects included students and faculty
as well as the university vice-president who was changed with overseeing
the work of the diversity task force. Overall, these authors have little trouble
conducting and interpreting primary research that led them to conclude
that, indeed, our campus is not diverse enough and that most students would
like to see the situation change.

   The next step these writers took was to look at the websites of some
other schools similar in size and nature to ours, to see how our university
compared on the issue of campus diversity with others. They were able
to find some statistics on the numbers of minorities at other colleges and
universities that allowed them to create a certain backdrop for their primary
research that they had conducted earlier.

   But good writing goes beyond the local situation. Good writing tries to
connect the local and the national and the global. It tries to look beyond
the surface of the problem, beyond simply comparing numbers and other
statistics. It seeks to understand the roots of a problem and propose a
solution based on a local and well as a global situation and research. The
primary and secondary research conducted by these students was not
allowing them to make that step from analyzing local data to understanding
their problem in context. They needed some other type of research sources.

   At that point, however, those writers hit an obstacle. How and where, they
reasoned, would we find other secondary sources, such as books, journals,
and websites, about the lack of diversity on our campus? The answer to
that question was that, at this stage in their research and writing, they did
not need to look for more sources about our local problem with the lack
of diversity. They needed to look at diversity and ways to increase it as
a national and global issue. They needed to generalize the problem and,

                                                                     Research and Critical Reading | 243
instead of looking at a local example, to consider its implications for the issue
they were studying overall. Such research would not only have allowed these
writers to examine the problem as a whole but also to see how it was being
solved in other places. This, in turn, might have helped them to propose a
local solution.

   Critical readers and researchers understand that it is not enough to look
at the research question locally or narrowly. After conducting research and
understanding their problem locally, or as it applies specifically to them,
active researchers contextualize their investigation by seeking out texts and
other sources which would allow them to see the big picture.

   Sometimes, it is hard to understand how external texts which do not seem
to talk directly about you can help you research and write about questions,
problems, and issues in your own life. In her 2004 essay, "Developing
`Interesting Thoughts': Reading for Research," writing teacher and my former
colleague Janette Martin tells a story of a student who was writing a paper
about what it is like to be a collegiate athlete. The emerging theme in
that paper was that of discipline and sacrifice required of student athletes.
Simultaneously, that student was reading a chapter from the book by the
French philosopher Michel Foucault called Discipline and Punish. Foucault's
work is a study of the western penitentiary system, which, of course cannot
be directly compared to experiences of a student athlete. At the same time,
one of the leading themes in Foucault's work is discipline. Martin states that
the student was able to see some connection between Foucault and her
own life and use the reading for her research and writing (6). In addition
to showing how related texts can be used to explore various aspects of the
writer's own life, this example highlights the need to read texts critically and
interpret them creatively. Such reading and research goes beyond simply
comparing of facts and numbers and towards relating ideas and concepts
with one another.

FROM READING TO WRITING

Reading and writing are the two essential tools of learning. Critical reading
is not a process of passive consumption, but one of interaction and
engagement between the reader and the text. Therefore, when reading
critically and actively, it is important not only to take in the words on the

244 | Research and Critical Reading
page, but also to interpret and to reflect upon what you read through writing
and discussing it with others.

CRITICAL READERS UNDERSTAND THE
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN REACTING AND
RESPONDING TO A TEXT

As stated earlier in this chapter, actively responding to difficult texts, posing
questions, and analyzing ideas presented in them is the key to successful
reading. The goal of an active reader is to engage in a conversation with
the text he or she is reading. In order to fulfill this goal, it is important to
understand the difference between reacting to the text and responding to it.

   Reacting to a text is often done on an emotional, rather than on an
intellectual level. It is quick and shallow. For example, if we encounter a
text that advances arguments with which we strongly disagree, it is natural
to dismiss those ideas out of hand as not wrong and not worthy of our
attention. Doing so would be reacting to the text based only on emotions and
on our pre-set opinions about its arguments. It is easy to see that reacting
in this way does not take the reader any closer to understanding the text. A
wall of disagreement that existed between the reader and the text before the
reading continues to exist after the reading.

   Responding to a text, on the other hand, requires a careful study of the
ideas presented and arguments advanced in it. Critical readers who possess
this skill are not willing to simply reject or accept the arguments presented
in the text after the first reading right away. To continue with our example
from the preceding paragraph, a reader who responds to a controversial
text rather than reacting to it might apply several of the following strategies
before forming and expressing an opinion about that text.

  · Read the text several times, taking notes, asking questions, and
      underlining key places.

  · Study why the author of the text advances ideas, arguments, and
      convictions, so different from the reader's own. For example, is the
      text's author advancing an agenda of some social, political, religious, or
      economic group of which he or she is a member?

                                                                     Research and Critical Reading | 245
  · Study the purpose and the intended audience of the text.
  · Study the history of the argument presented in the text as much as

      possible. For example, modern texts on highly controversial issues such
      as the death penalty, abortion, or euthanasia often use past events,
      court cases, and other evidence to advance their claims. Knowing the
      history of the problem will help you to construct meaning of a difficult
      text.
  · Study the social, political, and intellectual context in which the text was
      written. Good writers use social conditions to advance controversial
      ideas. Compare the context in which the text was written to the one in
      which it is read. For example, have social conditions changed, thus
      invalidating the argument or making it stronger?
  · Consider the author's (and your own) previous knowledge of the issue
      at the center of the text and your experiences with it. How might such
      knowledge or experience have influenced your reception of the
      argument?

Taking all these steps will help you to move away from simply reacting to a
text and towards constructing informed and critical response to it.

CRITICAL READERS RESIST OVERSIMPLIFIED
BINARY RESPONSES

Critical readers learn to avoid simple "agree-disagree" responses to complex
texts. Such way of thinking and arguing is often called "binary" because is
allows only two answers to every statement and every questions. But the
world of ideas is complex and, a much more nuanced approach is needed
when dealing with complex arguments.

   When you are asked to "critique" a text, which readers are often asked to
do, it does not mean that you have to "criticize" it and reject its argument out
of hand. What you are being asked to do instead is to carefully evaluate and
analyze the text's ideas, to understand how and why they are constructed
and presented, and only then develop a response to that text. Not every text
asks for an outright agreement or disagreement. Sometimes, we as readers
are not in a position to either simply support an argument or reject it. What
we can do in such cases, though, is to learn more about the text's arguments

246 | Research and Critical Reading
by carefully considering all of their aspects and to construct a nuanced,
sophisticated response to them. After you have done all that, it will still be
possible to disagree with the arguments presented in the reading, but your
opinion about the text will be much more informed and nuanced than if you
have taken the binary approach from the start.

TWO SAMPLE STUDENT RESPONSES

To illustrate the principles laid out in this section, consider the following two
reading responses. Both texts respond to a very well known piece, "A Letter
from Birmingham Jail," by Martin Luther King, Jr. In the letter, King responds
to criticism from other clergymen who had called his methods of civil rights
struggle "unwise and untimely." Both student writers were given the same
response prompt:

          After reading King's piece several times and with a pen or
       pencil in hand, consider what shapes King's letter. Specifically,
       what rhetorical strategies is he using to achieve a persuasive
       effect on his readers? In making your decisions, consider such
       factors as background information that he gives, ways in which
       he addresses his immediate audience, and others. Remember
       that your goal is to explore King's text, thus enabling you to
       understand his rhetorical strategies better.

     Example: Student A

        Martin Luther King Jr's "Letter from Birmingham Jail" is a very
     powerful text. At the time when minorities in America were silenced

                                                                      Research and Critical Reading | 247
     and persecuted, King had the courage to lead his people in the
     struggle for equality. After being jailed in Birmingham, Alabama,
     King wrote a letter to his "fellow clergymen" describing his struggle
     for civil rights. In the letter, King recounts a brief history of that
     struggle and rejects the accusation that it is "unwise and untimely."
     Overall, I think that King's letter is a very rhetorically effective text,
     one that greatly helped Americans to understand the civil rights
     movement.

     Example: Student B

        King begins his "Letter from Birmingham Jail" by addressing it to
     his "fellow clergymen." Thus, he immediately sets the tone of
     inclusion rather than exclusion. By using the word "fellow" in the
     address, I think he is trying to do two things. First of all, he presents
     himself as a colleague and a spiritual brother of his audience. That,
     in effect, says "you can trust me," "I am one of your kind." Secondly,
     by addressing his readers in that way, King suggests that everyone,
     even those Americans who are not directly involved in the struggle
     for civil rights, should be concerned with it. Hence the word "fellow."
     King's opening almost invokes the phrase "My fellow Americans" or
     "My fellow citizens" used so often by American Presidents when
     they address the nation.

        King then proceeds to give a brief background of his actions as a
     civil rights leader. As I read this part of the letter, I was wondering
     whether his readers would really have not known what he had
     accomplished as a civil rights leader. Then I realized that perhaps he
     gives all that background information as a rhetorical move. His
     immediate goal is to keep reminding his readers about his activities.

248 | Research and Critical Reading
     His ultimate goal is to show to his audience that his actions were
     non-violent but peaceful. In reading this passage by King, I
     remembered once again that it is important not to assume that your
     audience knows anything about the subject of the writing. I will try
     to use this strategy more in my own papers.

In the middle of the letter, King states: "The purpose of our direct-action
program is to create a situation so crisis-packed that it will inevitably open
the door to negotiation." This sentence looks like a thesis statement and I
wonder why he did not place it towards the beginning of the text, to get his
point across right away. After thinking about this for a few minutes and re-
reading several pages from our class textbook, I think he leaves his "thesis"
till later in his piece because he is facing a not- so-friendly (if not hostile)
audience. Delaying the thesis and laying out some background information
and evidence first helps a writer to prepare his or her audience for the
coming argument. That is another strategy I should probably use more often
in my own writing, depending on the audience I am facing.

REFLECTING ON THE RESPONSES

To be sure, much more can be said about King's letter than either of these
writers have said. However, these two responses allow us to see two
dramatically different approaches to reading. After studying both responses,
consider the questions below.

  · Which response fulfills the goals set in the prompt better and why?
  · Which responses shows a deeper understanding of the texts by the

      reader and why?
  · Which writer does a better job at avoiding binary thinking and creating

      a sophisticated reading of King's text and why?
  · Which writer is more likely to use the results of the reading in his or

      her own writing in the future and why?
  · Which writer leaves room for response to his text by others and why?

                                                                     Research and Critical Reading | 249
CRITICAL READERS DO NOT READ ALONE AND
IN SILENCE

One of the key principles of critical reading is that active readers do not read
silently and by themselves. By this I mean that they take notes and write
about what they read. They also discuss the texts they are working with,
with others and compare their own interpretations of those texts with the
interpretations constructed by their colleagues.

   As a college student, you are probably used to taking notes of what you
read. When I was in college, my favorite way of preparing for a test was
reading a chapter or two from my textbook, then closing the book, then
trying to summarize what I have read on a piece of paper. I tried to get the
main points of the chapters down and the explanations and proofs that the
textbooks' authors used. Sometimes, I wrote a summary of every chapter in
the textbook and then studied for the test from those summaries rather than
from the textbook itself. I am sure you have favorite methods of note taking
and studying from your notes, too.

   But now it strikes me that what I did with those notes was not critical
reading. I simply summarized my textbooks in a more concise, manageable
form and then tried to memorize those summaries before the test. I did not
take my reading of the textbooks any further than what was already on their
pages. Reading for information and trying to extract the main points, I did
not talk back to the texts, did not question them, and did not try to extend
the knowledge which they offered in any way. I also did not try to connect my
reading with my personal experiences or pre-existing knowledge in any way.
I also read in silence, without exchanging ideas with other readers of the
same texts. Of course, my reading strategies and techniques were dictated
by my goal, which was to pass the test.

   Critical reading has other goals, one of which is entering an on-going
intellectual exchange. Therefore it demands different reading strategies,
approaches, and techniques. One of these new approaches is not reading in
silence and alone. Instead, critical readers read with a pen or pencil in hand.
They also discuss what they read with others.

STRATEGIES FOR CONNECTING READING AND

250 | Research and Critical Reading
WRITING

If you want to become a critical reader, you need to get into a habit of writing
as you read. You also need to understand that complex texts cannot be read
just once. Instead, they require multiple readings, the first of which may be a
more general one during which you get acquainted with the ideas presented
in the text, its structure and style. During the second and any subsequent
readings, however, you will need to write, and write a lot. The following are
some critical reading and writing techniques which active readers employ as
they work to create meanings from texts they read.

UNDERLINE INTERESTING AND IMPORTANT PLACES IN THE
TEXT

Underline words, sentences, and passages that stand out, for whatever
reason. Underline the key arguments that you believe the author of the
text is making as well as any evidence, examples, and stories that seem
interesting or important. Don't be afraid to "get it wrong." There is no right
or wrong here. The places in the text that you underline may be the same
or different from those noticed by your classmates, and this difference of
interpretation is the essence of critical reading.

TAKE NOTES

Take notes on the margins. If you do not want to write on your book or
journal, attach post-it notes with your comments to the text. Do not be
afraid to write too much. This is the stage of the reading process during
which you are actively making meaning. Writing about what you read is the
best way to make sense of it, especially, if the text is difficult.

   Do not be afraid to write too much. This is the stage of the reading process
during which you are actively making meaning. Writing about what you read
will help you not only to remember the argument which the author of the
text is trying to advance (less important for critical reading), but to create
your own interpretations of the text you are reading (more important).

                                                                      Research and Critical Reading | 251
   Here are some things you can do in your comments

  · Ask questions.
  · Agree or disagree with the author.
  · Question the evidence presented in the text
  · Offer counter-evidence
  · Offer additional evidence, examples, stories, and so on that support the

      author's argument
  · Mention other texts which advance the same or similar arguments
  · Mention personal experiences that enhance your reading of the text

WRITE EXPLORATORY RESPONSES

Write extended responses to readings. Writing students are often asked to
write one or two page exploratory responses to readings, but they are not
always clear on the purpose of these responses and on how to approach
writing them. By writing reading responses, you are continuing the
important work of critical reading which you began when you underlined
interesting passages and took notes on the margins. You are extending the
meaning of the text by creating your own commentary to it and perhaps
even branching off into creating your own argument inspired by your
reading. Your teacher may give you a writing prompt, or ask you to come
up with your own topic for a response. In either case, realize that reading
responses are supposed to be exploratory, designed to help you delve deeper
into the text you are reading than note-taking or underlining will allow.

   When writing extended responses to the readings, it is important to keep
one thing in mind, and that is their purpose. The purpose of these
exploratory responses, which are often rather informal, is not to produce
a complete argument, with an introduction, thesis, body, and conclusion. It
is not to impress your classmates and your teacher with "big" words and
complex sentences. On the contrary, it is to help you understand the text you
are working with at a deeper level. The verb "explore" means to investigate
something by looking at it more closely. Investigators get leads, some of
which are fruitful and useful and some of which are dead-ends. As you
investigate and create the meaning of the text you are working with, do not
be afraid to take different directions with your reading response. In fact, it is

252 | Research and Critical Reading
important resist the urge to make conclusions or think that you have found
out everything about your reading. When it comes to exploratory reading
responses, lack of closure and presence of more leads at the end of the piece
is usually a good thing. Of course, you should always check with your teacher
for standards and format of reading responses.

   Try the following guidelines to write a successful response to a reading:
   Remember your goal--exploration. The purpose of writing a response is
to construct the meaning of a difficult text. It is not to get the job done as
quickly as possible and in as few words as possible.
   As you write, "talk back to the text." Make comments, ask questions, and
elaborate on complex thoughts. This part of the writing becomes much
easier if, prior to writing your response, you had read the assignment with a
pen in hand and marked important places in the reading.
   If your teacher provides a response prompt, make sure you understand
it. Then try to answer the questions in the prompt to the best of your
ability. While you are doing that, do not be afraid of bringing in related texts,
examples, or experiences. Active reading is about making connections, and
your readers will appreciate your work because it will help them understand
the text better.
   While your primary goal is exploration and questioning, make sure that
others can understand your response. While it is OK to be informal in your
response, make every effort to write in a clear, error-free language.
   Involve your audience in the discussion of the reading by asking questions,
expressing opinions, and connecting to responses made by others.

USE READING FOR INVENTION

Use reading and your responses to start your own formal writing projects.
Reading is a powerful invention tool. While preparing to start a new writing
project, go back to the readings you have completed and your responses
to those readings in search for possible topics and ideas. Also look through
responses your classmates gave to your ideas about the text. Another
excellent way to start your own writing projects and to begin research for
them is to look through the list of references and sources at the end of
the reading that you are working with. They can provide excellent topic-
generating and research leads.

                                                                     Research and Critical Reading | 253
KEEP A DOUBLE-ENTRY JOURNAL

Many writers like double-entry journals because they allow us to make that
leap from summary of a source to interpretation and persuasion. To start
a double-entry journal, divide a page into two columns. As you read, in
the left column write down interesting and important words, sentences,
quotations, and passages from the text. In the right column, right your
reaction and responses to them. Be as formal or informal as you want.
Record words, passages, and ideas from the text that you find useful for your
paper, interesting, or, in any, way striking or unusual. Quote or summarize
in full, accurately, and fairly. In the right-hand side column, ask the kinds
of questions and provide the kinds of responses that will later enable you
to create an original reading of the text you are working with and use that
reading to create your own paper.

DON'T GIVE UP

If the text you are reading seems too complicated or "boring," that might
mean that you have not attacked it aggressively and critically enough.
Complex texts are the ones worth pursuing and investigating because they
present the most interesting ideas. Critical reading is a liberating practice
because you do not have to worry about "getting it right." As long as you
make an effort to engage with the text and as long as you are willing to work
hard on creating a meaning out of what you read, the interpretation of the
text you are working with will be valid.

   IMPORTANT: So far, we have established that no pre-existing meaning is
possible in written texts and that critical and active readers work hard to
create such meaning. We have also established that interpretations differ
from reader to reader and that there is no "right" or "wrong" during the
critical reading process. So, you may ask, does this mean that any reading
of a text that I create will be a valid and persuasive one? With the exception
of the most outlandish and purposely-irrelevant readings that have nothing
to do with the sources text, the answer is "yes." However, remember that
reading and interpreting texts, as well as sharing your interpretations with
others are rhetorical acts. First of all, in order to learn something from your
critical reading experience, you, the reader, need to be persuaded by your

254 | Research and Critical Reading
own reading of the text. Secondly, for your reading to be accepted by others,
they need to be persuaded by it, too. It does not mean, however, that in order
to make your reading of a text persuasive, you simply have to find "proof" in
the text for your point of view. Doing that would mean reverting to reading
"for the main point," reading as consumption. Critical reading, on the other
hand, requires a different approach. One of the components of this approach
is the use of personal experiences, examples, stories, and knowledge for
interpretive and persuasive purposes. This is the subject of the next section
of this chapter.

ONE CRITICAL READER'S PATH TO CREATING A
MEANING: A CASE STUDY

Earlier on in this chapter, we discussed the importance of using your existing
knowledge and prior experience to create new meaning out of unfamiliar
and difficult texts. In this section, I'd like to offer you one student writer's
account of his meaning- making process. Before I do that, however, it is
important for me to tell you a little about the class and the kinds of reading
and writing assignments that its members worked on.

   All the writing projects offered to the members of the class were promoted
by readings, and students were expected to actively develop their own ideas
and provide their own readings of assigned texts in their essays. The main
text for the class was the anthology Ways of Reading edited by David
Bartholomae and Anthony Petrosky that contains challenging and complex
texts. Like for most of his classmates, this approach to reading and writing
was new to Alex who had told me earlier that he was used to reading "for
information" or "for the main point".

   In preparation for the first writing project, the class read Adrienne Rich's
essay "When We Dead Awaken: Writing as Revision." In her essay, Rich offers
a moving account of her journey to becoming a writer. She makes the case
for constantly "revising" one's life in the light of all new events and
experiences. Rich blends voices and genres throughout the essay, using
personal narrative, academic argument, and even poetry. As a result, Rich
creates the kind of personal-public argument which, on the one hand,
highlights her own life, and on the other, illustrates that Rich's life is typical

                                                                     Research and Critical Reading | 255
for her time and her environment and that her readers can also learn from
her experiences.

   To many beginning readers and writers, who are used to a neat separation
of "personal" and "academic" argument, such a blend of genres and styles
may seem odd. In fact, on of the challenges that many of the students
in the class faced was understanding why Rich chooses to blend personal
writing with academic and what rhetorical effects she achieves by doing so.
After writing informal responses to the essay and discussing it in class, the
students were offered the following writing assignment:

       Although Rich tells a story of her own, she does so to provide an
       illustration of an even larger story--one about what it means to be
       a woman and a writer. Tell a story of your own about the ways
       you might be said to have been named or shaped or positioned
       by an established or powerful culture. Like Rich (and perhaps with
       similar hesitation), use your own experience as an illustration of both
       your own situation and the situation of people like you. You should
       imagine that the assignment is a way for you to use (and put to the
       test) some of Rich's terms, words like "re-vision," "renaming," and
       "structure." (Bartholomae and Petrosky 648).

Notice that this assignment does not ask students to simply analyze Rich's
essay, to dissect its argument or "main points." Instead, writers are asked
to work with their own experiences and events of their own lives in order
to provide a reading of Rich which is affected and informed by the writers'
own lives and own knowledge of life. This is critical reading in action when a
reader creates his or her one's own meaning of a complex text by reflecting
on the relationship between the content of that text and one's own life.

   In response to the assignment, one of the class members, Alex Cimino-
Hurt, wrote a paper that re-examined and re- evaluated his upbringing and
how those factors have influenced his political and social views. In particular,
Alex was trying to reconcile his own and his parents' anti-war views with the
fact than a close relative of his was fighting in the war in Iraq as he worked
on the paper. Alex used such terms as "revision" and "hesitation" to develop
his piece.

   Like most other writers in the class, initially Alex seemed a little puzzled,
even confused by the requirement to read someone else's text through the
prism of his own life and his own experiences. However, as he drafted,

256 | Research and Critical Reading
revised, and discussed his writing with his classmates and his instructor, the
new approach to reading and writing became clearer to him. After finishing
the paper, Alex commented on his reading strategies and techniques and on
what he learned about critical reading during the project:

   ON PREVIOUS READING HABITS AND TECHNIQUES

       Previously when working on any project whether it be for a History,
       English, or any other class that involved reading and research, there
       was a certain amount of minimalism. As a student I tried to balance
       the least amount of effort with the best grade. I distinctly remember
       that before, being taught to skim over writing and reading so that I
       found "main" points and highlighted them. The value of thoroughly
       reading a piece was not taught because all that was needed was a
       shallow interpretation of whatever information that was provided
       followed by a regurgitation. [Critical reading] provided a dramatic
       difference in perspective and helped me learn to not only dissect the
       meaning of a piece, but also to see why the writer is using certain
       techniques or how the reading applies to my life.

ON DEVELOPING CRITICAL READING STRATEGIES

       When reading critically I found that the most important thing for
       me was to set aside a block of time in which I would't have to hurry
       my reading or skip parts to "Get the gist of it." Developing an eye
       for...detail came in two ways. The first method is to read the text
       several times, and the second is to discuss it with my classmates and
       my teacher. It quickly became clear to me that the more I read a
       certain piece, the more I got from it as I became more comfortable
       with the prose and writing style. With respect to the second way,
       there is always something that you can miss and there is always a
       different perspective that can be brought to the table by either the
       teacher or a classmate.

ON READING RICH'S ESSAY

       In reading Adrienne Rich's essay, the problem for me was't
       necessarily relating to her work but instead just finding the right
       perspective from which to read it. I was raised in a very open family
       so being able to relate to others was learned early in my life. Once

                                                                      Research and Critical Reading | 257
       I was able to parallel my perspective to hers, it was just a matter
       of composing my own story. Mine was my liberalism in conservative
       environments--the fact that frustrates me sometimes. I felt that her
       struggle frustrated her, too. By using quotations from her work, I was
       able to show my own situation to my readers.

ON WRITING THE PAPER

       The process that I went through to write an essay consisted of three
       stages. During the first stage, I wrote down every coherent idea
       I had for the essay as well as a few incoherent ones. This helped
       me create a lot of material to work with. While this initial material
       doesn't always have direction it provides a foundation for writing.
       The second stage involved rereading Rich's essay and deciding which
       parts of it might be relevant to my own story. Looking at my own
       life and at Rich's work together helped me consolidate my paper. The
       third and final stage involved taking what is left and refining the style
       of the paper and taking care of the mechanics.

ADVICE FOR CRITICAL READERS

The first key to being a critical and active reader is to find something in the
piece that interests, bothers, encourages, or just confuses you. Use this to
drive your analysis. Remember there is no such thing as a boring essay, only
a boring reader.

  · Reading something once is never enough so reading it quickly before
      class just won't cut it. Read it once to get your brain comfortable with
      the work, then read it again and actually try to understand what's going
      on in it. You can't read it too many times.

  · Ask questions. It seems like a simple suggestion but if you never ask
      questions you'll never get any answers. So, while you're reading, think
      of questions and just write them down on a piece of paper lest you
      forget them after about a line and a half of reading.

258 | Research and Critical Reading
CONCLUSION

Reading and writing are rhetorical processes, and one does not exist without
the other. The goal of a good writer is to engage his or her readers into a
dialog presented in the piece of writing. Similarly, the goal of a critical and
active reader is to participate in that dialog and to have something to say
back to the writer and to others. Writing leads to reading and reading leads
to writing. We write because we have something to say and we read because
we are interested in ideas of others.

   Reading what others have to say and responding to them help us make
that all-important transition from simply having opinions about something
to having ideas. Opinions are often over-simplified and fixed. They are not
very useful because, if different people have different opinions that they are
not willing to change or adjust, such people cannot work or think together.
Ideas, on the other hand, are ever evolving, fluid, and flexible. Our ideas are
informed and shaped by our interactions with others, both in person and
through written texts. In a world where thought and action count, it is not
enough to simply "agree to disagree." Reading and writing, used together,
allow us to discuss complex and difficult issues with others, to persuade and
be persuaded, and, most importantly, to act.

   Reading and writing are inextricably connected, and I hope that this
chapter has shown you ways to use reading to inform and enrich you writing
and your learning in general. The key to becoming an active, critical, and
interested reader is the development of varied and effective reading
techniques and strategies. I'd like to close this chapter with the words from
the writer Alex Cimino-Hurt: "Being able to read critically is important no
matter what you plan on doing with your career or life because it allows you
to understand the world around you."
