BAD IDEAS ABOUT WRITING
INTRODUCTION

    Cheryl E. Ball and Drew M. Loewe

    Beginning in 1998, Edge.org has asked a diverse group of schol-
ars, intellectuals, and artists the annual Edge Question, a ques-
tion designed to spark arguments about provocative ideas to be
published online and collected into print volumes intended for a
general public audience. Edge Questions have included such ques-
tions as "What is your dangerous idea?," "What have you changed
your mind about? Why?," and the one that inspired this collec-
tion: "What scientific idea is ready for retirement?" That last ques-
tion was the 2014 Edge Question, published in a book titled This
Idea Must Die: Scientific Theories that are Blocking Progress. Drew first
saw the book in a publisher's exhibit at the 2015 Conference on
College Composition and Communication, a big annual conven-
tion of writing teachers and scholars. After reading the book, espe-
cially in the context of an academic convention, Drew suggested on
social media that the field of writing studies should publish its own
collective effort to name particularly unhelpful or backward ideas
and argue directly to the public about them. Cheryl replied right
away that she would be on board, and thus this project was born.

    This project is necessary because while scholars in writing stud-
ies (just as in any academic field) argue to and against one another
in scholarly journals, books, and conference talks, those forms
of knowledge-making don't consistently find their way into the
public's understanding of writing. Yet "the public" in all its mani-
festations--teachers, students, parents, administrators, lawmak-
ers, news media--are important to how writing is conceptualized
and taught. These publics deserve clearly articulated and well-re-
searched arguments about what is not working, what must die, and
what is blocking progress in current understandings of writing. So
our call for proposals sought contributions that provided a snapshot
2 Bad Ideas About Writing

of major myths about writing instruction--written by experts for
the educated public--that could collectively spark debate and have
us rethink our pieties and myths. This collection is an attempt by
a varied and diverse group of writing scholar-teachers to trans-
late our specialized knowledge and experiences about writing for
a truly wide set of audiences, most of whom will never read the
scholarly journals and books or attend conferences about this topic
because of the closed nature of such publications and proceed-
ings. In keeping with the public purpose of these writings, it was
important to us that it be published open-access. Because there are
so few options for trade-like academic books that are open access,
we decided--in consultation with the authors of this collection--
to publish Bad Ideas About Writing as an open educational resource
through the Digital Publishing Institute, which Cheryl directs. Bad
Ideas will join other books in West Virginia University Library's
nascent digital publishing project, where it will be supported by
librarians for a long time to come.

     We intend this work to be less a bestiary of bad ideas about
writing than an effort to name bad ideas and suggest better ones.
Some of those bad ideas are quite old, such as the archetype of
the inspired genius author, the five-paragraph essay, or the abuse
of adjunct writing teachers. Others are much newer, such as
computerized essay scoring or gamification. Some ideas, such as
the supposed demise of literacy brought on by texting, are newer
bad ideas but are really instances of older bad ideas about literacy
always being in a cycle of decline. Yet the same core questions such
as what is good writing, what makes a good writer, how should writing
be assessed, and the like persist across contexts, technologies, and
eras. The project has its genesis in frustration, but what emerges is
hope: hope for leaving aside bad ideas and thinking about writing
in more productive, inclusive, and useful ways.

     The individual entries, which we came to dub as both opin-
ionated encyclopedia entries and researched mini-manifestos, offer
syntheses of relevant research and experience along with cross-ref-
erences to other entries that take up related subjects. Instead of
the typical trappings of academic citation styles (APA, MLA,
Chicago, Oxford, etc.) that are specific to certain disciplines, we
asked authors in the Bad Ideas collection to summarize the avail-
able research and present it in a way similar to how a newspaper,
introductory textbook, or podcast might deliver such research--
not through individual citations, but through a list of resources
and further reading that would point readers to follow-up material.
                                                                              Introduction3

The authors of these entries are often published experts in these
fields, so searching for their other work at a library or online will
produce additional information on these topics. We have provided
keywords for each entry as well, which correspond to the academic
terms that would appear in other peer-reviewed, published research
on these topics.

    The entries cohere around eight major categories of bad ideas
about writing that are tied to the production, circulation, cultural
use of, evaluation, and teaching of writing in multiple ways. The
categories are bad ideas about:

      · The features of good writing
      · What makes good writers
      · How grammar and style should be understood
      · Which techniques or processes produce good writing
      · Particular genres and occasions for writing
      · How writing should be assessed
      · How technology impacts writing
      · Teachers of writing
    Although we have categories (and there are thematic clusters
visible within the larger categories), we encourage readers to read
the entries with and against each other, looking for productive over-
laps and disagreements. For instance, there are at least three entries
on the five-paragraph essay--the genre perhaps most known by the
various publics reading this book, and the most maligned by its
writers--and each entry takes a different perspective, disagreeing
as needed where the research and the writer's experience pertain.
    Without forcing a weak consensus or flattening out the indi-
viduality of the chapters, together they offer a practical, action-ori-
ented group of rational manifestos for discontinuing unhelpful
or exclusionary ideas about a subject and activity that all have a
stake in. We hope that the collection is a conversation-starter, not
a conversation-stopper, and we hope that it provides a catalog of
support for productive conversations about how and why to stop
the bad ideas about writing and start the good.
BAD IDEAS ABOUT
WHAT GOOD WRITING IS
RHETORIC IS SYNONYMOUS WITH
EMPTY SPEECH

    Patricia Roberts-Miller

    Recently, I was at a meeting of faculty whose research and
teaching interests concerned issues of environmentalism. A
colleague from another department asked me what my area was.
"Environmental rhetoric," I replied. He looked slightly shocked
and then commented, "Good environmentalism doesn't have a
rhetoric." I'm in a department of rhetoric, so I teach rhetoric, read
scholarly pieces on rhetoric, and attend conferences on rhetoric.
However, I often forget that other faculty members' views on rhet-
oric might be different than mine.

    A popular view of rhetoric is that it is a straightforward model
of how communication should work: A person can speak the truth
simply by using words that refer to true things in the world. If she
chooses not to use sentences filled with words that refer to true
things in the world, then she is engaged in rhetoric. Rhetoric, in
this view, is something you add on to sentences (such as meta-
phor) that decorates and obscures communication. If I say, "The
cat is on the mat," I am using language correctly. However, if I say,
"The elegant feline languishes mournfully on the expensive carpet,
waiting impatiently for what he sees as his lazy servants to open a
can of salmon," then I have added rhetoric to the first sentence, or
chosen rhetoric over clear communication.

    For many people, the simpler, plainer version of the sentence is
not just a stylistic choice, it's a moral one. Many people believe that
the addition of more complicated words obscures the meaning of
the sentence. Rhetoric, to them, is something that hides the truth.
If you look at the two sentences, though, you can see that the elabo-
rated, supposedly more rhetorical one communicates quite clearly.
In fact, it communicates more effectively and precisely than "The
8 Bad Ideas

cat is on the mat." It might, of course, be false--there might not be
such a cat; it might not be elegant; it might not be thinking much
of anything; it might be quite cheerful; it might not like salmon.
But the same is true of the simpler sentence--there might not be a
cat; it might not be on a mat. Thus, linguistic simplicity and truth-
fulness aren't necessarily connected, and linguistic complexity and
truthfulness aren't necessarily opposed.

     Or, to put it another way, for a long time, philosophers of
language insisted that language works by sentences having propo-
sitional content--"the cat is on the mat"--which can be expressed
in various ways. Rhetoric is what we layer onto the proposition.
Or, as the old saying goes, "Rhetoric is clothing on the idea." In an
Edenic world, we would all wander around naked, and we would
all simply and clearly speak our thoughts; rhetoric is something we
must have in this fallen world.

     People who believe that rhetoric hides meaning believe
that we could return to Eden by using simple, plain, and rheto-
ric-free language. One of several underlying assumptions is that
it's harder to lie in plain language, or that lies are more obvious
when the language is less complicated. Therefore, we can trust
plain language and should treat complicated language with suspi-
cion. Oddly enough, this seemingly straightforward proposition
isn't true. In other words, this simple belief shows that an idea can
be untrue and persuasive at the same time. It is also interesting
that the master deceivers have generally relied on simple, yet false,
claims. It's quite likely that people believed their assertions were
clear and plain and, therefore, assumed that they must be true.

     The Edenic view isn't a helpful way to think about rhetoric.
It isn't even how language works. While it's true that the same
thing can be said in different ways, there is a way of saying that
thing without rhetoric. "The cat is on the mat" is still a style--the
simple style--with internal rhyming and prose rhythm. It's also
structurally the rhetorical figure of chiasmus--the sentence begins
and ends in an almost identical way. We can't get away from rhet-
oric, but we can choose its kind.

     As in all interesting arguments, it's a question of how we're
defining terms. And rhetoric has a variety of definitions. It was first
used in Platonic dialogues with very little precision. It comes from
the Greek word for a person with a certain role in the Athenian
Assembly (rhetor). It is believed that it was Plato who added the
-ic later.

     He used rhetoric in terms of speech-making as opposed to
                                                         About What Good Writing Is 9

arguing in small groups. Plato wasn't opposed to argumentation,
and he wasn't even opposed to some verbal sleight of hand. After
all, Socrates--often read as a kind of spokesman for Plato's views--
relied heavily on some fairly dodgy logical moves in the dialogues.
Plato's point seems to be that speech-making isn't a very useful
skill because making speeches to large groups (Athenian juries
might have hundreds of people) is not very effective for getting
to the truth. It might be effective for getting others to accept the
truth one has already figured out (that seems to be the point that
Socrates is making in the dialogue Phaedrus), but, if you want to
find out what's true, argue with another individual. Do not make
a speech.

    Of course, Socrates makes a lot of speeches in Platonic dialogues.
So, it is still murky whether or not Plato noticed the contradiction,
was making a different point despite noticing the proposition, or
didn't write the dialogues to get to the truth. In fact, Plato's over-
all attitude toward rhetoric is murky, even though his school, the
Academy, did have rhetoric classes. They were taught by a man
named Aristotle.

    On the other hand, Aristotle, who was a teacher of rheto-
ric, neither defined rhetoric as style nor as something you add to
language. He described it as a discipline and a skill that enables
you to see the available means of persuasion. For Aristotle, rheto-
ric is about public speaking to large groups, and it is different from
philosophy. So, he did share those two assumptions with Plato.
But he didn't agree with Plato about rhetoric not getting us to the
truth. He thought that it could get us to the truth, but that it could
also be used to deceive. It depends on the motives of the person
using it.

    Aristotle loved syllogisms, and seems to have believed that all
reasoning could be done through them. In philosophy, to get to
the truth, you try to begin with a universally valid major premise
(e.g., all men are mortal). Then you have a more specific proposi-
tion related to that premise (e.g., Socrates is a man) that enables
you to draw a conclusion (e.g., Socrates is mortal). But Aristotle
said that this kind of reasoning doesn't work in large assemblies
for two reasons. First, during a speech, people don't have the time
to reason from universally valid major premises--if you're arguing
about whether Philip of Macedon represents a threat, it's useless
to try to find universally valid premises about tyrants or war or
people from Macedon. You don't have time. Second, the kind of
things about which we make speeches--politics, ethics, military
10 Bad Ideas

strategy, guilt or innocence, honor and dishonor--aren't subject
to certainty. There are no universally valid major premises about
tyrants that will help us figure out what we need to do now and
here to assess Philip. We must rely on what is probably true.

     According to Aristotle, what you learn from rhetoric is how
to approach political, ethical, and legal problems, how to come
up with an argument when you can't be (or, at least, shouldn't
be) certain that you're right. You also learn how to assess other
people's arguments. Aristotle, unlike many other philosophers,
doesn't present rhetoric as an inferior discipline to philosophy (he
says it's a "counterpart"). It's just different. It's a pragmatic skill
that helps us in decision-making.

     Aristotle, being an astute observer, noticed that people
argued about different things in similar ways. He came up with
28 approaches, called "lines of argument" (they're also sometimes
called "formal topoi," which makes it seem as though they have
long dresses and white ties). If I am making a speech trying to
persuade people to become more active in politics, I might argue
from precedent (listed as #11 of his 28 lines), or argue that the
consequences of political activism are good (#13), or point out
inconsistencies in the argument for political quietism (#22), and
so on. Those different lines aren't ornaments I hang on the propo-
sition that people should be politically active; they are all different
ways of thinking about the situation.

     Take, for instance, Aristotle's first line of argument: consider-
ation of the opposite, a strategy that might structure my entire
case. I might spend all my time trying to show that political activ-
ism is good because political quietism is bad. I might, however,
make that just part of one speech, in which I move from how good
it is to be politically active to a moving description of the tragedies
associated with political quietism. Or, I might make it one para-
graph, or one sentence. I might say, "Ask not what your country can
do for you, but what you can do for your country." In other words,
the forms--such as consideration of the opposite--can be used
to structure a clause, sentence, paragraph, speech, or (in John F.
Kennedy's case) political philosophy. Rhetoric is a way of thinking.
It is not just something added to a thought derived by other means.

     Does that mean that rhetoric is always good? Of course not.
Rhetoric is a contingent, pragmatic, and generally (but not always)
verbal way of approaching problems we face as members of commu-
nities. It is the cause as well as the consequence of thought. If we
tend to think in binaries and divide everything into this versus that,
                                                        About What Good Writing Is 11

then we'll probably be drawn to the rhetorical figures that divide
things into two. Continually presenting and interpreting issues
in that divided way will reinforce our sense that things really are
divided into two. We might then act in ways that divide things into
two--we might believe that everyone is either an ally or an enemy,
and thereby alienate neutral parties. Thinking and talking about
everyone as ally or enemy might mean we are likely to end up in a
world in which people end up treating us in that manner. Rhetoric
isn't always good, and it isn't always bad, but it's rarely neutral.

    For instance, we might be tempted to use metaphors of disease,
infection, or contamination for those groups that we don't like.
That might be a calculated decision to mislead an audience. We
might not dislike the groups as vehemently as we project but we
still perform for the audience to get votes, money, popularity, sales,
sex, or something else. It is insincere. These types of people might
make us feel unsettled and disgusted. They might even come
across to us as dangerous. Thus, we call them slimy or a cancer on
the body politic. We proclaim that they spread ideas, weaken our
community, and threaten our children. Those metaphors and that
rhetoric would feel accurate, and it would convey our meaning--it
is not added on; it is not ornamentation. It is what we mean. And
it can hurt us as a community because it can mean that we then
interpret that group's actions through a lens of disease, threat, and
danger. We can end up killing them or getting them killed because
of the rhetoric we used. We can't get away from rhetoric, but we
can choose the kind of rhetoric we use.

Further Reading

    For further reading on rhetoric as more than "mere rhet-
oric," see especially Wayne Booth's Rhetoric of Rhetoric, which
distinguishes between "rhetrickery" and rhetoric as an inclusive
method of deliberation. Eugene Garver's Aristotle's Rhetoric: An
Art of Character is an elegant introduction to Aristotle, and Debra
Hawhee and Sharon Crowley's Ancient Rhetorics for Contemporary
Students, though a textbook, explains classical and current concep-
tions of rhetoric usefully.

AMERICA IS FACING A LITERACY
CRISIS

    Jacob Babb

    In a 1975 Newsweek article entitled "Why Johnny Can't Write,"
Merrill Sheils asserted, "Willy-nilly, the U.S. educational system is
spawning a generation of semiliterates." Sheils worried that tech-
nologies such as computer printouts and the conference call were
destroying Americans' abilities to produce clear and concise prose
in professional settings, warning that the decline of literacy means
that they would soon find themselves back in Babel. Sheils offers
a dire vision of late 20th-century Americans who were unwilling to
embrace the highly structured rules of the English language and a
failing education system that was shoving literacy over the preci-
pice. Literacy, according to Sheils, was in crisis.

    The notion that literacy is in crisis is nothing new. Americans
have been asking why Johnny can't write for a long time now. The
United States has fought against the perceived decline in literacy
since the 19th century when higher education--indeed, education
in general--became more widely available to people who were not
wealthy white men.

     It was during this era that higher education gradually shifted
away from its narrow periphery that produced clergymen and
lawyers. The Morrill Land-Grant Act of 1862 authorized states to
use federal lands to build state-supported institutions that focused
on agriculture and technology. In response, many of the best univer-
sities in the country were established. Colleges and universities
began to put greater emphasis on faculty research, moving away
from the more teaching-focused traditions of American higher
education. The emphasis on research continued to grow through-

science that cured diseases, sent people to the moon, and obliter-
ated large quantities of people with atomic weapons.

     As the purpose of higher education changed and more academic
institutions were established, more people began going to college.
The economic and educational backgrounds of new students
became more varied. And with each change that was witnessed
in students, technology, and media, academics and non-academics
alike bemoaned the decline of literacy.

     The perennial literacy crisis has been a significant contribu-
tor to the spread of composition instruction in American universi-
ties. First-year writing emerged in response to a perception among
faculty members at colleges and universities as well as members
of the broader society outside academia that high schools were
not providing adequate instruction in writing and reading, so high
school graduates were underprepared for the rigorous demands of
academic writing. At Harvard University, the faculty and admin-
istration decided that the crisis in student preparation required a
temporary solution, a stopgap until high schools could improve
the quality of writing instruction and subsequently send students
to college who did not struggle to write clear, coherent, and gram-
matically correct prose. That temporary solution in the 1880s was
English A, a freshman composition course that instantly became a
model for other institutions across the country.

     The courses envisioned as temporary have since become a
staple of American higher education. The reasons for the course's
lasting power are complex, but literacy crises are the primary drive
behind the stabilization of first-year writing and the growth of writ-
ing instruction throughout undergraduate and graduate education.
The academic field of writing studies owes its growth throughout
the 20th century to public distress that literacy is failing.

     Blame for the collapse of literacy shifts from high-school teach-
ers to technology, television, Internet, smart phones, laptops, and
tablets--the same technology we often hope will rescue us from
illiteracy--to a lack of adequate funding for teacher education and
the institutions that provide literacy instruction. Since education
has become more readily available to people of color and the lower
middle and working classes, the demand for literacy instruction
has increased. Basic writing, a term coined by Mina Shaughnessy
through her work with community college students in New York
City in the 1970s, provided students with more time and instruc-
tion in reading and writing to prepare populations for college who,
only decades earlier, would never have had the opportunity to

attend college. Writing instruction as a means of improving the
literacy of the diverse people living and working in the United
States is a worthwhile endeavor.

    When framed as a response to the literacy crisis, writing instruc-
tion cannot help but carry a connotation of a desperate response to
an epidemic. One of the chief beliefs associated with the myth of
the literacy crisis is that writing instruction is basically a curricu-
lar Band-Aid, an inoculation against illiteracy that will soon go the
way of smallpox and polio vaccines. Yet, well over a century after
its origination, composition remains a vital part of higher educa-
tion, not just surviving but flourishing as writing instructors have
developed new approaches to writing instruction in light of the
ever-shifting literacy needs of the American populace.

    The field of writing studies has developed many excellent strat-
egies for teaching composition that encourage students to reflect
on their own writing processes, to interact with other readers and
writers, and to produce complex texts in media beyond alphabetic
writing. However, scholars have also repeatedly asserted that a
single course or two cannot fix student writing. Since the 1970s,
scholars such as Peter Elbow, Donald Murray, James Britton, and
Mina Shaughnessy have shown that writing is not a skill people
simply gain and attain. In recent years, scholars such as Kathleen
Blake Yancey, Anis Bawarshi, Mary Jo Reiff, and Elizabeth Wardle
have argued that writing teachers must face the challenge of trans-
fer, the idea that students often fail to transfer knowledge from
one class or field to another, if first-year writing is to succeed in its
mission of improving student literacy.

    However, no single course or course sequence could solve our
nation's literacy woes, especially as the concept of literacy becomes
more complex. Culture now maintains a higher standard for infor-
mation literacy and digital literacy in addition to the expectation
that students read and write well. Colleges and universities have
built many different initiatives to continue the work of teaching
students to write well by building writing centers to offer student
writers individualized attention and by providing writing across
the curriculum programs to teach professors in other disciplines to
use writing as a means of helping students learn.

    So when the next version of Newsweek's "Why Johnny Can't
Write" emerges and ignites public fears of illiteracy, the public will
be looking for answers. It is so easy to blame K-12 schools for the
demise of literacy as we know it. Federal and state governments
introduce new initiatives to fight against that perceived demise,
16 Bad Ideas

whether those initiatives come in the form of No Child Left Behind
or the Common Core or whatever the next solution to all of educa-
tion's problems ends up being.

     It's also easy to blame colleges for not meeting the literacy
needs of the populace. Ironically, many state-supported univer-
sities are no longer able to offer remedial courses for students
who may need some additional help to succeed in college, in part
because state legislatures, ready to trim university budgets, do not
want to pay for courses that may limit a student's ability to finish
a bachelor's degree in four years. So the courses that have often
helped students prepare for the rigor of academic writing and the
sophistication of writing informed by knowledge of rhetorical prin-
ciples are actually being cut even as the public continues to declare
that literacy is in decline.

     Rather than thinking of writing instruction as a form of triage,
inoculation, or clinical diagnostic generated to protect the middle
class from the ravages of illiteracy, we benefit from thinking of
writing instruction as a means of helping students improve their
abilities to engage in public discourse in all its varied forms. What
writing teachers have known for generations is that writing is not
an end in itself--it is a method of invention that gives shape to our
view of the world and empowers us to engage in discourse with our
fellow humans. There are few things more important than that.

     There is no literacy crisis. Instead, the concept of literacy contin-
ues to become more complex as we expect people to know how
to produce and understand texts in multiple forms, whether writ-
ten, visual, or otherwise. Like all human institutions, education is
inherently flawed, and teachers, students, parents and others must
always consider ways and initiatives to improve literacy education.

18 Bad Ideas

FIRST-YEAR COMPOSITION
PREPARES STUDENTS FOR
ACADEMIC WRITING

    Tyler Branson

     I have a memory that really sticks out in my mind when I think
of all the bad ideas about writing. I was at the dentist making small
talk, and my dentist asked, "So what is it you teach at the univer-
sity?" Squinting at the bright light above me, I responded, "I teach
mostly first-year writing." "Uh oh!" he chuckled, looking back
at the dental assistants behind him. "Better watch my grammar
around you, huh?" He paused and said, thoughtfully, "You know,
I should send my son to you. He can't spell to save his life!" To
be fair, these sorts of comments are made innocently enough and,
anecdotally, they tend to happen a lot. The reason for this, I think,
is because of a particularly bad idea about writing and writing
instruction, one that surprisingly hasn't let up in the past 40 years:
that first-year writing is a basic course in language, grammar, and
syntax that prepares students for something called academic writ-
ing in the more "legitimate" courses in the university; and that its
teachers consist primarily of error-correctors and behavior-modifi-
ers armed with red pens and elbow patches. However, such an anti-
quated view of what first-year writing is and can be only scratches
the surface of the kinds of learning possible in a writing classroom.

     My dentist understands first-year writing as remedial instruc-
tion in language, but this is an outdated description for this univer-
sal course in U.S. higher education. You can actually trace this back
to the 1800s, when more and more men and women started attend-
ing college. At the time, first-year writing instructors decided that
the best way to provide this new influx of middle-class profession-
als with the tools to succeed in written communication was to focus
on correctness and efficiency. Writing instruction back then taught
                                                        About What Good Writing Is 19

that good writing was correct writing, and that you can measure
good writing by counting errors.

    However, people in the field of composition have come to learn
a lot about how writing works and how it is best taught in courses
like first-year writing. As Seth Kahn has shown in this collection,
researchers have known since the 1970s that teaching grammar
and mechanics does not improve student writing. Andrea Lunsford
and Karen Lunsford even recreated a famous study of errors in
Freshman Composition essays and found that "the rate of student
error is not increasing precipitously but, in fact, has stayed stable
for nearly 100 years." What they mean is that errors in writing are
a fact of life. As writing teachers, the idea that errors are a fact of
life has been quite helpful because it has allowed them to prioritize
higher order issues in writing like argument, analysis, audience, purpose,
and context. By having students focus more on argument and audi-
ence in their writing, the five-paragraph essay template becomes
increasingly irrelevant because it doesn't resemble anything about
how writing looks in the real world or what different audiences
expect in different reading contexts. Writing isn't a set of formulas
that you plug in to get different kinds of texts. Writing is a process
of brainstorming, composing, revising, having your work read by
others, and then revising again. This is a complex, in-depth process
that goes way beyond correctness.

    Yet, when first-year writing comes up in popular culture (or
the dentist's office), people still recall the image of the red pen. In
1975, Merrill Sheils wrote in a Newsweek article, "Why Johnny Can't
Write," lamenting students' "inadequate grounding in the basics
of syntax, structure and style" and blamed it all on the "politi-
cal activism" among English professors. This tradition of bashing
what's being taught in first-year writing continues to this day, from
bombastic authors like Stanley Fish who publish New York Times
editorials lamenting how college graduates of today are "unable to
write a clear and coherent English sentence," or popular books on
higher education like Richard Arum and Josipa Roska's Academically
Adrift, which claims that college graduates are vastly deficient in
writing. They report that 80 percent of first-year college students
and 50 percent of college seniors have never written a paper longer
than 20 pages. For many educated, well-meaning folks interested in
higher education, these popular portrayals of writing in the univer-
sity only reinforce the idea that first-year writing is a course that
trains students to churn out 20-page academic essays, or worse,
that these are examples of intellectual rigor in first-year writing.
20 Bad Ideas

     It's also important to note that a lot of folks have a vested inter-
est in keeping first-year writing courses tied to correctness and
grammar. When writing instructors attempt to do otherwise, they
are often met with opposition and charges of attempting to indoc-
trinate their students and politicize the classroom. Conservative
website Minding the Campus describes this as little writing, but
plenty of activism. When it appears that American students aren't
writing well, it's easy to point to first-year writing and ask, well
what are they teaching in there? In fact, first-year writing teachers
are often scapegoats for political debates that extend beyond the
writing classroom. So it is important to note that there are politi-
cal dimensions to the debate about what first-year writing should
teach, and ramifications for wanting to push the boundaries.

     To be clear, though, I'm not saying that academic writing and
correct writing are bad. On the contrary, courses in rhetoric and
composition can be very helpful in allowing students to practice
academic-level reading and writing in other disciplines, and this
often helps students better understand the various kinds of writ-
ing they are bound to encounter in the university. And even in
professional writing courses, it's important to teach students that
making errors in your writing is often a way to turn off your audi-
ence, or worse, it impedes your audience's ability to understand
what it is you're trying to say. However, the idea that first-year
writing exists to train students to write correctly does everyone a
disservice. It obscures all the other opportunities for learning in
first-year writing that go way beyond the production of essays that
are academic in nature.

     For one, academic writing is context-dependent. As Elizabeth
Wardle writes in this collection, "There is no such thing as writing
in general. Writing is always in particular." The expectations in,
say, Introduction to Sociology may differ wildly from what another
instructor expects in Introduction to Film. Also, while first-year
writing can teach students basic skills in conducting research or
structuring arguments, it is quite limiting to say that these skills
are only specific to academic writing in general.

     In fact, we might be better off thinking of first-year writing
as a course in the practice of citizenship than a course in writing
academically. I would argue that society needs students skilled in
civic discourse now more than ever. One only has to look to the
so-called exemplars of civic discourse--our politicians and other
public figures--as evidence. Talking heads on cable news showcase
                                                        About What Good Writing Is 21

a malignant style of uncivil, boorish argumentation in which
pundits unabashedly bend, distort, or even make up facts to advance
their positions. And while this may make for good television (for
some), it promotes a pernicious argumentative style that teaches
students that winning a debate is more important than exploring
their biases, increasing their empathy, and accepting differences.
That is why it might be better to imagine first-year writing not as a
remedial course in academic writing, but as a productive space for
respectful argument. In fact, by having students practice making
claims and offering counterarguments in a range of contexts, first-
year writing works like no other course to promote empathy, ethics,
and compassion in public discourse. First-year writing isn't just
about preparing students for academic writing. It's about modeling
and practicing writing as an act of citizenship.

    First-year writing also works like no other course to push
students to explore the possibilities of language, to work with new
and uncomfortable ideas and genres, and to analyze important
issues and how they are argued in the public sphere. Part of this
means getting students to develop better methods of writing and
reading in digital environments, which involves discerning what
philosopher Harry Frankfurt has called bullshit. A recent survey
found that 84% of American students indicated they would bene-
fit from learning whether or not certain online sources are trust-
worthy. Another study reported that around 82% of middle-school-
ers were unable to determine what was sponsored content and what
was a real news story on a website. And being able to sift through
the bullshit to find reliable sources, meaningful arguments, and a
deeper intellectual exchange in public deliberation is a literacy skill
developed specifically in first-year writing.

    Getting smarter about the purpose of first-year writing means
vanquishing one of the worst ideas about writing: that it consists
of mechanical, prescribed, product-centered, decontextualized
instruction in language. At its worst, first-year writing teaches
students that good writing is correct writing, that the course
is merely a hurdle, and that its content is mostly basic instruc-
tion without much depth or substance. At its highest potential,
though, first-year writing gets at the political and cultural contexts
of language use; it asks students to consider how those contexts
work to inform their own positions on important public issues;
and it pushes students to think about how they can ethically and
persuasively position themselves in ongoing public conversations.

see Sharon Crowley's Composition in the University (University of

FIRST-YEAR COMPOSITION SHOULD
BE SKIPPED

    Paul G. Cook

     Whenever my dean cajoles me into attending our monthly
8:00am recruitment events for high school students, parents often
ask me, "So, what does s/he [here they will nod in the general
direction of their student] need to do to `skip' freshman comp?"

     I get it. These are anxious and expensive times. And if a college
degree is just another product, as many believe, then it's damn
near one's duty as an American to scrutinize every facet of the
investment and save valuable credit hours whenever possible. But
as the director of a writing program, I know the positive impact a
well-crafted freshman composition course can have on a first-year
student's college career, and it bugs me that first-year composition
(FYC) gets lumped in as just another add-on to an already pricey
purchase.

     State legislators and policymakers, in their efforts to make
higher education faster and more flexible, are busy touting MOOCs
(massive open online courses) and dual-enrollment programs that
allow students to take FYC in high school as an alternative to
the traditional two-semester, two-course sequence. Most institu-
tions offer incoming students a way to skip or test out of FYC if
they perform well enough on a placement exam. These exams are
usually timed, superficial in their assumptions about writing, and
not considered an accurate measure of students' writing abilities,
according to a great deal of research that examines how we assess
the effectiveness or success of student writing.

     Rather than indulging anxieties about having to take FYC, I try
to explain to parents and students how useful the course can be for
all incoming college students, regardless of majors or career plans.
But I'm fighting a tough battle at this point. Everyone has heard of
                                                        About What Good Writing Is 25

that kid down the street who skipped freshmen comp, or took it
in high school or online, or tested out, or something else. So natu-
rally, you have this seductive idea floating around that by avoiding
FYC, one is somehow beating the house.

    Second, writing is a curious and ancient technology. Our famil-
iarity with writing and with the many important tasks it performs--
from texting to Twitter--leads people to assume that writing is a
basic skill they've already learned if not mastered. Most of us don't
have the same misplaced confidence when it comes to college alge-
bra. Then there's the simple fact that a four-year college degree
is just too expensive. A degree of some kind is now essential for
most upwardly mobile Americans. According to Bloomberg Business,
tuition has pole-vaulted some 1,225% since the 1970s, a rate that
has vastly outpaced other essential costs like food and even health-
care. Given the high cost of a four-year degree, it makes sense that
parents and students--nearly 70% of whom will pay for school by
taking out some sort of student loan--are looking for any opportu-
nity to save a few bucks. All of this is to say that even though it may
be a tempting one, for the majority of incoming college students,
skipping FYC is a bad idea.

    Here's why that idea needs to die: Writing and language are
like screens between humans and what we (can) know about the
world around us. Even that which we perceive as cold, hard facts
are ultimately filtered through the words and symbols we use to
make sense of...well, everything. Thus, the process of learning to
write is a matter of broader intellectual development and surviv-
al-gear-for-living. Writing, in other words, embraces much more
than relaying a preset message to a reader. As students learn how
to approach the written word--how to read it, yes, but also how to
read the many voices, ideas, moods, circumstances, and rhythms
that influenced and shaped the words on the page--they begin
to understand how language is an essential tool for learning and
exploration. FYC is uniquely qualified to provide this experience
for several reasons.

    Students in FYC, whether in face-to-face (f2f) or online sections,
benefit from the interactions they have with other writers, texts,
and their teachers. College writing teachers consider it an article
of faith and a hard-won point of research that texts, meaning, and
knowledge are created through the complex social intersections
that occur among humans. In other words, meaning does not exist
outside of texts and language; even the words and symbols we use
to express meaning--like the ones you're reading now--only mean
26 Bad Ideas

(or signify) by virtue of their difference from other words on the
page and from the virtual universe of words that might have been
chosen but weren't. Meaning, many in rhetoric and composition
believe, is an effect of language, a by-product, so to speak, rather
than something that exists before or somehow outside of language
and what we call the rhetorical situation: reader, writer, purpose,
medium, genre, and context.

     According to reams of scholarship, rhetorical training is critical
to students' growing awareness of their readers (audience), their
ability to read situations (context, genre/medium, and purpose),
and their developing identities as social and political beings (writ-
ers). In practical terms, possessing this capacity to do things with
words means that a student can transfer the skills they've devel-
oped for one scenario--say, responding to an argument using
evidence or even questioning the assumptions behind the argu-
ment itself--to other rhetorical situations and courses that require
similar skills. Researchers who study this phenomenon, such as
Linda S. Bergmann and Janet Zepernick, call this concept transfer,
for obvious reasons.

     This awareness of the essential social-ness of language is height-
ened through the training FYC students receive in the persuasive
and purposeful uses of language. FYC is typically a student's first
encounter with the ancient human practice known as rhetoric, the
original being-together-through-language art of how to be persua-
sive using words, symbols, and gestures. From the Greeks onward,
rhetoric has been central to human affairs. Indeed, until the 19th
century, rhetoric dominated formal education in Europe and the
United States; now, it's found mainly in graduate programs in rhet-
oric and composition studies, speech communication, and in FYC.

     Students in FYC also receive one-on-one coaching that they are
not likely to get in other classes. FYC is often one of the few courses
that a student can count on to be small--almost always 25 students
or fewer--compared to the massive lecture halls or online courses
that characterize one's early college years, especially at larger
universities. FYC teachers get to know their students by name,
lead discussions, coach students on writing-projects-in-progress,
and provide crucial support both in the classroom and in one-on-
one conferences. Together, students evaluate texts and explore the
many facets of meaning and meaning-making. Crucially, they are
provided adequate time and space to do so. For these reasons and
more, research shows that FYC encourages student engagement
and helps retain students during and after their first year.

    FYC provides a space in the all-important first year for students
to nurture the habits necessary for effective writing, research, and
inquiry into complex problems and questions. Data from large-
scale research studies such as the Stanford Study of Writing and the
National Survey of Student Engagement (NSSE) indicate that the
ways of writing students practice in FYC--analyzing, synthesizing,
integrating contradictory ideas from multiple sources--promote
deep learning, which enables students to integrate what they are
learning with what they already know. As we've discussed, writing
is closely connected to exploration, to putting down on paper and
seeing the limits of what we know. Writing in FYC allows students
to expand those limits by relentlessly pushing back against the
stubborn boundaries between the known and the new.

    Students can--and often do--use their FYC experience to
engage theretofore untapped interests and passions, thus unlocking
possibilities for futures they perhaps were not even aware existed.
FYC allows students to break out of their educational molds. They
can (and sometimes do) fail the course altogether. And this, too,
can be a good thing.

     Several forces conspire against the continued success of FYC:
decades of waning funding for higher education, bad ideas about
writing and how it works, and unethically sourced, flexible labor.
Recently, it has become something of an academic bloodsport
to poke at FYC's relevance and what it can do. But FYC courses
succeed in jogging first-year students out of their comfort zones
and into the complex, messy realm of texts, meaning, intent, revi-
sion (literally "to see again"), and ultimately otherness. As John
Duffy writes, "To make a claim in an argument is to propose a rela-
tionship between others and ourselves." When students seriously
consider ideas, values, and opinions that they themselves do not
share, they learn how to, as Duffy puts it, "sacrifice the consola-
tions of certainty and expose themselves to the doubts and contra-
dictions that adhere to every worthwhile question." Even with its
primary focus on writing effectively and learning how to enter an
ongoing conversation, somewhat ironically, FYC's greatest gift to
students may be that it teaches them how to listen.

Perspectives (State University of New York Press) is terrific on the
tangled political and curricular histories that continue to bind FYC
to English departments at most U.S. institutions. James Slevin's
edited collection Introducing English: Essays in the Intellectual Work of
Composition (University of Pittsburgh Press) is an excellent over-
view of the disciplinary politics of composition and FYC (see espe-
cially Chapter 2).

     Considered by many in the field to be one of the more tren-
chant and politicized statements on the university-as-social-insti-
tution to appear in the last decade, Marc Bousquet's 2008 book
How the University Works: Higher Education and the Low-Wage Nation
(New York University Press) takes on such sacred cows as student
employment, WPA "bosses," and FYC's complicity in the adjuncti-
fication of higher ed (see especially Chapter 5). But if you read one
book in the course of your life about the university-as-idea and its
role in contemporary Western societies, the late Bill Readings's The
University in Ruins (Harvard University Press) is hands-down the
one you should read.

     Sharon Crowley and Debra Hawhee's Ancient Rhetorics for
Contemporary Students (Pearson) is a hybrid rhetoric textbook/histo-
ry-of-rhetoric tome that's been around for about as long as the
Gutenberg Bible (not really, obviously), and it contains everything
from artfully written histories of rhetorical theory to end-of-chapter
exercises, some of which date back to the ancient Greeks (really!).
For a much shorter, article-length articulation of how classical
rhetorical principles can be adapted for today's undergraduates,
David Fleming's "Rhetoric as a Course of Study" (College English)
offers a curricular blueprint that is useful for implementing some
of the ideas explored in this short chapter.

YOU CAN LEARN TO WRITE
IN GENERAL

    Elizabeth Wardle

     There is no such thing as writing in general. Do you doubt
this claim? Test it out. Go to your desk right now and attempt
to write something in general. Do not write for any specific audi-
ence, purpose, or context. Do not use any conventions that you've
learned for school, work, creative writing, and so on. Just write in
general.

     You can't do it, because it can't be done. There is no such thing
as writing in general. Writing is always in particular.

     It's not just common sense that tells us that learning to write in
general is not possible. Many studies of writing have been done--
in workplaces, in classes across the college landscape, and in social
and civic settings. They tell us that every new situation, audience,
and purpose requires writers to learn to do and understand new
possibilities and constraints for their writing. Writing fan fiction in
Wattpad requires understanding what other fans expect, what fan
fiction writers and readers think good fan fiction is, and what the
technological medium supports and allows. The same is true for
any other kind of writing--we write in our journals and think of
our future selves or anyone who might find the journal. We write
as biologists for other specialists who understand previous find-
ings and value the ideas of some biologists more than others. As
students write across their general education courses, they find
themselves repeatedly asked to write essays or research papers, but
often learn the hard way that their history teacher, poetry teacher,
and philosophy teacher all mean and expect very different things
by "essay" or "research paper." This is because context, audience,
purpose, medium, history, and values of the community all impact
what writing is and needs to be in each situation.
                                                        About What Good Writing Is 31

    There is no writing in general, and thus no single class or work-
shop or experience can teach people to write. once and for all. But
people want to believe that it's possible to write in general because
this belief makes writing seem less difficult and allows them to
believe that writers can get a one-time writing inoculation that
will extend across all settings. If this is the case, then non-English
teachers and employers are off the hook; they don't have to help
students learn to write in their classrooms or workplaces, they can
just criticize writers for not being able to meet their expectations--
and criticize English teachers for not doing their jobs.

    The idea that we can all learn to "write in general" is not just
a harmless myth. It's a dangerous idea that needs to die because it
hurts students and frustrates teachers and employers. And writers
who believe it are easily discouraged because they don't know how
to learn what they need to learn in new writing situations.

    A better conception of writing is one in which we all remem-
ber (realistically) our own experiences learning to write in differ-
ent situations, and then apply that memory to our expectations
of what we and others are capable of achieving. A better notion
of how writing works is one that recognizes that after learning
scribal skills (letters, basic grammatical constructions), everything
a writer does is impacted by the situation in which she is writing.
And thus she is going to have to learn again in each new situa-
tion. Yes, she can apply and repurpose some of what she already
knows how to do, but she will have to learn new things and not
expect that what she already knows about writing is easily appli-
cable in new situations. This means that when an employer hires
a student fresh out of college and asks her to write a report for the
CEO, he might expect that she knows what a report is in general,
but he needs to remember that she's never seen a report at this
company (she needs some examples), does not know the CEO and
his idiosyncrasies (she needs some insider info), and does not yet
understand what people in this setting consider important (she
needs a heads-up on that). Similarly, parents should expect that
their child might struggle when writing in a new class, or when
moving from high school to college because learning takes time
and requires being immersed in the context. Journalists and crit-
ics need to remember that texting employs certain conventions
that are appropriate for their medium and purpose--and those are
not destroying writing in general, because there is no writing in
general. All of us, then, should give ourselves time to anticipate
new writing situations, look at examples, find out what people's
32 Bad Ideas

values and expectations are in them, and give ourselves time to
practice and learn what we need to know in order to write success-
fully in that new situation.

     If we can remember that there is no writing in general and
no magic formula that will help us write well in all situations, we
are more likely to be able to use (or transfer or repurpose) what
we know effectively from prior writing situations. This is because
we will be aware of the new context, on the lookout for exam-
ples, and willing to accept that struggle and practice are simply a
part of learning to write in a new situation. Too frequently, writ-
ers attempt to rigidly use what has worked for them in other situ-
ations, only to find out the hard way that such rigid re-use is not
appropriate in the new setting. These ideas--that there is no writ-
ing in general, that writers always have more to learn, that failing
or struggling are a normal part of writing--are some of the many
threshold concepts of the discipline of writing studies. In other
words, they are things researchers have learned, and things that
will help writers be more effective, if only they can accept them in
place of the common cultural assumptions about writing that are
not always accurate.

     There is no writing inoculation, because there is no such thing
as writing in general. But this isn't bad news. Rather, it gives all
writers permission to keep learning, to fail, and to engage in new
kinds of writing in new situations.

WRITING KNOWLEDGE TRANSFERS
EASILY

    Ellen C. Carillo

     It may not be an exaggeration to say that the very notion of writ-
ing instruction is based on a myth. Writing courses, like courses
in many--maybe all--fields, are arranged in what we would call
a vertical curriculum with students enrolling first in introductory
courses like freshman English. This course may be followed by a
research-writing or similarly advanced writing course and then,
perhaps, by a more intense writing course that often serves as a
capstone seminar in the student's major. Certainly, there are vari-
ations of this model, but the structure is largely consistent across
American post-secondary institutions in that students are expected
to take introductory writing courses before taking more advanced
ones. The reason curricula are designed in this way is so that
students apply what they learn in those introductory courses to
the more advanced courses that follow. This sounds like common
sense, no? Yet, it is a myth that students will automatically apply--
or transfer (the term most often used in educational psychology
and composition studies) what they learn in their lower-level writ-
ing courses to their upper-level ones. They simply won't.

     Anecdotally, writing instructors see this all the time: students
entering a second-semester writing course as if they had no previous
college-level writing course (let alone one linked to that second-se-
mester course), or students struggling with the writing component
of their senior seminars despite their taking the required intro-
ductory writing courses and writing-intensive course(s) in their
majors. Any number of variables might account for the experiences
these anecdotes describe, but research corroborates that students
don't automatically transfer what they have learned about writing
from one class into the next. The key word here is "automatically."
Transfer is not impossible, but it shouldn't be taken for granted. It
                                                        About What Good Writing Is 35

is a bad idea for writing programs and instructors to simply rely on
curricula design to do their work for them--students will continue
to be unprepared for their next writing course, let alone a course
where writing is only one of the components.

    Before describing the research that indicates why writing
programs and instructors should not assume that knowledge
transfer will automatically occur, it is perhaps wise to define the
term transfer and offer some of its history. Transfer is a concept that
has been studied for years by educational and cognitive psycholo-
gists, only recently becoming an interest of those in composition
studies who teach and research writing development. Educational
psychologists Gavriel Salomon and David Perkins define trans-
fer as "instances in which learning in one context or with one set
of materials impacts on performance in another context or with
other related materials." Research on transfer dates to the turn of
the 20th century. Educational psychologists Edward Thorndike and
Robert Woodworth conducted the earliest experiments in 1901.
They found transfer to be rare and only successful when there were
identical elements in the situations or contexts. Less than a decade
later, educational psychologist Charles Judd challenged these find-
ings and showed that if the learner was capable of understanding
the abstract principle informing the problem or idea, she would be
able to apply it in a different context even if all the same elements
were not present. Judd showed that transfer was, in fact, possi-
ble in situations that were not characterized by identical elements
and that the learner herself was an important component in the
process.

    While Judd showed that transfer was possible, he did not
prove that it was automatic; it is the automaticity of transfer that
is too often assumed in the teaching of writing. There is simply
no basis for that assumption. Writing professors Anne Beaufort
and Elizabeth Wardle both found in their research that even when
students described their first-year writing courses as valuable, they
were largely unable to generalize its teachings and thus imagine
how that writing connected to other courses. For example, Wardle
explains that students "did not appear to make even near connec-
tions of those skills, much less transfer those skills to very different
contexts... no students suggested they were being asked to write a
persuasive paper to be able to write persuasively in other courses."

    Although Judd's experiments in 1908 indicated that transfer
was possible, it would take nearly a century for those who teach
and study writing to begin thinking about what to do about this.
36 Bad Ideas

In fact, it was less than a decade ago that these scholars regularly
began asking questions such as: If transfer is possible, are there
certain ways we can teach writing to promote transfer?

     The affirmative answer to this question is the antidote to this
bad idea. Curricula must be redesigned with the concept of trans-
fer in mind, and instructors must be trained to teach toward the
goal of transfer. No matter how one teaches for transfer, the one
consistent recommendation for doing so involves incorporating
metacognitive exercises into writing courses. Metacognition liter-
ally means thinking about thinking, so metacognitive exercises in
the classroom would ask students to think about what they are
thinking and learning. These exercises give students opportunities
to reflect on what they are learning about writing and--as such--
potentially position students to transfer what they are learning.
The same applies to everyone who suspects they will want to or
need to transfer something they are learning to a future context.
It would be useful to reflect on that learning and even anticipate
where else it might be useful for people to transfer that knowledge
to other situations since it will not automatically transfer.

     Most recently, Kathleen Yancey and her colleagues tested the
benefits of deliberately teaching for transfer. They found that
students in courses with instructors who taught for transfer did
transfer their writing skills and knowledge more regularly than
students who were in other types of writing courses. My sense
is that more studies that corroborate these findings are on their
way. If that's the case, and these studies are taken as seriously as
they should be, colleges and universities will see the emergence
of new curricula and teaching practices that no longer perpetuate
the myth of automatic transfer. The broader implications of stud-
ies on teaching for transfer are just as striking. By studying trans-
fer, all of us come to a better understanding about how we and
others learn in our everyday lives and what types of learning expe-
riences facilitate transfer not just in academic contexts but across
all the contexts we inhabit, including--but certainly not limited
to--school, home, and work.

READING AND WRITING ARE NOT
CONNECTED

    Ellen C. Carillo

     Since the 1950s we have been hearing that Johnny can't read.
In 1975, Newsweek informed us that Johnny can't write, either.
Over the years, a range of reasons for Johnny's illiteracy have
been offered. Most recently, technology has been named one of
the culprits. Johnny spends too much time on the computer and
not enough time reading books. He spends so much time texting
and tweeting that he has forgotten how to write correctly, how to
spell, how to develop ideas in more than 140 characters. Public
outcries about literacy (or lack thereof) often lead to a closer look
at the education system. The public raises questions surrounding
why colleges and universities in particular--where Johnny would
be expected to gain in-depth and comprehensive literacy skills--
are not doing a better job. What is often neglected in these public
debates about the best way to teach literacy at the college level is
that reading and writing are connected practices and, as such, the
best way to teach them is together. It is a bad idea to continue priv-
ileging writing at the expense of reading.

     This problematic separation of the connected practices of read-
ing and writing is no longer an issue in students' early school-
ing, where they are taught reading and writing simultaneously.
Although it took decades for elementary school teachers and curric-
ula developers to realize that young children need not learn how
to read before they learned how to write, language arts instruc-
tors now teach reading and writing alongside each other. They
do so because research has shown that students learn to read and
write better when they are instructed in both simultaneously. This
research, for example, shows that students' phonic skills are rein-
forced when children practice both reading and writing the same
                                                        About What Good Writing Is 39

words. As they get a little older, students begin to develop an aware-
ness of genres or types of text, which, like the study of phonics, is
also further reinforced by a concurrent focus on reading and writ-
ing. As students read (or are read to) they learn to recognize typical
elements of fiction, which they then imitate in their own writing
and stories. Even a two-year-old who has been read to consistently
will recognize that "once upon a time" indicates the beginning of a
story, and will often begin that same way when asked to make up
his or her own.

    By the time students arrive in college, stories beginning with
"once upon a time" are long gone, and in their place are difficult
and dense texts--often multimedia texts-- from a range of fields
each with its own set of conventions. Instead of drawing on models
of early literacy education that focus on teaching reading and writ-
ing simultaneously, college and universities largely privilege writ-
ing over reading. This hierarchy is evidenced by the universal first-
year writing requirement in American colleges and universities, as
well as by writing across the curriculum programs. The integrated
approach to teaching reading and writing falls away to students'
peril and causes great frustration in the professors who often attri-
bute students' struggles in their courses to poor writing ability,
when these problems are often related to students' reading diffi-
culties. While students' eyes may make their way over every word,
that does not mean that students have comprehended a text or that
they are prepared to successfully complete the writing tasks asso-
ciated with the reading, which often involve summary, analysis,
interpretation, and evaluation.

    More importantly, if students are not given the opportunity
to continue working on their reading throughout their college
careers, they may struggle analyzing, interpreting, and evaluat-
ing all that surrounds them since comprehension is a crucial step
toward these more advanced interpretive practices. Students may
lack the ability to read the world around them because they do not
have the tools to recognize the values and assumptions that inform
the images, advertisements, news stories, political campaigns, and
ideas with which they come into contact on a daily basis. By not
focusing on reading as an equally creative and active enterprise as
writing--very much writing's counterpart in the creation of mean-
ing--colleges and universities are potentially producing students,
or citizens, who think reading is passive. These students might
blindly accept whatever comes their way rather than actively engag-
ing ideas, asking questions, and seeking out multiple perspectives.
40 Bad Ideas

     Although writing is more often thought of as a creative act,
reading is just as creative. When one writes, one is creating mean-
ing by putting words and ideas together. When one reads, the
same thing is happening. Although someone else has already put
the words and ideas together, the reader interacts with those and
creates meaning by bringing her perspective, personal experi-
ences, and background to what literary scholar Louise Rosenblatt
has called the transaction between the text and reader. This is
why a few people might read the same novel but each take some-
thing different from it. That personal transaction with the text has
affected how each reader creates meaning. When reading and writ-
ing are taught alongside each other in the college-level classroom,
students can gain practice experiencing and relishing in opportuni-
ties to create meaning not just through writing, but through read-
ing everything from print texts to art to websites to national news
events, all of which they will continue to engage beyond school.
Focusing on active reading approaches, including everything from
comprehension strategies to ways of determining something's
inherent values and biases to productive methods of responding,
is crucial if students are going to leave postsecondary institutions
prepared to be informed, aware, and engaged citizens.

     Unfortunately, there is still a great deal of work to be done
since recent studies such as The Citation Project, a multi-institu-
tional, and empirical research project show that students' reading
abilities are largely underdeveloped. This research seeks to under-
stand how students read sources and use them in their writing.
With less than 10% of students using summary in their writing
(as opposed to paraphrasing, copying, and citing), scholar Rebecca
Moore Howard and her colleagues noted that their findings raise
questions about students' abilities to understand what they are
reading. Recent studies from Education Testing Services have
corroborated these findings as did findings from studies conducted
by ACT, Inc. and the Pew Charitable Trust, which found that close
to half of the college students in their samples did not meet mini-
mum benchmarks for literacy or lacked reading proficiency. These
deficiencies are major problems particularly in this digital age for,
as literacy scholar Donald Leu and his colleagues have pointed out,
foundational literacies such as reading and writing print text will
continue to play a crucial role--and maybe even a more essential
role--in this digital age because of the proliferation of information.

     Because there is so much at stake, educators and the public
must keep the connections between reading and writing in mind as
                                                        About What Good Writing Is 41

we continue to engage in debates about the best practices for teach-
ing literacy. The value of literacy undoubtedly extends far beyond
school. To read and to write is to create, to interpret. If education
is, in fact, a means to preparing citizens to function and participate
within a democracy then reading and writing--and the interpretive
skills they inculcate--are crucial. As research has shown, teaching
them alongside each other reinforces both skills.

    Even if we want to be a bit cynical and argue that postsecondary
education has become nothing more than a necessary, but burden-
some, step to gaining employment, both reading and writing are
still just as important. A 2011 survey found that 86% of corporate
recruiters said strong communication skills were a priority--well
ahead of the next skill. In a 2013 survey of 318 employers published
by the Association of American Colleges and Universities, 80% of
employers said colleges should focus more on written and oral
communication. In these and similar studies, communication is
defined by reading and writing abilities. Employers want to hire
people who can communicate effectively, and despite our culture's
recent celebration of all things STEM, many employers continue
to vocalize the importance of effective communication skills.
Teaching reading and writing together will help students become
more proficient in both.

    Developing those communication skills means that those of
us within education should look at the curricula we teach and/
or administer and ask ourselves if we have fallen into the trap of
compartmentalizing reading and writing to the detriment of our
students. If we have, we must ask ourselves: how might we better
integrate attention to both reading and writing in order to enrich
the literacy education we are providing? We must not assume that
simply exposing students to texts of all kinds and across all media
will automatically result in comprehension. Instructors must delib-
erately teach students how to actively read the words and images
and, by extension, the world around them. Instructors must do
so not only so students can succeed in their courses, but so that
students can be prepared to actively engage in the complex inter-
pretive work that is expected of citizens in an information-rich
culture.

    We are all encountering more text and visual images than ever
before. There is a great deal at stake if we don't take the opportu-
nity to teach active reading alongside writing. Instructors need
to teach students different strategies for reading the complex
texts they will encounter throughout their academic careers and
42 Bad Ideas

in the world. One of these strategies might be rhetorical reading
wherein readers pay particular attention to how a text is work-
ing on them, persuading them. A better understanding of this as a
reader can also support students' writing as they develop their own
arguments. Instructors might also provide a strategy such as read-
ing like a writer, wherein readers notice the choices a writer has
made and understands the relevance of those choices to their own
writing. Without explicit attention to reading and the relation-
ship between reading and writing, students will not have strategies
for making sense of new or difficult texts, arguments, images, and
ideas they encounter. Denying students the richness of an educa-
tion that considers reading and writing alongside each other means
denying them the opportunity to become as proficient as possible
in these connected practices and, therefore, experience and prac-
tice the interpretive work that is specifically human.

READING IS NOT ESSENTIAL
TO WRITING INSTRUCTION

    Julie Myatt Barger

     Writing teachers are fond of the adage "good readers are good
writers," but those same teachers frequently fail to assume respon-
sibility for teaching students how to read. This often manifests
itself in teaching only surface-level reading strategies in K-12 such
as skimming and reading for the gist, and in cries of, "They should
know this stuff before they get here!" at the university level. This
abdication of responsibility has far-reaching effects for students,
particularly those from underserved populations, leading them to
believe they are poor readers rather than people who have not been
taught to read deeply, thus potentially limiting their abilities to
compete in a market characterized by ever-changing and increas-
ingly competitive workplace literacies. This oversight is not mali-
cious in intent but rather is the product of four key issues:

     First, there exists an educational culture that privileges test-
ing over sustained and meaningful encounters with texts. No
Child Left Behind (NCLB) legislation resulted in widespread test-
ing that became a formidable obstacle to helping students develop
deep reading skills. As teachers understandably grew fearful about
losing their jobs because of low test scores, they devoted class time
to preparing students for the tests rather than developing prac-
tices that would have helped students improve as readers and writ-
ers. Standardized tests often rely on multiple-choice responses that
neither allow for complexity of thought nor invite students to draw
connections between the text under consideration and their own
experiences. In the era of NCLB, these tests typically required read-
ings of short, acontextual passages generated by the testing compa-
nies instead of existing publications that, when paired with the
right questions, could have allowed students to draw meaningful
                                                        About What Good Writing Is 45

connections between the larger cultural context and the choices
the author made in constructing the text. For example, an English
III (junior-level) practice test published by Pearson for the State
of Tennessee Department of Education in 2012 included 49 multi-
ple-choice questions asking students to identify correct punctua-
tion, combine or rearrange sentences, and determine the meaning
of specialized vocabulary. The practice test prompted students to
demonstrate reading proficiency by identifying the main idea of
a passage, evaluating forms of evidence, and assessing a source's
validity, but nowhere were students asked to demonstrate their
ability to "analyze texts to identify the author's attitudes, view-
points, and beliefs and to critique how these relate to the larger
historical, social, and cultural contexts of the texts," even though
this kind of rhetorical reading was, as evident on a teacher webpage,
identified as a course-level expectation in the Tennessee Language
Arts Standards. Students may not have had sufficient engagement
of this sort with text because the acontextual, ahistorical test-gen-
erated passages did not invite rhetorical reading.

    Second, there have been longstanding debates in the field
of composition studies about the purpose of first-year composi-
tion (FYC), the writing course required of almost all university
students, including what role reading should play in the teaching
of writing. Ellen C. Carillo explains in Securing a Place for Reading
in Composition that reading instruction hasn't been as prominent a
feature of the first-year writing classroom as it should have been
largely because of debates in the field about what kinds of readings
should be assigned. Probably the most famous debate surrounding
reading in the writing classroom (known as the Tate-Lindemann
debate) addressed the issue of whether or not literary texts are
appropriate for use in FYC. In this exchange, Gary Tate repre-
sented the position that FYC should exclude no texts, articulating
his commitment to preparing students for the conversations they
would have in their lives beyond the university and his concerns
that in its emphasis on academic discourse, FYC had become a
service course for other academic disciplines. Erika Lindemann
proposed that the purpose of FYC is to introduce students to
academic and professional discourse through a rhetorical approach
to writing, complete with instruction in genre, style, purpose,
and audience. Lindemann expressed concerns that using litera-
ture in the composition classroom relegated student writing to the
margins and reduced the academy to one genre--the essay--thus
failing to prepare students for future writing tasks. Both Carillo and
46 Bad Ideas

Sharon Crowley characterize this debate as a product of tensions
surrounding the uneasy relationship between FYC and literature.
Distancing the composition classroom from literature left reading
out in the cold, resulting in less attention to reading instruction
in the FYC classroom. Though many composition studies schol-
ars would contend that differentiating what happens in FYC from
what occurs in a literature course was a necessary step in the devel-
opment of our discipline, it appears that in the process of defining
ourselves, we lost sight of how very important reading instruction
is to the teaching of writing.

     Third, there is a lack of recent research on reading in the field
of composition studies and a gap in teacher training, particularly at
the university level. The majority of research on reading in the field
of composition was published over 20 years ago. As a result, those
teaching introductory writing classes are, as Linda Adler-Kassner
and Heidi Estrem note, seldom introduced to theories of teach-
ing reading, so they do not feel equipped to make explicit reading
instruction part of their teaching. Carillo calls this "a pedagogical
gap" in which "instructors lack the resources to develop reading
pedagogies that will complement their writing pedagogies."

     Finally, there have been unrealistic demands placed on FYC
instructors charged with preparing students to conduct research
and write in all disciplines. Many people, among them univer-
sity faculty outside of composition, tend to expect FYC--in the
course of just one or two semesters--to remake students into writ-
ers capable of conducting research and writing for their chosen
fields of study. Though scholars such as Elizabeth Wardle have
challenged the notion that FYC should prepare students for work
in their disciplines, arguing instead that the course should expose
students to theories of writing so they can understand how writ-
ing works, the course remains overburdened, with reading increas-
ingly neglected. This FYC-as-general-academic-literacy-inoculation
encourages students to view reading as just another requirement,
rather than as an opportunity for discovery and an important form
of knowledge making. Take, for example, the research paper, a
staple in this model of FYC. All too often, this assignment has
no audience other than the teacher, no purpose beyond earning
a grade, leaving students with little motivation to locate quality
sources and use them thoughtfully.

     Misconceptions about what writing is and debates about the
purpose of FYC distract from what should be writing teachers'
primary goal, what Kathleen Blake Yancey, Liane Robertson, and
                                                        About What Good Writing Is 47

Kara Taczak have in their book Writing Across Contexts character-
ized as teaching students to think like writers. An important part
of that is teaching students how to read like writers, as Mike Bunn
illustrates in "How to Read Like a Writer." Despite instructors'
recognition that reading and writing are interconnected, reading
instruction all too often receives short shrift in the writing class-
room, with instructors failing to offer explicit instruction in a vari-
ety of reading strategies, instead promoting content-based read-
ings that emphasize a text's meaning over attention to how it was
constructed. Worse yet, instructors may even supply the meaning
for students, many of whom expect their instructors to do just that.

    The emphasis on content-based readings that resemble literary
analysis is a product of instructors' own familiarity with literary
analysis, as those teaching writing are often former English majors
who tend to be more well-versed in literary critiques (in which the
emphasis is on what is written in a fictional text) than in rhetor-
ical analyses (in which the emphasis is on the choices the writer
made in attempting to achieve a particular purpose and how those
choices influence the ways various audiences respond to the text).

    Composition scholars readily agree that students need to be
taught how to write rather than merely be tasked with writing. High
school English language arts teacher and author Kelly Gallagher
argues that the same is true of reading: "If we simply assign read-
ing instead of teaching students how to read, we'll get poor read-
ing"--and, I would add, poor writing. So what exactly should read-
ing instruction involve? To demystify reading and support students
in learning to read like writers, writing teachers must:

      · Introduce students to the concept that reading, like writing,
         is a recursive process, meaning that the act of reading is not
         linear or straightforwardly sequential but instead demands
         that readers revisit various points in their reading multiple
         times throughout the process;

      · Acknowledge their reading difficulties and guide students
         in assessing their own reading struggles;

      · Share strategies and provide heuristics--or interactive tech-
         niques that promote discovery--that help students read
         actively, work through confusion, make inferences, and
         connect the text to their own experiences and ideas (see,
         for example, Mike Bunn's "How to Read Like a Writer");

      · Promote collaboration that gets students talking about their
         reading experiences and exposes them to others' questions,
         perspectives, and interpretations;
48 Bad Ideas

      · Assign a wide variety of texts students can use as models
         for their own writing;

      · Guide students in reading rhetorically (analyzing texts not
         for meaning as one would in a literature class but rather to
         determine how and why the texts were constructed as they
         were by asking what the context surrounding the writing is,
         who the intended audience is, what the author's purpose is,
         and what effect the author's choices have on the audience);

      · Invite students to ask questions of texts, both models and
         those they compose themselves, in order to consider what
         the author could have done differently, as well as how these
         changes could influence the reader's relationship to the
         text;

      · Create a mechanism for students to reflect on their reading
         experiences, consider how their reading benefits their writ-
         ing, and envision how the skills they are developing could
         be of use to them beyond the writing classroom.

     Of course, even explicit reading instruction in a writing-inten-
sive classroom will not benefit students fully if they are unable
to recognize how their reading can help them improve as writ-
ers. Explicit writing instruction that makes students aware of the
interconnected nature of reading and writing benefits students in
numerous ways:

      · It leads to increased investment where students are more
         likely to take responsibility for learning to read carefully and
         critically, thus gaining more from the learning experience.

      · It helps students understand how to use sources in mean-
         ingful, responsible ways because students spend time
         building a relationship between the secondary sources they
         are reading and the research-based writing they produce.

      · It helps students understand that writing is rarely formu-
         laic due to the range of texts with differing rhetorical situ-
         ations they might study in a reading-writing curriculum.

      · It gives students models to emulate in their own writing
         due to this breadth of reading materials.

      · It helps students draw from prior knowledge and transfer
         their skills in the future.

     Several of the benefits described above run parallel to the habits
of mind introduced in the Framework for Success in Postsecondary Writing,
developed by the Council of Writing Program Administrators, the
National Council of Teachers of English, and the National Writing
Project. These habits of mind include openness, engagement,
                                                        About What Good Writing Is 49

responsibility, flexibility, and metacognition, the latter of which is
defined as thinking about one's thinking. These ways of approach-
ing learning are important because the reality is that what occurs
in the writing classroom is merely the beginning; for students to
be successful in meeting the reading and writing demands of their
future lives and careers, they must claim ownership over their own
learning, be open to new possibilities, and be willing to adapt to
the new situations they encounter.

    By failing to give reading its due, we are blocking students'
access to avenues of inquiry that would support their growth as
readers, writers, and thinkers. In an era characterized by chang-
ing workplace literacies and the birth of new genres inspired by
Web 2.0 technologies (such as wikis, blogs, and social networking
sites), a flexible rhetorical education is more necessary than ever.
The goal informing writing instruction at all levels should be for
students to develop not only the skills that will serve them in the
academic realm but also the ability to ask the questions and culti-
vate the behaviors that will allow them to respond effectively to the
diverse composing contexts they will encounter in their future lives
and careers beyond the classroom. Parents, students, and policy-
makers should expect reading, specifically reading actively, collab-
oratively, rhetorically, and with an eye toward one's own writing, to
be a significant part of writing instruction at all levels.

evolving technologies and social practices, the teaching of read-

influenced writing instruction. They include Sharon Crowley,

of what researchers learned about how people write, how writing
functions, and how writing should be taught.

BAD IDEAS ABOUT
WHO GOOD WRITERS ARE
WRITERS ARE MYTHICAL, MAGICAL,
AND DAMAGED

    Teri Holbrook and Melanie Hundley

    In two recent conversations, we heard comments that show
the images of writers people carry in their heads. "Oh, you know
how writers are," said one guest to another over dinner. "They live
in a garret and observe the world from somewhere above the rest
of us." At a bookstore, a middle-school student stood among the
stacks of books and stated, "Authors aren't real people. They're
like fairies who wave their wands and stories get created." These
two views--author-in-garret and author-as-wand-waver--point to
an abiding notion about writers circulated in popular culture: They
are different from--and perhaps somewhat above--you and me.
In addition to being magical beings not of this world, they are also
fragile and incapable of dealing with the routines and stresses of
daily life, so they drink, do drugs, need help, and occasionally slip
into murderous madness. These traits make up four of the most
prevalent representations of writers in the media, and they present
a problem. After all, given these kinds of on-the-job hazards, who
would ever aspire to the writing life?

Popular Portrait #1: Writers Possess Magical Gifts

    This view of writers supports the idea that since writing is
magical, it isn't work. Writing just...happens. Journalists may
doggedly follow leads, but they pound out articles on deadline
with nary a misstep (or an editor). Authors, well dressed and care-
fully coiffed, appear on talk shows promoting work that is already
bound and jacketed. Absent is what Stephen King calls the grunt
work, which happens when authors wrestle with the page. King
himself plays on the portrait of writer as magical in his depiction
of Paul Sheldon, the main character in Misery. In the film version
54 Bad Ideas

of the book, James Caan serenely types "The End" on the last
page of his manuscript and adds it to the neat stack of papers on
his desk. Done--no fevered rewriting, no crossing out or starting
over. His writing is effortless and over in the first few minutes
of the film. The rest of the story is devoted to the extraordinary
power his words have over his biggest fan. Another common depic-
tion of writer as magical can be found in crime-solving novelists
such as Murder She Wrote's Jessica Fletcher, a gifted observer who
sees details the police miss. Fletcher and her ilk do not actively
write while on screen; their authoring labor is unseen, conducted
in spare time not dedicated to stopping crime. These depictions
perpetuate the idea that writing isn't just easy--it's magical work
done by super-exceptional people.

Popular Portrait #2: Writers Are Recluses

     The myth that writers are somehow magical and, therefore,
not part of this world leads to another perception of writers: They
either are not capable of handling the real world or they make the
clear decision to remove themselves from it. This myth is perpet-
uated by the well-circulated mystiques of such reclusive literary
figures as J.D. Salinger, Thomas Pynchon, and Harper Lee and is
part of the lore about writing perpetuated in elementary through
high-school English language arts classes. (A quick Google search
brings up numerous sites with listings and articles about famed
reclusive writers as well as novels and films directed at middle
grades and young adult readers, such as John Green's The Fault in
Our Stars and Gus Van Sant's Finding Forrester.) Several films have
traded on the notion of author-as-recluse. In the Jodie Foster vehi-
cle Nim's Island, based on Wendy Orr's children's book, a young
girl writes to the author of her favorite action stories expecting
that she will rescue her, only to discover that the author is agora-
phobic, germaphobic, and cannot deal with the world outside her
apartment. In As Good As It Gets, Jack Nicholson plays a writer who
tries to control his obsessive-compulsiveness by devising rules
for engaging with the outside world. If we broaden the portrait
of writer to include publishers--the people who create the larger
structures in which writers construct their works--then we can
consider Orson Welles's Citizen Kane, a film about a brilliant news-
paper publisher's life-long retreat into isolation. These films repre-
sent writers as damaged or fragile people whose magical gifts allow
them to share imaginative worlds with their readers even as they
restrict their participation in the real world around them.

Popular Portrait #3: Writers Abuse Alcohol and Other
    Substances

    As with the writer-as-recluse representation, the writer-as-alco-
holic trope is supported by real-life examples. Among famous writ-
ers who were alcoholics are Edgar Allan Poe, Ernest Hemingway,
and F. Scott Fitzgerald, to name just a few. Whether or not alcohol-
ism is an occupational hazard is much contested among authors.
Donald W. Goodwin has published some of the opposing views,
quoting Alistair Cooke's claim that alcohol "has no more connec-
tion with writing than with plumbing" and Michael Crichton's
observation of "how many people in `the arts'... are heavy drink-
ers, and for that matter how many do not drink at all, in that care-
ful, somewhat embarrassed manner which indicated a drinking
problem somewhere in the past." Goodwin presents a variety of
data that support the stance that writers have a higher rate of alco-
holism than the general population, and writers who create repre-
sentations of authors in popular culture often echo that percep-
tion. From Ray Milland's portrayal of an alcoholic writer in Billy
Wilder's movie The Lost Weekend to Paul Giamatti's rendition of
the wine-tasting struggling writer in Alexander Payne's movie,
Sideways, writers have been depicted as masking their anxieties and
fears with alcohol.

Popular Portrait #4: Writers (And Their Fans) Are Scary

    Ever since Mary Shelley penned her famous first novel, in which
Dr. Victor Frankenstein tells the story of his creation experiments
to an eager young writer-turned-ship's-captain, authors in fiction
have been associated with suspense and horror. One of the most
widely recognized and satirized examples of this representation is
Stephen King's Jack Torrance from The Shining. Snowbound in a
cavernous hotel with his wife and son, struggling author Torrance
slowly descends into madness, as revealed by his chilling and repet-
itive writings. The writer-as-madman trope is also used in Robert
Altman's film The Player, in which a studio executive is sent death
threats by a rejected screenwriter. In Joel and Ethan Coen's Barton
Fink, the main character is a writer who is not so much a madman
himself but is embroiled in a 1940s Hollywood that is macabre,
violent, and surreal. The associations between authors and horror
also extend to the depiction of fictional readers; in Misery, Stephen
King creates a story in which the outcome of a fan's devotion is
violence and murder. In these representations of authors (and
56 Bad Ideas

readers), writers inhabit frightening worlds where they are either
threatened or pose threats to those around them.

So Who Are Writers, Really, and Why Does it Matter?

     The four portraits discussed here are not the only iconic repre-
sentations of writers circulating in popular culture, but they are
among the most prevalent ones. And they present a problem. In
Inkheart, Cornelia Funke writes of a character that knew all kinds
of people who surrounded themselves with books but had never
actually met anyone who wrote books. There are two ways to read
this observation: that the character had never met an author, or
the portraits of authors she carried in her head did not match the
people around her who crafted narratives by putting words on
paper. We take up this second reading because it points to the diffi-
culty of accepting the iconic representations of writers popularized
in novels, films, and television: They often do not depict the major-
ity of working writers who live the day-in, day-out writing life, and
they misrepresent or too easily summarize what writing practices
entail.

     The view that writing is effortless and done on the side by
extraordinary people dismisses the real effort writers put into their
work, which has multiple ramifications. For starters, it makes the
hard work of writing invisible, discouraging young writers who
might dismiss their own labored efforts as evidence that they just
don't have what it takes. It also devalues the products of writing,
feeding into the idea that a writer's intellectual property is unim-
portant and the need to pay writers for their work is unnecessary.
If authors can lead the writing life in their spare time (when not
solving crimes, for example), then how valuable in terms of labor
can writing be? Also playing into this dynamic are the unseen
others--editors, spouses, agents, assistants--who handle much
of the mundane behind-the-scenes business of authoring while
the writers themselves appear free to lead tweed-blazered lives
penning stories in their studies. The invisibility of all that writing
support undercuts the levels of labor needed to produce a manu-
script ready for publication.

     The psychological portraits of writers popularized in media
also need to be more nuanced. There is no question that being a
writer is a complex occupation and how each writer embraces that
complexity depends on their own resources and outlooks; Olivia
Laing offers a haunting examination of that complexity in The Trip
                                                       About Who Good Writers Are 57

to Echo Spring: On Writers and Drinking, and Jane Piirto has analyzed
the work and words of women writers that show many suffer from
depression and substance abuse. But through interviews with
published authors, Catherine Wald examines how writers build
resilience--how they handle the occupational necessity of rejec-
tion, the uncertainties of publication, the responses of friends and
family. Writing can be tough work, but many writers have devel-
oped coping mechanisms and support networks aimed at making
themselves healthy in ways that do not include substance abuse or
agoraphobia.

    The notion of the lone author living reclusively in her apart-
ment (frequently brought into the sunlit world by a precocious
child or teenager) also belies the social nature of writing. While
writing does include concentrated time working alone, profes-
sional writing is never an individual endeavor. Perpetuating the
myth of the reclusive author hides not only the roles of all the
people who shape a book but also makes invisible the business
side of authoring. Social media has made the author's work of
self-promotion more evident, but the author as public figure is not
new. M. Thomas Inge noted that Truman Capote, who wrote at a
time when critics valued reclusive writers, took advantage of 20th
century media and his own conversational abilities to develop his
persona as a writer who was both literary, social, and media savvy.

    The belief that writing emerges, Athena-like, fully developed
from the writer's head minimizes both the labor involved and the
expectation that writing is a skill that can be improved. Popular
culture portrayals of authors are, by narrative necessity, centered
on the action in the author's life, and it is challenging to represent
the labor that goes into writing; hours typing on a computer may
not make for exciting storytelling. But the insidious invisibility of
the work of writing perpetuates myths that damage both current
and possible writers. The myth that writing is a magical process
that only certain people can undertake fosters the view of writers
as fragile beings incapable of handling the world in which they
live. Because the hard work of writing is not portrayed often in
popular media, young writers may not see writing as something
they can do or as work that is economically valued. Some authors
may embrace the myth and use it to their advantage, but they do so
aware that they are playing a game with public expectations. The
myth of the magical or monstrous writer is perpetuated.

Undoing the Myth: How Real People Live the Writing Life

     It's no easy task to undo the myths surrounding the writing
life; after all, they are so persistent because they hold threads of
truth (writing does require solitude; some writers do abuse drugs
and alcohol and are depressive). Plus, to be frank, they make for
good drama. But instead of mistaking these myths as glamorous,
desirable, or inevitable, it's important for aspiring authors to stave
off cultural portraits that are unhelpful so they can imagine other
kinds of writing lives for themselves. This is especially true in the
digital age when the notion of being a writer is more available
to a greater number of people. One possible move is to analyze
common themes circulating about writers and then strategize ways
to combat them. For example, fear of rejection is a common char-
acter trait in representations of writers, and talk of rejection is
common in books about writing. In tandem with fear of rejection,
however, is recognition that successful writers are resilient, and as
Jane Piirto points out, they learn to take rejection and criticism as
part of the life-long writing process.

     Another possible shift is to move from seeing writers as mythi-
cal and magical to seeing writers, like most of us, as working stiffs.
Author and creative writing instructor Kristine Kathryn Rusch
argues that the primary problem with writing as a profession is that
it isn't seen or taught as a profession. It's a pastime or a passion
but not a career. To develop as an author, writers are often advised
to workshop their manuscripts-in-progress, but these workshops
can be detrimental. Frequently, the focus of peer workshops is on
constant critique, leading authors into a trap of revising a single
piece until they give up. Instead, Rusch advises, writers should see
their work as part of a career where they improve through contin-
ued effort, ongoing practice, and frequent submissions, a self-for-
giving and practical stance that undercuts portraits of writers as
people obsessed about their personal failures and the imperfec-
tions of their work.

     Part of understanding writing as a profession or career--or even
an avocation that isn't destructive--is to recognize the unglamor-
ous day-to-day pace of writing. As author Anne Lamott points out,
writing will have its moments when it is exhilarating. It will also
have its moments when it is agonizing or flat dull. The key, she
stresses, is to sit down and write, even if the words are slow to
come and even if when they do come they aren't very good. This
is part of the writing life, and it isn't fantastical, magical, and fear-
some. It's the job.

YOU NEED MY CREDENTIALS
TO BE A WRITER

    Ronald Clark Brooks

     Recently, I launched a public writing project to help people free
themselves from writer's block, or to at least free themselves from
writer's block for long enough that they could get some part of their
own life stories written down. I particularly wanted to reach out to
people who normally would not think of themselves as writers.
Having considered most of the lessons of the process movement to
be commonplace, I didn't anticipate resistance to this project from
the people I would meet, but on our first trip out I encountered a
young man who very much considered himself a writer, and he told
me outright that he found the project offensive. "Not everyone can
write," he said, and as he did so, the small group of people who had
gathered around my booth started to disperse.

     What is it about writing that generates this attitude, often held
passionately, that some people are writers and others are not? Is
it the romantic ideal of innate genius? The belief that one has to
be initiated in a given way to join a special club called writers?
Is it something unique to the craft of writing and the anxieties it
provokes? I have never heard of a professional baseball player, for
example, telling a community baseball league that they should get
off the field or that they're a menace to the sport, but I have heard
professional writers complain about there being too many people
claiming to be writers. Is this an anxiety one sees from the prac-
titioners of all underappreciated arts? Regardless of the answer to
these questions, the idea that one has to be a credentialed writer
in order to write is definitely a bad idea about writing, one that is
pervasive in the general public and oftentimes fostered by writing
teachers themselves.

     When talking to the young man at my booth, I realized that as
a composition teacher, and especially as a trainer of teachers, I have
                                                       About Who Good Writers Are 61

encountered some version of the belief that one has to be creden-
tialed in order to call oneself a writer for most of my professional
life. Writing teachers should be credentialed (see Seth Kahn's
chapter), and in no way am I suggesting that these credentials are
not important, but the kind of credentials that one gets in order to
speak authoritatively about a field--whether that field is literature,
film, cultural studies, creative writing, linguistics, or even the often
now widely divergent fields of composition, rhetoric, and literacy
studies--those need to be set apart from the beliefs that one must
have in order to teach writing well.

    The most important belief that a writing teacher can have
about writing is, as Peter Elbow (a well-known teacher of writ-
ing) put it, that everyone can write. And at the heart of that belief
is the assumption that everyone's experience and perspective is
already worth writing about as soon they arrive in the classroom.
To expand that belief beyond the classroom, we should generally
believe that everyone's experience and perspective is already worth
writing about as soon as they arrive at the page or screen. If this
belief is essential for teachers of writing, it is even more so for the
writers themselves. At some level, when we sit down to write we
must believe it can be done, regardless of our previous experiences,
or nothing gets written. This is true for beginners, but it is equally
true for experienced writers because every new writing situation
brings on new challenges and, as many of us have discovered, one
often has to learn to write all over again with each new project.

    At the same time, believing that one already knows how to
write can be as much of a barrier to writing as believing that one
can't. Believing that everyone already knows how to write, however,
is very different than believing everyone can write. Believing that
everyone already knows how or should know how to write is a
different bad idea (see Elizabeth Wardle's chapter), and it is one
that often leads to the production of five paragraph themes and
disembodied, formulaic, general writing. Believing that everyone
can write is simply starting with the idea that even though writing
is complex, sometimes difficult, infinitely varied and variable, and
dependent on rhetorical context, everyone is able to start some-
where in the process, and only from that ground can one unlock
the potential to do it well.

    What is key, then, is to create a space where a writer can develop
a more positive, empowered approach to the actual complexity
that is writing. Peter Elbow began his career with the book Writing
Without Teachers, and it might be that this more optimistic ground
62 Bad Ideas

is more easily fostered outside the classroom, as the culture of
assessment that schooling creates constantly wants to reintroduce
the bad idea that you need credentials to be a writer. This is not
to say that classes can't hold on to the belief that everyone can
write, but these kinds of classrooms require vigilance in order to
reinforce optimistic attitudes about writing. Despite how difficult
it is to do so, maintaining this vigilance has proven to be effective.
In Ways of Thinking, Ways of Teaching, George Hillocks has shown us
that optimism is the one factor that continually makes a positive
difference in the outcomes of writing classes.

     If you find yourself in a writing course (or still remember a
writing course) that has not fostered a positive outlook toward
writing, it is entirely possible to create this environment yourself
by surrounding yourself with supportive writers. Supportive does
not mean they will tell you everything you write is great (that's
not what everyone can write means). Supportive means that they
will hold you accountable to getting writing done and to help you
continually improve your writing. That's the beauty of it being a
bad idea that you need credentials to be a writer. There is abso-
lutely nothing stopping you from getting started right now.

for ways of thinking about assessment based on this philosophy,
see Peter Elbow's book of the same title. For qualitative proof of
the effectiveness of optimism and the writing process, see George
Hillocks's Ways of Thinking, Ways of Teaching. Because most process
theorists share Elbow's optimism about everyone's potential to
perform, it is worth studying the works of Ken Macrorie, Sondra
Perl, Donald Murray, Wendy Bishop, and many others in order to
know the best ways to foster your own supportive writing commu-
nity. For even more specific information about how to create work-
shops beyond the confines of writing classrooms, see Pat Belanoff
and Elbow's Being a Writer: A Community of Writers Revisited. More
importantly, look for local writers' clubs and readings and commu-
nity groups in your area. One possible way to find these is to sign
up for and take part in National Novel Writing Month, Academic
Writing Month, and Digital Writing Month. Many have found
success by letting their writing communities develop from there.

ONLY GENIUSES CAN BE WRITERS

    Dustin Edwards and Enrique Paz

     Our American culture and education has cultivated quite the
romantic idea of authorship. Instruction in language arts and liter-
ature consistently and often forcefully exposes students to writ-
ers who have been canonized as The Greats: geniuses of thought,
master wordsmiths, and inspired creators--in a word, authors--
who transcended humanity and mortality. Shakespeare, Emerson,
Orwell, and so on--these were truly writers!--they say. These
writers sat at grand mahogany desks in remote cabins ensconced
in the most still and people-less of lakes and forests. These writers
sequestered themselves from all influence and feverishly scribed
brilliant works only their peerless minds could produce. But these
writers, great as they may be, have been the most damaging to our
current perceptions about writing.

     The image of this autonomous, genius, and origin-ary author
bears great consequences; it designates a coveted status against
which many, if not all, writers are compared. It is etched into intel-
lectual property debates, woven into anxieties and uncertainties
over plagiarism, and intricately bound to the economics of writ-
ing. Worst of all, it stubbornly refuses to die, despite persistent
attempts to overthrow its reign on literacy instruction and cultural
production.

The Weight of Genius
     As graduates of U.S. education, we've personally experienced

(and continue to experience) the damage this myth has wrought
on those who write. The genius writers were enlightened, wise,
and shrewd observers of the world and humanity. They wrote the
truth as only they could, and that fount flowed freely and easily.
But that's not how writing works for us. Writing is hard. So many
writing tasks we meet are impenetrable, fortified on every side with
                                                       About Who Good Writers Are 65

bulwarks tall and steel. We pound and press against those walls--
but nothing. Our work often stalls out, halted in place. We obvi-
ously cannot be true authors, right? This should be that easy. Why
doesn't it just come out? These unrealistic expectations cannot be
the only way to be an author.

    These genius authors misguide many writers. Their most
damaging effects are the unrealistic expectations they pose for
everyday writers. Writing scholar and plagiarism expert Rebecca
Moore Howard believes the notion of the solitary, genius author
has perpetuated a climate where novice writers fear being unorig-
inal and must strive to prove their own creativity and genius. You
need only glance at the branding language of the plagiarism detec-
tion service Turnitin, a self-proclaimed "originality-checker," to see
how this manifests in real-life scenarios. The demand for original-
ity frustrates many writers, who do not see how they could ever
have the genius to discover an original thought.

    Other writers, both within and outside of academic settings,
similarly struggle when they feel their writing process doesn't live
up to the lauded image of The Greats. In a short essay in The Irish
Times, author and musician Josh Ritter writes about how he wres-
tled with the image of genius authors. He never felt his songwrit-
ing counted as real writing, which can only happen upon grand
escritoires, penned with quill and ink and set in parchment. He
writes, "Never mind that for my entire writing life I'd been writ-
ing at my kitchen table, with my guitar on my knee and a pen and
notebook handy, if I wanted to be a real writer, I would need a desk.
[...] And without the desk, how could I write my novel?" Ritter
finds himself limited by the image of writing and writers that a
desk represents. Without a desk, Ritter can't imagine he has the
ability to produce a worthy piece of writing, just as many don't feel
like true writers if they struggle and strive when they write. But
Ritter comes to a conclusion we also share: remote cabins along
isolated lakes, grand writing tables carved from cedars, brilliant
manuscripts born in one candlelit sitting--these don't accurately
represent what writing looks like for anyone.

    Well-hidden between pristine white pages and well-crafted
words lies the same trying process many endure each time they
open a document or hold a pen as well as the same unyielding
barricades that keep them out, which often only give way when
they are influenced and inspired by others. Tales of genius writ-
ers who pour out perfectly structured prose all on their own
recount fables rather than reality. (See Teri Holbrook and Melanie
66 Bad Ideas

Hundley's chapter elsewhere in this book for more on bad myths
about writers.) Instead, these writers were certainly very much like
ourselves--nervous, frustrated, harried, and tired, looking for help
at 1:38 a.m. while trying to meet a deadline. What help we do
find rarely comes from genius, self-willed epiphanies. Instead, we
find solace, support, and success when we look outside ourselves,
borrow ideas, remix other texts, talk to others, and collaborate
with their thoughts. The Lone Genius author doesn't exist. And it
never did.

     Yet, such an understanding of authorship has become so
commonplace, so naturalized, that few ever interrogate its origins.
A closer look at this myth reveals that the author was forged only
recently in Western history. According to literary historian Martha
Woodmansee, the invention of the author in its current configura-
tion can be traced to 1st-century Europe. It was during this century,
according to Woodmansee's analysis, when a larger cultural shift
began to take place, and out of a swirl of change--technological,
legal, economic, and cultural--a new definition of the contempo-
rary author began to emerge. This is the author that largely sticks
today: the creator, owner, and proprietor of unique, original works
such as essays, books, poems, and so on.

The Invention of Genius

     Views of writing that lead to modern ideals about authors
developed along with the circulation of popular treatises on
originality. In 1759, for example, the influential writer and poet
Edward Young's "Conjectures on Original Composition" began
to draw deep divides between original and imitative authorship.
Originality, Young claimed, sprung forth naturally from an inher-
ent root of genius, like a plant bearing fruit. Imitations, on the
other hand, were artificial inferiors built from the work of others.
Young's essay, and many others like it, began to forcefully redirect
the locus of inspiration. They claimed that true authors are not
inspired by the outside world; they are inspired by their unique
selves. True authors are not imitators; they are originators. True
authors are not made; they are born.

     This redirection of inspiration also coincided with the birth of
a new class of writers: professional authors. Now, essayists, poets,
and other public intellectuals claimed an occupation where writ-
ing was their primary means for earning a living. Thanks in large
part to the expansion of a larger reading public due to advances in
                                                       About Who Good Writers Are 67

printing technology, a need grew to find ways for professional writ-
ers (and the publishing industry) to earn money from their printed
works. Enter copyright. Early copyright laws, according to histo-
rian Mark Rose's analysis of copyright, helped to form an under-
standing of the author as an owner and proprietor of his or her
individual ideas. In other words, copyright helped to define the
author as author: an autonomous individual whose original ideas
merit legal protection and deserve monetary rewards.

    There are many reasons why this understanding of the author
persists today. Tenets of originality, property, proprietorship, and
genius have become etched into the fabric of Western authorship.
Genius authorship is coded into our legal and economic systems
and is further upheld through years of education. Our understand-
ings of an author are also a product of the publishing industry
itself. Publishers present a polished and finalized copy of writing
and thereby dilute the messiness of the writing process. The idea
that authors derive their writing abilities from their natural intel-
lect is difficult to shake because it is inscribed in the very word
author itself.

    But such was not always the case. A deeper look at history,
together with today's digital writing practices, reveals how the
myth of the lone, original genius can be challenged. Specifically,
alternatives to genius see value in imitation, collaboration, and
remix. Authors don't act in isolation but rather find themselves
surrounded by other ideas, people, and writing.

The Alternative to Genius

    Before the idea of genius authorship took hold, Woodmansee
notes that authors were commonly depicted either as vehicles
(receiving ideas from some outside source) or craftsmen (forging
new materials out many disparate sources). An even deeper history
reveals a more esteemed regard for imitation. Practices of imita-
tion--drawing inspiration from outside sources by borrowing,
adapting, and altering models from a rich stockpile of sources--
were largely valued in ancient cultures. Imitation was how students
learned their craft, and it was viewed as a way to invent new mean-
ings out of existing materials. In fact, ancient philosophers and
poets often used the metaphor of a transformative bee to describe
the work of imitation. As Seneca described in the 4th century BCE,
"We should follow, men say, the example of the bees, who flit about
and cull the flowers that are suitable for producing honey, and then
68 Bad Ideas

arrange and assort in their cells all that they have brought in." This
metaphor suggests the act of producing a new work involves gath-
ering bits and pieces from many different external sources.

     These historical practices and ideas about authorship demon-
strate what writing once was and what we believe it still should be:
a collaborative endeavor in constant and deep conversation with
the works and ideas of others. In other words, instead of the reclu-
sive genius, we aim to be social writers. Instead of inspiration from
within, we seek influence from without. Writing requires talking
to friends, asking help from colleagues, finding answers and ideas
in others' writings, and indulging in those practices. We embrace
collaboration over isolation, and it is precisely this model of writing
that we argue education should promote to writers and students
everywhere.

     In a way, it's odd to call for more collaborative writing or writing
influenced by others, because it's already happening everywhere.
Many scholars attest that collaboration, rather than isolation, is
the dominant approach to everyday composing. Writing scholars
Lisa Ede and Andrea Lunsford, for example, have studied the work
of writers in diverse fields, including engineering, psychology,
chemistry, and even sanitation. They find that the professionals in
these fields rely heavily on collaboration to succeed in their writing
tasks. Likewise, writing researcher Joan Mullin confirms that many
artists--painters, architects, fashion designers, graphic artists and
more--always feel their work is collaborative and often learn by
mimicking, imitating, and even copying the work of others. These
writers and artists rely heavily on others' thoughts and ideas to
help them learn and succeed, and their success exemplifies why
this should be the default approach to all writing.

     What's more, collaboration involves more than the act of writ-
ing with other warm bodies in the room. It also involves a differ-
ent kind of collaboration: reusing, recycling, and repurposing
existing materials for new uses. In our digital age, everyday people
increasingly have access to vast reservoirs of archived materials.
Significantly, these materials can be put to use for new purposes.
Rhetoric scholars Jim Ridolfo and Dànielle Nicole DeVoss refer to
this remix process as "taking old pieces of text, images, sounds,
and video and stitching them together to form a new product."
Writing, if viewed this way, isn't predicated on values of isolation,
inward inspiration, or originality; rather, it sees values in shar-
ing, explicit influence, and renewal. Perhaps surprisingly, as media
researcher Henry Jenkins notes, the language of remix resuscitates
                                                       About Who Good Writers Are 69

older, pre-Romantic ideals of authorship. A turn toward remix and
borrowing, for Jenkins, "is not that radical when read against a
larger backdrop of human history," despite the deeply entrenched
ideal of creative genius propagated in recent history.

    As both history and contemporary practice demonstrate, writ-
ing has always required deep social engagement and influence, and
no writer has succeeded solely due to preternatural intellect or
talent. The pervasive idea of the reclusive author and genius birth-
ing prose free from influence must die--and in its wake, a renewed
idea of productive and meaningful collaboration (with other writ-
ers and their texts) will thrive.

SOME PEOPLE ARE JUST BORN
GOOD WRITERS

    Jill Parrott

    The author-god, according to mid-20th-century language theo-
rist Roland Barthes, embodies the Romantic notion of the artist
to whom brilliant epiphanies come to be written down. In fact, at
times throughout history, the best authors were believed to have
been chosen and directly inspired by God Himself. Because of
this cultural paradigm, many of us are deeply and psychologically
invested in the idea of individual genius authorship, as discussed
in Dustin Edwards and Enrique Paz's chapter elsewhere in this
collection. But, Bruce Horner writes in Students, Authorship, and
the Work of Composition that the genius idea separates us from the
real world. By seeing authors as genius artists only, we remove
ourselves from the activity of writing, which is social and contex-
tual, and are distracted by the product itself. When struggling writ-
ers consider writing a piece of art, they become frustrated because
they cannot force their writing to look like what they expect art to
be, and they have no clue where to begin to make themselves the
genius writer they believe teachers, bosses, and readers expect.

    Some of this idea--that writing is a talent set in stone--can be
directly correlated to the history of writing instruction itself. At
the end of the 19th century, proponents of a so-called literacy crisis
claimed that students entering American universities needed to
become more familiar with their own language and coincided with
a push to use our education system to build a uniquely American
intellectual identity, which ended up relegating writing instruction
to first-year courses. Many critics have attached this literacy crisis
to cultural anxiety over the growing pluralism of American soci-
ety as immigration increased with the Industrial Revolution. This
anxiety could also be seen in the approaches taken in these new
72 Bad Ideas

writing-focused classes. In a narrative all writing studies scholars
are familiar with, much of the teaching of writing in late 19th- and
early- to mid-20th-century America focused on the object produced
by writing, not the process of writing a text. This focus on the prod-
uct of writing reinforced the idea of writing as a skill some people
just had. Essays were usually written once and were done, for good
or ill. Students who were privileged to be of the right socioeco-
nomic, national, or ethnic background already wrote to the univer-
sity's standards because they were part of the group in power who
set the standards. Therefore, their perceived talent perpetuated the
author genius idea because these desirable students were already
seen as good writers while the less desirable students were not.

     Now, however, our cultural situation is quite different. Because
computer-based composition is quicker than pen to paper and
because the Internet allows us to share what we have written so
quickly, our composition happens quickly, often as a reaction to
what someone else has written or posted. One of the effects of
word processing and subsequently web publishing is that authors
are not just authors; they are also editors and publishers, broad-
ening the individual's daily interaction with language. In other
words, while the idea of the individual author genius is theoret-
ically problematic, it is also practically problematic because our
everyday authorship practices are socially situated, collaborative,
and interactive. People can and do read and write (and read and
write again) all the time. Social media such as Twitter, Facebook,
Instagram, and others offer daily opportunities for reading, creat-
ing, and responding to texts. Many people are experts at those
activities but then lack the experience and facility to recognize the
rhetorical requirements of other contexts or genres.

     Unfortunately, many discussions of authorship tend to ignore
these interesting aspects of language and focus on what writers
should not do: don't plagiarize, don't use "I," don't use Wikipedia.
The practices needed to become adept at writing are criminalized,
and inexperienced authors are often punished for being inexperienced.
Sometimes when I hear colleagues complain about student writ-
ing, my response is "But isn't that why we're here? Is it not our job
to teach them?" But a power differential between inexperienced
writers and professional authors perpetuates the idea of learners
as helpless children. We paint narratives of new writers negatively,
researchers refer to them by first name only in publications rather
than last names as we would real authors (in other words, "Julie
writes" as compared to "Faulkner writes"), we construct writers
                                                       About Who Good Writers Are 73

as passive rather than active, and we negatively compare them to
professional writers. In doing this, as Amy Robillard asks, "How
can students not come up lacking?" particularly in their own minds.

    As a reaction to these cultural forces at play, process-focused
teaching uses the steps taken as the writer creates the text--more
clearly connecting the act of writing with the product in the minds
of those participating. Since that shift in the 1960s, writing theo-
rists have been truly frightened to refer to our teaching as skills-
based for fear that it might undercut all the work done to challenge
those previously held assumptions of product-focused writing. But
skill is not a word we should fear if we define skill not as natural
talent but as a set of habits of mind and practices that can be taught
and learned.

    Indeed, the key to improving novice writers' experiences
is improving how they think about their work, a process called
metacognition. Opening up cognitive space that allows for meta-
cognition and reflection is essential to experiential and practical
improvement. One particularly powerful concept in the current
metacognitive conversation is persistence: Persistence emphasizes
that experience is more powerful than unchangeable ability, and
challenges help move writers forward rather than delaying their
progress. Good writers build these habits of mind. A success-
ful writer--whether someone working alone or with a commu-
nity group, or as a university student, professional writer, or any
other way--is not one who necessarily writes more but one who
persists and reflects on the work done as a means of improvement.
Instructors work not to reward the talented genius and punish the
unlucky, but to provide opportunities for writing, feedback, reflec-
tion, remixing, and revision of that work as socially located activi-
ties with rhetorical awareness. When a previously bad writer sees
improvement, sees the value of persistence, and feels the satisfac-
tion of the metacognitive recognition that they have gotten better,
they will know that good writers are not born but come to fruition
in the social act of writing itself.

    To alleviate this disconnect between what culture believes
writing is and what the activity of writing involves, many writing
studies professionals agree that we should emphasize the contex-
tual aspects that shape writing. We should emphasize writing as
a socially located activity and reject it as idealized art object. One
potential way to do this is to take writing out of the sole context
of the classroom. Traditional essays that are only seen by a teacher
(or perhaps a teacher and a peer reviewer) do not build writers'
74 Bad Ideas

concepts of themselves as authors because they can see those
assignments as acontextual hoops to jump through. Writing expe-
riences that broaden the writer's audience or provide real contexts
such as blogs or service learning placements in the community can
help new writers' see themselves as real authors with real audi-
ences and see the act of writing as a socially located activity.

     I will not deny, however, that certainly some authors are natu-
rally more comfortable, more experienced, or more confident than
others or may have more practiced facility with certain writing
situations. Natural talent exists. Sometimes I compare writing to
sports: I am not a naturally talented athlete, but I have trained for
and run in dozens of races, from 5Ks to half-marathons. I am a
runner. A person may not be naturally strong, but how could they
gain strength? Lift weights. Need more flexibility and balance?
Practice yoga. Likewise, it is with writing. We are all authors, and
all authors can become better authors.

     Indeed, research in writing studies shows that improved writ-
ing can be taught to writers at all levels, but we must first debunk
the deeply held idea in the collective psyche that only some lucky
people are good writers. If a person thinks their writing ability is
stuck in place, improvement is incredibly difficult, further solidify-
ing as a self-fulfilling prophecy the belief that they are a hopeless
cause. This idea that some people are good writers while others are
not can be truly crippling to a writer. Good writing instruction--
either in a classroom setting, a tutor session, or informally with
oneself--can only occur if the person believes they can become a
good writer with practice and focused feedback, which can only
happen if they have debunked the myth of the genius author. All
writers can improve their own writing by discovering which strat-
egies work for them and where their strengths and weaknesses lie.
We are not bound by an inborn, set level of writing talent. Good
writers are not born. They are learned.

76 Bad Ideas

FAILURE IS NOT AN OPTION

    Allison D. Carr

     Failure, so goes the dominant cultural narrative, is a sign of
weakness. Of laziness. Of stupidity and bad breeding and busted
bootstraps. Failure will ruin your life. In action, suspense, and
sports films, failure is not an option. In real life, failure only happens
to bad people. Or, more to the point in this context, to bad writ-
ers. Failure in writing betrays dullness of mind, smallness of imag-
ination. The failed writer--the one who cannot learn to write well
(which is to say, according to accepted conventions of good writ-
ing)--is discounted as dim, unprepared, non-serious, wacky, or
weird, distracted, behind.

     Or, failure is acceptable if we learn from it. If we can recuper-
ate it, if it brings us virtue and strength and morality because what
doesn't kill us makes us stronger. And if we never, ever do it again.

     No. Stop with this. This is stupid, and the opposite is actually
true: Failure should be welcomed, if not actively sought out, signal-
ing as it does both the presence of creative, risky thinking and an
opportunity to explore a new direction. To writing especially, fail-
ure is integral, and I will go so far as to assert that the best writ-
ing (and the best learning-to-write) happens when one approaches
the activity from a mindset trained on failure. Failure represents
a certain against-the-grain jettisoning of established ideas about
what counts as good writing in favor of rogue, original, atten-
tion-capturing, and intentional art. To fail willingly in writing is to
be empowered by the possibilities that emerge. It is to trust oneself
and one's ideas, a quality too rare in the age of hyper-achievement,
in which the only progress that counts is progress that moves up.

A History of Failure
     Broadly speaking, failure's bad reputation is an inherited relic

of another time. Though it would certainly be possible to trace its
                                                       About Who Good Writers Are 77

origins back to many religious mythologies, I will in the interest of
brevity go back only so far as the mid-19th century in America, when
the economy shifted from one based in agriculture to one based in
industry (closing, in theory, the opportunity gap between rich and
poor). From this backdrop grew the recognition that literacy, the
ability to read and write (and generally comprehend information),
would be the bedrock of a thriving community. Thus, literacy took
on the status of social necessity for the masses, not simply a luxury
for the ruling class. By the middle of the 19th century, a system of
common schools had been codified, and central to its curriculum
was grammar instruction and conventions of speech and writing.

    According to literacy scholar John Trimbur, from whom I have
been piecing together this history, reading and writing instruc-
tion functioned "as both a means to regulate popular literacy and
a social marker to divide the literate from the illiterate, the worthy
poor from the unworthy, `us' from `them.'" Given the then-cor-
responding (perhaps correlative) rates of illiteracy among incar-
cerated populations, success and failure in this realm came to be
perceived not simply as an indication of intelligence or economic
advantage, but as a matter of moral fiber. To fail in reading or writ-
ing meant a failure of moral fortitude.

    But cultural attitudes toward failure remain as sinister as ever,
perhaps more so in the wake of standardized testing, No Child Left
Behind, and Race to the Top. Failure continues to represent not
just ill preparedness, but weakness in spirit and mind, stupidity,
inadequacy, and a lifetime of toiling. And there is something about
failure in writing that amplifies these judgments, suggesting that
the subject somehow deserves to be judged and disadvantaged in
these ways.

An Alternative View

    What we have failed to grasp--why the idea that failure is bad
needs to die--is the integral connection between failure and risk,
creativity, and innovation, not to mention emotional and cognitive
resilience. This relationship is well documented, making its tena-
cious hold on cultural ideology especially confounding. For exam-
ple, many of us use and benefit daily from innovations discovered
by accident: penicillin, Corn Flakes, Post-it Notes, Corningware,
WD-40, oral contraception, and potato chips. All of these were
discovered when the discoverer was working on a different puzzle.
And discoveries like these are the norm, not the exception. This
is the primary activity of lab research, after all: A researcher may
78 Bad Ideas

run hundreds, thousands of trials and experiments, each a failure
in its own unique way (and some leading to accidental discover-
ies) before landing on, say, the polio vaccine or the secret to the
expanding universe. Likewise, in the tech industry, we need only
look as far as Silicon Valley and the dozens of stories of failed start-
ups to understand how integral failure is to the culture of innova-
tion there (even when it is difficult to stomach). In fact, failure is
so common and so prominent in tech, they've developed an entire
annual conference around it, FailCon.

     And though writing is not obviously about discovery of life-al-
tering products, it is about discovery of a different sort and thus,
the virtue of failure should be similarly celebrated. In fact, know-
ing what I know about learning to write (as a writer and a writ-
ing teacher myself), I would argue that it is impossible for one
to develop anything approaching a good writing ability without
years--decades, probably--of repeated failure. We aren't born
pen in hand, fully primed to write sonnets or political treatises as
soon as we get a grip on those fine motor skills. Writing is learned
slowly, over a long period of time, and with much difficulty, and
anybody who says otherwise is lying or delusional or both.

     Consider the testimony of renowned journalist and public
intellectual Ta-Nehisi Coates who, in an interview for The Atlantic's
"Creative Breakthroughs" series, describes writing as a process
of repeated failures that, with persistence, accumulate to create
breakthroughs. "I always consider the entire process about fail-
ure," he says, "and I think that's the reason why more people
don't write." Similarly, novelist Stephen King speaks publicly (and
repeatedly) about his impressively large stack of rejection slips
before Carrie was finally picked up by Doubleday, thereby launch-
ing his illustrious career (powered by persistence, no doubt, in the
face of his continued fear "of failing at whatever story I'm writ-
ing"). Pulitzer Prize winning novelist Junot Díaz writes memora-
bly of his difficulty in writing his second novel, a years-long exer-
cise in failure; it famously took Jane Austen fourteen years to
write Sense and Sensibility; and Joyce Carol Oates, in her "Notes on
Failure," reminds us that Faulkner considered himself a failed poet
and that Henry James only became a novelist after a failed turn at
playwriting.

     There is much disagreement, or shall I say healthy debate, in
the community of writing scholars about the best and most effec-
tive ways to teach writing. The specifics in this case are immate-
rial, because these scholars do agree on (at least) one foundational
                                                       About Who Good Writers Are 79

idea: that writing is a process, which is a coded way of avoiding
the harsher truth: Writing--and learning to write--involves a great
deal of failure. We start a draft; we get frustrated or stuck or side-
tracked, or we discover halfway through that we're actually inter-
ested in something else. We move to a clean sheet of paper or a
fresh document and start again. And the process continues until
we've made something cohesive, something that works. We schol-
ars know this not only because we've researched it, but because
we are writers ourselves, and we spend a great deal of time with
people struggling to improve their writing.

    Writing scholars don't use the word "failure" very often (or at
all), but we should. There is something bold there, something that
a dogged denial of failure closes off: permission to make a mess,
to throw something away, to try thirty different ideas instead of
toiling away on one. It's a reset button for the brain. That didn't
work! Let's salvage what we can and try again! Scholars and teach-
ers don't use this word, but we should--it is the most honest thing
we have to say about writing.

Making Failure an Option

    What should be clear is that failure is a significant part of the
entire scene of learning, an assertion that, again, is borne out by
widely respected research. Malcolm Gladwell isn't wrong when he
insists upon the 10,000-hour rule, which, in suggesting that it takes
10,000 hours to truly master anything (shooting free-throws, play-
ing an instrument), implicitly builds in a generous rate of failure.
It's true that writing is not stable in the way that chess is stable, but
the broad message of Gladwell's limited theory--that to excel at
anything takes a tremendous amount of practice and persistence--
easily aligns with prevailing thought on what is central to develop-
ment in writing: Writing is difficult and complex, and development
is not linear. More recently, Carol Dweck's concept of growth mind-
set suggests that people learn better when their efforts are assessed
and praised as opposed to their autonomous being: "You seem to
be working really hard" instead of "You're smart." Drawing on this
learning paradigm, cognitive researcher Manu Kapur tells us that
our brains are actually wired for failure.

    Failure is integral to learning and development, more so than
external markers of achievement or success. An avoidance of fail-
ure in learning, or in writing, or in industry or parenting or any
other human/community endeavor, represents an absence of
80 Bad Ideas

creativity and an abundance of predictability, little to no risk, and
perhaps even harmful or counter-productive thinking. This is not
a mindset anyone should encourage or reinforce. Instead, teach-
ers, scholars, mentors, and anybody involved in the conversa-
tion about writing development should be taking concrete steps
toward normalizing failure. This means rethinking the frame of
the entire scene of writing, including what it means to learn how
to do it and what it means to teach it. As my invocation of Gladwell
above demonstrates, it is foolish to imagine writing as a discrete
and stable skill that can be mastered, a mindset that unfortunately
dominates much writing instruction (especially in this era of test-
ing); instead, it is crucial that the project of developing as a writer
is understood as an always ongoing process of learning and discov-
ery and that writing classrooms should be thought of as labora-
tories where experimentation and question-asking prevails over
rule-memorization and formulaic discipline. Writing is not a list
of dos and don'ts, nor is success in writing a universally acknowl-
edged ideal. Writing is about risk and wonder and a compulsion to
make something known. Failure--and a willingness to fail often in
large, obvious ways--should always be an option.

THERE IS ONE CORRECT WAY OF
WRITING AND SPEAKING

    Anjali Pattanayak

     People consistently lament that kids today can't speak prop-
erly or that people coming to this country need to learn to write
correctly. These lamentations are based on the notion that there is
a single correct way of speaking and writing. Currently, the general
sentiment is that people should just learn to speak and write proper
English. This understanding of writing is rooted called current tradi-
tional rhetoric, which focuses on a prescriptive and formulaic way
of teaching writing that assumes there is only one way to write
(or speak) something for it to be correct. However, over the past
several decades, scholars in writing studies have examined the ways
in which writing has a close dialectical relationship with identity,
style genre, and culture. In other words, the rules for writing shift
with the people and the community involved as well as the purpose
and type of writing.

     Most people implicitly understand that the way they communi-
cate changes with different groups of people, from bosses to work
colleagues to peers to relatives. They understand that conversa-
tions that may be appropriate over a private dinner may not be
appropriate at the workplace. These conversational shifts might be
subtle, but they are distinct. While most people accept and under-
stand these nuances exist and will adapt to these unspoken rules--
and while we have all committed a social faux pas when we didn't
understand these unspoken rules--we do not often afford this
same benefit of the doubt to people who are new to our communi-
ties or who are learning our unspoken rules.

     While the idea of arguing whether there is one correct way of
communicating or whether writing is culturally situated might
seem to be a pedantic exercise, the reality is that espousing the
                                                       About Who Good Writers Are 83

ideology that there is one correct way to speak and write disenfran-
chises many populations who are already denigrated by society. The
writing most valued in this binary is a type of writing that is situ-
ated in middle-class white culture. In adhering to so-called correct
language, we are devaluing the non-standard dialects, cultures, and
therefore identities of people and their communicative situations
that do not fit a highly limited mold.

    The way in which correctness in language devalues people is
already troubling, but it becomes exacerbated by the current trends
in education. Please refer to the literary crisis chapter to learn more
about the changing dynamics in education. Given this shift and
the way that Standard Written English is deeply rooted in white
upper/middle-class culture, we see more and more students from
diverse backgrounds gaining access to college who are facing barri-
ers due to their linguistic backgrounds.

    This means that while minority students and lower class
students are ostensibly being given greater access to education,
careers, and other facets of society they had been previously
barred from, they are still facing serious barriers that their upper-
class white counterparts do not, particularly in terms of culture,
language, and literacy. J. Elspeth Stuckey argues that literacy,
rather than enfranchising students, is a means of oppression and
that it does little to help the economic futures of minority students
because of how literacy teaches a particular set of values--ways of
communicating and identity. In the context of educational settings,
the cultures and identities of academia are valued more than those
of the students, which sends the message that how they, their
family, and members in their community speak and act are wrong
by comparison. In essence, it sends the message starting at a very
young age that who they are and where they come from is some-
how lesser.

    In this sense, education, while well intentioned, serves to
further the marginalization of certain identities and cultures that
do not fit. This is particularly evident in Latino, African American,
and English as Second Language communities. In the book Paying
for the Party, Elizabeth Armstrong and Laura Hamilton note that
colleges like the school they studied for five years, which they
call Midwestern University, do not help facilitate social mobility.
Frequently, the students who entered college best prepared were
those who were already middle or upper class, meaning the oppor-
tunities the working- and lower-class students received were more
limited. When you look at this alongside what Gloria Ladson-Billings
84 Bad Ideas

calls the educational debt, or the compounded impact of educational
deficits that grow across generations of poor minority students,
literacy efforts as they are currently framed paint a bleak picture for
poor, minority students.

     The issue is not just one of unequal access to opportunities.
Jacqueline Jones Royster and Carmen Kynard illustrate how atti-
tudes toward students as writers are interwoven with attitudes
toward them as people. Language cannot be disassociated from
people, which has important consequences for those who grow up
speaking different dialects. By continuing to propagate the notion
of correct and incorrect ways of speaking, we effectively devalue the
intelligence and character of students, employees, and colleagues,
who, for whatever reasons, don't speak or write what in historical
terms has been called the King's English (among other names).
We use the perception of improper communication as evidence
of others' lesser character or ability, despite recognizing that this
country was united (if only in name) after declaring independence
from that King.

     This perception becomes all the more problematic because it
is not just about devaluing individuals, but about the widespread
practice of devaluing the literate practices of those who are already
marginalized. David Gold highlights the marginalization of women,
working class, rural, and African American literacy in our under-
standing of writing. Gold writes about how the literacy practices of
African Americans in universities laid the groundwork for the Civil
Rights movement. Indeed, the schools he studied were decades
ahead of the larger national conversation on how literacy, identity,
and power were interrelated. In her work examining how literacy
and identity formation were key for African American women and
for social change, Jacqueline Jones Royster discusses the impor-
tance of understanding the these cultural, identity, and social move-
ments, echoing the impact marginalized scholars had in academia.
Both demonstrate the detrimental impact of sidelining groups of
people and their literate practices by devaluing their languages and
their experiences, not just for those who are marginalized but for
our larger understanding of how we as a society write.

     The notion of one correct way of writing is also troubling
because it operates under the assumption that linguistic differ-
ences are the result of error. The reality is that, for many speak-
ers, what we might perceive as a mistake is actually a system of
difference. One notable example of a different dialect of English
is Ebonics, which has different patterns of speech rooted in the
                                                       About Who Good Writers Are 85

ancestral heritage of its speakers. Similarly, immigrant groups
will frequently speak and write English in a way that mirrors the
linguistic heritage of their mother tongue.

    The way that we conceptualize language is not just detrimen-
tal to minorities; it also devalues the identities that working- and
lower-class people bring to communicative situations, including
the classroom. Lynn Z. Bloom writes that "Freshman Composition
is an unabashedly middle-class enterprise." She argues that one
of the reasons composition is required for all students is because
it promulgates middle-class values and ways of thinking. These
values in the writing classroom are embodied in everything from
the notion of property, which undergirds the way that plagiarism
and intellectual property are treated, to formality of language and
rhetorical choices that are encouraged in papers. Indeed, the way
many instructors teach writing, plagiarism, citation, and word
choice in papers is not in and of itself good but rather is the socially
accepted way of interacting with text as defined by the middle class.
Mike Rose and Irvin Peckham write about the tension of middle-
class values on working-class students and the cognitive dissonance
and struggles with identity that come with imposing such values in
writing under the guise of correctness. The idea that there is one
correct way of writing devalues the writing, thoughts, intelligence,
and identities of people from lower-class backgrounds.

    Pragmatically, many argue that standard English should be
dominant in the binary between academic English and all other
dialects in order for speakers and writers to communicate with
credibility in their communities. This argument has been used to
justify the continued attention to correctness at the expense of
authors' voices, but we can teach people to adapt while also valu-
ing their identities. We can talk about writing as something that
they can employ to their benefit rather than a hegemonic standard
that supersedes their backgrounds, identities, and experiences.

    In order to value the diversity of communication and identities
that exist in the U.S., we need to start teaching and envisioning
writing as a cultural and social activity. We need a more nuanced
view of writing in society that encourages everyone to adapt to
their audiences and contexts rather than placing an undue burden
on those who do not fit the mold of standard English. One strategy
for teaching academic English without devaluing a writer's identity
is code-switching, a concept already taught in schools with signif-
icant minority populations as a way of empowering young people.
While instruction in code-switching is valuable because it teaches
86 Bad Ideas

students that they can adopt different linguistic choices to appeal
to different audiences, it is deeply problematic that the impetus
is still placed on minority students with non-standard dialects to
adapt. While code-switching is meant to empower people, it is still
rooted in the mentality that there is one correct way of writing,
because even as code-switching teaches an incredibly nuanced way
of thinking about writing, it is still being taught in the context of
preparing writers to deal with a society that will use errors in speak-
ing as evidence that they are lesser. As a result, it is a less-than-
ideal solution because it plays into--rather than undermines--the
racism of academic English.

     By perpetuating the myth of one correct way of writing, we
are effectively marginalizing substantial swaths of the popula-
tion linguistically and culturally. The first step in combating this
is as easy as recognizing how correctness reinforces inequality
and affects our own perceptions of people and questioning our
assumptions about communication, and a second step is valuing
code-switching in a wide swath of communicative situations.

AFRICAN AMERICAN LANGUAGE IS
NOT GOOD ENGLISH

    Jennifer M. Cunningham

     What linguist Geneva Smitherman calls African American
Language (also called Ebonics, African American Vernacular
English, black English, broken English, bad English, or slang) has
been discounted as a lesser form of communication than other
forms of spoken and written English. Our society perpetuates this
stigma, remaining uninformed or misinformed about its linguis-
tic complexity. Understood from a linguistics perspective, African
American Language combines an English vocabulary (the words
used) with an African grammar (the way the words are ordered and
conjugated) and phonology (the way the words are pronounced).
In that way, African American Language is not good or bad English
because it is not, linguistically speaking, English. Further, African
American Language, like other languages and dialects, follows
rules and conventions and is correct and good in specific contexts.

     Scholars like Lisa Delpit find that teachers in particular are
more likely to correct errors related to African American Language,
which is why teachers, professionals, and society at large need
to understand that African American Language is different from
and not a deficient form of Standard American English. The use of
"standard" is problematic, suggesting that the United States does,
in fact, have an accepted standard language. (Here, "standard" is
used to differentiate the type of English preferred in academic and
professional settings from other varieties of spoken and written
American English; most writing courses aim to teach this type of
language use.) Within the classroom or in a professional setting,
these so-called errors need to be addressed in terms of language
difference, code-switching, and expected conventions rather than
a person's misuse of English. These errors are not mistakes but,
                                                       About Who Good Writers Are 89

instead, occur when a communicator does not understand or is not
aware of differences between one language and another or when,
how, or why to switch from one language to another. Understood
that way, African American Language follows specific grammati-
cal, phonological, and morphological rules--the ways words and
sentences are ordered, conjugated, spelled, and pronounced is logi-
cal and rule-governed, not arbitrary, or wrong. Instead of follow-
ing the rules of Standard American English, African American
Language obeys specific linguistic patterns that tend to adhere to
both American English and African language rules.

    There are two primary hypotheses about the origin of African
American Language. One theory suggests that African American
Language is a dialect with English origins. The other theory main-
tains that African American Language is a language that developed
from a mixture of languages used by people of different linguistic
backgrounds in order to communicate and is a separate language
made up of mostly English-language vocabulary words and West
African grammatical and phonological rules. I am persuaded by the
second hypothesis and maintain that Southern American English
was influenced by African American Language, but the subject is
controversial.

    Linguists define languages according to their grammatical
origins, not their vocabulary. For example, English is considered a
Germanic language because its grammar follows Germanic rules,
even though its vocabulary is largely French and Latin. Likewise,
African American Language is more grammatically African than
English, even though its vocabulary is English. Therefore, it follows
logically that African American Language ought to be considered
linguistically (according to scholars like Ernie Smith) an African
language, separate from English, based on its grammatical origins in
the Niger-Congo or western and southern parts of Africa. Defining
African American Language as a separate language from Standard
American English, situating African American Language as a valid,
independent form of spoken and written communication.

    Linguist Lisa Green has written an introduction to African
American Language where she discusses its grammatical and phono-
logical rules. For example, within African American Language, as
with other Niger-Congo languages, there is a grammatical construc-
tion called zero copula, which means that sentences do not require
the verb be (i.e., be, am, is, are, was, were, been, being) to be grammat-
ically correct. Therefore, while some African American Language
speakers could say She reading, Standard American English speakers
90 Bad Ideas

would say She is reading. Both are correct linguistically. There is
also a construction that includes the word be known as habitual
be, meaning that if the word be is used in a sentence, an action is
consistent or regular. Therefore, She be reading means, in Standard
American English, She reads all of the time.

     Another grammatical feature common among African American
Language is the negative concord; in other words, a double nega-
tive. Contrary to what some believe, language does not work like
math, so including two negatives in a sentence does not make the
sentence positive. In fact, many languages (e.g., French, Spanish,
and Portuguese) include multiple negatives within a sentence
for emphasis. That means that the African American Language
sentence I ain't got no time is grammatically correct and more
emphatic than the Standard American English sentence I don't have
any time. The use of ain't is also grammatical in African American
Language and can also be translated to the Standard American
English word didn't. For example, the African American Language
sentence I ain't take the money translates to I didn't take the money in
Standard American English.

     A phonological construction or sound found among African
American Language is replacement of the th sound. The th sound
(e.g., with and think) is actually an uncommon and difficult sound
to produce if it is not part of a person's first language. English is
one of the few languages (as are Hindi, Greek, and Scottish) that
include this sound, and people for whom English is not their first
language make linguistic accommodations to approximate or recre-
ate the sound by using replacement sounds. A person whose first
language is French typically replaces the voiced th with another
voiced sound, which, in French, is often a /z/. This specific replace-
ment produces zis, zat, zese, zose for Standard American English
this, that, these, and those. In African American Language, this same
linguistic principle applies, and people for whom African American
Language is their first language replace a voiced th sound with a
/d/, producing dis, dat, dese, and dose. Likewise, African American
Language speakers tend to replace a voiceless th sound (such as
with) with another voiceless sound, usually a /d/ or /t/, which
produces wif or wit.

     These few linguistic explanations serve as examples to rein-
force the point that African American Language, whether spoken
or written, is not bad English. In fact, African American Language
follows many grammatical, phonological, and morphological
patterns that do not exist in Standard American English. When
                                                       About Who Good Writers Are 91

instructors, professionals, or society expect Standard Academic
English among oral or written communication, but instead find
instances of African American Language, it is not simply a problem
of syntactical or grammatical errors within a single language.

    When we focus on the ways that African American Language
and Standard American English are different, communicators are
able to better understand, acquire, and switch between both, and
society is more capable of recognizing the validity of the language
and its users. Conflating the two into one linguistic variety is
confusing at best and damaging at worst. We need to understand
and explain African American Language and Standard American
English as different languages, each with its own set of grammati-
cal, phonological, and morphological rules (even though they share
a lexicon or vocabulary).

    In the writing classroom, teachers can help students navigate
Standard American English expectations while not suggesting a
linguistic hierarchy. By speaking about language choices in terms
of difference rather than deficiency and in relation to academic and
nonacademic conventions, we can value both (or any) languages.
Delpit suggests validating students by welcoming their home
languages--and, therefore, their cultures and identities--into the
classroom so they feel respected and might be more willing to
add Standard American English to their linguistic repertoires. If
students understand that different audiences and contexts expect
different language choices and that African American Language is
different from Standard American English but that neither is better
or worse than the other, then they are better able to accept and use
both proficiently.

OFFICIAL AMERICAN ENGLISH
IS BEST

    Steven Alvarez

    The debate in favor of English as the official language of the
United States focuses on narrowing national unity amid linguis-
tic diversity for the sake of communicative clarity and the better-
ment of the country. Generally speaking, arguments for English
as the national language boil down to assimilating immigrants to
the United States. English-only supporters reason that if immi-
grants come to the United States, they must learn to speak, read,
and write English. And more, U.S. citizens should not have to be
burdened to speak, read, or write official business in languages that
are not English--U.S. citizens should not be inconvenienced with
para español, marque número dos when calling their banks or for foot-
ing the bill to translate driver's license applications or signs at the
Division of Motor Vehicles into different languages, let alone filling
out an application in another language.

    Thirty-one states have some form of English-only legislation,
most recently Oklahoma in 2010. For over three decades, the polit-
ical think tank known as U.S. English has been central for shaping
legal policies advocating for the unifying role of an official language
in the United States. U.S. English has lobbied to enact English-
only legislation across the United States, or what the organization
calls Official English. According to U.S. English, recognizing English
as the official language of the nation benefits the government
and its citizens by fostering a common means of communication
among its 325 spoken languages. Official English urges that official
government business at all levels be conducted solely in English,
including signs, applications, public documents, records, official
ceremonies, and meetings. U.S. English argues that making Official
English the law of the land would "encourage immigrants to learn
94 Bad Ideas

English in order to use government services and participate in the
democratic process." Immigrants in the Official English movement
must be forcefully encouraged to read, write, and speak English,
because if they live in America, they better learn English, and learn
quickly if they want to catch up with everyone else. Implicit in
the argument is that immigrants don't want to learn English, that
immigrants don't exercise their democratic rights, and that immi-
grants don't integrate with the mainstream.

     These huge misconceptions are at the root of U.S. English's
arguments dismissing bilingual education, literacy learning, and
immigrant involvement for a mythologized monolingual United
States, which are bad ideas for all writers in a democratic soci-
ety. Rather than approach the diversity of our voices in the United
States as gaps to be overcome toward learning English, we should
look to all of our nation's languages as gifts. The question of
Official English unifying difference is a smokescreen for nationalist
conceptions about immigrant integration and assimilation. Indeed,
the argument for Official English swirls into a dichotomy between
us and them, focusing specifically on how becoming American for
immigrants means being encouraged to lose a central component
of their identity to participate in the democratic process. This
way of thinking about plurilingual burdens hurts how the United
States thinks of its many linguistic gifts, however. The worst part
of this plurilingual benign neglect is the unfair blame individu-
als and groups receive for their supposed English language lacks,
deficits, and gaps. I propose instead that we learn how our writ-
ing repertoires move beyond and between languages. Instead of
standardized monolingual writing in Official English terms, we can
instead turn to how writing grounded in social justice and demo-
cratic pluralism connects local, national, and global struggles that
challenge language nationalism.

The Myth of an English-Only United States

     The English-only myth assigns deficits and gaps to anyone with
home languages that are not English. English-only policies make
prescriptions about official languages, and such debates also make
prescriptions about who can be a citizen or pass as one. Among
immigrant families across the nation there is a strong desire to
learn English. Immigrants on one level believe in more economic
opportunities with English, but also the power of English to be
able to defend themselves. In fact, immigrant parents learning
                                                       About Who Good Writers Are 95

English often blame themselves for not assimilating their chil-
dren's language identities, and in cases of home language loss,
blame themselves for that as well. What the English-only argu-
ment misses is the human struggles of immigrants, of individ-
ual and collective community struggles for bilingual education.
For English-only advocates, immigrants are faceless statistics
connected to cost analyses and alleged drains on public systems,
such as printing public signs and materials in languages that are
not English.

    English as the official language of the United States has roots
that go back to the founding of the United States. Benjamin
Franklin, for example, was notorious for desiring to rid the nation
of German-language schools. English-only was one of the Founding
Father's major concerns for preserving and conserving the emerg-
ing American identity. This is ironic enough considering the
English language's Germanic heritage, but nevertheless the sense
of linguistic assimilation amid pluralism has deep sediment within
the American monolingual psyche. Native Americans and immi-
grants from around the world have had their languages forcefully
removed in the United States since its beginning and have contin-
ually suffered assimilative pressures in schools for generations.

    It was not until the 1980s, however, that federal propos-
als for a constitutional amendment declaring English the official
language of the nation became increasingly vocal. In 1981, U.S.
Senator Samuel Ichiye Hayakawa, one of U.S. English's founders,
introduced the amendment in the Senate, and though the amend-
ment did not progress, the arguments awakened multiple lobby-
ing groups to expand the efforts at the state level, succeeding in
some 30 states to date. The U.S. English lobbyists made their
biggest strides in California, the home state of Senator Hayakawa.
In 1998, California voters passed Proposition 227, mandating that
California Limited English Proficient (LEP) students be taught
literacy overwhelmingly in English-only immersion programs not
normally expected to exceed one year rather than provide any fund-
ing for bilingual education. After one year, students were encour-
aged to sink or swim in mainstream classes. As a result, California
removed all bilingual classes and assessed thousands of emergent
bilingual students as limited in their academic English proficiency.
At the time, roughly a quarter of California's students classified as
limited.

    The arguments for national unity linked to English and
assimilation compel bizarre patriotic themes that convince some
96 Bad Ideas

Americans who would find discrimination on any other spaces
shameful. Through the guise of language, however, targeting immi-
grants turns discrimination into euphemisms about citizenship,
belonging, and the public good. The limited in the LEP designa-
tion carries the stigma of deficiency, applied to students' languag-
ing abilities and assuming potential and, as a result, opportuni-
ties. The children affected by the legislation are not researchers for
think tanks or lobbyists, let alone against learning English or their
home languages. The real limit for all students is mainstreaming
policy that cuts away at the plurilingual gifts of our nation. All
Americans stand to gain by learning to speak, read, and write many
languages.

Embracing All the Languages of the United States as
    Gifts

     The truth is that immigrants to the United States learn English
faster today than at any point in history. Historically, immigrants
to the U.S. transitioned from home languages to English within
three generations. Today, this timeframe has been compressed for
some immigrant groups to a single generation, as linguistic schol-
ars Rubén Rumbaut and Douglas Massey explain. The problem,
therefore, is not learning English but rather remaining bilingual.

     In addition, the assumptions of Official English that students
learning English find little support from their families or that
students' home languages have no place in learning both fall flat.
Official English assumes that there is no value to fluencies in
languages not English and that monolingual English is sufficient
for the global language. The narrow-minded view that English-
only is the only model for literacy learning should be put to rest.
English-only does not contribute to meaningful education on any
grounds. Decades of research into bilingual learning strongly advo-
cates for all students' plurilingual learning.

     Plurilingual writers have extensive vocabularies beyond
English and excellent abilities to translate and interpret across
and between languages. Bilingual individuals have also proven to
develop complex meta-cognitive skills for translating and commu-
nicating among diverse audiences. This movement between people
and writing makes for complex imaginative and critical writing.
Consider this plurilingual gift of writing as a way to move away
from the misconceptions about English-only ideologies. In a
global economy, the power of English is undeniable, yet the power
                                                       About Who Good Writers Are 97

of bilinguals to communicate beyond and across languages and
cultures is invaluable. Further, we can and must appreciate pluri-
lingualism as a gift, a gift that some students bring to our schools
from their homes and communities. When we try, we can learn
to appreciate that all the languages of our nation are gifts, and
those gifts shape our identities as unique individuals in communi-
ties who speak to one another between and across languages and
differences, even in spaces imagined to be monolingual.

Writing Across and Between Languages

    Ultimately, schools bear the responsibility for producing consci-
entious citizens; hence, the intolerant impetus behind Proposition
227 and efforts to standardize students and their languages do not
follow the democratic tradition of U.S. schooling. English-only
initiatives at the state level have not produced any evidence to back
their arguments about increasing proficiency among emergent
bilingual students or for aiding public communication. This lack of
evidence is not surprising because in reality there are no language
gaps, aside from those that policy makers create out of air. If you
catch yourself using ideas of language gaps, limited, or playing catch
up to arrive at English literacy, don't play into the game. There are
no gaps or limits when it comes to languages; there are only gifts.
So-called language gaps are bad for writing in all languages--not
just English--and bad for democracy.

    On a practical level, I write this from the level of students who
don't lobby Congress but who must learn to value the dignity of
all languages, most importantly the languages of all our nation's
communities and families. Rather than mark emergent bilingual
students by their limits, we should instead imagine students by
their potential and by the strengths they gain from their communi-
ties that they carry with them into classrooms. Rather than assume
students are limited writers or at fault in their individualized
efforts, we must acknowledge that emerging bilingual students are
not limited in their community contexts and instead look to the
diverse repertoires they perform. Writing that is truly democratic
values all languages and identities as they exist across the nation
and not as imagined as English-only.

    This type of writing means embracing all languages of commu-
nities, following the movements in diverse activities, perfor-
mances, and genres, including across generations and social
classes. For English-only purists, this view will remain contrary
98 Bad Ideas

to their ideology, but a realistic orientation acknowledges that
all American communities are plurilingual and that the language
hybridity of everyday practices happen in contexts that range from
the boroughs of New York City to the Appalachian regions of the
South, from Alaska to Hawaii to Puerto Rico. The reading of the
word to re-read the world and the opportunity to re-write is where
this hybridity can offer the liberating potential to envision social
justice across languages.

WRITER'S BLOCK JUST HAPPENS
TO PEOPLE

    Geoffrey V. Carter

    Whenever someone trying to write says that they are suffering
from writer's block, the first word that comes to my mind could be
misunderstood as uncharitable: slacker.

    At the end of this short essay, I will tell you why the word
slacker pops into my mind, but first I want to share some thoughts
regarding Edmund Bergler, the person who first developed the
term writer's block. Bergler was Sigmund Freud's assistant director
at the Vienna Clinic in the 1930s. Bergler made all sorts of outra-
geous claims, not the least of which was his ability to completely
cure the malady he coined. Of all Bergler's unsubstantiated psycho-
logical declarations, this was the one that bothered me the most.
When I think about Bergler's example, what comes to mind are
writing techniques that I use to circumvent writer's block rather
than further pathologize it.

    As a writer myself, I know that writing doesn't always come
easily. Fortunately, I've always been good at researching things
before I really start writing. I was puzzled, for example, by a
claim made by those who had previously studied Bergler: Bergler,
evidently, had claimed that he had a 100% cure rate when it came
to the malady he had invented. And yet, purportedly, Bergler never
explained exactly how he treated this problem. Surely, I thought to
myself, he would have mentioned a strategy somewhere. Delving
deeper into such puzzling claims is an important step in a writ-
ing process and, for me, such work often alleviates the feeling of
having writer's block.

    While searching through his work, I waded through Bergler's
pontifications on the frigidity of women and his rejection of homo-
sexuality. (Bergler seriously limited his own dating pool with such
100 Bad Ideas

proclamations.) Along the way, I found an article that gave him
credit for articulating a logical connection between gambling and
masochism. Perhaps Bergler wasn't completely off his rocker, even
if he wasn't able to see past Freud's sexual hang-ups or see fit to
disclose his alleged cure for writer's block. In all, I could only find
one trivial tactic that Bergler shared--inadvertently, perhaps--in
one of his clinical session anecdotes.

     Before I share this anecdote, I want to mention how it rein-
forces some of the other strategies for overcoming writer's block
that I've come across. These strategies were noted both before and
after Bergler's time. The hesitation to write, after all, has been
around since we've been trying to write. Whenever we stare at a
blank page, we're in good company.

     Perhaps the funniest piece of scholarship that I've ever encoun-
tered about the good company of a blank page is one that was actu-
ally published in an academic journal. It can be found in the 1974
issue of the Journal of Applied Behavior Analysis, if you care to track
it down yourself. (I certainly would not have delved into this jour-
nal had others not mentioned it in connection to Bergler.) When
I requested this journal from the library, I most certainly wasn't
looking for a laugh. But author Dennis Upper's entire article was
summed up in the title--"The Unsuccessful Self-Treatment of a
Case of Writer's Block"--because the rest of the article (no joke)
is a blank page with a footnote that it was "published without
revision" following its presentation at the 81st Annual American
Psychological Association Convention the year before and a note
from a reviewer who vetted its inclusion into the journal: "Clearly
it is the most concise manuscript I have ever seen--yet it contains
sufficient detail to allow other investigators to replicate Dr. Upper's
failure." Who knew that it would be serious business to publish
a blank page in an academic journal that, at the time, had been
publishing for over half a century?

     The humor of this article often causes people to smile. Curiously,
however, just as many people scoff at the idea of a non-article. I'm
not sure why the publishing of a blank page amuses some but is an
affront to others, but I have another story about writer's block that
might offer a key.

     Back in the 18th century, there was a French schoolteacher and
philosopher named Joseph Jacotot who put bad ideas about writer's
block to the test with the help of an illiterate Flemish locksmith.
Contrary to commonly held opinion at the time, Jacotot believed
that everyone--regardless of cultural hierarchy--had the capacity
                                                     About Who Good Writers Are 101

for equal intelligence. His notion of intellectual emancipation led him
to guide an illiterate locksmith in reading and comprehending a
17th-century French treatise. Rather than insisting his locksmith
learn through a traditional abécédaire (i.e., learning letters before
learning words before learning meaning and so forth), Jacotot's
philosophy was simple: "Everything is in everything." He operated
under an assumption that it is always easier to utilize what his
learners already knew. Thus the first name mentioned in the afore-
mentioned treatise, "Calypso," was understood by the locksmith's
recognition of the square and the round to identify what more tradi-
tional learners would label as L and O.

    Jacotot's "everything is in everything" tact is one that I've
come to feel embodies my approach to writing: As I was exploring
Bergler, I was researching a little bit of everything and incorporat-
ing a little bit of everything. I could tell Upper's blank page was a
clue, and as I listened to Jacotot's story about the locksmith play-
ing with names, I was getting down with a tactic only hinted at in
Bergler's work.

    And this is where I come back `round to Bergler and an anecdote
he briefly shared about one of his writer's block patients. As it turns
out, the patient said he "unlocked his [own] literary resources" by
playing with his psychiatrist's name: Bergler. Whether the patient
was calling Bergler out as a burglar for taking his money when he
was solving his own problem can't be verified. But the key here--
and yes, key is a punny reference to the illiterate locksmith--is the
idea that one can facilitate writing by embracing the blank page,
by remembering "everything is in everything," and by playing with
words and names. Doing so, I believe, negates the very problem of
writer's block.

    These stories about writer's block lead me to suggest that it
might be useful to experiment with playing with names to get one's
writing process underway. It's simple. By looking at your own name
and the names of others, we might find puns and anagrams to help
move writing along. Bergler-Burglar is simple, but as "everything
is in everything," even finding a certain glee in a name is permis-
sible. I find such play with names and words loosens me up, and
perhaps this might help others who feel frustrated or blocked too.

    It all comes down to this: When faced with the process of creat-
ing something, rather than just giving up, writing about anything
that comes to mind--even if it is just fooling around with words--
can sometimes motivate real work. Being playful, after all, often
leads to storytelling about why one is being playful. If this can be
102 Bad Ideas

accepted, the reason why the word slacker comes to my mind is
revealed as the prospect of being more than someone who simply
isn't trying hard enough.

     Before I leave you with a final impression of myself as having
contempt for someone struggling to create, let me clarify that
my first thought, mentioned at the start of this piece, is of the
movie Slacker (1991). This movie, written and directed by Richard
Linklater, is one that on paper looks like a bad idea--a really bad
idea. There are no big stars, no plotline, no main characters or char-
acter development, no traditional theatrical structure, no dramatic
music--indeed, there's no soundtrack at all. Slacker has no special
effects or any real action, and, as such, it contains nothing that a
Hollywood Feature would usually feature.

     But despite the nonexistence of all these traditional elements,
this film is a masterpiece of the mundane. For the entirety of the
movie, for a full one hour and forty minutes, nothing of conse-
quence happens. But it is just brilliant. Nothing happens, and yet
the film works.

     One character from Slacker, in particular, is an aspiring writer
at a coffee shop. At his scene's start, he is sitting, waiting for a
friend. As he waits, we hear him in the background expounding
on ideas for what he hopes will be the next Great American Novel.
When his friend approaches his table, our aspiring writer forgoes
the usual, friendly salutations and, instead, immediately enlists his
friend into the fever of his writing brainstorm. The aspiring writer's
various riffs--such as calling for "a full circle aesthetic re-evalua-
tion"--make him sound like a pseudo-intellectual blowhard who,
at one point, sees himself as the next Dostoevsky. But then--after
all this talk about writing--our aspiring writer reaches a moment
of clarity: "Who's ever written the great work about the immense
effort required in order not to create?" This line distills the essence
of Slacker into a single sentence. Linklater, of course, captures this
idea in his film's title. The line is all about turning the struggle to
write back upon itself in order to create. You have to try very hard
in order not to create at all.

Block'" (Journal of Applied Behavior) needs to be seen to be believed.
Better, still, is my recommendation that you link later to Richard
Linklater's movie, Slacker, and perhaps embrace the idea that tell-
ing the story about blocked writers may offer story enough.

104 Bad Ideas

STRONG WRITING AND WRITERS
DON'T NEED REVISION

    Laura Giovanelli

      "The standard perception that revision is something that
happens at the end of the writing process is a good place to start
revising ideas about revision."--Cathleen Breidenbach

     The fantasy that good writers summon forth beautiful, lean, yet
intricate sentences onto a page without sweating is an unhealthy
fiction, and it is wrong. What writers need is revision. Novice writ-
ers, experienced writers, all writers. Anyone interested in writing
clearer, stronger, more persuasive and passionate prose, even those
of us who are procrastinators panicking because we need to get
a project finished or a paper written and it's 2:00 a.m. the night
before our deadline--writers need revision because revision is not
a discrete step. Revision is not the thing writers do when they're
done writing. Revision is the writing.

     It's important to keep in mind I'm not talking about revision
as proofreading or copy editing; no amount of grammatical, spell-
ing, and style corrections transforms a piece of writing like focused
attention to fundamental questions about purpose, evidence, and
organization. That, to me, is revision: the heavy lifting of working
through why I'm writing, who I'm writing for, and how I structure
writing logically and effectively.

Revision is Writing
     My writing students are usually relieved to hear that published

authors often find writing just as fraught as they do. Like first-
year college students, people paid to write--the journalists and the
novelists and the technical writers--more often than not despair at
the difference between what's in their heads and hearts and what
                                                     About Who Good Writers Are 105

ends up on the page the first time around. The professionals are
just a little better at waiting things out, pushing through what
Anne Lamott calls "shitty first drafts" and all the ones that follow,
the revision of a tenth and a thirteenth and a twenty-third draft. I
show a YouTube video by Tim Weninger, a computer scientist and
engineer at the University of Notre Dame. In the video, Weninger
stitches together his revisions of a research paper. In my class,
we play a game, guessing how many revisions Weninger did. The
answer--463!--almost always surprises them. It still sometimes
surprises me. And sure, some of those revisions are small, fiddly
changes. But most of the time, even watching this quickly on class-
room monitors, my students notice Weninger aims for the jugular
in his writing. He's after wholesale overhaul of his argument and
of his larger work.

    However, talking about revision in terms of numbers of drafts
implies that all writing, all writers, and all revision work one way: hit
your target draft number, like your daily Fitbit goals, and you magi-
cally get good writing. But more revision isn't necessarily better.
Effective revising isn't making changes for the sake of change, but
instead making smarter changes. And professional writers--prac-
ticed writers--have this awareness even if they aren't aware of it.
In Stephen King's memoir On Writing, he calls this instinct the ideal
reader: an imagined person a writer knows and trusts but rewrites
in response to, a kind of collaborative dance between writer and
reader. To writers, the act of writing is an act of thinking. One writer
in a landmark study of comparing the habits of experienced writers
to those of novices called their first drafts "the kernel." If you're
someone like me who is constantly struggling to demystify this
complex cognitive thing we humans do, that metaphor of writing
as a seed is revelatory. Revision is not a sign of weakness or inex-
perienced or poor writing. It is the writing. The more writers push
through chaos to get to the good stuff, the more they revise. The
more writers revise, whether that be the keystrokes they sweat in
front of a blinking, demanding cursor or the unofficial revising they
do in our heads when they're showering or driving or running,
the more the ideal reader becomes a part of their craft and muscle
memory, of who they are as writers, so at some point they may not
know where the writing stops and the revision begins.

    Because writing and revision are impossible to untangle, revi-
sion is just as situational and interpretive as writing. In other
words, writers interact with readers--writing and revision are
social, responsive, and communal. Take Martin Luther King, Jr.'s "I
106 Bad Ideas

Have a Dream" speech. King gave a rough draft of the most famous
American speech of the 20th century to 1,800 people crammed
into a gymnasium in Rocky Mount, North Carolina, in November
of 1962. Seven months later, King gave another revision of the
speech to a gathering of political and spiritual leaders, musicians,
and activists in Detroit. In August of 1963, in front of the Lincoln
Memorial, King riffed and reworked and rebuilt what he preached
in Rocky Mount and Detroit, ad-libbing, deleting, and flipping lines.
"I Have a Dream" is what Americans remember today, engraved in
our collective memories, archives, and textbooks as symbols of an
entire era, but King's famous refrain singing his vision for a less
racially divided country was not even part of his speech's official
text that day. Was King writing a new speech? Was he done with
the Rocky Mount or Detroit one? "I Have a Dream" was not one
speech, but many, written and re-written. King was not content
to let his words sit, but like any practiced writer working out his
muscles, he revised and riffed, adapting it for new audiences and
purposes.

Revision: Alive and Kicking

     All this revision talk could lead to the counterargument that
revision is a death spiral, a way of shoving off the potential critique
of a finished draft forever. Tinkering is something we think of as
quaint, but not very efficient. Writers can always make the excuse
that something is a work-in-progress, that they just don't have time
for all this revision today. But this critique echoes the point that
writing is social and responsive to its readers. Writing is almost
always meant to be read and responded to, not hoarded away. A
recent large-scale study by Paul Anderson, Chris Anson, and other
writing researchers supports the idea that specific interventions in
the writing process matter more in learning to write rather than
how much students are writing. Among these useful interventions
are participation in a lively revision culture and an interactive and
social writing process such as talking over drafts--soliciting feed-
back from instructors and classmates. Extending the modern defi-
nition of writing more broadly to composing in any medium, revi-
sion is as bound to writing as breathing is to living. If anything,
humans are doing more writing and revision today. Sure, there are
people who call themselves writers and mean that it is part of their
formal job title. But then there are the greater numbers of us who
are writers but don't label ourselves as such, the millions of us just
noodling around on Facebook or Snapchat or Instagram. Facebook

and Instagram have an edit feature on posts. Google Docs includes
a revision history tool. When we send a text and our buzzy little
e-devices kick in with Autocorrect, changing Linkin Park to Kinky
Park, we compensate with frantic asterisks. We edit our comments
or return to clarify them; we cannot resist. Revision as writing is
an idea that we should not abandon or trash. And it may not even
be possible to.

THE MORE WRITING PROCESS,
THE BETTER

    Jimmy Butts

                "If you spend too much time thinking about a thing,
                                     you'll never get it done."--Bruce Lee

    Everyone has a writing process. And writing, like anything,
takes time. But for quite a while--much too long--writers have
increasingly embraced a specific and drawn out model for the writ-
ing process, which generally refers to five sure-fire steps: prewrit-
ing, drafting, editing, revising, and eventually--if one can muster
the endurance to get through each of those earlier stages--publish-
ing. As we have increasingly valued this writing process, we have
moved further away from valuing writing itself as a wonderful,
finished thing that humans can produce, that is, actually get done.

    In other words, we have so fetishized the creative process that
we've forgotten what we can actually create: words strung out into
beautiful constellations. The obsession with the writing process
rather than seeing writing as a completed product is an increas-
ingly problematic psychological perspective as we increase the
speed of production in the 21st century. Beleaguered revision has
become the norm. When any view becomes that dominant, it is
important to consider revising it. I am worried that we are taking
too much time to write. And time is our most important non-re-
newable resource.

    Meanwhile, well-meaning teachers all over still have color-
ful little posters up in their rooms with those classic five steps
borrowed from some fairly dated views on what writing involves.
We often do the various steps of the writing process while we write,
of course--just not necessarily in the prescriptive order outlined
by this slightly archaic structure. Writing is more complex than
110 Bad Ideas

a five-step program. These steps come from a time when people
typed on charming things called typewriters. Hannah Sullivan
blames the introduction of the typewriter along with Modernism's
aim to present an ideal text for our current obsession with punctil-
ious editing in her book The Work of Revision. There, Sullivan warns
that "revision can go too far." The technological shift in what writ-
ing involves plays a big part in how we view writing--as process
or product. For many, the writing process involves checking social
media accounts for something like three days. In an age of mass
distraction, it is perhaps increasingly important to see our writ-
ing finished, or it will increasingly become our collective pipe-
dream--a thing that we desire to do but never realize. (Indeed, in
much online writing, posts end up being fluid iterations, but read-
able published iterations nonetheless.)

     Perhaps we should drop writing as a verb and see it more and
more as a noun--the thing that writing is. Writing is no longer
merely a thing we do hunched over for hours, but a thing we make,
and increasingly quickly. This view, then, attempts to pull the rug
out from under process stances from the mid-20th century to the
present--embracing instead what might be called a hyperproduct
perspective on writing for the fastest century yet.

     The process theory of composition arose with a handful of
well-meaning thinkers in the 1960s and 70s. There is a bit of
history here about how we got ourselves into an idolatry of a slow
process theory of writing. Before the middle of the 20th century,
the general theories about writing in schools encouraged finish-
ing products--things like writing themes for English classes. This
view is now generally known as current-traditional rhetoric. It was
the kind of schooling that we might think of when we think of
rulers rapping student's knuckles to finish their work. An alternate
model that valued expressivism of creative and unruly thought and
the process of writing--and not the product--grew fairly common
as a backlash.

     Donald Murray and Peter Elbow in particular--those good,
friendly, inspiring kinds of writing teachers--advocated seeing
"writing as a process, not a product." Many embraced a kind of
slower process in the teaching of writing that resisted the kind of
production-line expectation of written work that can sometimes
arise along with a lot of anxiety. All of this was good. It was a valu-
ing of the human as a writer, but it began--I suspect--to devalue
the written work. As such, an era embracing endless drafting,
tinkering, and reworking ad infinitum began.
                                                     About Who Good Writers Are 111

    The Council of Writing Program Administrators, an organi-
zation that thinks about how writing works especially on college
campuses, claims that one of the primary outcomes in learning to
become a writer is to understand writing as a process. The coun-
cil states this goal in this way: "Writers use multiple strategies,
or composing processes, to conceptualize, develop, and finalize proj-
ects." To their credit, the objective is stated in a loose way to accept
multiple approaches to writing and flexibility and recursivity in the
processes that we develop as writers.

    We love tinkering. We love delaying that finished, polished
draft. But we must complete work. Otherwise, I think we relegate
that work--the work of writing--to something less valuable. We
blush at the fact that we scramble to complete drafts up to the
moment before they're due. Here, now, we might embrace that
kind of breakneck pace--the work finished in the wee hours of
the morning. Meanwhile, process has been critiqued since at least
the early 1990s through a set of frameworks called post-process
theory. Still, process haunts us. Most post-process critiques of the
process formula suggest that a process view is invalid by merely
embracing more complex, unknowable processes.

    Of course, the idea of following a formula to write a perfect
draft is a false construction. We write for specific situations,
each unique. A certain set of cognitive steps are involved in writ-
ing anything--from academic papers to tweets; however, the set
of steps used to compose one thing isn't necessarily a learnable
and reproducible set of steps. We cannot follow a writing process,
because writing is messier than that. Instead, then, revision and
process become excuses on the part of writers who have taken a
bit too long to finish writing projects, never ending or complet-
ing compositional tasks. Holding to dying process-based views,
endlessly reworking drafts never to completion, does a disservice
to writers who are seeking to make good, new things fast.

    We don't often meticulously revise text messages. The written
code of iOS 11 revises iOS 10. Each iteration becomes a potential
improvement, but always as a valuable--and evaluable--product.
In economic perspectives, revision is worthless unless it creates
iterations of value. How we view process essentially depends on
how much time we spend creating a thing. Is there a process to
composing a tweet? Sure. But is there much editing, revision,
recursive work? Not anymore.

    It is finally time to explore an alternative to our obsession over
the writing process in favor of a return to a healthy appreciation
112 Bad Ideas

of finished drafts--of writing itself. Our culture really does value
finished work. The exploratory work done in prewriting is harder
to appreciate. And while a concern with overvaluing product is
understandable, we should reclaim our writing--those satisfying
finished pieces that do what we intend. If we don't value writing,
then we can, of course, relegate it to something we endlessly defer
by thinking about it. Making writing achievable and real is the goal.

     The outcome of a written product is quite important. While
how writing gets done (process) may not be able to be demysti-
fied, we might be better able to see writing as a thing we make
(product). The process of writing is insignificant, unimportant,
and immaterial when the product of writing is really good. The
thing is what matters. And more than that, regularly finishing writ-
ten work makes one a writer. Writers must find their own ways of
completing all kinds of writing in their normal, everyday lives. But
completed writing is really what we're after--not worthless drafts.
Those drafts can be bad, and shaky, and loathsome. (They some-
times are!) But they must be finished.

     This perspective asks us to write and write a lot, but also to
finish and publish wherever we can happily find a space for our
work. I think that this view also invites us to stop dilly-dallying,
and saying that we are writers when we are sometimes not acting
like it and to accept our successes along with our failures. For if
we are to write things for the world, then some of it may not be
perfect, but it will be completed and made public.

     Of course, a hyperproduct view of writing is similar to a view
sometimes espoused by hundreds of pithy productivity websites--
the kind one might read when being unproductive. However, a
strong product-based view of writing values the writing as well as
what the writer can do. Famous portrait painter Chuck Close has
this wonderful line: "Inspiration is for amateurs, I get to work."
Mark Twain and Maya Angelou, among others, notoriously hated
the editing process. There are probably more quotations valu-
ing revision from famous writers than not, coming from a natu-
ral tendency, which is why this line of thought is so heretical and
necessary. Like any creative practice, it is easy to make writing a
ponderous sort of artistic practice. And it should involve a bit of
pondering and playful exploration, but it cannot stay there. The
tension between process and product involves a shift in how we
think about time. There is a well-known anecdote about Oscar
Wilde confessing that he spent all morning taking out a comma,
and all afternoon putting it back. This decadent view of the writing
                                                     About Who Good Writers Are 113

process simply isn't where we are as a culture. It's like spending all
day manicuring your nails. Arrant pedantry!

    And it is vanity. Time is a luxury. Revising too much can be
unethical--a waste. There are diapers to be changed. More than
that: People are dying. You are dying. And you need to write as
though your next piece could be your last.

    For better and worse, we value getting things done. Doing stuff.
Making stuff. With words, in our particular case. When we make
written work, we fall in line with other productive professions:
farmers, smiths, tailors, cobblers, artisans. Writing was analo-
gous to building for the Romans. In this view, writing is construc-
tion, but thinking about writing is never arriving at what we might
create. Our trade is sentences--complete ones generally. Perhaps
we fear finishing drafts because we're afraid they will fail. We writ-
ers might nail Nike's maxim to our walls: Just do it.

    This approach is not the soft handholding of Donald Murray.
We should clean the sludgy snailtrail of slow, process-oriented writ-
ing that is reminiscent of the Mac Beach Ball of Doom, endlessly
spinning. We owe it to the work of writing. We owe it to ourselves.
In this view, we say write something next week. And the next!
Write all the time. Don't waste another second. Love deadlines.
Eliminate distractions. Get it done. Now, go. Do.

obsession with getting things done, while Getting Things Done by

lines. And finally, perhaps the most in-depth study of our histori-

BAD IDEAS ABOUT
STYLE, USAGE, AND GRAMMAR
STRUNK AND WHITE SET THE
STANDARD

    Laura Lisabeth

    The Elements of Style, by William Strunk, Jr. and E. B. White, is
well loved by many writers and teachers as the ultimate reference
book on Standard English. Ask any writer or editor, and they are
likely to have one of its four editions on their bookshelves or will
remember it from some phase of their education. A recent survey
of over a million college syllabi showed that The Elements of Style is
the number one, most-assigned book in English-speaking coun-
tries and is also listed in the top ten assigned texts for almost every
discipline. It is difficult to imagine that a book this popular with
college professors and currently ranked first in sales on four differ-
ent Amazon lists originated as a 43-page, self-published pamphlet
a century ago.

    Strunk first assigned The Elements of Style as a handbook of punc-
tuation and usage in his advanced composition class at Cornell
University in 1918. The popular writer E. B. White (who had been
Strunk's student in 1920), along with the Macmillan Publishing
Company, turned Strunk's pamphlet into a slightly longer version
and published it in 1959. It included minor updates of Strunk's
original portion and a new chapter on style, introducing White's
signature essayistic voice into the book. Based largely on White's
reputation as a prolific writer of short pieces for Harper's and The
New Yorker, The Elements of Style immediately became associated with
a tradition of the best English language: grammatically correct,
tasteful, clear, and organized prose.

    But even in 1959, The Elements of Style was greeted with criticism
by the field of college composition for being vague and misleading
about the complex act of learning to compose academic writing. Its
current appearance on so many course syllabi across the disciplines
118 Bad Ideas

suggests a persistent dissatisfaction teachers have with the quality
of student writing coupled with the misguided belief that one writ-
ing handbook can solve the problem. But more importantly, the
kind of writing Strunk and White put forth as good writing is in
fact a discourse that limits and excludes, not reflecting the valuable
ways English is practiced in local and digital contexts and by a vari-
ety of writers from different language traditions. Insistence on the
kind of English constructed by The Elements of Style is uninformed at
best and, as I will show, unethical and racist at worst.

      The genre to which The Elements of Style belongs--the writing
handbook--is rooted in the mid-19th- century handbook of conver-
sation, a type of etiquette guide. Conversation handbooks became
wildly popular when the prevailing cultural structure in pre-Civil
War America was shifting power from an inherited social hierarchy
to a larger self-made middle class. Guides to gentility were an aid to
self-propelled social mobility and included elaborate rules for every
kind of behavior imaginable, including a standard language usage
that marked a speaker or writer as both apart from the socially infe-
rior and fit for engaging with society's elite people.

     When Strunk and White's style of English is prescribed as the
dominant discourse taught in schools and used in other autho-
rized places, it marginalizes the identities, knowledge, and being
of many people who come from other literacy practices. Literacy is
always attached to the deep ways of knowing embedded in language
practices that are localized to different cultures. An individual's
cultural or racial identity is often closely linked to specific language
practices that are not recognized in school where anything outside
of Standard English is framed as error. This connection points to
the fact that all literacies, Standard Academic English included, are
not neutral but are ideological--always structuring social power
as measured against themselves. Believing the Strunk and White
style to be the best way to write suggests that Standard Academic
English is a neutral transcription system for a universal reality and,
therefore, a universal good. But, in fact, as literacy researchers
argue, the English language cannot be understood apart from the
many contexts in which it is embedded: home, school, workplaces,
and social groups. It is not something fixed and unchanging, as the
age and minimally revised text of The Elements of Style might suggest.
Sociolinguists point to the ways English is already operating as
a flexible medium, repurposed by American users to include, for
example, Black and Latinx variations and the language and punc-
tuation of social media, all of which expand the expressiveness of
                                                About Style, Usage, and Grammar 119

English and make it relevant to more users. These culturally and
linguistically inflected ways of using English help people negotiate
the identities and knowledges inherent in all the contexts in which
people use language. Access to such uses of language can help
many emerging academic writers to develop more competence and
to perform better in school as they capitalize on existing meaning-
ful ways of expressing knowledge.

    Paradoxically, despite the public's positive associations with
prescriptive English as defined in The Elements of Style, the discourse
has often been called into question by educational leaders who
denounce its ineffectiveness in the teaching of writing as well as
question the ethics of insisting on its use in a diverse and demo-
cratic society. As far back as 1932, the National Council of Teachers
of English (NCTE) published a survey of American cultivated
English usage showing that the well-educated group of adults who
responded rarely abided by the strict usage rules of writing hand-
books. At the time, NCTE president Ruth Weeks predicted that
the survey's findings revealing a democratization of language in
the world outside school would prove that writing handbooks like
The Elements of Style were useless and that American students were
being unfairly judged by a classed and arbitrary set of standards
for their writing. In 1974, the NCTE published a more monu-
mental statement against the continued educational emphasis on
Standard English usage. "Students' Right to Their Own Language"
holds that teachers of writing must respect the languages students
bring with them to school, claiming "[L]anguage scholars long
ago denied that the myth of a standard American dialect has any
validity."

    One way to begin dismantling Strunk and White's bad idea
about writing is by understanding Standard Academic English as
a historically formed, culturally specific language among many
other languages. Reframe the notion of academic writing as a fixed,
unchanging, and neutral discourse; think of it instead as a flexi-
ble toolkit of language practices that change with the user and the
context. Many other literacies that could never conform to a Strunk
and White standard continue to enrich ideas of what counts as good
writing. With the unfolding of new media language practices, digi-
tal literacies are emerging to enable writers to compose discourse
beyond anything Strunk and White could have imagined. These
networked ways of writing, along with social-media inspired ways
of thinking about punctuation, continue to explode definitions for
what constitutes meaningful language and educated English.

     For further reading on the ideologies of Standard English and
the social situatedness of literacy, see Shirley Brice Heath's Ways
With Words (Cambridge University), Brian Street's Literacy in Theory
and Practice (Cambridge University), and James Paul Gee's Social
Linguistics and Literacies: Ideologies In Discourses (Routledge). Heath's
ethnography of two working class towns--one white and one
African American--critiques what she calls the autonomous model of
literacy, often prevalent in schools, which treats Standard English
as a neutral discourse, free of ideology. Gee argues that to under-
stand literacy we must consider the social context in which that
literacy takes place.

     There are several good books and articles that interrogate
specific values of Standard English. Richard Ohmann's "Use Definite
Specific Concrete Language" (College English) and Ian Barnard's
Upsetting Composition Commonplaces (Utah State University) discuss
the ideology implied in the concept of clarity, arguing that this
value in writing forecloses the complex language necessary for
critical inquiry of social conditions. Richard Lanham's books Style:
An Anti-Textbook (Paul Dry Books) and Revising Prose (Continuum)
point to the clarity-brevity-sincerity approach to writing as limiting

GOOD WRITERS ALWAYS FOLLOW
MY RULES

    Monique Dufour and Jennifer Ahern-Dodson

    What is good writing? And how does good writing get writ-
ten? In the first question, writing is a noun--a product made of
elements such as words, sentences, and paragraphs. In the second
question, writing is a verb--a process by which we create these
texts.

    Wisdom about writing--as a product and as a process--is often
expressed as hard and fast rules. Always begin an essay with a
catchy hook. Never use the passive voice. Always make your writ-
ing flow. Always make a detailed outline before you start to write.
Never edit as you draft.

    People espouse unambiguous rules about writing for many
good reasons. Writing is a notoriously challenging, complex, even
mysterious skill; nevertheless, we are expected to learn it and to do
it well throughout our lives. And there is often much at stake when
we write. We create texts to persuade others about all manner of
significant things: the best course of action, our qualifications for
a job, the quality of our ideas, and even the content of our charac-
ters. Do we seem smart and capable? Are our claims true and fair?
Will things turn out as we wish? With these questions at stake,
why wouldn't we want to discover and use foolproof writing tech-
niques? Adhering to clear-cut do's and don'ts could cut through
the ambiguity and difficulty of writing, and of making judgments
about the quality of texts. So let's identify the rules for good writ-
ing, state them unequivocally, and learn to write effectively for
once and for all.

    The trouble is: An unwavering rule-driven approach to writ-
ing often causes more difficulties than it solves. First, there is an
important distinction between rules and techniques. Simply put,
122 Bad Ideas

techniques are ways of doing things. For instance, one can approach
the writing process as a sequence of steps that should follow a
strict order: Have and refine an idea, conduct all the research, write
a complete draft from the beginning to the end, revise the draft,
edit it, and let it go. The writer completes each step in the process
before moving on to the next. (Writing assignments in school are
commonly structured this way.) This linear approach to the writ-
ing process is a useful technique that works under many circum-
stances. But it's not the only way to approach the writing process,
and it doesn't work especially well for some tasks. Still, for many
writers, it has calcified into a hard and fast rule. This good option
becomes the only option.

     But good options may not work under every circumstance.
Thus, when writers treat options as rules, writing can actually
become more frustrating because the writer insists on abiding by
the rule, whether it works or not. For example, that linear model of the
writing process can be very effective--it might work for a writer for
virtually every email, report, and research project she writes, year
after year. Until it doesn't. Perhaps she's writing a long, complex
project such as a dissertation or a book. Suddenly, she will likely
need to revise her prose and her ideas, continue her research, and
incorporate feedback throughout the process. She might write the
introduction last. She may need to write parts without knowing
where everything is leading. In short, she may need to abandon the
belief that writing must proceed through clearly delineated, linear
steps. It's not that the linear model of the writing process never
works. The problem arises when a writer treats it as a rule. And
it's especially frustrating because writers think they are being good
and doing the right thing by following the rules, only to find that
those rules more often impede their progress than enable it.

     As writing consultants for faculty instructors, we have witnessed
many smart, capable teachers who were undermined rather than
helped by their own staunch rules about the writing process. They
believed unequivocally that they could only write when they had
big blocks of uninterrupted time. Or that they should never share
unpolished, messy works-in-progress. Or that they could only work
on one project at a time. Of course, most faculty writers simply
don't routinely enjoy big blocks of uninterrupted time. They likely
need to write in smaller windows of time--30 minutes here, an
hour there--between their administrative, mentoring, and teach-
ing responsibilities (not to mention their lives). They could learn
to create time machines, or they could change their rules about the
                                                About Style, Usage, and Grammar 123

writing process and learn techniques that allow them to write in
the time they have. Similarly, writers who refuse to share unpol-
ished or partial works-in-progress for feedback from trusted read-
ers often end up wasting their precious writing time in the effort
to advance a project alone. We have seen faculty members end up
feeling like bad writers in the midst of personal failure, when in
fact they are simply making the mistake of treating a technique as
a rule.

    Rule-driven writing instruction may intend to make writing
easier, but it often undermines the very skills it is designed to foster.
For instance, many undergraduate writers have been taught that
they must create a detailed outline for a research paper before they
begin writing. And they are often told that a first draft of a research
paper must be presented in polished, error-free prose, and that the
draft must be complete, from beginning to end. In fact, we know
many teachers who refuse outright to read messy or incomplete
works-in-progress. So, students put extensive effort into planning
just how the essay will proceed and what it will say before they
write. And they spend time carefully polishing prose in a first draft.
Of course, outlining can be a powerful conceptual and organiza-
tional tool. However, when writers believe that they must outline
first, they often lock themselves into the ideas as expressed on the
outline, rather than allowing their ideas to develop and change as
they work. Writers who always create detailed outlines and who
write very polished preliminary drafts also tend to resist revision,
because they have already committed a great deal of upfront effort
on their initial plans and prose. By treating the linear model of the
writing process as a rule, teachers can create writers who don't
want to and don't know how to revise as a powerful part of think-
ing and writing.

    We propose another way. Think of good writing as the thought-
ful use of an evolving repertoire, rather than adherence to a static
list of commandments. In order to become a skillful writer, one
discovers and experiments with a range of techniques. A writer
draws upon this repertoire to meet the needs of the project, the
ideas at hand, and the rhetorical situation. As one's repertoire
grows, and as one becomes practiced in drawing upon it, one can
grow more confident about overcoming difficulties, taking up chal-
lenges, and expressing one's ideas effectively. Ultimately, writers
become skillful when they are willing to assess and reassess the
quality of any idea about writing in terms of its effectiveness in
their own experiences.
124 Bad Ideas

     People will continue to present useful techniques as though they
are divine laws. However, we suggest that writers mentally trans-
late rules into suggestions and what if questions. Take, for example,
the common advice to always begin an essay with a catchy hook.
Catchy hooks such as apt, vivid anecdotes can be used to excellent
effect, if they meet the needs of the text and the circumstances. A
writer can try it out and see what happens. What effect does it have
on the text? Does it meet the audience's and context's needs (i.e.,
the rhetorical situation)? Does it contribute to expressing what the
writer is trying to say? How do real readers respond? In this way,
writers can experiment with techniques, deliberate about their
implications, and make judgments about the best course of action
among their options. And, most importantly, writers focus their
goals and purposes, rather than on the rote adherence to rules,
which is more meaningful, and more fun.

     To be clear: We are not suggesting that there are no rules and
that rules don't matter. Without adherence to conventions of
grammar and usage, for instance, many readers may misunder-
stand a writer's point or not take them seriously. However, writers
are ultimately undermined by a thoroughgoing rule-bound mental-
ity. First, if writing is simply a matter of following rules and plug-
ging in formulas, it's boring to most people. Second, in writing,
problems are normal. When we think of writing as an opportu-
nity to use and develop our repertoires to make and express mean-
ing, writers can define the problems and needs before them and
draw on their resources to solve them with creativity and aplomb.
Perhaps we don't have as much uninterrupted time to write as we
once did. We cannot create more time where there is none, but we
can learn to write in the time we have. Perhaps our longer, more
complex ideas cannot be crammed into a five-paragraph theme. We
can learn new ways of organizing an essay to express an ambiguous
claim. We don't need to stop writing when the rules don't work.
And, we don't need to read and judge one another's writing only
in terms of our own strictures. When we acknowledge that many
of our rules are in fact techniques, and when we understand that
writing is the skillful use of evolving repertoires, we can focus on
expressing ideas worth sharing and become the kind of readers and
writers who are in a position to listen.

126 Bad Ideas

WRITERS MUST DEVELOP
A STRONG, ORIGINAL VOICE

    Patrick Thomas

     One of the most common pieces of advice to writers (old and
new) is that they must spend time cultivating their voice. Far less
common are pieces of advice for actually doing this work. Should
writers spend months in search of an original topic, researching,
and developing brilliant new subjects to write about? Such work
seems particularly difficult in an era of excessive information. Or
should writers journey on their own, Elizabeth Gilbert-style, eating,
praying, and loving their way around the globe? This kind of jour-
ney, while glamorous, seems as extreme as it would be expensive.

     Part of the reason advice about developing one's authorial voice
is scant is because the concept of voice usually implies some intrin-
sic characteristic of the author herself. With such a fuzzy defini-
tion, instructive advice about developing one's voice instead gets
conflated with two other aspects of good writing: point of view, or
the writer's perspective on a topic; and figurative language, the use
of descriptive devices.

     Why, then, does the idea of the author's voice have such stay-
ing power in discussions of good writing? For one thing, voice is
a concept that reflects the long-held belief that writing developed
from spoken language and that, over time, writing became a substi-
tute for speech. However, recent research from fields of archaeol-
ogy and art history suggests that this is not the case: Writing devel-
oped not from speech but out of a need to represent numbers in
the increasingly complex, economic transactions in early cultures
(see, for instance, Denise Schmandt-Besserat's work on the history
of writing).

     Origins aside, writing and speech are two ways of using
language, so many people think it is possible to ascribe similar
                                                About Style, Usage, and Grammar 127

characteristics to each and, in turn, to conceptualize writing in
terms of speech. Further, since writing and speech are conceptual-
ized in terms of rhetorical practices--that is, the uses of language
as a means of creating knowledge and effectively communicating
that knowledge--applying verbal qualities of speech to writing
provides a kind of shorthand for thinking and talking about writ-
ing. That shorthand also prevents us from thinking and talking
about writing as its own form of communication. And the author's
voice represents one important limitation of thinking about writ-
ing in terms of speech.

    No writing happens in a vacuum. Writing, as a communica-
tive activity, is made for an audience of readers. In practice, how
readers interpret writing has far less to do with passive decoding
or reception of a message developed by someone else. Reading is
itself a constructive act--quite literally, reading is meaning making.
From the perspective of the reader, then, being a part of an audi-
ence has power. Much of that power lies in the ways readers infer
an author's voice into a text.

    Suppose, for example, that you receive a love letter. You would
likely interpret this letter differently depending on what you know
about its author. If the love letter comes from your spouse, signifi-
cant other, or paramour, you might cobble together memories of the
author's familiar expressions, knowledge of the author's manners
of language use, and even particular moments in the history of
your relationship that imbue your reading of the letter with what
you think the author's motives are. On the other hand, if your
love letter is written by a secret admirer, you might find the whole
notion of this letter awkward, flattering, intriguing, or intrusive.
With this unknown author, you have less to go on to determine
what the letter means, and with the knowledge you're lacking, the
author's voice is distant, even inappropriate.

    Regardless of your letter's author, it is important to remember
that all of the conjecture about the author that goes on happens
in the mind of the reader. It has little to do with the author or her
voice at all. Using the author's words, the reader weaves together
an interpretation based on the reader's own previous experience
with those words, with similar genres or situations, or her own
priorities for the text.

    Where, then, is the author's voice?
    From the perspective of an author, an audience is always an
approximation, or, as Walter Ong called it, a fiction. When an
author writes, she anticipates when, how, and why an audience
128 Bad Ideas

might use her text, but this is always a best guess, something in
between what the author imagines and what actually happens
when real people read her writing. In the same way, when a reader
encounters a piece of writing, the author's voice is always a fabri-
cation--a fiction--in the mind of the reader.

     This is hardly a groundbreaking observation; after all, fifty years
ago Roland Barthes declared that "the birth of the reader must be
at the cost of the death of the Author." Barthes's "The Death of
the Author" holds particular importance for revising contemporary
myths about the author's voice; specifically, it brings into stronger
relief the fact that any rendering of the author's voice rests solely
in the ways a reader encounters a text, and what the reader pays
attention to while reading. In other words, any voice of a text is
contingent upon the particular ways a reader might apply empha-
sis to certain ideas, prioritize certain linguistic devices, and make
inferences about an author's motives, intents, or aims--all at the
expense of other ideas, devices, or aims.

     Recognizing that an author's voice is a characteristic created
by the reader, the concept and efforts to develop it occupy a less
prominent role in the development of writing ability than writing
teachers commonly give it credit for. On the other hand, letting go
of the myth of the author's voice allows for a number of possibili-
ties that help writers develop their work.

     First, letting go of this myth de-mystifies the practice of writ-
ing. Prioritizing voice stifles necessary kinds of invention practices
needed to produce writing in the first place, because the priority
of authenticity or unique ability over content makes writers edit
themselves before they've even started writing. Recognizing, too,
that writing is audience-driven helps to make the work of writing
more manageable.

     Second, de-bunking the myth of the author's voice helps to
remove the stale notion that writing is some kind of divined gift,
talent, or genetic trait that some people have and others do not.
Removing this obstacle to writing helps people see writing as not
only important to their lives, but also an ability that is learnable,
teachable, and can grow with practice.

     Third, laying bare the myth of the author's voice draws atten-
tion to aspects of good writing that reflect what readers want and
need. Specifically we come to recognize that aspects of writing we
claim to value--like originality, authenticity, or sheer cleverness--
are perhaps less important than more practical issues like the abil-
ity to make and support a claim, the ability to select and ethically
                                                About Style, Usage, and Grammar 129

represent evidence and experience, or the ability to write in a way
that readers might recognize as important.

    Fourth, removing the myth of the author's voice helps to provide
a larger, more cumulative picture of how writing functions in the
world. Scholars call this intertextuality--the ways writing emerges
from, builds on, responds to, acts upon, and provides for other
writing. Removing writing from the constraints of a single author's
voice helps to trace how writing circulates and brings about the
production of more writing and to show how writing is employed
in all facets of life.

    Finally, relieving ourselves of the myth of the author's voice
empowers readers to consider the ways their own abilities to make
meaning have an impact on the subjects they care about. It also
provides a way to explain how multiple, even competing interpre-
tations of a text can be developed through careful, critical reading
practices. This is, in the end, what authors really want from read-
ers: to engage in dialogue about the knowledge they make through
the practices of writing and reading.

    What's lost by letting go of the myth of the author's voice? Not
much--except, perhaps, a clumsy metaphor that gets in the way
of more accurate descriptions of a reader's response. Conversely,
letting go of the author's voice turns writers' and writing teachers'
attention toward more important aspects of learning to write. It
allows writers to move beyond what Linda Flower calls writer-based
prose--in which the primary concern is the author's own ideas and
expression of those ideas--to reader-based prose, in which the audi-
ence's needs take priority. It re-focuses the analysis of production
of writing toward what authors can help readers to think about,
understand, feel, and believe. In short, letting go of the author's
voice makes room to envision the nature and function of writing
more accurately--not as a series of individual disruptions, but as a
continual integration of knowledge and a way of making sense of
the world.

LEAVE YOURSELF OUT OF YOUR
WRITING

    Rodrigo Joseph Rodríguez

                 "You're also two people, writer and reader. This is a
                                tremendous asset."--Verlyn Klinkenborg

    Leave yourself out of your writing is a belief that must die. This
myth both hinders and undermines deeper learning and thinking
in the lives of writers, readers, thinkers, and students. It can be
interpreted in various ways that range from removing the personal
point of view in a document to altogether distancing oneself from
the subject and interest that was once held for a topic or concept
worthy of writing for an audience. With one's self removed, the
writer is partly absent from the page and conversation. Common
lore based around assignments and research papers creates this
stance of effacing the writer and essentially one's being. The
opposite is true for writing: The writer needs to be present and
breathing on the print or digital page. To make meaning through
language, the writer must be present to the audience and mindful
of beliefs to produce coherent, meaningful, and engaging writing
for the reader. Writing in 1914, Spanish philosopher José Ortega y
Gasset asserted, "I am I and my circumstance; and, if I do not save
it, I do not save myself."

         The act of writing is influenced by the writing beliefs learned,
adopted, and now followed as a habit in practice to record, or save,
our selfhood. In fact, the influence upon our form of expression
may have been a teacher, another writer, and even a rule maker.
Some of these writing beliefs can become pitfalls, or bad ideas,
if reflection is missing from our practice. If there is a connection
early on in the writing between the subject and writer, then the
arguments, observations, and truths presented to the reader can
132 Bad Ideas

hold more attention for the audience. By being told to leave your-
self out of your writing, the writer is not building a publicly recog-
nized voice with confidence and a level of expertise that builds
trust with an audience. The false conception that the writer must
be removed or, even worse, nearly dead to one's audience is anath-
ema. Sometimes, this bad idea is promoted under the assumption
that to maintain objectivity the writer must be absent and avoid
using the pronoun I. Thus, the first-person point of view is miss-
ing. Nonetheless, those who write need to have a presence, and,
as Toni Morrison wrote, an I/eye for credibility and connection
between writer and reader. The audience is counting on the writer
to deliver by being committed and present in the writing.

         Why must you leave yourself out of your writing? Why and
how? Writers adapt to writing conditions and circumstances, and
their adaptation has responsibilities and consequences, too. One of
the adaptations includes writing the self in communications instead
of gradual disembodiment or complete separation. By being pres-
ent in one's writing as one writes, the writer is creating conditions
for the reader to better understand a topic as well as the concepts
that drive learning and understanding. The writer achieves this
by: (1) writing sentences that establish who the writer is through
the pronoun I, (2) revealing the purpose and interest for writing
about the topic, (3) stating the argument that holds the content
together in the first place, and (4) providing evidence and concepts
for the argumentative position or exploratory topic. Klinkenborg
describes the reader and writer, who are in a kind of union, as a
"tremendous asset" that comes to fruition through language and
form. The self is significant in the act of writing to make mean-
ing, present an argument, and come into existence on the page. To
repress or remove the self from one's writing is counterproductive
for the writer's purpose.

         Sandra Cisneros explains, "As a writer, I continue to analyze
and reflect on the power words have over me." Cisneros's state-
ment may resonate with emerging writers in classrooms, outside
of classrooms, and spaces of their own making to write and create
with language. Writers affirm their lives and empower the lives of
others who connect with their words and concepts. The first-per-
son point of view is an essential marker in the making of mean-
ing for both the writer and reader and need not be abandoned nor
silenced. Even if the self is briefly mentioned and noted in one's
written deliberations, its use will suffice in making oneself known
and present in the discussion of ideas, concepts, and perspectives.
                                                About Style, Usage, and Grammar 133

One learns about oneself as one writes and by asserting the self.
Indeed, words and literacies carve the identities of writers who are
influenced by the societies they inhabit and the subjects they study.
In essence, words empower and define us as Cisneros observes.

         Some writers across the disciplines, which include the arts,
education, engineering, mathematics, technology, and sciences,
attempt in various cloaked forms to remove their sense of self as
they write under the assumption that writing must be as univer-
sal as possible. Unfortunately, this means less personality and
presence. This is done in detrimental forms if the writer fails to
acknowledge purpose, actions, and influences to an audience.
Furthermore, writers and thinkers are connected to their subjects
and arguments, which they deem worthy of explanation or descrip-
tion. As such, writers learn about themselves through their writ-
ing and the interconnectedness to thought and argument. In fact,
writers give authority and credibility to experience through their
expertise and in structure and argument. The reader entrusts the
writer's self not only by the levels of expertise for having done
the labor and research, but also by the valuable experiences drawn
from analysis. In short, it is a false idea to eliminate one's first-per-
son point of view in writing, rather than supporting the writer's
personal and communicative voice on the print and digital page.

         Admittedly, writing is an act of free will that calls for the
writer to be present with voice while deliberating through language
with ideas, concepts, and perspectives for understanding. The new
rule to adopt is as follows: Speak up and be present and known in your
writing! This can be implemented by valuing your own self-as-
writer and by answering the following calls for the writer to be
present and alive: (1) As a writer, how will I help the readers know
what they will be learning through my writing purpose and human
presence? (2) In which ways can I hook and engage the readers?
(3) Which experiences and skills do I possess that can deepen
understanding through my writing? (4) How can I encourage read-
ers to rethink or reimagine what they may already know through
reflection and action? (5) What order of my ideas and concepts will
be most optimal for reader understanding? In sum, reliance upon
oneself and one's writing are essential in developing a writing life
and an audience. Make your writing and thinking audible on the
print and digital page for two: the writer and reader.
134 Bad Ideas

RESPONSE: NEVER USE "I"

    Kimberly N. Parker

     The writer is present everywhere on the page. Ultimately, the
writer cannot run and hide when thoughts are penned or typed for
an intended audience. For instance, when my high-school sopho-
more student-writers read over the options for their first writing
assignment--one that I attempt to make inviting and acts to give
me insight into their current abilities--they know a few writing
truths already.

     The first truth they reveal is that all writing must be confined
to five paragraphs. Soon, the second truth is revealed. Frankly, it
seems paramount and antithetical as they share it in their words:
Writers can never write using the first person. EVER! To use I
conjures up all types of angst that--compounded with a nearly
universal dislike of analytical writing--makes for a difficult begin-
ning between writers and their writing coach. Thus, in my four-
teen years with young people in secondary English language arts
classrooms and in my writer identity and role, what I value is the
importance of helping young people understand who they are as
writers and guiding them to use writing as a creative source for
liberation. For these endeavors, it is imperative that they bring all
of themselves into their writing. This applies to all writers in the
practice of our craft.

     It's worth considering how writers first get chastised and
come to believe they must leave themselves out of their writing in
the first place. When they are just beginning to experiment with
language, most of the writing they are asked to produce draws from
personal experience: They write about their friends, families, and
pets. Personal narrative abounds and overflows within their lines
of writing on the page or on the monitor screen of their computer
or device. Their writing revolves around who they are and what
matters and happens to them.

     Poet Claudia Rankine reminds us: "The world is wrong. You
can't put the past behind you. It's buried in you; it's turned your
flesh into its own cupboard. Not everything is useful but it all
comes from the world to be stored in you." In ideal situations and
in classrooms where standardized testing does not oppress creativ-
ity, students are their writing and voice. When I ask my student
writers when they stopped writing in the first person, they usually
                                                About Style, Usage, and Grammar 135

pinpoint to the beginning of middle school. Many also often mark
this transition as the stage when they ceased to care about writ-
ing with a sense of freedom. Middle school required them to stop
writing about their personal experiences (save the annual poetry
unit) and instead write responses to literature. Since many of my
students are readers and writers in need of revival, they also note
this period of their lives when they began to dislike reading. Full-on
disengagement is the norm once we meet during their sophomore
year. Unfortunately, who they are as writers with ideas about
what they want to write about and what matters to them most
now becomes a distant, shelved memory. Writing can become a
disembodied task they are required to complete, devoid of any joy,
connection, or feeling. Admittedly, as writers they are convinced
they have nothing to say.

    Thus, we spend our semesters together in the attempt to help
writers rewrite their understanding of how to be present and alive
in their writing. Literacy experts Jeff Anderson and Deborah Dean
advise that writers "need options for how to say what they want
to say." We read many models, pulled from all writing genres,
where I query, often (incessantly, they would probably say): (1)
What do we know about this writer? (2) What is he/she doing
that we would like to try? (3) How can this inform or guide our
own writing? Before we can dig into these questions, though, a
student inevitably raises their hand and asks: What? We can use
I? I thought we couldn't do that! There are accompanying head
nods from classmates that lead to the ideal invitation to discuss
why the self matters in everything we write, and why writers bring
themselves to the page and screen in their writing. Otherwise, why
write at all? I ask. Furthermore, why read something that discon-
nects the writer with hardly any care or concern? Again, young
writers can be skeptical of this pushback, since they've perfected
being disconnected from their own writing and human voice. Why
engage on a meaningful level now?

    As writer, teacher, and coach, I invite them to reconsider their
interests in our classroom by conducting a questionnaire survey,
participating in writing conferences, and engaging in workshops to
learn more about what matters to them. I craft assignments that
draw on their interests and require their presence. When I read
their writings, I want to know where they are most present in their
writing and where they can add more presence in their writing. At
this point, I am a motivator and cheerleader for writing one's self,
building on Stephen King's belief that "it's all on the table, and you
136 Bad Ideas

should use anything that improves the quality of your writing and
doesn't get in the way of your story."

     I am trying, they respond. Show me how to do it, they chal-
lenge. I wake up my sleeping computer and project a document
on the board to write before them. I talk and think aloud, argu-
ing sometimes with myself, but always writing, rewriting. They
hear my voice emerging as I write, think. All of my deliberations,
all of my writing surfaces, merges, and projects. They witness
the writing process as messy and imperfect, yet with wondrous
possibilities. Conversely, I make leaps as a writer. I am writing my
own truths before them without self-censorship; I am present as
I write. This is the moment they hook themselves onto some part
of what they're writing: why one cares about a topic with concepts
to explore toward writing one's way, which includes meaning and
understanding.

     In a state of triumph, I read their work and hear them all over
again through their deliberate thoughts that are theirs alone, yet
interconnected to the worlds they enter and exit so freely and
fiercely to write and name themselves through the written word.
They may read their draft aloud to me; I smile in affirmation. We
marvel and discuss the power of writing when writers invite, bring,
and accept themselves into their work.

THE PASSIVE VOICE SHOULD BE
AVOIDED

    Collin Gifford Brooke

    Many of the rules that we find in writing handbooks are
customs or personal preferences that, over time, pass from the
realm of advice to proscription. Some are grounded in the differ-
ences between spoken and written language, whereas others repre-
sent the stylistic or aesthetic tastes of their inventors. While rules
in general may vary with time, place, and genre, the directive that
we should "use the active voice," in the words of Strunk and White,
is so common (and so enthusiastically repeated) that it might as
well be universal. This hostility to the passive voice, however, is
misplaced. Active verbs are often our first, best choice when writ-
ing, but truly skilled writers know how to use passive verbs effec-
tively, rather than ignoring them out of hand.

    What is the passive voice? In linguistics, active and passive are
technical terms used to describe verbs and their position within
a sentence with respect to subjects and objects. This in turn is
the voice of a verb, although this category tends to bleed over into
broader claims about the sentences or passages where the verbs
appear. Verbs in the passive voice simply reverse the subject-verb-
object arrangement of the typical English sentence (e.g., where an
object is verbed by a subject). Unlike in Latin, where it is a matter
of different verb endings, the passive voice in English typically
requires a helping verb, making the sentence longer in addition to
altering its construction.

    The technical details of the passive voice, however, do not really
explain the hostility that many have for it. Some of the distaste for
passive verb structures comes from the cultural associations that
the terms active and passive carry. In Strunk and White, for exam-
ple, active verbs are characterized variously as direct, vigorous,
140 Bad Ideas

bold, concise, forcible, lively, and emphatic. While some of these
characterizations are correct, considering that an indirect sentence
structure is often longer, they also carry implicit judgments that
make the passive voice seem less desirable. And passive has
become a generalized term used to label writing perceived as weak;
as linguist Geoffrey K. Pullum observes, "people are simply toss-
ing the term `passive' around when they want to cast aspersions
on pieces of writing that, for some ineffable reason, they don't care
for." As one of the writers for the popular linguistics site Language
Log, Pullum has gathered dozens of examples of such denuncia-
tions, most of which misidentify the passive voice in the process
of condemning it.

     If there is one quality of the passive voice that seems to deserve
that condemnation, however, it is the way that it can be used to
obscure responsibility or accountability. The classic example of this
is the difference between "I made a mistake" and "Mistakes were
made." Both sentences are grammatically correct, but the latter
conceals the agent of the mistake. The passive voice, we might
say, allows speakers or writers to hide behind language, by direct-
ing attention away from their involvement or responsibility in a
situation. For example, on October 21, 2015, the New York Times
published an op-ed by Ellen Bresler Rockmore titled "How Texas
Teaches History." Rockmore's editorial is primarily concerned with
the ways that the horrors of slavery are downplayed in history text-
books approved by the Texas Board of Education. One of the meth-
ods employed to do so, according to Rockmore, is the textbooks'
frequent reliance on passive voice. "Through grammatical manipu-
lation," she writes, "the textbook authors obscure the role of slave
owners in the institution of slavery."

     Rockmore is not alone in supposing that "grammatical choices
can be moral choices." Both Slate ("Why Scientists Need to Give
Up on the Passive Voice") and McSweeney's Internet Tendency ("An
Interactive Guide to Ambiguous Grammar") published high-profile
(and much-shared) recommendations against the passive voice in
2015. Jacob Brogan, author of the Slate article, argues that passive
voice is less a matter of morality than effectiveness: "The passive
voice makes storytelling more difficult because it hides the charac-
ters deep in the sentence--if it shows them at all." Although less
dramatic than Rockmore's diagnosis, Brogan's complaint is other-
wise similar. Whether conceived as historical agents or characters
in a story, the passive voice minimizes or obscures their participa-
tion in the activity described by the sentence.
                                                About Style, Usage, and Grammar 141

    Pullum is skeptical of such claims, however, noting that "the
belief that the passive necessarily embodies such qualities [e.g.,
vagueness, avoidance] is transparently false." He explains that
there are "plenty of other ways" to obscure agency or responsi-
bility. To say that "mistakes happened" is no less evasive than
"mistakes were made," but only the latter employs a passive verb.
And in circumstances where responsibility is distributed through-
out a complex web of agents, concrete subjects and active verbs
might themselves be ultimately misleading. To return to our earlier
example, Rockmore identifies the Texas Board of Education and
the textbook authors (employed by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt)
as chiefly responsible for the distorting language of the history
textbook. Both parties certainly share some of the culpability,
but "How Texas Teaches History" doesn't adequately capture the
degree to which federal education policy, under both Republican
and Democrat administrations, has fostered this outcome. It may
be expedient to single out Texas, but textbook content across the
nation is determined by a combination of politically appointed
state officials and profit-driven corporate education vendors, both
responding to broader circumstances. Rockmore herself seems to
sense this, as she resorts to the passive voice in her final para-
graph, noting that "The textbook publishers were put in a difficult
position."

    My point here is not to call Rockmore out; rather, I want to
suggest the moral implications of our grammatical choices are
not intrinsic to the grammar itself. Writing that emphasizes the
concrete actions of specific agents can blind us to broader, systemic
issues, just as easily as indirect prose obscures those agents' roles.
Rather than assuming that the passive voice is somehow immoral,
weak, or dishonest, we should instead ask what it is that passive
verbs allow us to accomplish.

    As we observed above, passive verbs alter the subject-object
sequence in a written sentence; this is perhaps their most imme-
diate impact on prose. Reaching back to Strunk and White and
beyond, critiques of the passive voice frequently provide several
examples of this effect, presenting sentences side-by-side to
demonstrate how preferable active verbs are. When we consider a
single sentence, more often than not, the most direct version will
appear to be the better option. Outside of Twitter, though, we do
not write in single sentences. Our prose is much more likely to
happen in paragraphs and pages, and the passive voice plays an
important role here as well.
142 Bad Ideas

     Joseph M. Williams argues in Style: Lessons in Clarity and Grace
that readable prose is more than simply finding the best sentence
in each case. Installed in paragraphs, sentences relate to and
depend upon each other; what may seem to be the better alterna-
tive when viewed in isolation may ruin a paragraph's cohesion, the
degree to which the sentences flow and hold together. Cohesion is
achieved, explains Williams, when sentences maintain a balance
between given and new information, beginning with the former
and ending with the latter. Beginning a sentence with informa-
tion that is already established in readers' minds allows them to
perceive connections and to add new information atop that founda-
tion. Sentences that don't follow the given-new structure will seem
choppy and disconnected, requiring additional work on the part of
readers to forge the connections among them.

     For Williams, cohesion among sentences takes priority over
any injunction against the passive voice. He counsels writers to
focus instead on context, and to choose the voice best suited for
it. Williams provides a number of examples, including the follow-
ing: "Some astonishing questions about the nature of the universe
have been raised by scientists exploring the nature of black holes.
A black hole is created by the collapse of a dead star into a point
perhaps no larger than a marble." The appearance of the phrase
"black hole" at the end of the first sentence as well as the begin-
ning of the second provides cohesion. Revising the second sentence
to feature an active verb ("The collapse of a dead star into a point
perhaps no larger than a marble creates a black hole.") makes little
sense in that context. Given how much distance such a revision
would introduce between the subject and verb of the sentence, it
is doubtful that the active voice improves the sentence, even in
isolation.

     We can return one final time to Rockmore's essay, and exam-
ine the first sentence of her final paragraph ("The textbook
publishers were put in a difficult position.") in context. Two of the
three preceding paragraphs make specific reference to "the text-
book authors" and "the authors" respectively. The new informa-
tion layered into the sentence actually circles back to the politics
discussed earlier in the essay. This small sentence manages both to
provide cohesion in the immediate context of the final paragraphs
and to supply overall coherence by connecting two of the primary
agents that the op-ed considers (the Board of Education and the
textbook publishers).
                          About Style, Usage, and Grammar 143

    The passive voice can certainly be abused, but in the hands of
a skilled writer (like Rockmore), it is an invaluable strategy. There
is nothing intrinsically weak, evasive, or bureaucratic about the
passive voice, nor anything about it that makes a sentence neces-
sarily inferior. The passive voice is appropriate in some contexts
and less so in others, but this is a matter for a writer's judgment
rather than a rule to be (dis)obeyed. We should be teaching writ-
ers the skilled application of the passive voice, rather than teaching
them to avoid it altogether. Understanding sentences in context
rather than isolation would allow writers to take up questions of
cohesion and coherence.

TEACHING GRAMMAR IMPROVES
WRITING

    Patricia A. Dunn

     Teaching grammar improves students' knowledge of linguis-
tics. But if students' writing is to improve, teachers need to teach
writing.

     Long before any of us were born, people were complaining
about the writing and grammar of other people, usually younger or
less powerful than the complainant. Ironically, "these kids today,"
who were once criticized for their allegedly bad writing, may now
be shaking their own grey heads at the writing of others or laugh-
ing about all this drama in a more tolerant afterlife.

     What usually follows fast upon a complaint about other
people's writing is a wistful longing for the days when traditional
grammar exercises were ubiquitous in the schools, as if they're
not today. In fact, those who complain that grammar is no longer
taught in schools should do a quick Google search of "grammar
worksheets" and then sit back to scroll through page after page of
links. This postlapsarian longing for allegedly defunct traditional
grammar instruction springs from a mistaken assumption that
all those grammar drills turned those who did them into flawless
writers. Those drills didn't work then; they don't work now.

     One way to improve writing is to stop looking for a better way
to teach grammar. To improve writing, find a better way to teach
writing.

The Research No One Believes
     For years, composition/rhetoric professionals (people who

conduct research on writing, often have doctorates specializing
                                                About Style, Usage, and Grammar 145

in the teaching of writing, and teach in or direct college writ-
ing programs) have been encouraging new writing instructors to
focus on the teaching of writing, not the teaching of grammar, and
certainly not isolated grammar exercises disconnected from the
students' own writing. There are good reasons for this advice.

    Decades of research have shown that isolated grammar exer-
cises are among the worst uses of time in a writing class, given
that such practices can result in students' writing actually getting
worse. Education researchers did a meta-analysis (a compila-
tion, summary, and recommendation) of many research projects
on writing over the years. In their 2007 report to the Carnegie
Corporation of New York, Steve Graham and Dolores Perin found
that isolated (traditional) grammar teaching was the only instruc-
tional practice to actually have a negative--that's right, nega-
tive--impact on students' writing. In the 1980s, George Hillocks,
Jr. conducted a comprehensive synthesis of writing research that
went back to studies done in the early 1960s. Hillocks's academic
article, "Synthesis of Research on Teaching Writing," and his book,
Research on Written Composition, could not have been clearer about
the harmful effects of traditional grammar.

    However, a technique called sentence combining (where
students take a series of short sentences and combine them into
longer ones, using a mix of clauses, phrases, and linking punc-
tuation) did fairly well in multiple studies of student writing.
In other words, students who did sentence combining (crafting
short sentences into longer ones, actively manipulating sections
of sentences, rearranging clauses and phrases, adding or delet-
ing modifying words, and punctuating the longer sentence so that
it was smooth) saw their own writing improve after this work.
But grammar exercises--quizzes on parts of speech, the naming
of types of phrases, clauses, and sentences? After those, students'
writing got worse.

    But no one believes this research--other than those who
conduct or study writing as a career. So convinced is the general
public that young writers are in desperate need of old-fashioned,
rigorous grammar, that writing teachers from grade school through
grad school continue to be pressured to teach grammar as a way
to improve writing. Even some teachers continue to think that if
only grammar could be drilled into students in a fun, engaging way,
students would write correctly ever after. It doesn't happen.
146 Bad Ideas

Time to Throw in the Towel?

     The reasons so many people believe in the almost religious
benefits of what they call grammar are complex and deep, with
disturbing--perhaps unconscious--connections to class, disabil-
ity, race, national origin, and gender. As a recent rhetorical analy-
sis of grammar rants has demonstrated, many such rants are laced
with moral judgments about the departure from allegedly proper
grammar. In a disturbing, repeating trend, the offending speaker
or writer is seen as uneducated and lazy, the latter judgment being
connected not so subtly to one of the Seven Deadly Sins (Sloth).

     So maybe it's time to give up--to let people go ahead with
their beloved acontextual grammar worksheets, to use them to
their hearts' content (they do, anyway, as the massive number of
search results prove). But those promoting these grammar drills
should also be shown how to observe what happens in their classes
when they inflict such lessons on their students, as well as how to
document the before-and-after writings of these students. Perhaps
their first-hand experience will convince them when other people's
research could not.

     Those teachers should be encouraged to actually analyze
students' writing projects before and after the isolated grammar
treatment. Designing such a study takes some hefty background
in research methods. What concrete, measurable features have
researchers agreed would constitute improvement in writing (no
easy task to agree on, actually), and what measureable differences
are there in the before-and-after samples? Objectively measured,
did the student's writing get better, stay the same, or deteriorate?

     And to keep everyone honest and the results as objective as
possible, someone else should do the analysis--not the teacher of
the grammar lessons--in order to avoid confirmation bias, which is
when researchers really, really want to see, for example, improve-
ment in writing, so they do see it, even if the writing didn't actually
improve. Students, too, can praise their grammar lessons, think-
ing they are now good writers, when the objective evidence that
they've improved is, in fact, not evident.

Better Ways to Teach Writing

     Setting aside for a moment the conclusions of future studies,
which will no doubt also be ignored, what can teachers do right now
to help students improve their writing? They can teach writing in
context. They can teach students to write in real-world situations,
                                                About Style, Usage, and Grammar 147

helping them notice how different writing projects can have very
different constraints. No one is arguing here against grammar or
against intense, sophisticated language study. In fact, people who
know the most about grammar are aware that many so-called rules
are not rules at all but merely conventions, which are not univer-
sal and can change over time and from genre to genre. The best
teachers help their students keep pace with these changes and help
them decide when and whether to use a reference from a 1950 or
2016 grammar handbook, or to look online for the most up-to-date
guidelines. (The most informed text on language conventions and
change is Garner's Modern American Usage, which obtains its evidence
from a wide range of current usage.)

    It goes without saying that everyone appreciates clear, well-ed-
ited writing. But teaching grammar won't help because clarity is
slippery. What's clear to one reader might be unclear to the next,
depending on his or her respective background knowledge. For
example, sewing directions would be clear to a tailor, but not to
someone who has never picked up a needle and thread. An arti-
cle in a physics journal would be clear to a physicist, but not to a
pharmacist.

    Even what is considered so-called correct writing can vary
depending on the conventions expected in a particular genre or
publication. (Google "Oxford comma" if you want to see sparks fly
over conflicting views of punctuation.) As Elizabeth Wardle points
out in this volume, "There is no such thing as writing in general."
Every writing project is constrained by previous iterations of that
type of writing. Is it a memo, résumé, game manual, business plan,
film review? Its context and publication also shapes its readers'
expectations. A letter to the editor of The New York Times has some
features in common with a letter to the editor of Newsday (a local
Long Island paper), but even this same genre looks different in
these two publications. Everything from punctuation to evidence
presented in the respective letters is noticeably different, includ-
ing sentence structure and length, vocabulary level, and rhetorical
appeals aimed at different readerships.

    Someone wishing to teach students something about gram-
mar, including syntax, parallel structure, agreement, clauses, verb
tense, and so on, could, of course, use these letters or other real-
world writing to do so. But what's more important is that students
learn to discover for themselves the subtle or substantial differ-
ences in the writing, depending on what it's supposed to do in that
place and time. It's the educator's responsibility to help students
148 Bad Ideas

see those differences and to understand how important this skill
is. No one knows what students will be asked to write five years
from now, what not-yet-invented writing projects they'll face. They
need these analytical skills to tackle writing needs in their future
professions.

     What does it mean to teach students to notice how writ-
ing shifts and changes? This analysis can start with examining
supposed truisms. For example, young writers are often given the
generic advice to vary their sentence structure, a good plan for
some college application essays and news stories. But many how-to
pieces, including recipes--in the convention of that genre--are
usually a list of short, imperative commands, often missing arti-
cles or even pronouns. Many teachers tell young writers to increase
their use of sensory imagery. Describing in detail more sights,
sounds, textures, and aromas might enhance restaurant reviews
or travel narratives, but not business plans, meeting minutes, or
memos.

     If young people are to be knowledgeable, ever-learning,
active citizens in a participatory democracy, they must develop
a wide-ranging, flexible literacy. Writing instructors should help
students become informed, alert, and engaged readers and writ-
ers of a variety of texts and contexts, so that they learn to notice,
appreciate, and master (should they so desire) all kinds of writing.
This nimbleness requires opportunities to be challenged by a vari-
ety of writing tasks, not time squandered by having students circle
adverbs.

     For more than 50 years, researchers have studied how teaching
traditional grammar (parts of speech, names of phrases and clauses,
types of sentences, etc.) has affected student writing. The results
have been consistent: Writing does not improve and sometimes
worsens after that instruction. To see a meta-analysis of which
studies show these results, start with George Hillocks's 1986 book,
Research on Written Composition: New Directions for Teaching. His 1987
article in Educational Leadership, "Synthesis of Research on Teaching
Writing," is a shortened version of his book, and there is a chart
on p. 75 of that article that shows which approaches to teaching
writing work better than others. To see a more recent summary of
such studies, see Steve Graham and Dolores Perin's 2007 report to

sentence combining does moderately well in many of these stud-

authentic writing involves, see Ken Lindblom's widely shared 2015

150 Bad Ideas

GOOD WRITERS MUST KNOW
GRAMMATICAL TERMINOLOGY

    Hannah J. Rule

     As an English teacher, I have become used to dodging eye
contact at parties when a grammar question inevitably comes up,
as heads crane around to request my discourse on which form of
whom or who can be deemed proper or definitively correct. It's not
just expected that I know which form is eternally right (yet another
bad idea about writing: that language is an unchanging system of
absolute rights and wrongs), but also that I have a range of precise
terminology to define the relevant grammatical parts. I don't; I
don't always have that terminology at hand. Partygoers are not
impressed by my method of listening to the options to see which
sounds most fitting or even beautiful. They just expect me to have
the names.

     This thirst for grammar terms is fairly common, fueled perhaps
in part by the enduring stereotype of the English teacher as gram-
mar police or by the ways many imagine grammar lessons in
school. The art of sentence diagramming, for instance, is predi-
cated upon seeing and naming grammatical parts--subject, object,
adjective, verb, article--and knowing which of those parts earns a
slanted, dividing, or straight line. And though sentence diagram-
ming is now mostly a relic, some nevertheless still believe in this
kind of knowledge. The vast numbers of hands that go up in my
college courses when I ask who did grammar worksheets on parts
of speech in high school may be proof enough of this belief's endur-
ance. The grammar worksheet hangs on, though, only by virtue of
a bad idea about writing: that good writers must know grammati-
cal terminology.

     It's pretty bad, and a bit strange, that some believe writ-
ers should be able to circle their every adjective. But it's worse
                                                About Style, Usage, and Grammar 151

(and stranger still) when grammatical identification is invoked
and passed as itself a sign--even the singular indicator--of a
good writer. This view is suggested in a 2013 CNBC News arti-
cle, "Why Johnny Can't Write, and Why Employers are Mad," in
which author Kelly Holland laments the "inadequate communi-
cation skills" of today's job seekers. Holland's piece is meant to
evoke Newsweek's 1975 article, "Why Johnny Can't Write," a piece
that catalyzed a literacy crisis in the public imagination, inspired
"back to basics" sentiments and, likely, the renewed persistence of
the grammar worksheet. Though Holland's piece hits some famil-
iar notes (indeed, yet more bad ideas about writing: that educators
aren't teaching writing; that technology is destroying the written
word), it isn't quite the same old song.

    Significantly, the employer sentiments about writing summa-
rized in the article generally match those of English educators: that
writing should be the focus of education, that skills in organiza-
tion and context-specific rhetorical strategies are the most import-
ant, and that new employees will likely require ongoing work-
place training in writing in order to develop fluency in professional
discourse. Nowhere a whiff of concern about what a predicate is. In
spite of this complex vision of proficient written communication,
Holland begins her piece by reinforcing the idea that good writers
can be measured by grammar-identification knowledge. "Can you
tell a pronoun from a participle," Holland begins, "use commas
correctly in long sentences; describe the difference between its and
it's? If not, you have plenty of company in the world of job seek-
ers." Holland's barometer is wholly, even comically, inaccurate. It
prioritizes identifying and defining, abilities that have no bearing
on the complex arts of organization, persuasion, and effectiveness
in writing.

    It's not that I'm against cultivating the ability to see a pronoun
or against learning some of the general conventions of comma use.
But what I am against is the still pervasive belief that these abilities
are of significant value. Both English educators and the employ-
ers in Holland's article generally know this: conscious knowledge
about grammar, parts of speech, and punctuation usage rules do
not help anyone, in the long run, to perform that knowledge in
writing. An effective writer cannot be measured by her ability to
identify and define grammatical parts. This is not the same as
saying that writers should never learn to identify direct objects or
spot a dependent clause, but rather that this kind of knowledge is
tremendously, detrimentally overvalued.
152 Bad Ideas

     For a long time (that is, hundreds and hundreds of years), gram-
mar was studied without any concern for, or interest in, its rela-
tionship to writing proficiencies. As noted by Constance Weaver,
a leading voice on grammar in English education, grammar was a
matter only of mental discipline and social refinement for most of
its instructional history. It was only rather recently (that is, around
the 1960s) that English educators began to focus much more exten-
sively on writing instruction and, in turn, to question exactly how
the study of grammar may or may not help make students better
writers. And what was discovered is not only that mental discipline
alone isn't a great rationale for its pursuit, but also that teach-
ing grammar in traditional ways is actually detrimental to writing.
Writing researchers have repeatedly shown that formal grammar
instruction--those worksheets, diagramming drills, or exercises
that emphasize the study of subjects, predicates, objects, and
clauses with an emphasis on terminology--is fruitless and futile.

     Any value attached to knowledge of grammatical terminology
for its own sake is thus based upon fully outdated ideas about what
the study of grammar might do. An individual's ability to define
grammatical parts is perhaps at best a kind of neat party trick, but
ultimately not that important and absolutely not related to one's
abilities or potentials as a writer.

     Conscious, definitional knowledge of grammatical terms
simply doesn't impact processes of writing. Doing language in our
everyday lives--crafting a meaningful text message to a crush, or
penning an elegy for a departed family member--isn't influenced by
deliberate, memorized rules about the right form of who or whom.
It doesn't have a thing to do with knowing when you're writing a
noun or a participle phrase. That is, it doesn't reflect how individu-
als come to know and perform language. Research has shown that
complex grammar knowledge is already in us, in every one of us, in
both shared and idiosyncratic ways. As English professor Patrick
Hartwell has written, the "grammar in our heads"--the largely
untaught, subconscious tacit system of grammar installed in us
all at an early age--is precisely "how we make our life through
language." But we can't really talk about that fund of knowledge,
aside from performing it as we speak and write. Grammarians or
sticklers might need the names, but writers don't.

     A better idea about writing is rather that good writers know how
to do grammar to myriad effects. The most useful grammar knowl-
edge is much less explicit than naming, formed through expo-
sure to language and its many options, arrangements, and infinite
                                                About Style, Usage, and Grammar 153

combinations and built upon our intuitive, tacit experiences with
sentences. Leading English pedagogues have shown that the best
way to increase grammatical effectiveness and style in students'
writing is by having them study the choices writers have made in
compelling mentor texts and then practice making those moves
in their own writing. As Patricia A. Dunn puts it, students must
develop their grammar and sentence chops through engagement in
writing they care about, not through the estrangement of decontex-
tualized drills and memorization.

    Jeff Anderson, a middle school English teacher and author
of many books on teaching grammar and editing, teaches gram-
matical concepts in context through processes of dialogic quest-
ing and discovery, asking students to analyze and intuit syntactical
patterns in a range of example texts. This approach builds upon
the research-validated claim that writers deploy grammar knowl-
edge unconsciously and through exposure, not through the ability
to label parts of speech or other grammatical constructs. Being able
to see certain grammatical concepts, like independent clauses or
modifiers, is essential to the kind of discovery approach to gram-
mar that others and I advocate. But any work on terms and iden-
tification is only valuable insofar as it helps writers meaningfully
engage in the complex craft of writing.

    Perhaps what has ultimately kept grammar names alive in spite
of the research about formal instruction is that writing teachers
haven't much articulated the ways this particular kind of grammar
knowledge doesn't matter. Once formal grammar instruction was
debunked in our literature, some writing teachers have tended to,
in Martha Kolln's terms, "avoid the G-word" altogether, suggest-
ing instead that simply "practice, practice, practice" in writing is
the key. But writing teachers do a disservice, too, if we think we
can or should avoid grammar altogether. Grammar is an inter-
nalized, complex human system we all mysteriously acquire and
continuously reshape through experience. And it's that rich experi-
ence with the magnificent systems of grammar--the discovery and
dialogue about compelling examples combined with lots and lots
of thoughtful practice in writing--that matters and makes a differ-
ence to writing development, not grammatical terminology.

GRAMMAR SHOULD BE TAUGHT
SEPARATELY AS RULES TO LEARN

    Muriel Harris

    There's a long-held belief that grammar can be taught sepa-
rately from writing by asking students to memorize rules and to
complete exercises to practice those rules. But research has consis-
tently shown--again and again (and again)--that most students do
not transfer their memorization of grammar rules to the production
of grammatically correct writing. Thus, all the time spent teaching
grammar in isolation, and practicing it by completing exercises, has
been largely wasted. Such work is neither practical nor successful.
Extensive meta-studies indicate that teaching grammar rules in
isolation is a waste of time; yet, teachers who seem well inten-
tioned continue to teach grammar and test students for mastery.

    If we wonder why explanations of grammar don't lead to error-
free writing, many underlying causes have been nominated, such as
students not reading enough (certainly a valid concern), not having
enough writing assignments in school (also most likely valid), and
not being taught grammar in class (definitely not valid as all those
studies have shown). But a particularly troublesome cause that
needs more attention--and could possibly lay to rest the notion
that grammar should be taught separately in isolation--is the fact
that definitions of grammar as offered in textbooks, resources on
the web, and in class lessons are perfectly clear and adequate for
people who already know what they explain. But such definitions
are incomplete and totally inadequate for those trying to learn the
grammar rules in question. Definitions understood by people who
already know what is being defined, but not understood by people
trying to learn what is being defined have been called COIK, an
abbreviation for Clear Only If Known, a term first introduced by
technical writers.
156 Bad Ideas

     One way to explain the COIK phenomenon is to consider an
example of a COIK definition. If I want to know what the field of
physics is about, I'd find this definition: Physics is the scientific
study of matter and energy and how they interact with each other.
Since I am married to a physicist, I was assured by him that this
is a standard definition of physics. He understands it and consid-
ers it clear. However, since I don't know what matter or energy
are, it's not an adequate definition for me. I might start by asking
what matter is, and if I looked that up, I'd learn that matter is any
substance that has mass and occupies space. Fine, but what is
mass? Mass is the quantity of inertia possessed by an object, or the
proportion between force and acceleration referred to in Newton's
Second Law of Motion. There is a lot more to learn here, but I
haven't even begun to explore the definition of energy, another term
in that initial definition of physics. This begins to seem like a game
of infinite regress, but while that definition of physics is clear to
those who know what physics is about, it does not, for those of us
trying to learn, lead to any useful understanding of the field.

     The obvious objection to this example is that physics is a partic-
ularly difficult concept to grasp. Applying COIK definitions to
concepts of grammar might be a better way to understand the prob-
lem of a COIK definition to those trying to learn grammar concepts
in isolation. One COIK definition is the deceptively simple one for
a sentence: A sentence expresses a complete thought. Most people
can state this definition, but that does not mean they know how to
write clusters of words that form a complete sentence, because the
definition depends on knowing what a complete thought is. When
a colleague and I asked 179 college students (a mix from first-years
to seniors) to read an essay and identify which word groups were
sentences and which were fragments, the results were dishearten-
ing. Here are students' responses to two of the most problematic
sentences in the essay:

     A. "Then he goes on apologizing for days."
     Identified as a complete sentence: 55% (98 students)
     Identified as a fragment: 44% (79 students)

     B. "Not to mention his mannerisms are good at all times."
     Identified as a complete sentence: 42% (75 students)
     Identified as a fragment: 54% (97 students)
                                                About Style, Usage, and Grammar 157

    In these two cases, the first example is a complete sentence,
and the second example is not. In no case was there total agree-
ment on any of the 30 sentences in the essay. The obvious conclu-
sion--that we understand the concept of sentences as express-
ing complete thoughts--apparently didn't help these students
correctly identify word groups that were complete thoughts. But
the students who weren't able to identify which word groups were
sentences no doubt had written vast numbers of sentences of their
own. The COIK problem is that the students weren't able to apply
the concept to the examples.

    But perhaps what's needed is more detail to explain what a
sentence is. If I were to expand the earlier definition, I'd say that a
sentence has an independent clause with a subject and a verb. I'd
probably define what an independent clause is by explaining that
it has a subject and a verb and can stand alone. But identifying
subjects and verbs is yet another matter, as we'd have to be sure
that the person seeking the definition can identify a subject and a
verb. There are numerous definitions of subjects and verbs, but we
might offer this: The subject is the part of a sentence that performs
the action; commonly indicates what the sentence is about; and can
be a noun, pronoun, phrase, or clause. Once again, we are on a path
regressing back through various terms that need to be understood
by the person attempting to learn the rule or concept of sentence.

    For anyone who already knows the terminology of those defi-
nitions, they are acceptable, even though they are COIK. The basic
concept of a sentence is clearly a highly complex one. Similarly,
trying to help students understand verb tense, pronoun case, punc-
tuation rules, dependent and independent clauses, and other rules
of grammar all depend on their understanding of the basic defini-
tion of a sentence and the various terms used in that definition. So
teaching these rules is not likely to result in students knowing how
to actually make use of them when writing. Students can memorize
definitions, and can apparently even complete practice exercises,
but they don't have the knowledge needed to figure out how to
apply those rules when they write.

    Instructors who choose not to teach rules of grammar have
other approaches, such as identifying grammatical errors in
students' own writing. But there are COIK problems here too.
Some teachers, hoping to encourage students to learn how to find
their own answers, are likely to indicate errors by naming them.
Given that terminology, the student will go back to the textbook
and back to the COIK problem, where, if the student doesn't have
158 Bad Ideas

a deep understanding of the concept to begin with, the student
can't draw on the general concept to employ it in other instances
of writing. So, if marking errors in students' writing isn't particu-
larly productive, what can help students write more grammatically
correct prose? In the writing center where I devoted years of my
teaching time to meeting with students in one-to-one tutorials, I
shied away from explaining rules. Instead, if grammar was one of
the concerns that brought students to our writing center, I offered
them strategic knowledge. That is, I introduced them to strategies
that often--but don't always--work.

     An example might include strategies for where to insert punc-
tuation. For commas, I'd invite the student to read the sentence
aloud to hear if there's a pause in their reading that might well
indicate a comma is needed. This doesn't always work, but it can
help, and it's easier to remember and use than to try explaining a
comma rule. Focusing on strategic knowledge can work in one-to-
one tutorials because the tutor and student are working with the
student's writing, and in the discussion that follows, there can be
back and forth conversation to see if the student knows how to
use the strategy, and the tutor can explain that the strategy is not
always going to work.

     But there are only a limited number of strategies, and they don't
encompass all grammatical rules. Nor do they always work. Some
classroom teachers look for models from the pedagogy of teaching
English to students whose first language is not English. Specialists
in the field of foreign language teaching advocate immersion in the
target language to be learned, rather than studying its rules. They
immerse students in speaking, writing, listening, and reading the
target language. Such approaches are only a sampling of various
practices and methods for teaching students to be literate users
of their language, and there doesn't seem to be a wide consensus
as to which are more effective. None of the approaches are simple
or guarantee success. But there is fairly consistent agreement that
teaching grammar in isolation doesn't work. Studies have demon-
strated this over and over. But for those who persist in thinking
they can help students achieve grammatical correctness by explain-
ing rules, they should be aware they are very likely to be offering
COIK definitions that, finally, don't do much more than remind
them of what they don't know.

BAD IDEAS ABOUT
WRITING TECHNIQUES
FORMAL OUTLINES ARE ALWAYS
USEFUL

    Kristin Milligan

    In many classrooms around the country, students are handed
assignment sheets that nicely detail what is expected of them as
writers. Regardless of the genre, one (outdated) mainstay is the
mandate for formal outlines. It's good for writers to collect their
thoughts before jumping into the physical process of writing, and
most people would agree with this concept, but unfortunately,
not everyone thinks or writes the same way. As a result, formal
outlines required at the beginning of the writing process may
hinder creativity and progress. Even more likely, students write
the mandated outline after the piece has been revised and edited,
as a means of meeting the assignment requirements. Requiring
students to create an outline as the first step of the writing process
teaches them that writing is a linear movement, when in reality,
it's actually recursive.

    There's an age-old argument among those in the composition
field. Should teachers and writers be focused on the product or
the process of writing? Writing can be understood in a variety of
ways, but one consistent factor is the idea of planning before actu-
ally writing the intended piece. For quite a while now, this idea has
translated to the mandatory inclusion of outlines as a means of
helping students organize and develop their thoughts before writ-
ing a draft. In general terms, the use of outlines as a pre-writing
strategy is thought to afford writers the ability to more cohesively
structure their written work. While organization and form are
important aspects to the writing process, just because someone has
organized ideas in a prefabricated and hierarchical form does not
mean the actual writing is going to reflect this linear pre-writing
strategy. For instance, one study concerning the behavior of good
164 Bad Ideas

writers found that only one of the writers studied used anything
close to what one could call an outline, but there were 14 other
good writers in the study, too. Does that mean that the one student
who used an outline is the best writer? How can teachers qualify
writers' abilities and strengths, especially based on a linear docu-
ment that vaguely represents a recursive process? This disconnect
highlights a major gap in the understanding of how good writers
compose texts.

     Howard Gardner is well known for developing the idea of
multiple intelligences (or the different ways that people learn, such
as kinesthetically, visually, aurally, etc.). Through an exploration
of multiple intelligences, it has been found that mathematically
minded people are the ones who do their best work using outlines.
One out of six intelligences prefers outlines, and yet in some class-
rooms, outlines are still a required part of writing assignments.
Essentially, requiring students to create a formal outline for their
written work excludes other valuable organizational strategies,
such as mind mapping, picture drawing, and manipulating phys-
ical representations of ideas, such as rearranging Post-It notes on
a whiteboard. Instead of only choosing a familiar and mandated
organizational form, students should instead be allowed to use
strategies that work best with their own intelligences to foster
their growth.

     Another reason mandatory outlines should be given their proper
burial is that outlines seem to only serve students in a particular
manner: organization. Students' final drafts are more organized
when they use electronic outlining, but it doesn't help them in
strengthening a paper's argument. In other words, outlines help
students organize ideas, but don't help students develop those
ideas. Furthermore, a study on how students use prior knowl-
edge to develop new skills toward writing established that outlines
alone don't help with student understanding. Ultimately, outlines
make students focus on writing as a product instead of a process,
even though they are meant to do the latter.

     Even if students weren't required to create formal outlines, an
organizational process would most likely be used in some manner,
based on how people learn through observation of others' writing
processes. Research highlights how students naturally use outlines
as they fit into particular assignments. Not only do students have
the ability to apply the concept of outlining when needed, they
also marry this strategy with others that benefit them in the writ-
ing process. Even so, research shows that the use of outlines has
                                                          About Writing Techniques 165

no correlation with the success of student papers. So, it can be
assumed that students have the capability of using an outline (in
whatever form it may take) as it serves their writing purposes,
but students should not be forced to use a pre-writing strategy
that is inorganic to their writing process, such as a formal outline
with Roman numerals, a and b subdivisions, and the like. When
students only need to plug in information into an already estab-
lished structure, they lose multiple opportunities to engage in crit-
ical thinking and development of their ideas.

    In most cases, required outlines become a contrived formal-
ity, not a tool to help student writers succeed. Personal experience
reminds us that students learn how to create outlines by being told
what to do. (I can still hear my junior-year high school English
teacher repeating to us that if our outlines "have an A they must
have a B. If they have a 1 they must have a 2," as if this alone
constituted pre-writing.) A more fruitful approach is to encourage
students in their writing by allowing them to explore multiple writ-
ing strategies at every stage of the process. In doing so, there's the
possibility that students' beliefs about their writing efficacy will
increase because they will be focusing on what helps them develop
their skills in writing and not their skills in following directions.

    But not all uses of outlines are pernicious. One way that
outlines can serve a vital function is to use them in the reverse.
A small amount of literature has been shared about how writing a
draft, then an outline of that draft, gives the writer the chance to
see where revisions are needed. It's important to note that some
students just don't know what they're going to write about until
they've started writing. Using outlines to organize thoughts that
don't exist yet has the capability of stifling students' thinking
processes, but when students decide to adapt outlines to benefit
their personal writing method, it reinforces the fact that writing
is a recursive and non-linear process. Teachers should be teach-
ing outlines as a way to highlight the progress that students have
made, instead of as a way to dictate where students are supposed
to end up before they've even started.

    Reverse outlines not only help students pinpoint whether
Paragraph 2 should become Paragraph 4, but they also emphasize
many other aspects of writing as well. As Rachel Cayley points
out, reverse outlining helps students pinpoint general structural
problems and begin the process of detailed revisions. Additionally,
depending on what is included in the reverse outline, students may
end up noticing errors in topic sentences, flow of ideas, transitions,
166 Bad Ideas

or the development of their argument. Reverse outlining helps to
delineate the need to circle back, review, and revise, while encour-
aging students to realize that hierarchical structure and organiza-
tion are important factors in creating a well-developed text.

     Writing is a messy practice, and it's important to be gentle with
one another and ourselves, especially when we decide which tools
we want to use to make sense of our mess. It's vital to realize and
remember that outlines are a tool at our disposal when we write;
they aren't the only mode of organization, nor are they necessarily
the best mode for our particular writing process.

168 Bad Ideas

STUDENTS SHOULD LEARN ABOUT
THE LOGICAL FALLACIES

    Daniel V. Bommarito

     One measure of effective writing, when taught alongside argu-
ment and critical thinking, is the extent to which a writer identifies
and roots out logical fallacies, both in others' arguments and in
one's own. Variously defined as errors or flaws of reasoning, logi-
cal fallacies are generally thought to be violations in an argument
that keep the truth of the matter, whatever it may be, somehow
beyond the grasp of the writer and reader. In fact, such a view is
so ingrained in our popular consciousness that it's not uncommon
for discussions of fallacies to slip into a hyperbolic, even religious
tenor, as in the case of one highly trafficked blog on fallacies that
commands across the top of its homepage, "Thou shalt not commit
logical fallacies!" Such commandments rest on an assumption that
by stamping out fallacies a writer's ideas can stand firmly on the
foundations of logic, thus free of obfuscation and open to unadul-
terated analysis. However, as with most rules associated with writ-
ing, the proscription of logical fallacies is more complicated than
commonly thought.

     Logical fallacies earn the bad idea label because their application
to writing and argument often serves as much to obstruct commu-
nication as not. I'll admit this is an ironic claim, since fallacies are
preserved in most writing guides because their identification and
eradication are presumed to put arguments on firmer ground--but
hear me out. Logical fallacies should be put out to pasture for three
reasons: (1) defining logical fallacies is notoriously difficult and
leads to selective attribution and enforcement; (2) identifying logi-
cal fallacies can actually work to shut down communication rather
than energize it; and (3) attempting to adhere to proper logical
form can stifle creativity and undermine one's ability to wrestle
                                                          About Writing Techniques 169

with uncertainty. Taken individually, maybe none of these reasons
would be enough to warrant casting fallacies aside altogether, but,
taken together, they suggest a need to rethink how we define and
use fallacies in the context of writing.

    An initial strike against logical fallacies is the lack of a clear defi-
nition or explanatory theory, despite having a rather long history.
The notion of a logical fallacy can be traced back to Aristotle's On
Sophistical Refutations. There, Aristotle describes fallacies as "reason-
ings" that seem to be genuine "but are not so." He illustrates with
a few examples: Some people are beautiful, while others "seem to
be so, by dint of embellishing themselves"; some people are physi-
cally fit, "while others merely seem to be so by blowing and rigging
themselves out"; some inanimate objects really are gold, "while
others are not and merely seem to be such to our sense." You get
the picture. Suffice it to say, on Aristotle's account, fallacies are
arguments that appear on the surface to be reasonable or logical
but are not in reality.

    However, the philosopher Ralph H. Johnson believes that
such a characterization doesn't hold water because the recogni-
tion of a fallacy is entirely subjective. That is, what appears to be
good reasoning to one person might very well be bad reasoning to
another. Similarly, the philosopher Stephen Toulmin, whose work
has been highly influential in the discipline of rhetoric and compo-
sition, puts an even finer point on it, saying that "we shall not be
able to identify any intrinsically fallacious forms of arguing." In
other words, one person's appeal to authority--to, say, the Bible
for a historical account of the origin of life--might be perfectly
reasonable to a person with the same set of values and expecta-
tions while that explanation would seem totally faulty to a person
with different values and expectations. And no technical descrip-
tion of the reasoning itself, without reference to the particular
circumstances in which the reasoning occurs, can explain why it
may satisfy some and not others. For those committed to flagging
fallacies and incriminating others for their misuse, these charges
are at least a setback, if not a critical blow.

    But it gets worse. Even the ancients suspected that Aristotle's
notion of fallacies wasn't all it was cracked up to be. For exam-
ple, around the second century C.E., Sextus Empiricus--skeptical
of logicians, philosophers, and just about anyone who claimed to
have secure knowledge of any sort--found identifying fallacies to
be misguided and ultimately useless. He held that fallacies could
tell us nothing more about an argument than what we already
170 Bad Ideas

knew. That is to say, an argument's conclusion might be deemed
false, not because of any technical knowledge of the way an argu-
ment unfolded, but because of the arguer's prior knowledge of
the issue under debate. As Sextus put it in an example, a person
does not avoid a chasm at the end of the road because of his pene-
trating study of the road; rather, it is prior knowledge of a chasm
at the road's end that leads him to ignore the road altogether. In
making such a claim, Sextus took dead aim at his contemporaries
who believed they could diagnose arguments and explain why and
how reasoning failed or succeeded as it moved from premises to
conclusions. In effect, Sextus leaves us with a functional definition
of fallacies that goes something like this: An argument is fallacious
when it leads to conclusions that we already dislike or know to be
problematic. Wholly unsatisfying, I should think, and contrary to
what we tend to presume when it comes to studying the role of
fallacies in arguments.

     Despite the problems identified by Sextus, Toulmin, and
Hamblin, the tradition of fallacies has remained largely intact for
over 2,000 years. Sure, theorists have rearranged the furniture a
bit, as Hamblin tells us, but little if anything has been added or
developed. Today, we continue to rely on the authority of tradition
without paying much mind to that tradition's shortcomings.

     A second strike against fallacies is that they can easily shut
down debate rather than energize it. In fact, shutting down debate
is precisely what Aristotle's original discussion of fallacies was
designed to do. The opening portion of On Sophistical Refutations
indicates the type of argumentative dialogue Aristotle has in mind
for the application of fallacies--namely, "contentious" dialogue.
Contentious dialogue referred to the verbal sparring that took
place in public contests between a protagonist and an antagonist,
those who, in Aristotle's words "argue as competitors and rivals
to the death." The aim of such competitions was the metaphorical
death of an opponent, and there were five ways to bring about such
a demise: (1) to win by refutation outright, (2) to show an oppo-
nent's argument to be fallacious, (3) to lead the opponent into a
paradox, (4) to force him into making a grammatical mistake, or
(5) to reduce him to "babbling." And of course, as Aristotle notes,
it would also suffice "to give the appearance of each of these things
without the reality." The fallacies, then, were strategies taught to
students so that they could learn to take down the opposition. Cast
in this light, it's not surprising that fallacy talk shows up frequently
when someone wants to silence the opposition--literally to leave
                                                          About Writing Techniques 171

an opponent with nothing else to say, rather than engage in fruit-
ful debate.

    A third strike, related to the second, is that too much concern
for identifying and rooting out fallacies can inhibit creativity and
keep people from wrestling with the uncertainties of daily life. The
Italian professor of rhetoric, Giambattista Vico, made a similar
claim as far back as the 18th century. Vico believed that his contem-
poraries' preoccupation with formal logic was harmful to students
because it dulled their natural creativity and, once they grew up, left
them unpracticed in dealing with pressing social issues of the day,
issues about which formal logic had little to offer. In place of teach-
ing students to target and purge seemingly faulty reasoning, as was
common in his day, Vico advocated teaching what rhetoricians call
invention by way of the topics. Invention is the activity of drumming
up arguments and is one of the key intellectual practices the disci-
pline of rhetoric offers writers. The topics were helpful forms of
reasoning that offered people strategies for producing arguments
in a variety of contexts. Vico believed that this inventive process
would capitalize on the natural creativity and imagination of young
students and, most importantly, give them the tools needed to be
well-rounded, prudent adults by the time they entered public life.
For Vico, and indeed even for rhetoricians today, the narrow preoc-
cupation with debunking flawed reasoning can stand in the way of
such development.

    So what's the take-away? Let me make three last points. First,
writers benefit when they realize that fallacies exist in the eye of
the beholder and that, by and large, people only search for fallacies
when they already dislike something in an argument. Being on the
lookout for fallacies will tell you more about the person doing the
looking than it will about the argument itself.

    Second, writers benefit when they avoid seeing fallacies as
endpoints or conclusions to arguments. Too often, fallacies conjure
up combative exchanges that are focused more on winning than
on moving toward some shared understanding. Rather than errors
to identify and eradicate, fallacies can be indicators of something
amiss that needs to be investigated further. At their best, fallacies
can serve as starting points for fruitful dialogue, not endpoints.

    Third, writers benefit when they recognize that fallacies are
a necessary part of the day-to-day, lived-in world, where incom-
plete knowledge and leaps of logic are a practical necessity. When
writers approach communication as the messy business that it is,
172 Bad Ideas

fallacies go from being violations of reasoning to the very reasons
we continue conversing at all.

     By making this case against the traditional treatment of falla-
cies, I of course don't mean to suggest that argument strategies
cannot be deceptive or that reasoning cannot be abused. They
can, and it often is. However, it is important to realize that the
problem with fallacies (informal ones, at least) is not the thinking
itself in any technical sense, but the spirit in which that thinking
is undertaken and defended. Writers benefit when they understand
and control fallacies, rather than see them as errors simply to be
avoided.

     Aristotle's classic work discussing fallacies, On Sophistical
Refutations, is accessible online through MIT's The Internet Classics
Archive, as is Aristotle's Rhetoric, which can serve as useful
complementary reading. For critiques of the tradition follow-
ing Aristotle, see C. L. Hamblin's Fallacies (Methuen Publishing)
and Gerald J. Massey's "The Fallacy Behind Fallacies" (Midwest
Studies in Philosophy). Similar critiques of fallacies can be found in
other volumes that also discuss practical reasoning more gener-
ally, including Stephen Toulmin's The Uses of Argument (Cambridge
University Press); Toulmin, Richard Rieke, and Allan Janik's
Introduction to Reasoning (Macmillan); and James Crosswhite's The
Rhetoric of Reason: Writing and the Attractions of Argument (University
of Wisconsin Press).

     For examples of contemporary approaches to the teaching
of fallacies, see Anne-Marie Womack's article "From Logic to
Rhetoric: A Contextualized Pedagogy for Fallacies" and Sharon
Crowley and Michael Stancliff's Critical Situations: A Rhetoric for
Writing in Communities (Pearson). Womack's approach moves falla-
cies to the center of class discussion and shows how fallacies can
be used to conduct audience analysis. Crowley and Stancliff, while
not discussing fallacies explicitly, emphasize rhetorical reasoning,
which works to ground arguments, and the practice of argumenta-
tion itself, in particular historical contexts.

     Contemporary scholars of rhetoric have sought to develop
alternatives to the agonistic view of argumentation that is so
widely circulated. Wayne Booth's The Rhetoric of Rhetoric: The Quest
for Effective Communication (Blackwell) is a fine volume that offers an
accessible discussion of the virtues and limitations of rhetoric and

argumentation from a 21st-century perspective. Another fine work
that considers alternatives to agonistic dialog is Krista Ratcliffe's
Rhetorical Listening: Identification, Gender, Whiteness (Southern Illinois
University Press). Ratcliffe shows how understanding the logics
underlying systems of thought can facilitate communication across
cultural differences.

LOGOS IS SYNONYMOUS WITH
LOGIC

    Nancy Fox

     Logos. Ethos. Pathos. The three basic rhetorical appeals. Surely
Aristotle laid them down for all writers over 2,300 years ago, right?
In his text, On Rhetoric, Aristotle presents logos as argument itself,
aligned with ethos, the appeal of a speaker's character, and pathos,
the appeal to audience attitude or feeling. Together, these appeals
infuse an argument with its persuasive power. However, an often
simplistic, formulaic, and transactional use of these complex terms
detaches them from their potential meaning. Such is the persistent
problem, or bad idea, about logos.

     Logos, the "argument itself " according to Aristotle, consists of
material such as data and narrative, as well as the cogent reason-
ing that allows us to make sense of our stories. However, through
careless practice, mistranslation, or misconception of the word's
origins, logos is often defined simply as logic. Logic, in Aristotle's
terms, is a tool for scientific calculation and investigation. Aristotle
is considered the father of logic because he invented a structure
called the syllogism, exemplified by the famous statement: "Socrates
is a man. All men are mortal. Therefore, Socrates is mortal." The
first two assertions--"Socrates is a man. All men are mortal"--are
premises that lead "of necessity," in Aristotle's terms, to the only
conclusion: "Socrates (a man) is therefore mortal."

     But logic that serves scientific investigation is a different strat-
egy from the logos appeal of rhetorical argument and storytell-
ing. Logos is grounded in audience and situation--not scientific
deduction. In fact, the ancient Greeks had a variety of definitions
for logos, including computation and exposition, as well as forms
of verbal expression, such as oratory and poetry, that represent
an expansive and faceted story. None of these definitions were so
                                                          About Writing Techniques 175

reductive as merely logic. It is confusing, then, that the entry on
logos in the Encyclopedia of Rhetoric and Composition opens with the
words "logical appeal," which also appear consistently in many
other canonical works in the field, not to mention in textbooks
that translate scholarly concepts for students. Logos is commonly
defined as a set of logical (and therefore inevitable) conclusions
drawn from assertions or claims, such as the syllogism.

    Audiences and particular rhetorical situations may require
logical reasoning and even syllogisms, but situations are rarely
completely encompassed within one form of reasoning or arguing.
Perhaps the best example would be a court case, in which syllo-
gistic arguments, narrative appeals, and community values inter-
twine. The case is not fully explicable or approachable through one
kind of proof. Writers are not constrained by formal and limiting
systems like logic, which are highly useful for some circumstances,
but irrelevant or even inappropriate to others, including the kinds
of writing situations in which students often find themselves.
Students are often challenged to understand and make arguments
about political, social, artistic, policy, or cultural topics that cannot
be demonstrated or logically proven.

    All sources that dispute the logic-only definition speak of logos
as complex, a bit mysterious, and resistant to easy analysis. It's
true that Aristotle defined logos as "the argument ... (and) proof,
or apparent proof, provided by the words of the speech itself."
However, textual evidence of logos existed centuries before the
systematizing hand of Aristotle traced the strands of rhetorical
proofs through logos, ethos, and pathos in 350 BCE. Ancient texts
reveal competing perspectives of logos, from spiritual to structural.
The Online Writing Lab (OWL) of Purdue University gathers these
disparate views in one succinct statement that poses and resolves
the problem of this potent word: "Logos is frequently translated as
some variation of `logic or reasoning,' but it originally referred to
the actual content of a speech and how it was organized."

    Teaching logos as logic in rhetorical arguments sets students
up for confusion. They may study the myriad ways we build argu-
ments, from articles to films, stories, songs, and marketing or polit-
ical campaigns. Yet when asked to analyze arguments and make
their own, students are often ill-served by a hunt for logical entail-
ments among situated arguments about issues for which there is no
one, entailed, necessary answer to be demonstrated. Recognizing
logic's innate limitations to encompass all that logos is and can be,
some folks in computer programming and the writing world itself
176 Bad Ideas

propose such hybrid terms as fuzzy logic and informal logic to resolve
this issue. They open the term logic itself to less predictable--and
more human--ways of thinking and speaking about ourselves. In a
closely related issue, beyond the reach of this chapter but worthy
of further investigation, an appreciation of the true meaning of
logos can allay concern that digital landscapes are distorting our
interactions and relationships. It's the reduction of our human
communication to logical systems based on algorithms that logos,
our robust language story, can redress, enliven, and enlighten.

     The primary texts collected in Rhetorical Tradition: Readings
from Classical Times to the Present, edited by Patricia Bizzell and
Bruce Herzberg (Bedford Books), trace the use of the term logos
through time and cultural development of rhetorical practices.
But the origins of the word logos can be discovered in the earliest
texts by Heraclitus, "Concerning the Logos," which describes the
sacred nature of logos, and Aristotle's On Rhetoric: A Theory of Civic
Discourse, the source for a practical understanding of logos as it
informs our daily communications with one another.

     Scholars who trace the various strands of logos--spiritual and
practical--in the context and texture of ancient Greek culture
include Debra Hawhee and Sharon Crowley in Ancient Rhetorics for
Contemporary Students (Allyn and Bacon); Susan Jarratt in her foun-
dational Rereading the Sophists: Classical Rhetoric Refigured (Southern
Illinois University Press); and Jeffrey Walker, who investigates the
deeper sources of logos in human communication, beneath strat-
egy, in Rhetoric and Poetics in Antiquity (Oxford University Press).

Times to the Information Age, edited by Theresa Enos (Garland);

BAD IDEAS ABOUT GENRES
EXCELLENT ACADEMIC WRITING
MUST BE SERIOUS

    Michael Theune

    Surely, you can't be serious! After all, very smart people have
been slaying ignorance while slaying audiences by delivering intel-
ligent ideas with comedy's passion, edge, urgency, and punch for
quite some time: Samantha Bee. John Oliver. Key and Peele. Matt
Stone and Trey Parker. Dan Perkins, a.k.a. Tom Tomorrow. Aaron
McGruder. Sarah Silverman. Tina Fey. Bill Maher. Dave Chappelle.
Wanda Sykes. Dennis Miller. Roseanne Barr. Richard Pryor. Lenny
Bruce. Dorothy Parker. Mark Twain. William Hazlitt. Voltaire.
Jonathan Swift. Lear's fool. Aristophanes. And, if you want to go
into the deep past, Stephen Colbert (the real one, the one who
hosted The Report). And further still, Jon Stewart. (Too soon?)

    But those who think academic writing must exclude the come-
dic are serious. (And a writing teacher should NOT call them
Shirley. That is, not if that teacher wants to keep her job.) Of course
they rarely say so in public. Mostly they keep silent on the topic
of teaching humorous yet legitimately academic, persuasive writ-
ing, and let the Western tradition's tendency to privilege tragedy
carry the big stick. Sometimes, though, they pass laws and create
policies that say nothing overt about comedy in the writing class-
room--still, the instructions about how to do well on high-stakes,
state-sanctioned writing examinations call for writing that care-
fully lays its foundations, creates its structure, and establishes its
points serious brick by seriouser brick. (And then, in the conclu-
sion, one dutifully retells the story of the turgid grid one's made.)
And should they happen to acknowledge the existence of some-
thing like comedy in good writing, they often allow it for momen-
tary purposes, as a way to punch up some otherwise ponderous
prose, say, or to show with a touch of ethos that the author indeed
182 Bad Ideas

is a real person. But that's it--two or three titters, and your humor
limit's reached. (And those isolated titters will seem so weak and
misplaced they likely should be omitted anyway....)

     So just who are these gradgrinds, these crabtrees, these kill-
joys, these robocops with big sticks up their bums? Alas, unless
you've taught or supported the teaching of writing using comedy,
the kicker is: very likely they is you. And it's a shame: there's
much to recommend the endorsement and teaching of humorous
academic writing, the conveyance of the big schtick.

     In fact, composition theorist Peter Elbow declares that writing
pedagogy could be improved by "more honoring of style, playful-
ness, fun, pleasure, humor," so clearly it's time for a right ribbing.
Humor demands close attention to language at all levels. Making
comedy requires a writer to consider diction, of course, but also to
be deliberate about intricacies such as sound and rhythm--after
all, it's often just a matter of a few syllables that enables one to
be silly. Humor also is an effective means by which to teach the
second-most-difficult thing to teach young writers: style. (The
most difficult thing is how to spell ukulele.) Style often is the first
element of writing to go when it comes to teaching young writ-
ers--in favor of elements such as developing a thesis, supporting
that thesis with evidence, and putting a staple in the upper-left-
hand corner. But in comedic writing, style is an absolute require-
ment. In comedy, it's not word choice, but the hunt for the choic-
est word. And sentences must be tightly woven to serve as the fuse
that carries the spark right to an ending that blows readers away.
And maybe even enlightens them. On a much larger scale, humor
requires vivid descriptions, dazzling metaphors, splendiferous
speech acts, and the skillful interrelation of such elements. Writing
comedy entails seeing and creating in content and language those
productive occasions and opportunities, requiring the writer's will-
ingness to capitalize on them, to see everything as potential set up,
and then to land the punch. About poetry, William Butler Yeats, in
his poem "Adam's Curse," states, "A line will take us hours maybe; /
Yet if it does not seem a moment's thought, / Our stitching and
unstitching has been naught...." The same holds true for academic
writing, especially the kind that also hopes to leave readers in
stitches.

     Bruce A. Goebel, a professor at Western Washington University
and the author of Humor Writing: Activities for the English Classroom,
notes, "[H]umor is nothing less than the careful and effective use
of language." But humor also is so much more. Former president
                                                                         About Genres 183

of the Modern Language Association Gerald Graff argues that
teachers need to work to connect academic writing courses with
"students' youthful argument culture." Teaching comedy surely is
one strong, energetic way to do so. At the level of concept, of ideas
about what to write, humor is always attuned to the new: new
possibilities, new perspectives, jazzy combinations. Mel Helitzer,
the author of Comedy Writing Secrets, instructs his readers to "[t]
rain your mind to constantly ask What if?," noting that "What if?
imagination allows you to realign diverse elements into new and
unexpected relationships that surprise." If you ask, for example,
what if the hillbillies in a horror movie became the beset-upon,
virtuous characters, while the college kids vacationing at the cabin
are cruel and vicious? Well, then you might get as an answer the
hilarious Tucker and Dale vs. Evil. Such big conceptual shifts can
help students think anew about texts they're considering. What if
there's a counterexample for the case being made in that essay we
read for class? What if I tried to argue the exact opposite of what
this famous thinker is suggesting? What if I tried to apply here the
comedic rule of three, which dictates that a priest, a rabbi, and a
Chihuahua is totally freakin' funny--what kind of hilarious joke
might I create?

    In terms of process, it's industry standard for comedy writing
to be collaborative. (My friends had to leave before we finished the
last paragraph.) About writing in general, many are convinced of
the myth of the lone genius, those gassy know-it-alls, picking off
ideas in isolation. But that notion of the writer is so bad there's an
essay on it in this collection! With humor, students will need each
other in order to generate and to test out material. And there's a
model for it: the comedy writers' room. And this model has even
made it into pop culture--the writers' room is visited again and
again in the television shows Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip and 30
Rock. Sure, the writers' room in 30 Rock smells, and the writers
play pranks on each other, but they get their work done, and seem
to have fun doing it. And they eat a lot of pizza. The collaboration
humor calls for is not just collaboration with other people--it's
also collaboration with other texts, other sources. It takes a great
deal of knowledge to make a joke work. True, a lot of it can be done
with oodles of Googling, but who knows? That could be a gateway
drug, something to fight the lack of information fluency.

    Humor not only can help teach the elements of writing and
thinking while emphasizing collaboration, but it also power-
fully makes the case for writing. For so many students an explicit
184 Bad Ideas

argument needs to be made for writing because they are always
asking themselves this: Why write when I can speak it into my
phone and the phone will dutifully transcribe my thoughts? (And
the NSA will keep a back-up file!) Humor makes the writing
process matter. In this process, invention is true invention: You're
creating something never thought of before. (Unless your essay is
about airplane peanuts. In which case, change your topic because
you're writing a Seinfeld rerun.) Comedy helps authors barnstorm
brainstorming. It makes the drafting and revising process more
multifaceted, open, searching, continuous--it moves from daft-
ing and reviling to drifting and revving, to riffing and devising,
through drafting and revising to afterdrafting and revisinging (it's
not unusual for performance to be a part of the creation of comedy,
which must have voice... even if it's Gilbert Gottfried's). Authors
who try to create comedy at the spur of the moment most often
find out it simply can't be done--it's just too demanding. It's like...
like...like...see? It's really hard!

     In Everything's an Argument, a 1,000+ page college writing
textbook, the authors--who spend a total of six pages discuss-
ing humor, not one of which offers any insight into how to create
humor--note that "it's usually better to steer clear of humor."
With colleagues like that, who needs nuns with rulers? The good
news is that anyone who wants to try to teach comedic academic
writing can: Other resources are available. There's Mel Helitzer's
great Comedy Writing Secrets, the book that taught me about most
of the techniques I've used in this essay. (My apologies to Mr.
Helitzer and all his descendants.) There's also Arthur Plotnik's
Spunk & Bite: A Writer's Guide to Bold, Contemporary Style, which
offers great techniques--"megaphors," anyone?--for making edgy,
brave, often funny, certainly engaging writing. Even better, Spunk
& Bite's first chapter takes on Strunk and White's Elements of Style,
arguing that it's a guidebook for "millions of struggling language
users" who are "seeking a quick authoritarian fix for shaky writ-
ing skills." Additionally, the growing body of pedagogical research
and reflection by teachers who have their students write using the
techniques and processes of comedy contains a number of great
assignments. These adventurous instructors are trying hard to be
respected and loved--just like the comedians and humorists who
inspire them.

     Those who have used comedy to teach writing have begun
to share the results of their labor, and initial reports--while not
exactly unbiased--are promising. Assessing the quality of the

work she received from students who took a creative nonfiction
course that focused on humor writing, Marietta College professor
Bev Hogue notes that the baseline was really good: "Some of these
papers were structured very much like the typical research paper
produced by a competent freshman composition student, but with
this important difference: These students had spent the entire
semester paying close attention to the elements of style while play-
ing games with language, form, and content, so the final papers
were polished, sophisticated, and often very funny--but still recog-
nizably research papers." And that was just the baseline. Above
this, the writing sang: "Other students were more adventurous,
taking the sorts of risks they had observed in other authors, color-
ing outside the lines to create their own new and effective forms
of expression. And a few--a very few--created final papers that
approached art."

    Of course, just as in any writing class, in a writing class that
focuses on comedic technique and process, some communal rules
very likely should be established. Is there anything that can't be
included in a humorous piece? How do we work together to make
the classroom respectful but also lively and productive? Is it really
okay to admit that Carrot Top is occasionally funny? It certainly is
the case that, as founding members of the International Society
for Humor Studies, Alleen Pace Nilsen and Don L. F. Nilsen, note,
"humor is a good tool for teaching about censorship"; however,
it also must be recognized that humor simply tends toward the
irreverent, and that this is, frankly, ideal. Thus, empowered, young
writers--who can feed off of transgression, off of calling power into
question--are more likely to tip over and crack up some sacred
cows. How much better than to have students be scared cowards!
Studying comedic techniques, students also become better, more
perspicacious (look it up!) readers--they know how humor works,
and so might be less apt to fall for it when some pernicious politi-
cian or idiot ideologue trumpets venom cut with a little laughter.
Armed to the teeth, they're also better able to bite back.

    There are three theories of humor: incongruity (putting together
what doesn't fit leads to fits of laughter), superiority (seeing others
slip on bananas is appealing), and relief (comedy as the jocular
discharge of subconscious energies). So, clearly, though initially it
may seem incongruous to teach humor while teaching academic
writing, such writing--edgy, engaged, careful and powerful--will
be superior to so much of what's come before it. And what a relief
that will be!

CREATIVE WRITING IS A UNIQUE
CATEGORY

    Cydney Alexis

    To many, if not most, the phrase creative writing marks a genre.
It's as simple as breakfast. A man writes in a garret, his pages lit by
the faint glow of a lamp. Ideas are spilling madly from his cerebral
cortex to the page. He probably has a cup of coffee next to him. Or
a dog. And he is writing a story--perhaps about a road trip.

    I know this is the image in most people's brains because it
is the one I've read or heard described hundreds of times by the
media, in popular culture, by writers themselves, in books written
by writers on writing, by my students, and by friends. It is also the
image most strangers (or distant family members) produce when
I tell them my field is writing studies, a discipline dedicated to the
study of academic writing of all kinds: college writing, digital writ-
ing, and workplace writing, just to name a few examples. Upon
hearing this, a man I met in a hostel, over breakfast, asked me to
listen to his poem to see if it was publishable, even though, not
being a poet, I had no credentials for evaluating his text. My distant
cousin, after years of asking at Thanksgiving dinners, still can't
understand why I don't want to edit his novel. Most of us learn to
laugh off the glaze that comes over people's faces as we academics
in writing studies explain what we do write.

    The problem is that one image of writing dominates the popu-
lar imagination and is weighted with value more heavily than all
others: creative writing, which is treated as if it's interchangeable
with fiction and poetry. Over the years, I've come to understand
a few pervasive problems that stem from the view of creativity as
tied to fiction and poetry, from the public's lack of awareness of
what academics and other workplace writers do, from problematic
attitudes held within the so-called field of creative writing itself
188 Bad Ideas

about what types of writing are creative, and from the ways writing
studies scholars reinforce problematic ideas about creativity. These
problems include:

     One sphere of writing is marked off as creative while others are
de-valued.

     People who write everything except poetry and fiction--that is,
people who contribute the vast majority of writing to the world in
the form of lists, essays, emails, blog posts, texts, instruction manu-
als, and so on--see their work as less creative and less important.

     This mass of unrecognized writing and labor is virtually unrep-
resented in popular culture, and academics and other workplace
writers are not part of the cultural narrative around creativity (save
some exceptional examples, such as the way writing is represented
in the television show The West Wing, often a powerful meditation
on the importance of collaboration and revision in workplace writ-
ing, and in the film Her, which celebrates vernacular ghost writing).

     I first took note of the emotional weight and impact of this
phenomenon when conducting interviews for my dissertation on
the impact of materials of all kinds on the writing process. I inter-
viewed 48 people, and in countless interviews, people expressed
the heartbreaking sentiment that there once was a time when
they wrote creatively (poems and stories), but now, they are just
academics or just workplace writers. Even more troubling was that
when asked if they considered themselves writers, they resound-
ingly answered no. Even for people who write daily for their trade,
writing has become synonymous with poetry and fiction writing,
which has become synonymous with creative writing. They uttered
statements such as these: "I used to write [for pleasure]...through-
out childhood....I wrote little fiction stories, I wrote in a diary, I
wrote autobiographical stories.... Writing a dissertation is kind of
like a job.... I don't write that much anymore. Well, I don't write
creatively."

     I began asking more people whose livelihoods depend on the
written word, and who write daily, if they see themselves as writ-
ers. I also began asking graduate students who came to see me at
various writing centers I worked at whether they considered them-
selves writers. And again, most said no. There was something in
the identity label of writer that people have attached to a particular
kind of writing. Deborah Brandt voices this powerfully when she
points out that while the identity label of reader is available to most
people, meaning that most readers could confidently say "I'm a
reader," the identity label of writer is not available in the same way.
                                                                         About Genres 189

    In one of her book chapters, Brandt demonstrates how cultural
narratives around the importance of reading enable families to
understand the value of this act and to support reading as a family
value and practice. This practice, of course, has a long history--
reading was, until quite recently, a family, and not a solitary or
even silent, activity (scholars debate exact dates, but some point
to silent reading as a late 19th- or even a 20th-century phenome-
non). Writing, on the other hand, has often been associated with
privacy, secrecy, and solitude, as Brandt asserts. It is also associated
not with workplace forms, but with poetry and fiction. A question
that comes to mind is that if families do not see themselves as
skilled writers (because the designation of writer is reserved only
for poetry and fiction), then how can they encourage writing in all
of its forms as a family value? Brandt notes that in her hundreds of
interviews with families, people rarely remembered writing around
parents. For many families, being a writer is not seen as a valuable
trade--it's the stuff of fiction.

    What persists are damaging stereotypes about writing and
creativity that continue to reinforce troubling dichotomies about
the nature of creativity. Consider the famous joke that "those who
can't do, teach," which parodies the work of individuals dedicated
to fostering creative thinking in others, requiring them, also, to
constantly be creating. Or consider that teachers and professors
are almost always depicted in popular culture as practitioners, not
talent. Although not necessarily a film about writing, Good Will
Hunting pits an enfant terrible against a practiced and pragmatic math-
ematics scholar whose hard work will never be valued as much as
Will's spontaneous ability to solve genius-level problems. To take a
more recent example, in Me, Earl, and the Dying Girl, Nick Offerman
plays a ridiculous sociology professor whose intellectual contribu-
tion to his field is portrayed solely via his penchant for wearing
tribal clothing from around the world. His son characterizes him as
a person who basically sits around a lot. When faculty aren't being
ridiculed in popular culture, all sorts of other problematic stereo-
types are propagated, such as the effectiveness of White teachers
or teacher figures inspiring at-risk or inner-city students, usually
students of color, to be creative by writing fiction or poetry (see,
e.g.,, Dangerous Minds, Finding Forrester, Freedom Writers, Up the Down
Staircase). Try to imagine these movies teaching writing skills that
would be valuable outside of these singular moments of fiction-
alized inspiration? In Dead Poets Society, we even see the symbolic
gesture of a teacher tearing up a syllabus, perhaps imagined to be
190 Bad Ideas

the dullest of literary genres, even though as a material represen-
tation of a 16-week experience, a syllabus can be one of the most
creative and rewarding of writing forms. Indeed, if creative writing
is about world creation, as many argue it is (though this, too, is
debatable), what is closer to this than the creation of a new expe-
rience? These films couldn't conceive of encouraging other forms
of writing--which is why we should be thankful for the model of
creativity we are treated to in Her, in which Joaquin Phoenix plays
a ghost writer of love letters--not generally a celebrated writing
genre.

     How did the field of creative writing, and the public's idea about
this type of writing, emerge? In The Elephants Teach, D.G. Myers
presents ample evidence that the institutionalized field of creative
writing barely resembles the ideals and movement that produced it
in the 1920s United States, when it exploded in popularity largely
due to the writings of educator Hughes Mearns. Mearns developed
and popularized what's considered to be the first creative writing
workshop for junior high school students. He was tired of English
courses that used literature as a means of drilling students on
vocabulary or grammar or as some other means to an end. Mearns
proposed the practice of writing literary texts for self-expression,
so that kids would enjoy literature, and for promoting an under-
standing of literature by writing it. His published description of his
creative workshop spread quickly and was rapidly adopted across
the United States, largely because he traveled to present the model
in schools and published student work in various texts that were
publicly devoured.

     However, according to Myers, in contrast with current concep-
tions of writing that treat fiction and poetry as more cultured than
genres such as workplace writing, emails, lists, or even theses,
Mearns would not have abided by a view of creative writing as
somehow more cultured or valuable. Neither would prominent
early 20th-century progressive educator John Dewey, Mearns's
influencer. In fact, both Dewey and Mearns were highly critical of
the notion of culture, which seemed to be a means of discriminat-
ing against the masses for abilities that people held due to vari-
ous privileges and advantages (such as speaking proper English).
Myers demonstrates how the rise of creative writing paralleled the
rise of post-World War II college enrollments due to the G.I. Bill, as
well as the rise of federal student aid. The rise of creative writing
programs also divorced creative writing from its study of literary
texts, and the field emerged as one that, rather than train future
                                                                         About Genres 191

writers, instead trained future teachers of fiction and poetry. He
notes that "Creative writing was devised as an explicit solution to
an explicit problem. It was an effort to integrate literary knowledge
with literary practice," but that "what had begun as an alternative
to the schismatizing of literary study had ended as merely another
schism." Now, English departments are divided, with the study of
fiction and poetry quite divorced from other parts of the program.

    An effect of popular attitudes about writing is that much public,
popular, and workplace writing is devalued, despite its ubiquity,
importance, creativity, and potency. The division impacts so-called
non-fiction, too (a genre defined by a lack). As Barbara Tuchman
articulates, "I see no reason why the word `literature' should always
be confined to writers of fiction and poetry while the rest of us are
lumped together under that despicable term `non-fiction'--as if we
were some sort of remainder."

    Too often, binaries are leaned on in order to praise one thing
and devalue another. This is the case with the phrase creative writ-
ing and just about every form of writing that is set apart from it. For
example, in his powerful book chapter on housewives' shopping
lists, Daniel Miller demonstrates how the lists he studied reflected
an awareness of the organization of grocery stores that housewives
were calling on when producing them. Rather than items being
listed in random order, their writers were, instead, listing items
to reflect food categories and writing them to reflect their planned
future movement through those stores. Once again, this is the
creation of an experience through a particular writing form.

    And also too often, what's placed on the other side of the binary
is work that is critical in nature. Consider an article by scholar
and literature professor, Graeme Harper, who, in championing the
creative writing workshop, repeatedly utters sentences like these:
"[My students] are required to write both creatively and critically."
When the critical is opposed to the creative, it's easy to understand
why public and academic attitudes so pervasively represent persua-
sive writing as uncreative, particularly when pitted against those in
the so-called creative arts.

    Over the years, the students I have worked with, and partic-
ularly students who see me in the writing center, have reported
that after I talk with them about some of these ideas, and after
they begin thinking of themselves as writers, their positive feelings
about writing intensify. No one wants to feel that the daily work
they do is valueless, dull, uncreative. And everyone should be able
to access an identity that they are proud of related to their trade.
192 Bad Ideas

I am concerned that narratives about what it means to be creative
and a creative writer are to blame for much of what I've described.
I would love to see English and related departments banish the use
of creative writing in titling disciplines, tracks, and departments.
Instead, bring us all together under the banner of writing studies,
writing, or writing arts.

     In my courses, I tell my students at the beginning of the term
that they will not hear me use the phrase, and I tell them why.
Most of my students are not going to be fiction writers and poets;
they are going to be journalists, technical writers, emailers, texters,
medical record writers, memo-writers, proposal writers, and list
writers. And I want them to practice their craft in each of these
genres and to understand that if they enjoy this work, it is as valu-
able to them as fiction and poetry. It's time we banish the idea
that certain writing forms are creative and certain aren't. And the
idea that those who write in the workplace aren't artists. Or that
academic writing is dull. Let's challenge ourselves to expand our
ideas about what it means to be creative, to stop using the perni-
cious phrase creative writing, and to produce more public texts that
depict the creativity involved with forms besides fiction and poetry.

ing, see D.G. Myers's The Elephants Teach: Creative Writing Since 1880
(University of Chicago Press). Scholars have traced the history and
evolution of the interrelated fields of creative writing, literature,
and composition and rhetoric/writing studies, all of which have
traditionally been housed in English departments. Notable exam-

     Deborah Brandt's Literacy in American Lives transformed the writ-
ing studies field's view of how literacy is acquired by arguing that our
acquisition of it is dependent upon large-scale, powerful, rich, and
often invisible structural forces, or sponsors, that enable or thwart
access to literate resources such as technology, reading materials,
and money. In the chapter, "Remembering Writing, Remembering
Reading," she demonstrates how families and society contribute to
literacy acquisition, noting that individual self-concept as a reader

or writer are not only tied to family practices around reading and
writing, but to cultural ideas about the value of those activities that
are themselves culturally, nationally, and institutionally sponsored
and are passed down, often unremarked, through generations.

    Theorization of identity (also referred to as self-concept, selfhood,
and self-identity) is robust in fields such as consumer research,
psychology, and philosophy. My research frequently draws on the
following works: Russell Belk's "Possessions and the Extended
Self "; Erik Homburger Erikson's Identity and the Life Cycle (W.W.
Norton & Company); Dorothy Holland, Williams S. Lachicotte,
Jr., Debra Skinner, and Carole Cain's Identity and Agency in Cultural
Worlds (Harvard University Press); Robert E. Kleine, III, Susan
Schultz Kleine, and Jerome B. Kernan's "Mundane Consumption
and the Self: A Social-Identity Perspective"; Jean-Paul Sartre's Being
and Nothingness: An Essay on Phenomenological Ontology (Routledge).

POPULAR CULTURE IS KILLING
WRITING

    Bronwyn T. Williams

     For more than a century, common sense has been telling us
that popular culture is killing writing. In 1887, Adams Sherman
Hill, of Harvard, bemoaned the effect of popular culture on writing
this way: "To read nothing but newspapers and second-rate novels
is surely a waste of time... (and) tends to weaken the powers of
attention and concentration, to diminish, if not destroy, freshness
of thought and individuality of expression." While the culprits
have changed over the years, from newspapers to movies to tele-
vision in the 20th-century, to digital games and social media today,
the concerns and complaints remain remarkably the same. Popular
culture texts, according to these laments, are intellectually unde-
manding, too reliant on emotion, too informal, and often morally
compromising (the last was also a concern of Hill's). Students
who read too many comics, watch too much television, or play too
many digital games, according to this narrative, will produce naïve,
emotional writing that is riddled with errors.

     Curiously, however, literacy has not disappeared in the years
since Hill developed the foundational first-year writing course at
Harvard, to combat the poor writing he attributed in part to popu-
lar culture. Literacy rates continue to increase in the U.S., as do
the number of words people read and write every year, thanks to
the rise in online writing. In university classrooms, as Stanford
University's Andrea Lunsford demonstrates in her research,
undergraduate writing students are not only writing longer papers
in their courses today, they are making fewer errors of usage and
style. Clearly, popular culture has not led to a generation of illit-
erate people. What's more, popular culture is not, in itself, the
cause of poor writing and when young people engage with popular
culture they are learning valuable rhetorical concepts and skills.
                                                                         About Genres 195

    Yet when I tell people, whether members of the public or other
writing teachers, that popular culture is not the nemesis of writ-
ing they assume it to be--and I've been researching the interplay
of popular culture and student writing for close to twenty years--
they can't believe what I'm saying is true. Across the political spec-
trum, they are convinced that popular culture is killing writing.
Critics on the right fear the intellectual and moral laxity of popu-
lar culture, while those on the left fault popular culture for rein-
forcing harmful stereotypes and brainwashing them into becom-
ing mindless consumers. Across the board, they are convinced
that popular culture harms writing because it is too easy to under-
stand and students learn nothing from it. In short, popular culture
wastes time and minds. People complain that students refuse to
read novels, or that they write emails containing typos, or that they
include text-speak in college papers.

    Even though research contradicts these anecdotal experiences,
these narratives persist for several reasons. For one thing, research
on memory and narrative makes it clear that all of us are notori-
ously bad at accurately remembering how we learned things, or
how we struggled to learn things, when we were younger. In addi-
tion, people tend to distrust or discount new technologies and
media with which they are unfamiliar, while maintaining nostalgia
for what they did as youth. As Mitchell Stephens notes, in tracing
the complaints that have accompanied new communication media
dating back to the Gutenberg printing press (and including the
telephone, pencils, and television, among others), "We rarely trust
the imposition of a new magic on our lives, and we rarely fail to
work up nostalgia for the older magic it replaces." Such nostalgia
leads to narratives of a perpetual literacy crisis that are remarkably
consistent decade after decade.

    Perhaps most important, however, is the general misunder-
standing of how people acquire rhetorical and literate abilities,
particularly as they move from one genre or medium to another.
A substantial, and growing, body of research on the relation-
ship between popular culture and writing shows time and again
students engaging in literacy practices that are complex and
constantly evolving. There are ways in which popular culture helps
student writers, some ways in which it doesn't seem to make much
difference, and, yes, some ways in which it collides with the writ-
ing students do in school.

    One prevailing myth about popular culture is that it is easy or
simple and that's why young people like it. It's true that some movies
196 Bad Ideas

or video games or television programs are not all that challenging
in content or form. The same can be said of many books, plays, and
poems. Even as critics of popular culture find it easy to summon
uncomplicated reverence for established media and genres, such as
the print novel, the reality is that there is no medium or genre in
which every work is a masterpiece, and no medium or genre that
cannot carry substantial intellectual insights. Young people talk to
me and other researchers about being heavily invested in popu-
lar culture such as television series, comics, movies, and games
that are complex, innovative, and engaging their minds. People
who still think television is a vast wasteland aren't watching series
such as The Americans or Westworld, with their complex characters
and narrative structures. People who think all computer games are
mindless and don't require thought haven't played the range of
games I see students playing, which require diligence, creativity,
and learning to complete.

     The reason students read popular culture with facility and
enthusiasm, including complex and sophisticated forms, is not
a matter of simplicity, it's a matter of practice. Learning how to
navigate any genre takes time and practice to figure out how it
works. Think about the first time you tried to figure out some-
thing in a genre with which you had little practice, whether it was
a legal contract, poem, opera, or heavy metal. It probably slowed
you down, was a bit confusing, and was neither pleasurable nor
confidence building. Yet, if you had more practice, your familiarity
and facility would increase. There is no doubt that, for the great
majority of students, they have much, much more practice reading
and making sense of popular culture than they do with academic
articles or textbooks. Although, it is also the case that, for every
student, there are genres of popular culture they do not have much
experience with and are not able to make sense of easily. When
I talk with students about popular culture, it is not long before
they'll tell me of a form or genre that they just think is weird or
that they don't get, whether it's hip hop or country music or horror
films or Twitter. It is practice with reading and interpreting genres
that has developed their skills in reading, movies, popular music,
television, computer games, social media, and more. They read
with ease, but not because the content is always easy.

     The ease with which students can interpret a form of popular
culture has developed with practice, which at some point included
struggle, help from others, and accumulating knowledge--in other
words, learning. Another myth about popular culture and writing
                                                                         About Genres 197

is that people learn nothing from it. Students learn a tremendous
amount about rhetoric and communication from their engagement
with popular culture, most notably about rhetorical concepts such
as genre, audience, and style. When researchers talk with students
about their popular culture reading, the students talk knowledge-
ably and even critically about these rhetorical aspects. Students
may talk about a romantic comedy in terms of genre conventions,
for example, discussing the kinds of character types that typically
show up, whether as protagonists or sidekicks. Or, ask students to
discuss the people who frequent an online popular culture discus-
sion forum and they will be able to describe the audience there, as
well as the kinds of posts that are viewed positively or negatively.
Young people may not always discuss these elements using the
specific terms we use in academic settings, but they are familiar
with these key rhetorical concepts.

    It is not the case that the rhetorical abilities students learn
through their extensive engagement with popular culture transfer
seamlessly to their classroom writing. Like any of us learning to
write in a new genre, students need writing classes that help them
understand the conventions, and the reasons for the conventions,
of that new genre. Still, when we talk with students about key
rhetorical concepts of audience, genre, and style--elements crucial
to negotiating any writing situation--we need to understand that
students enter the classroom with a vast range of experiences with
these concepts. If we help students understand and articulate the
knowledge they have learned from popular culture in terms of audi-
ence, genre, and style, it is easier to get them to consider how all
writing works within particular genre conventions. If we can help
them see how they have learned the conventions of popular culture
through practice and discussion, they can see how they can do the
same if they learn and practice the conventions of academic texts. I
should also note that when students understand more about genre
and rhetoric, they also become more creative and critical readers
and writers of popular culture. Learning is best when the bridge
goes both ways.

    People do not necessarily connect the ideas of guidance and
instruction to how students learn popular culture. Certainly, it is
true that young people are exposed to some popular culture forms,
such as television, from an early age and do not need to learn how
to interpret many television programs in the same way they have
had to learn to read. On the other hand, there are popular culture
forms, such as computer games, that take more explicit instruction
198 Bad Ideas

and guidance to learn. Even within familiar forms such as televi-
sion or music, new genres and unusual songs or programs can be
confusing to young people. They do, in fact, need instruction or
guidance to help them with their struggles to understand unfamil-
iar popular culture. At these moments students typically turn to
their peers for advice. You don't need to spend much time around
young people before you can hear them arguing about, or explain-
ing to each other, the meaning of a song or movie. The develop-
ment of online forums has offered another popular source of advice
and guidance. Research with students with a variety of interests
demonstrates that they go to online forums about everything from
computer games, to music, to movies for reviews, tips, or discus-
sions. It is important to remember that these discussions happen
through writing and reading.

     Indeed, one of the results of the advent of an online, partici-
patory popular culture is that it has led to an explosion of reading
and writing. Although there are other modes of communication
online, such as video, there is still a tremendous amount of read-
ing and writing taking place in online spaces. In fact, compared
with thirty years ago, when television and film dominated popular
culture practices, young people today are engaged in significantly
more reading and writing. What they are learning from writing and
reading in online spaces is, again, a more sophisticated and criti-
cal appreciation of concepts of audience, genre, and style, as well
as concepts of authorial presence, collaboration, and remix. If you
make the time and effort to listen to young people who write and
read online, they can talk at length and with insight about how, for
example, they consider audience and their online persona when
creating a social media profile and posting comments on that page.

     Again, when students talk about rhetorical concepts such as
audience or genre, they may not articulate their knowledge using
these terms unless we make that connection for them. Even so,
they do understand the effect of rhetoric on communication. They
understand that context influences the choices they make when
communicating, and consequently they usually understand that
they should use different rhetorical approaches in different contexts.
I have not interviewed or observed a single student over the years
who did not understand that there were differences in expectations
for genre and style between posting an update on social media and
writing an essay for a university course. They understand that they
are supposed to switch from popular culture genres and language
use when writing for a course. (Indeed, linguist David Crystal,
                                                                         About Genres 199

among others, demonstrates that stories of students incorporat-
ing text-speak in academic papers is largely an urban myth.) That
students understand that writing in an academic setting necessi-
tates a different kind of writing than popular culture does not mean
they can do so automatically and effortlessly. Learning to write in
a new genre always results in uneven moments of struggle and a
tendency to make more errors of usage. Still, the issue is switching
from one genre to another, not that one of the genres happens to
be some form of popular culture.

    Finally, while this is not the place to address concerns people
have about the effects of popular culture on morality, I do want to
challenge the idea that popular culture makes young people lazy
and shortens their attention spans. Simply put, how do we recon-
cile the argument about shorter attention spans with young people
flocking to popular movies that are more than three hours long, or
playing video games for hours until solving a particular problem,
or reading book series such as Harry Potter or The Hunger Games that
run for thousands of pages? Instead, we should ask why they are
willing to spend so much time and effort on these popular culture
texts and yet are often less interested in lengthy academic texts.
One reason, as I noted above, is that having had more practice with
popular culture they are able to engage with it more skillfully. Yet,
another reason for the appeal of popular culture for students is that
the movies, games, and music they engage with on their own time
are usually under their control. Students' interpretations of popu-
lar culture are not dictated by their parents or evaluated by their
teachers. According to researchers on motivation, control over our
activities and of the meaning we make of those activities usually
increases our motivation to engage in such activities. We rarely take
as much pleasure in work that is assigned to us as in projects that
we engage in by choice. Perhaps rather than fretting about popular
culture we should be worrying more about the damage that relent-
less standardized assessment is having on student motivation.

    Please understand, I am not going down the road to "every-
thing that is bad is actually good for you." Popular culture can be
problematic in many ways. The representations of gender and race
and violence can be deeply disturbing, as can cynical appeals to
emotion--from advertisements to cable news talk shows. What's
more, the kind of extended, evidence-based argument common in
academic writing is much rarer in popular culture, where narrative
and collage are much more prevalent rhetorical forms. Students
who have more of their experience reading and writing popular
200 Bad Ideas

culture will have some learning to do in college to practice and
master the genres of writing expected there. The point is, however,
that students would have to learn to read and write in new genres
when they get to university, regardless of the genre knowledge they
had when they arrived on campus.

     If we understand this last point--that students will always
have to learn, and struggle with, writing in new genres at univer-
sity--then we can understand why popular culture, regardless of
the form, has been the source of so much complaint for more than
a century. Too many people still believe that you can be taught
to write once, and that such knowledge should serve you for the
rest of your life. First-year writing courses are often regarded as
providing the single inoculation for writing--and against popu-
lar culture--that students need. Instead, we must understand that
writing and reading are abilities that we acquire through learn-
ing and practice, and that we never stop learning them. The more
we are immersed in texts, the richer understanding we have of
the genre, style, audience, and rhetorical context for which they
were produced. Students are adept at reading and writing popular
culture because they practice it, learn it, control it. Given the same
conditions, and motivation, they can learn to do the same with
other forms of writing.

POPULAR CULTURE IS ONLY
USEFUL AS A TEXT FOR CRITICISM

    Mark D. Pepper

     Popular culture, once written off as lacking depth and impor-
tance, is now the subject of in-depth analysis both on college
campuses and in non-academic venues. Students write extended
considerations of how cult TV show Buffy the Vampire Slayer
explores teen insecurities through their embodiment in the show's
demonic villains. Bookstores sell essay collections with titles like
Myth, Media, and Culture in Star Wars and The Sopranos and Philosophy.
Online think pieces analyze how Taylor Swift's lyrics may or may
not be feminist. A public wiki devoted to the television show LOST
still has devoted fans trying to figure out what it all meant (maybe
even figuring out what those accursed numbers were all about).

     All this writing increasingly problematizes the argument
that popular culture is primarily dumb, simplified fodder for the
masses. In his book, Everything Bad is Good For You, Steven Johnson
builds a sustained argument that popular culture (especially in the
past three decades) has become more complex, better written, and
cognitively stimulating. The existence of so many college courses,
mass-marketed books, and online pieces of analysis suggest that
popular culture warrants close textual scrutiny. The popularity
of this writing also suggests a desire for consumers to dig deeper
into what their entertainment is about and what broader cultural
effects it may have. Considering the actual depth of pop culture
texts, it's not surprising that performing deep reading is so popu-
lar in the classroom.

     This textual analysis of popular culture for its deeper mean-
ings or cultural effects is not a bad idea in and of itself; in fact,
getting popular culture taken seriously was a hard-fought struggle
in academic circles throughout the latter half of the 20th century.
                                                                         About Genres 203

However, that battle was seemingly won on the idea that popu-
lar-culture texts should be treated in the same manner as clas-
sic literature where textual features such as symbolic and meta-
phorical messages are treated as important elements of the texts.
Therein lies the problem. When popular culture is predominantly
written about from the perspectives of textual analysis and cultural
criticism, this writing often fails to capture the personal, varied,
and complex experiences of consuming popular culture. Students
often balk at these writing assignments because they recognize
that something is missing (or murdered, in the words of William
Wordsworth). Without different kinds of writing assignments
that balance the rush to critique content, students are seemingly
asked to disregard a lifetime of experience with these texts that do
not seem valued by an educational setting that is laser focused on
textual dissection.

The Unique Place of Popular Culture in Daily Life

    When popular culture is brought into a classroom as analyti-
cal fodder for student papers, the results are often smart and well
written. Such writing often presents the popular text in a "here's
its deeper meaning" light, sometimes to counter the still-com-
mon misconception that pop culture is lower or dumber than
other forms of texts. Other written analysis often suggests how a
popular text is damaging because of the problematic representa-
tions of society's marginalized and disenfranchised groups through
encoded, normalized messages and symbols. And the assignments
work. Students writing in this vein hit all the checkboxes currently
heralded by educational goals and outcomes statements: critical
thinking, inquiry, close reading, and working with diverse texts.
However, saying this type of writing works means something very
specific and potentially limiting.

    When instructors ask students to write about Buffy the Vampire
Slayer or Breaking Bad with the same focal points also applied to
Hamlet or Moby-Dick, there's an implied message that pop culture is
not more than that. Sure, the texts may operate similarly in some
ways (they all have symbolically charged, complex plots, characters,
and themes), however, the popular texts operate in some uniquely
different ways too. These are the texts we get hyped for and binge
in encaptivating doses. These are the texts that inspire us to buy
related t-shirts, toys, and memorabilia. These are the texts we
avoid spoilers for and geek out with our friends about (sometimes
204 Bad Ideas

while wearing costumes of characters from the text). These are the
texts sometimes so bad that we watch them simply because they
are so bad (hey, Sharknado). These are the texts that are sometimes
just on or just there--a background tapestry for everyday living.
Pop culture is a unique and contradictory site of meaning making
that often (and usually) goes far beyond the definition of meaning-
fulness required by a textual analysis/critique writing assignment.
It's a realm of personal connections, emotional nuance, and messy
contradictions that defies most traditional grading rubrics.

     This is not to suggest that literature (or even essays) offered for
analysis in the classroom don't also come with personal connec-
tions, entertainment value, and emotional perspectives. However,
standard-issue writing assignments far too often ask that those
factors be stripped away or ignored in the actual writing (some
instructors of writing still inexplicably discourage the use of "I"
in any situation). So it's not hard to imagine how some students
react negatively when they're suddenly asked to dissect pop culture
in ways that explicitly (or implicitly) ask them to disregard every-
thing they know and feel about a popular text and reduce it to a
textual artifact for parsing.

     Textual analyses often come with an implied demand for the
readers of such pieces to reject their enjoyment (or, at least, feel
guilty about it), and adopt the correct stance when a problem-
atic element is being dissected. Fans may rightly ask: Why should
this author's critical interpretation affect my personal relationship
with the text just because he or she has a degree or book contract?
Another response may be: I see now that this text is problem-
atic, but I still like it. After all, close textual analysis might change
minds (or add some nuance) for some readers and writers, but it
more likely allows readers who already have these specific critical
tendencies to feel good about being on the right side of what they
already know.

     Here, the unique status of popular culture must be noted
again. Students likely expect that the authors of critical essays
about Toni Morrison or Kafka know more about the texts than they
do. Students often (but not always) have little prior experience
with the work. And students write cautiously and with reserva-
tion about Beloved or The Metamorphosis because they're treading
new ground. But when pop culture becomes the topic of writing,
students may have the feeling that something is missing because
they bring so much prior experience with them to the blank page.
They have a knowledge base from which to confidently observe,
                                                                         About Genres 205

"Well, that hasn't been my experience with the text." Not to be
misunderstood, it's obviously good to encounter new perspectives
and question previous assumptions. Nonetheless, the question
becomes: What is being taught about writing when textual/critical
analysis asks students to disregard their outside expertise, turn off
their personal investments, and attack (from their points of view)
texts that they know are more complex than narrative meaning and
cognitive impact?

Fandom Studies and Affective Musings

    Again, the problem is one of ratio. These textual/critical analy-
ses wouldn't be so potentially limiting if they were more frequently
balanced with other ways of writing about popular culture. One
alternate direction is summed up under the loose banner of fandom
studies.

    In fandom studies, textual critique takes a backseat to observ-
ing how texts are reacted to, invested in, and made part of fans'
identities and daily lives. While textual critique often assumes a
text's particular effects, fandom studies goes to the source and
lets fans and their practices speak for themselves (though still
filtered through the critical lens of the observer). Fandom writ-
ing also brings a myriad of possibilities to the classroom. Students
can write ethnographic research reports on face-to-face or digital
communities that chart the movement of writing practices within
a network of fan activity. Fan fiction can be analyzed (and even
compared to the original work) as an exercise in learning style and
voice. The clever and surprising alterations in fan fiction also have
much to teach about creativity and invention. Finally, fandom offers
avenues to analyze or produce transliteracy--the process of writ-
ing across different media with a variety of tools. For example, The
Lizzie Bennet Diaries is a popular YouTube channel that video blogs
(vlogs) the modernized lives of characters from Pride and Prejudice.
Along with the vlogs, the characters use Twitter and Google+,
which allows fans to co-create and shape the ongoing story.

    Popular culture may also be written about in ways that go
beyond the confines of textual content. Lawrence Grossberg
argues that outside the actual content being considered, the plea-
sure people take in popular culture, is primarily based in affective
investments. Affect (admittedly a complex concept too broad for
full exploration here) can aptly be understood as the motivating
force that adds intensity to our daily interactions and subsequently
206 Bad Ideas

leads to an individual's sense of what matters--the feeling of life.
Obviously, textual and ideological content sometimes matter in
our enjoyment or dislike of a text; however, they are just two pieces
of the puzzle because affect privileges the depth and complexity of
feeling over textual meaning. Grossberg suggests that our encoun-
ters with popular texts are intensified (or come to matter) by the
complex investments of emotion, passion, mood, and energy that
we bring to them in the process of actively integrating popular texts
into our identities and social lives. This is the element of popular
culture consumption missed in a million close, textual readings.
This is where textual meaning is merely a starting place for a text's
integration into a person's identity and social performance.

     So what does affective popular culture writing look like? Such
writing is less concerned with criticism and more focused on what
the text means to the author's life. The writing is more personally
revealing and socially inviting as it attempts to chart the author's
investment in a text, while simultaneously inviting the audience
to recognize themselves and reflect on their own relationship to
the subject matter. Put differently, affective writing shows authors
speaking directly for the texts that usually speak for them. The
work of Chuck Klosterman, a pop culture essayist, provides an apt
example. Though Klosterman does not avoid textual criticism and
cultural effect (as in his essay critiquing how MTV's The Real World
created "one-dimensional personalities"), he consistently connects
pop culture to his personal experiences in a memoir-like style.
Whether he's writing an ode to the universality of Billy Joel, analyz-
ing how porn feeds our need for amateur celebrities, noting how
people dismiss country music to sound cool, or what he learned
from extensively playing The Sims video game, Klosterman's work
highlights how popular culture makes us feel, makes us connect,
and makes us discuss.

     Embracing affect leads to a more personal style of student
writing about pop culture but does not have to lead to completely
subjective journaling (not that there's anything wrong with that
either). Though students are encouraged to write about their
participation and engagement with popular culture, the focus is
more on the intensity and complexity of that enjoyment. Pleasure
(and distaste) is a complicated orientation that, from an affective
perspective, is created by any number of extratextual features: early
memories of the text (or its genre), opinions about the texts' fans,
how the text is publically disseminated, public images/narratives
of the artist, and ways the text encourages social investment. By the
                                                                         About Genres 207

nature of affect, some of these aspects will necessarily matter more
or less. As student writings map this complex web of personal/
social investments (intensely engaging with some while possibly
ignoring others), the writer understands that textual effects and
reactions (plus the motivations texts may or may not spur) are
often unpredictable, contradictory, and incomplete. Such a lesson
is fundamentally important when a purely textual focus often
implicitly teaches that writing has a unified effect and preferred
interpretation.

    Textual/critical analysis certainly has an important place.
However, as the dominant form of writing about popular culture,
it often fails to account for the ways pop culture is used when
the viewer isn't specifically focused on critique. Pop culture is a
complex space that creates diverse, contradictory, and messy ways
to consume, participate, identify, discuss, and make meaning. And
pop culture is too entrenched in the daily lives of millions to let
one type of writing oversell its importance. Through balancing pop
culture use in the classroom, students continue to learn analyti-
cal criticism while simultaneously being awarded for their current
expertise and complex relationships with the source material.

    For more information on the history of popular culture analysis
and criticism, see Culture, Media, Language (Routledge), which charts
the theories and methodologies of The Centre for Contemporary
Cultural Studies throughout the 1970s. Though obviously not
the only group of thinkers to influence how pop culture became
a subject for textual criticism, many of the school's members and
writings form important historical touchstones for the type of
analysis critiqued in this chapter. The book includes Stuart Hall's
(director of the Centre from 1974-1979) famous work, "Encoding/
Decoding," which highlights how cultural producers create and
distribute ideology and meanings through texts that readers can
either accept/naturalize or critique/resist.

    For more on the theories and methods of fandom studies,
Henry Jenkins is arguably the most well-known name in what
is often a diverse field. His books, Textual Poachers: Television Fans
and Participatory Culture (Routledge) and Fans, Bloggers, and Gamers:
Media Consumers in a Digital Age (NYU Press), both allow textual crit-
icism to take a backseat to the practices and dispositions of fans.
For a broader take on fandom studies as a whole, Mark Duffett's

Understanding Fandom: An Introduction to the Study of Media Fan Culture
(Bloomsbury) explores fan stereotypes, representations, and prac-
tices while citing many thinkers in the field along the way. His
chapter, "Beyond the Text" is most applicable to this chapter, in
that, it explores how criticism and analysis alone will always miss
out on the lived experience of the text under scrutiny.

     As this chapter mentions, affect theory is complex and really
needs a fuller study to appreciate both its usefulness and limita-
tions. Lawrence Grossberg's Bringing it All Back Home: Essays on
Cultural Studies (Duke University Press) collects some of his earli-
est writings on the relationship between affect and pop culture
consumption and enjoyment. But for a more current take on
competing definitions and applications of affect theory, Melissa
Gregg and Gregory J. Seigworth's collection, The Affect Theory Reader
(Duke University Press), probes much deeper into the nuances
and ramifications of this pre-conscious, intensity producing force
that shapes our attachments and affinities for popular culture's
offerings.

THE FIVE-PARAGRAPH ESSAY IS
RHETORICALLY SOUND

    Quentin Vieregge

    The five-paragraph essay (5PE) doesn't have many vocal
defenders in Departments of English in higher education, but for
some instructors, the 5PE remains a useful tool in the pedagogi-
cal kit. Most college writing instructors have eschewed the 5PE,
contending that it limits what writing can be, constricts writers'
roles, and even arbitrarily shapes writers' thoughts. Yet, defenders
of the 5PE counter that beginning writers need the guidance and
structure that it affords. It works, they say, and it gives writers a
place from which to start.

    The 5PE may sound familiar. In its most basic form, it is an
introduction, three points, and a conclusion. Students are often
given a topic to discuss, a passage to respond to, or a question
to answer. The introduction and body paragraphs typically follow
prescribed conventions regardless of content. For instance, the
introduction has an attention-getter and explains what others
have said about the topic, and the thesis usually comes close to
the end of the paragraph. Each of the body paragraphs has a topic
sentence that makes a claim that can be backed up with evidence
and that refers back to the thesis. Each topic sentence is followed
by sentences that provide evidence and reinforce the thesis. The
body paragraphs end with a wrap-up sentence. The conclusion
reminds the reader of the main idea, summarizes the main points,
and might even leave the reader with one lasting impression.

    If all that sounds familiar, then it might be because you were
taught the 5PE. Defenders of the 5PE can sometimes be found in
high schools or two-year colleges, where they might work with
students who struggle with writing or are learning English as a
second language. One such teacher, David Gugin, writes about how
210 Bad Ideas

the five-paragraph model benefits students learning English as a
second language. Like many proponents of the 5PE, he assumes
that the main impediment to expressing an idea is knowing how to
organize it. As he puts it, "Once they have the vessel, so to speak,
they can start thinking more about what to fill it with."

     This type of metaphor abounds. Byung-In Seo compares writing
to building a house: One builds a basic structure and the individ-
ual spark comes from personalizing the details, either decorating
the house or the content of the essay. She refers particularly to her
experience with at-risk students, usually meaning students who
come into college without the writing skills needed to immediately
dive into college-level work. Similarly, Susanna L. Benko describes
the 5PE as scaffolding that can either enhance or hinder student
learning. A scaffold can be useful as construction workers move
about when working on a building, but it should be removed when
the building can stand on its own; the problem, as Benko observes,
is when neither teacher nor student tears down the scaffold.

     Here is the thing, though: When writers (and critics) talk
about the 5PE, they're not really talking about five paragraphs any
more than critics or proponents of fast-food restaurants are talking
about McDonald's. Most defenders of the 5PE will either explic-
itly or implicitly see the sentence, the paragraph, and the essay as
reflections of each other. Just as an essay has a thesis, a paragraph
has a topic sentence; just as a paper has evidence to support it, a
paragraph has detail. An essay has a beginning, middle, and end;
so does a paragraph. To quote a line from William Blake, to be a
defender of the 5PE is "To see a World in a Grain of Sand." There
are circles within circles within circles from this perspective. If you
take this approach to writing, form is paramount. Once you under-
stand the form, you can say anything within it.

     This focus on form first (and on the use of the 5PE) is a hall-
mark of what composition scholars call the current-traditional
approach to writing instruction. The current-traditional approach
is traceable to the late 19th century, but still persists today in the
5PE and in writing assignments and textbooks organized around
a priori modes of writing (the modes being definition, argument,
exposition, and narrative). Current-traditional rhetoric valorizes
form, structure, and arrangement over discovering and developing
ideas. In current-traditional pedagogy, knowledge does not need
to be interpreted or analyzed, but merely apprehended. Writing
processes are mostly about narrowing and defining ideas and about
applying style as external dressing to a finished idea.

    Detractors of the 5PE claim that it all but guarantees that
writing will be a chore. What fun is it to write when you have no
choices, when the shape of your words and thoughts are controlled
by an impersonal model that everyone uses, but only in school?
Teaching the 5PE is like turning students into Charlie Chaplin's
character from Modern Times, stuck in the gears of writing. The
5PE allegedly dehumanizes people. A number of writing special-
ists from University of North Carolina-Charlotte wrote an arti-
cle called, "The Five-Paragraph Essay and the Deficit Model of
Education." One of their critiques is that this model means that
students aren't taught to think and feel fully; rather they're taught
to learn their place as future workers in an assembly line econ-
omy: topic sentence, support, transition, repeat. Finally, as several
writing instructors have observed, the 5PE doesn't comport with
reality. Who actually writes this way? Who actually reads this
way? Does anyone care if an essay in The Atlantic or David Sedaris's
non-fiction collection Me Talk Pretty One Day doesn't follow some
prescriptive model? If the model doesn't connect to how people
actually write when given a choice, then how useful can it be?

    Well, as it happens, formulaic writing has some support. Two
such people who support it are Gerald Graff and Cathy Birkenstein,
coauthors of one of a celebrated writing textbook, They Say/I Say.
Graff and Birkenstein's book rests on the assumption that all
writers--especially skilled writers--use templates, which they've
learned over time. For instance, there are templates for thesis
sentences, templates for counterarguments, templates for rebut-
tals, templates for introducing quotes, and templates for explaining
what quotations mean. One example from their book is this: "While
they rarely admit as much, __________ often take for granted that
_______," which is a template students might use to begin writ-
ing their paper. Students are supposed to plug their own thoughts
into the blanks to help them express their thoughts. Graff and
Birkenstein tackle the issue of whether templates inhibit creativ-
ity. They make several of the same arguments that proponents
of the 5PE make: Skilled writers use templates all the time; they
actually enhance creativity; and they're meant to guide and inspire
rather than limit. This doesn't mean Graff and Birkenstein love the
5PE, though. In an article in The Chronicle of Higher Education, they
contend that templates are an accurate reflection of how people
write because templates are dialogic, but the 5PE is not.

    Formulas, including templates, can be effective, and arbitrary
formulas can be useful under the right circumstances too. They can
212 Bad Ideas

be useful if they are used as a point-of-inquiry, meaning if writers
use them as a starting place rather than a destination when writing.
In what ways does the five-paragraph model work for this partic-
ular assignment? How should I deviate from it? Should I have an
implied thesis rather than an explicit one?

     Now, you might be thinking, that's well and good for begin-
ning students, but what about advanced students or professionals?
They never use formulas. Well, when my proposal for this piece
was accepted, the two editors sent me explicit instructions about
how to organize the essay. They divided their instructions into
"first paragraph," "middle paragraphs," and "later paragraphs,"
and then instructions about what comes after the essay. Within
each part, they gave specific directions; everything was spelled out.
I had a problem; I planned to argue in favor of the five-paragraph
essay, so I couldn't use their formula, which presupposed I would
argue against the bad idea.

     Hmm. That conundrum required me to ask myself questions,
to inquire. How should I innovate from the model? How should I
not? Their prescriptive advice was a point-of-inquiry for me that
forced me to think rhetorically and creatively. Maybe the five-para-
graph model can be a point-of-inquiry--a way to start asking ques-
tions about rhetoric and writing. When I wrote this piece, I asked
myself, "Why do the editors want me to write using a specific
format?" And I then asked, "In what ways does this format prevent
or enable me from making my point?" Finally, I asked, "In what
ways can I exploit the tension between what they want me to do
and what I feel I must do?" Asking these questions forced me to
think about audience and purpose. But, perhaps more crucially, I
was forced to think of the editors' purpose, not just my own. By
understanding their purpose, the format was more than an arbi-
trary requirement but an artifact indicating a dynamic rhetorical
context that I, too, played a role in.

     Once I understood the purpose behind the format for this essay,
I could restructure it in purposeful and creative ways. The 5PE
follows the same logic. Teachers often, mistakenly, think of it as
an arbitrary format, but it's only arbitrary if students and teachers
don't converse and reflect on its purpose. Once students consider
their teacher's purpose in assigning it, then the format becomes
contextualized in consideration of audience, purpose, and context,
and students are able to negotiate the expectations of the model
with their own authorial wishes.

THE FIVE-PARAGRAPH ESSAY
TRANSMITS KNOWLEDGE

    Susan Naomi Bernstein and Elizabeth Lowry

     "But I learned how to write an essay in high school! All you
need is five-paragraphs with five to eleven sentences per paragraph.
Why am I even taking this class?"

     Most first year composition instructors have, at one time or
another, heard this complaint from a student, who has been taught
that writing should be no more complicated than knocking out
the requisite five-paragraphs: In your first paragraph, warn your
audience that you are planning to make no more (or less) than
three points which they will know to look for in paragraphs two,
three, and four respectively. After that, use the fifth paragraph to
remind your audience of the three points you just made. For first-
year college students, the five-paragraph essay is considered to be
a kind of catch-all for the would-be writer, a formula that students
are often taught works for any kind of essay, on any topic, upon any
occasion. Except when it doesn't.

     We argue that the emphasis on the five-paragraph essay at the
high school level is emblematic of what internationally well-re-
garded Brazilian educator and activist Paulo Freire refers to as
the banking model of education. According to Freire, the bank-
ing model is a form of teaching and learning in which knowledge
is understood to be a kind of currency that is literally deposited
into students' heads by an expert. The banking model is promoted
by an educational system that relies on standardized tests and
other quantitative methods of analysis. Within the banking model,
students accrue facts and formulas like interest, drawing on that
interest when it is time to show what they have (l)earned from
school. Another way to conceive of the banking model could be
garbage in, garbage out. Or, as Freire himself puts it: "The more
                                                                         About Genres 215

students work at storing the deposits entrusted to them, the less
they develop the critical consciousness which would result from
their intervention in the world as transformers of that world. The
more completely they accept the passive role imposed on them,
the more they tend simply to adapt to the world as it is and to
the fragmented view of reality deposited in them." Here, Freire
references storage, suggesting an eventual reallocation (or trading)
of information that is presented as being empirical and objective.
Freire critiques this model of education because it renders learn-
ers passive and dependent on the authority figures from whom the
knowledge is ostensibly disseminated. Students educated within
this system can too easily become complacent, accepting whatever
they are told without question. Just as disconcertingly, students
are not always supplied with knowledge that they can use in mean-
ingful ways outside of school.

    If our education system promotes modes of learning that apply
only to school but not to the rest of our lives, chances are minimal
that any of us will retain what we have learned beyond our lives out
of school. In a similar vein, the five-paragraph essay is an exem-
plar of the banking model of education as a means of demonstrat-
ing how information is stored, rather than as a means by which
students can interrogate and transform the world around them. To
be successful in the banking model of education, students merely
need to regurgitate (in some recognizable form) the knowledge
that has been deposited in their heads. The five-paragraph essay
is that recognizable form. Easy to read, easy to grade, and easy to
teach.

    The five-paragraph essay is widely believed to be useful in
terms of making students assimilate, absorb, store, categorize, and
organize new knowledge, but it is not useful in terms of getting
students to actually use that knowledge creatively or critically for
productive problem posing and solving. In this sense, the idea of
knowledge transfer from high school to college via the five-para-
graph-essay form is untenable. Although popular wisdom holds
that assimilating some structural empirical knowledge of writing
will help to promote efficient knowledge transfer between high
school and college, in fact, the five-paragraph form can become a
limitation when students are confronted with various new struc-
tures of knowledge significant to post-secondary success.

    Put another way, knowledge is not meaningfully transferable
through the five-paragraph-essay form because the banking method
of education conceives both learning and students themselves
216 Bad Ideas

as products rather than as works in process. The five-paragraph
form emphasizes shutting down processes of inquiry--that is, it
dismisses the need for future conversation by providing the illusion
of having resolved complex problems. The role of the five-para-
graph essay in the move from high school to college is analogous to
using training wheels when learning to ride a bike. Useful--maybe
even necessary at first--but, as the rider becomes more proficient
and broaches more complex terrain, those little wheels will collect
debris, or become snagged on rocks. Thus, these once-useful train-
ing wheels become a liability. They may slow the rider down or,
when they catch on obstacles, may throw her from the bike. At
best they are a nuisance, while at worst they are a danger. Without
training wheels it may be tough to get started at the beginning of
a ride, but eventually we figure out how to do it. Bumpy rides may
pose a challenge, but they make us resilient.

     That said, at what point is it time to move away from the
five-paragraph essay? We believe that the time comes to move
away when one is focusing on a problem that defies pat answers.
That is, when working on a piece of writing that is designed with
a purpose beyond simply organizing information by reporting on
uncontroversial facts (e.g., "smoking is bad for you"). As soon as a
student is in a position to enter a process of inquiry to explore (and
perhaps offer solutions to) an issue that may provoke more ques-
tions and yield myriad answers, the five-paragraph format should
be thrown to the wind. We want authors to be resilient, to be inde-
pendent thinkers, to be problem solvers and interrogators. Such is
the purpose of teaching beyond the supposedly foolproof formula
of the five-paragraph theme. When students are challenged to write
beyond memorized formulas, to travel beyond the how of writing
to the why of writing, they learn skills of academic resiliency that
will transfer to college and beyond. Freire also addresses this. To
counter the banking model of education, he offered the idea of
problem posing, in which students take on problems and issues from
their everyday lives and from their communities. Such problems,
Freire believes, would engage students' hearts and minds and
would offer critical motivation and support for learning rather than
(l)earning inside and outside the classroom.

     Susan recounts the story of a time when the five-paragraph
formula seemed helpful--at least at first. She had applied to
teach in an emergency teaching-certification program in a large
Northeastern city. She met with other applicants in a school cafe-
teria to complete a series of tests including an essay-writing test.
                                                                         About Genres 217

The applicants were to respond to the question, "What are the
three most important skills that teachers need in our city's class-
rooms?" Of course, this topic easily lent itself to a five-paragraph
essay: An introduction (including a thesis listing the three main
skills), one skill per paragraph, and a conclusion that repeated the
most important points. Susan fit the essay together as neatly as
pieces of a jigsaw puzzle, robotically meeting unarticulated expec-
tations. Just as the jigsaw puzzle encourages the assemblage of a
mass-produced factory image already conceived by another entity,
the five-paragraph essay seemed to be prompting the construction
of an argument that was always already anticipated.

    The testing session seemed an appropriate analogy for writ-
ing instruction itself. Administrators offered a writing test that
implied a five-paragraph response, a response that could be easily
vetted to identify uniformity and adherence to conventions.
Applicants who followed these unspoken rules would be deemed
qualified to teach the five-paragraph essay to the next generation of
students. Anyone who interrogated this standard method for writ-
ing, whether teacher or student, need not apply.

    After the essay-writing test ended, the applicants met for a
short break and discussed with one another the essays they had just
written. Somehow everyone had automatically done what Susan
had done. All their essays sounded remarkably similar, except for
one applicant who asked in disbelief, "We were supposed to divide
that essay into paragraphs?" The rest of the applicants exchanged
glances. In her head, Susan answered, "Well, yes. If we choose not
to think outside the box. And if we expect every writer to follow
the same formula rather than the more complicated nuances that
come from real thinking." Even as the directions for the writing
test did not mention paragraphing explicitly, the five-paragraph
theme seemed implicit for structuring an effective response.

    The fact that the emergency certification applicants were slated
to teach in the city's most at-risk schools was also disconcerting.
The banking model of education depends upon formulas such as
the five-paragraph essay to deliver its most efficient lessons, espe-
cially in working-class schools, in which teachers instruct students
to follow the rules. This "hidden curriculum," as Jean Anyon
describes it, rewards "rote behavior," readying working-class chil-
dren "for future wage labor that is mechanical and routine." Such
instruction replicates, rather than interrogates, U.S. social class
structures. The link between the banking model of education and
classism has been drawn because the banking model does not
218 Bad Ideas

encourage students to challenge the status quo by entering into a
process of inquiry. Instead, the banking method suggests that the
knowledge conferred upon students (or deposited within them) is
all those students will need in order to be successful. In fact, this
is not the case. Students need to think critically and creatively in
order to become community leaders and to gain social and politi-
cal power.

     Critical thinking should begin as early as possible--and it
should begin by challenging the five-paragraph form. For exam-
ple, students could be asked how they might rewrite five-para-
graph essays in more imaginative ways. What happens if they
add more paragraphs? What happens if they remove some? What
happens if they begin to change the order of the paragraphs? How
might meaning change and how might students better control the
intended message of their writing? After all, meaningful writing is
far from formulaic.

THE FIVE-PARAGRAPH THEME
TEACHES "BEYOND THE TEST"

    Bruce Bowles, Jr.

     "Tell them what you are going to say, say it, tell them what you
said." I remember learning this strategy from my English teacher
my senior year of high school. While mentioning this might seem
like a cheap shot at a former teacher, it is quite the contrary--he
was one of the best teachers I have ever had. This strategy was
taught to us as a general format to follow, yet modify, for a variety
of writing tasks. However, with the increase in high-stakes test-
ing that education has seen over the last 10-15 years, this strat-
egy frequently becomes a rather rigid, prescriptive formula: the
five-paragraph theme (FPT).

     Most of us are familiar with this structure, even if we do not
refer to it as the five-paragraph theme. Traditionally, the FPT
contains an introductory paragraph that moves from a general over-
view of a topic to an explicit thesis statement that highlights three
main points. The three supporting paragraphs each take up one of
these three main points, beginning with a topic sentence and then
moving into more detailed description. Finally, the FPT ends with
a standard conclusion that is, oftentimes, merely a restatement of
the thesis statement and reiteration of the three main points. (Yes,
this theme is referred to as a five-paragraph essay, FPE, elsewhere
in this book, but the concept is exactly the same. That it goes by
different names while having the same outcome shows its ubiquity
in school-based writing situations.)

     Advocates for the FPT contend that it is a phenomenal tool
that teaches all students a basic organizational structure that can
be built upon in the future and, in addition, is especially useful for
teaching students who struggle with basic organization when writ-
ing. While such a view may indeed have a small degree of merit, the
                                                                         About Genres 221

persistence and popularity of the FPT has a more sinister source--
standardized testing. With its mechanical formula, the FPT is
the perfect vehicle to ensure inter-rater reliability (consistency
amongst test graders), allowing for both efficient and economic
scoring sessions for testing companies. Essentially, the FPT influ-
ences writing instruction as a result of what is referred to as assess-
ment washback, with standardized testing indirectly dictating curric-
ulum. Thus, the FPT has become the primary genre, not because
of its educational merit or real-world applicability, but as a result
of its pragmatic benefits for testing companies. Even worse, as a
result of its rigidity and the manner in which testing companies
assess the FPT, it imparts a hollow, formulaic notion of writing to
students that emphasizes adherence to generic features rather than
focusing on quality of content, informed research practices, effec-
tive persuasive techniques, and attention to the specific contexts in
which students will compose.

    To understand why the FPT is immensely beneficial for test-
ing companies, it is essential to understand the concept of inter-
rater reliability. The original attempts at assessing writing ability
on large-scale, standardized assessments relied on multiple-choice
questions that dealt with grammar and stylistics primarily.
However, such assessment methods were scrutinized since they
did not actually have students compose (and, as other chapters
in this collection discuss, acontextual grammar instruction that
multiple choice tests rely on doesn't improve writing). Such meth-
ods were critiqued as lacking construct validity; in essence, they
were not measuring the actual construct (writing ability) they were
purported to measure. Instead, they merely focused on specific
skills that did not reflect one's overall ability to write.

    As a result, testing companies were forced to transition to holis-
tic scoring--evaluating writing as a whole as opposed to its isolated
components. Yet, this presented quite a dilemma. At its core, the
evaluation of writing is a subjective, interpretative endeavor. After
all, we have all disagreed at one time or another with an friend or
colleague about the quality of a particular book, newspaper article,
and so on.

    However, such disagreement is especially problematic for the
standardized testing community. How can a standardized writing
assessment be an accurate reflection of students' writing ability
if the people scoring the students' writing disagree wildly as to
the quality of it? Thus, it is necessary for these testing companies
to produce consistency amongst scores. That's what inter-rater
222 Bad Ideas

reliability is meant to do--create reliability among the raters, and
it is paramount for testing companies to justify the accuracy and
fairness of their writing assessments. At its core, inter-rater reli-
ability is a measure of how often readers' scores agree on a specific
piece of writing. An inter-rater reliability of 1 indicates perfect
agreement and, for standardized testing purposes, an inter-rater
reliability of .8 (80% agreement) is usually seen as the benchmark
for reliability. However, obtaining a .8 inter-rater reliability is not
as easy as it may seem. Even on a holistic scale of one to six (one
poorest, six highest), raters will frequently disagree.

     As a general rule, the more rigid and precise the criteria for
evaluation of a piece of writing, the more likely a high inter-rater
reliability will be achieved. This is why the FPT is so efficient in
scoring standardized writing assessments; with its prescriptive
formula and distinct features, raters can be normed (i.e., trained
to agree) on the presence and quality of these rather specific
features. Is there a clear and concise thesis statement with three
main points? Check. Does each supporting paragraph have a topic
sentence and move into a more detailed description? Check. Did
the conclusion effectively restate the argument? Check.

     Although the scoring session for a standardized writing assess-
ment may not necessarily be as mechanical in nature, the general
premise still holds. If raters can be trained to identify specific
features or qualities in writing, they will be more likely to agree on
an overall score; this agreement saves testing companies time and
money since they do not need to resolve disagreements between
raters. While such a practice may seem to be merely a practical solu-
tion to a troubling assessment problem, it actually has profound
consequences for writing instruction at the elementary, secondary,
and collegiate levels.

     Ideally, assessments should reflect the curriculum taught in
schools. Yet, when high-stakes testing tethers students' scores
to school funding, teacher bonuses, students' acceptance to
colleges, and so on, the reverse frequently happens--the curric-
ulum taught in schools begins to align with the assessments. The
state of Florida provides an illustrative example of this. Surveying
students across four Florida high schools, Lisa Scherff and Carolyn
Piazza have found that persuasive and expository writing (styles
frequently associated with the FPT and standardized testing) were
heavily emphasized in the 9th and 10th grades, not surprisingly the
grades in which the students took the state's standardized writ-
ing test. Instead of receiving instruction on composing in a variety
                                                                         About Genres 223

of genres and for a variety of purposes, students are rigorously
drilled on how to effectively compose for the genre featured on the
state assessment, which--to no one's surprise--is a five-paragraph
persuasive or expository essay.

    Beyond restricting writing instruction to a formulaic genre, this
assessment washback has other negative effects on students' writ-
ing development as well. Prominent composition scholars Chris
Anson and Les Perelman (featured in this collection) have found
that students can be coached to perform better on these standard-
ized writing assessments by following a few general guidelines:
Follow the structure of the FPT, write more words (length of essay
tends to directly correlate with score), use big words (the higher
the vocabulary the better, regardless of whether the words are used
correctly), use multiple examples (whether they are relevant to the
overall argument or not), and provide a lot of supporting details
and evidence, whether they are factually correct or not, since raters
are trained not to account for factual accuracy. (One of the students
Perelman coached wrote that the Great Depression was primarily
a result of American competition with Communist Russia, admit-
ting that he made something up since he could not remember the
specific details.) These standardized writing assessments reinforce
notions about quantity over quality in writing. I believe it is fair to
surmise that most English teachers would not support these prac-
tices as methods for improving writing!

    The simple solution to all of these problems would appear to
be merely reducing our reliance on, or removing, the FPT from our
curricula. However, as long as policy makers rely on standardized
writing tests, and those writing assessments rely on the FPT, such
a change in curriculum will not be possible. The manner in which
we assess writing will always exert a tremendous influence over
how we teach writing. Since, for inter-rater reliability and economic
purposes, standardized testing relies on the FPT, the only sure-fire
way to reduce--or eradicate--the use of the FPT in our curricu-
lums is to reduce or eradicate our reliance on standardized testing.

    Over the last two decades, we have consistently been fed a lie
that teacher evaluation is biased; as a result, standardized test-
ing is necessary to hold schools accountable for student learning.
This cunning ruse has deceived us into believing that standardized
assessment evaluates student learning better and predicts future
growth and performance more accurately. The logic is that teachers
and administrators are biased; standardized testing provides a level
playing field for everyone involved.
224 Bad Ideas

     And yet, surprisingly (or not surprisingly), the reverse is true,
at least when it comes to predicting future academic success. Pop
quiz: Which measure is the most accurate predictor of high-school
students' success at the collegiate level? If you answered SAT
scores or performance on state-wide assessments, you would be
wrong. Time and time again, studies show that a student's high
school GPA is the most accurate predictor of collegiate success!
Essentially, the supposedly biased and poorly trained local educa-
tors are the most apt at assessing students' growth, learning, and
future performance. The expertise and localized knowledge of our
teachers is rendered irrelevant by standardized testing; in an effort
to remove the purported bias of local educators, standardized test-
ing removes a wealth of local knowledge and expertise from the
process of assessing writing.

     Transitioning to localized writing assessments would not only
take advantage of educators' local knowledge and expertise, it
would enable more authentic, valid forms of writing assessment.
Students could produce capstone projects that require them to
compose in genres and media that adequately reflect the compos-
ing challenges they will face in college or their future professions.
Writing portfolios would enable local educators to assess how
students perform on a multitude of writing tasks across a vari-
ety of contexts. Electronic portfolios would even allow students to
practice technological literacy skills. Local educators could work
collaboratively with state and federal agencies to create challenging
writings assessments that would accurately reflect the composing
challenges students will face in their futures, while ensuring over-
sight to prevent any possible bias or padding of the results of these
assessments.

     As long as we remain tethered to standardized testing as our
primary method for assessing students' writing proficiency, the
FPT will exert a prominent influence over curricula. However, by
allowing local educators--who work diligently with our students
and children throughout the school year and know students' abil-
ities and needs best--to play a prominent role in developing and
administering such localized assessments, more valid writing
assessments can be developed that will influence curriculum in a
positive, educationally productive fashion.

RESEARCH STARTS WITH ANSWERS

    Alison C. Witte

     The research paper has become a rite of passage where students
choose a topic (or are assigned one) about which they present a
claim, and then look for ways to confirm it with evidence located
through some ambiguous thing or process called research. One of
the primary problems with the research paper is that it teaches
students that to do research is to look things up--to use the library
or the Internet. Skills for locating information are essential to
being a successful researcher, as is familiarity with the library and
the rich variety of sources available, but it represents only a small
part of the research process.

     So, what does it really mean to do research? Research is a three-
stage process: (1) seeking information that is new to the researcher,
(2) interpreting, evaluating, and organizing that information, and
(3) reporting that information to others to affect some action.
Richard Larson emphasizes that the nature of research is active.
The researcher--whether student, academic, or professional--
takes an active role in seeking. Seeking is not limited to locating
what exists, but also extends to creating new data or information
in service of answering a question or solving a problem.

     Perhaps some of the confusion over the role of research in writ-
ing, and the writing process, comes from the structure of classical
argument that is often included as part of the organizational pattern
for the research paper. When argument is taught, it's frequently
connected to the historical practices of Greek and Roman rheto-
ric. Rhetoric, the study of the ways to use language to persuade
a listener, was one of the core subjects of formalized education
in Greek and Roman times and was seen as a necessary compo-
nent of democratic citizenship. The study of rhetoric focused on
argument as an oral practice of making clear claims in an effort
to persuade. Speakers would present their positions, respond to
                                                                         About Genres 227

challenges to their positions, listen to speakers presenting opposing
positions, challenge those positions, and adjust their own claims
and approaches. Argument was the primary means of conducting
governing and legal activities, so participants were expected to be
knowledgeable in both the conventions of arguing and in posses-
sion of acceptable, logical evidence to support their claims. The
process was messy, time-consuming, and in some cases, not the
most efficient way to conduct business or legal proceedings. It was
viewed as a dynamic interaction that involved speakers going back
and forth, and sometimes round and round, in an effort to come to
a conclusion. Classical argument, in its basic principles, was meant
to be a continual process rather than strictly a completed product.

    Oral argument was a cornerstone of university curricula
through the Middle Ages, the Renaissance, and into the 18th
century. Written forms of argumentation did not take precedence
in university settings until the 1800s, and coinciding with increas-
ing specialization found both within and outside of the university.
The research paper replaced oral exams and public speaking as a
measure of intellect; and it was initially successful at fostering and
promoting the creation of knowledge in local communities. The
use of the research paper proliferated until it became the primary
genre students write--a genre less about creating knowledge and
more about compiling it.

    Subsequently, the research paper became a tool for teaching
students how to use the library, find the right words, and skillfully
search through the words of others. Such a task eliminates the
writer's voice from the conversation--as they are not required to
participate in the discussion of the subject at hand, but simply to
report what others have said about it. Because they are not active
participants in the conversation, when students are taught by their
textbooks and teachers to make a claim supported by reasons at an
early stage of developing their argument, they have no real stake
in the claim they make, nor any real grounds for making such a
claim. Their choices are often arbitrary and rote, based in what
they believe they know, in what they are comfortable with, or in
what they believe will lead to many easy-to-find, readily accessible
sources. They see no purpose for their claim other than complet-
ing the assignment. Nonetheless, this claim becomes the thesis
statement of the paper and is to be the foundation of the work that
follows.

    Teaching students the purpose of doing research is supporting
an idea or belief one already holds is not teaching students about
228 Bad Ideas

research. In fact, the name research paper is, in itself, misleading,
as it implies that research is a practice only used in a particular
genre or instance, rather than as a fundamental element of nearly
all forms of academic, workplace, or personal writing. Researching
isn't meant to be a narrow task of looking up information, but
of creating and discovering new information in response to prob-
lems. Describing research in these limited terms does not prepare
students to participate in actual research in their courses of study
and in their professional fields.

     A more useful approach to teaching students about research,
and how to do research, begins with re-thinking how we define
research and research skills. If research is the process by which
a researcher seeks new information, makes sense of that infor-
mation, and then reports that information to someone else, then
research ought to begin with a question, not an answer. Students
need to be taught not to look for answers, but to look for problems
that need solving and for questions that need to be answered.

     Rather than limiting the conception of research to a search for
certain facts or pieces of evidence or to a trip to the library, it needs
to include the processes of primary research--research collected
directly by the researcher using tools he or she has designed to
find the information needed to answer a particular question. I am
not suggesting that secondary research--the locating of previously
published materials--be eliminated, but that it not be presented as
the paramount form of research, as is often done in the research
paper. Secondary research is a key part of the research process and
usually precedes any primary research. Once a researcher has a
question, it's logical to see if and how others might have answered
the same question. To be successful, students, and any researchers,
must have a working knowledge of the question they are investi-
gating. However, that information serves as a starting point for
researchers, who then ask further questions to spur and design
their own primary research.

     Primary research provides students with opportunities to
engage with people around them, to work collaboratively, to think
critically about the best way to accomplish the task of getting the
information they need to answer their questions, to learn how to
manage and organize data, and to learn to interpret data. Because
students need to work with people around them to develop ideas
and locate problems to research and solve, primary research
encourages students to see the ways in which research might help
or benefit the people around them in their local communities.
                                                                         About Genres 229

Additionally, working on primary research as a component of a
class engages students with one another as they share their strug-
gles, progress, and successes. They have the opportunity to learn
both from their own experiences and each other. Students engaged
in primary research also have to design their own tools (surveys,
interview questions, experiments, etc.) to accomplish their partic-
ular goals. They can test versions and make modifications, adapt-
ing to changes in their research question, or problems that arise
during the process. The need for such adaptability breaks students
of the conception that there is a way to get the answers that they
need, preparing them to be adaptable in situations beyond the
classroom.

    Once the definition of research shifts from information locat-
ing and idea confirmation to information generating and problem
solving, the ways students write about research needs to change.
The genre of the academic research report requires students to
present the findings of their research in a clear, logical fashion,
while also documenting their processes and opening their work to
be critically examined by others. The research report also typically
necessitates a literature review--a collection of published and cited
research related to the topic at hand--that provides the impetus
for the student's project and to show how the project extends what
has already been done and provides new insight or knowledge.
Thus, the research report gives students practice at both primary
and secondary research, while allowing them to pursue genuine
research questions.

    Having students design and pursue genuine research projects
that generate rather than simply locate information teaches them
that research is about innovation--about doing what hasn't been
done. It also demonstrates to them that research is a useful tool
not only for learning, but also for action. Information gained from
research can be used to impact their schools, homes, workplaces,
and communities. Then, much as the ancient Greeks viewed clas-
sical argument as an essential part of citizenship, participating
in genuine research and research writing becomes a key part of
engaged and productive citizenship in the 21st century.

RESEARCH STARTS WITH A THESIS
STATEMENT

    Emily A. Wierszewski

    Our collective belief in the importance of definite answers
impacts many areas of our lives, including how we understand the
process and purpose of research. Specifically, it leads to a thesis-first
research model in which research is only used to verify our existing
ideas or theses. (Alison Witte discusses this bad idea in a previous
chapter.) In this model, there is no room for doubt or ambiguity.
We assume we need to know the answers to our problems or ques-
tions before the process gets underway, before we consult and eval-
uate what others have said.

    Research can be productively used in this way to verify assump-
tions and arguments. Sometimes what we need is just a little
support for an idea, a confirmation of the best approach to a prob-
lem, or the answer to simple questions. For example, we might
believe the new iPhone is the best smartphone on the market, and
use research on the phone's specs to prove we're right. This kind of
thesis-first approach to research becomes harmful, however, when
we assume that it is the only or the most valuable way to conduct
research. Evidence of this widespread assumption is easy to find. A
simple search for the research process on Google will yield multiple
hits hosted by academic institutions that suggest a researcher needs
a thesis early in the research process. For instance, the University
of Maryland University College's Online Guide to Writing and Research
suggests that a thesis should be developed as soon as source collec-
tion gets underway, though that thesis may change over time. In
the book, A Writing Process, author Vinetta Bell suggests that the
thesis-writing process begins during the "preliminary research"
stage. This strategy is endorsed by multiple research library
websites, such as the University of Minnesota.
232 Bad Ideas

     And yet, genuine inquiry--the kind of research that often
leads to new ideas and important choices--tends to begin with
unsettled problems and questions, rather than with thesis state-
ments and predetermined answers. Wernher von Braun, an engi-
neer whose inventions advanced the U.S. space program in the
mid-21st century, famously describes research as, "What I'm
doing when I don't know what I'm doing." The understanding
of research as discovery is echoed in the recent "Framework for
Information Literacy in Higher Education," a document authored
by the Association of College and Research Librarians (ACRL).
They write that research often begins with open-ended questions
that are "based on information gaps or reexamination of existing,
possibly conflicting, information." In other words, research isn't
just for backing up our hunches. It can, and should, also be used as
a method of investigating areas of uncertainty, curiosity, conflict,
and multiple perspectives.

     As the ACRL's framework also emphasizes, when research-
ers review published source material around their topic, points of
disagreement will be discovered; these points are expected as schol-
ars propose ideas to address complicated issues. When we are open
to selecting and engaging with these multiple published perspec-
tives in our research, we're also forced to consider how they extend
or challenge our beliefs and ideas about a topic. Considering all
sides, we can then make a more informed decision about our ques-
tions or topics.

     Another potential harm of the thesis-first model of research is
the attendant assumption that the research process is linear. In a
thesis-guided research process, a question is posed, an answer is
generated, and sources are found that match up with that answer.
Truthfully, research rarely progresses on an uncluttered path
toward a clear solution. Instead, research is a recursive process that
involves many diversions, bumps, and missteps. Clark College's
library website describes the research process as a daisy, rather
than a line. Like a daisy's petals, research is described as cyclical
and fluid. As we research, we may find ourselves returning to and
changing our question, or we may near the end of a project and
think we're done but discover we need to go back to find more or
better sources. The messiness of research requires us to be flexible,
often modifying our approaches along the way. When we enter the
research process with a narrow and rigid focus on our thesis, we
can become discouraged and inclined to abandon our ideas when
the research process does not unfold neatly.
                                                                         About Genres 233

    In place of a thesis-first model, we would be better served
to begin research with a question or a statement of a problem.
We should conduct research not just to back up our pre-exist-
ing assumptions and prove we're right about something, but also
when we feel curious or confused and do not have answers. Why
is something the way it is? Why doesn't the data quite add up? How could
something be changed for the better?

    When we understand research as a process of discovery rather
than a process of proof, we open ourselves up to be changed by
our research--to better our lives, our decisions, and our world. We
acknowledge that we do not have the only or the best answer to
every question, and that we might learn something from consider-
ing the ideas of others. While research definitely has the power to
impact our lives and beliefs, research doesn't always have to be life
altering. But in a thesis-first model where our only goal is just to
prove we're right, there is no possibility of being changed by our
research. Here's a practical example of the difference. Just imag-
ine the results of a research process beginning with a thesis like
"Human trafficking should have harsher legal penalties" versus one
that starts with an open-ended question like "Why does human
trafficking persist in the democratic nation of the United States?"
In the thesis-first model, a researcher would likely only encounter
sources that argue for her pre-existing belief: that harsher penal-
ties are needed. She would probably never be exposed to multi-
ple perspectives on this complex issue, and the result would just
be confirmation of her earlier beliefs. However, a researcher who
begins with an open-ended question motivated by curiosity, whose
goal is not to prove anything, but to discover salient ideas about a
human rights issue, has the chance to explore different thoughts
about human trafficking and come to her own conclusions as she
researches why it's a problem and what ought to be done to stop
it, not just create stronger consequences for it.

    Viewing research as a process of discovery allows us to accept
that not every question is answerable and that questions some-
times lead only to more questions. For instance, the researcher in
the previous paragraph exploring the issue of human trafficking
might find that there is no clear, single explanation for the preva-
lence of this human rights violation, and that she's interested to
know more about the role of immigration laws and human traf-
ficking--something she never even thought of before she did
her research. When researchers do discover answers, they may
find those answers are fluid and debatable. What we have at any
234 Bad Ideas

time is only a consensus between informed parties, and at any
time, new research or insights can cause that agreement to shift.
Kenneth Burke, a philosopher and literary critic, explains the
constructed nature of knowledge in his unending conversation meta-
phor. According to Burke, the moment in which a researcher reads
and participates in scholarship around the research topic or prob-
lem is just a speck on a continuum of conversation that has been
ongoing well before the researcher thought of the question, and
will continue long after the researcher has walked away from it. As
Burke writes, "The discussion is interminable."

     So how can we move toward embracing uncertainty? In his
book, A More Beautiful Question, Warren Berger suggests that parents
and those who work with young children can foster curiosity by
welcoming questions. Parents also need to learn to be comfort-
able with saying "I don't know" in response, rather than search-
ing for a simple answer. Berger also recommends that as children
go through school, parents and educators can work together to
support children's questioning nature, rather than always privileg-
ing definite answers. When students graduate and move into the
working world, employers can encourage them to ask questions
about policies, practices, and workplace content; employees should
be given freedom to explore those questions with research, which
can potentially lead to more sustainable and current policies, prac-
tices, and content. The same goes for civic and community life,
where any form of questioning or inquiry is often misconstrued as
a challenge to authority. To value questions more than answers in
our personal and professional lives requires a cultural shift.

     Although our culture would tell us that we have to know every-
thing, and that we should even begin a research project by know-
ing the answer to our question, there is obvious value in using
research as a tool to engage our curiosity and sense of wonder as
human beings--perhaps even to improve our lives or the lives of
others. If all researchers started the process with preconceived
answers, no new findings would ever come to be. In order to truly
learn about a topic or issue, especially when it involves important
decision making, we need to learn to embrace uncertainty and feel
comfortable knowing we might not always have an answer when
we begin a research project.

THE TRADITIONAL RESEARCH
PAPER IS BEST

    Alexandria Lockett

     To understand the research paper and its contemporary signif-
icance, we must acknowledge how the Internet makes the process
of research and of writing research much more complex. A vast
majority of Internet users use the web and social media multi-
ple times per day. Long gone are the days when one major func-
tion of the research paper was to bring students into contact with
libraries. Today's students need to also know how to navigate the
Internet--a vast digital source of information whose system archi-
tecture affects the work of teaching and research.

     Typically, a first-year college student's research paper assign-
ment might require 5-10 sources, whereas advanced students are
probably asked to cite no more than 30 sources. These figures
may stem from research concerns that emerged during an entirely
different technological history. This number makes sense if we
consider the physical labor involved in visiting the library, commu-
nicating with a librarian, finding the card catalog, writing down
serial numbers, walking up several flights of stairs, locating the
correct stack, browsing the stack, and using a step stool to reach
the source in question--rinse and repeat. These spatio-temporal
aspects of composing a research paper most likely affected source
selection. For example, some textbook writers used to complain
about how research papers often lacked primary sources and relied
on questionable secondary materials despite physical libraries'
numerous resources.

     The number of sources a paper should include remains an
essential guideline that defines the research paper, which affects
how students prioritize their efforts. Most college students will
not have to worry about physically setting foot in a library building
                                                                         About Genres 237

to meet the research paper's quantitative source requirement. In
fact, finding the number of sources is the easiest part for student
writers, because a broad search will take less than one full second
to retrieve millions and millions of sources on any given subject.

    Of course, finding sources may be easy, but strategically incor-
porating them into an argument may seem impossible to today's
writers. How could any teacher reasonably expect a student to come
up with a thesis when they are seconds away from an uncountable
selection of sources and communities of knowledge? What incen-
tive does any researcher have to make new ideas in the data deluge?
When almost anything that can be conceived is searchable via the
Internet, what is the researcher really responsible for? Verifying
data? Deliberating about its significance? Informing their social
media networks?

    Unfortunately, the labor involved in researching and using
the Internet for research tends to be ignored. Instructors may
underestimate the nuances of popular databases and overesti-
mate students' frequent use of databases as competency. However,
Internet research really is a lot of work. Researching "the research
paper" via Google, Google News, and Google Scholar retrieves
almost 19,000,000 results. Unaccompanied by quotes, the number
of results exceeds one billion. Without awareness of the impor-
tance of Boolean logic, or operators that affect the scale of results,
a researcher may find herself drowning in data. When plugged
into proprietary databases available to most college and university
students such as Proquest, JSTOR, ScienceDirect, and Academic
Search Complete, the research paper displays several thousands of
sources per database.

    Consuming data dumps, whether by the dozens, hundreds,
or thousands, would take decades to read, summarize, annotate,
interpret, and analyze. These processes do not include the creative
task of evaluating the patterns between data or learning more
about the backgrounds, values, and beliefs of their authors--all of
which were easy to take for granted when working with a limited
number of print sources. Therefore, the 21st-century politics of
research is defined by the problem of scope. There is simply too
much information.

    Although traditional research papers undoubtedly address the
problem of how to evaluate and integrate sources, a contemporary
first-year college writing student will probably be sensitive to her
limitations as a single writer. What kind of original contribution
can teachers reasonably expect the average high school or college
238 Bad Ideas

student to create that they can't instantly access via the Internet?
It hardly seems appropriate, or fair, to ask any student, regardless
of classification, to wade through oceanic swaths of online data for
the purposes of making an original contribution, as a single author,
to some public policy debate or academic discipline.

     Moreover, there are few incentives to ethically conduct research
when the paper is taught as a bureaucratic necessity of the high
school or college experience. I could wax poetic about the joys of
discovery and the wonderment of wandering aimlessly through
scholarly work, but the research paper does not tend to encourage
this openness. Students may believe that if they include a certain
number of sources of a particular kind, and use the instructor's
preferred documentation style, that their research paper will be
successful. Too often this simplistic approach is mistaken for lazi-
ness. But, most people cannot handle the chore of deciphering
the data deluge. Plagiarism, then, becomes a major effect of the
Internet's causal effect on teaching and learning the research paper.

     Thousands, if not millions, of students will use Google and
Wikipedia as first steps towards plagiarizing work--plunging into
an abyss of boredom or cultivating their curiosity about a subject.
Their teachers will obediently, and sometimes zealously, police
plagiarism with the assistance of Google's robust search engines
and Turnitin. Both the student and teacher will use social media
to talk about their frustrations and joys in real-time. The student's
plagiarism will most certainly deserve a status update, some likes,
and perhaps some comments. The teacher's boring instruction
and the difficulty of the assignment will end up discussed in text
messages, and who knows which social media platforms or blogs.
At worst, the student will complain about it to RateMyProfessor.
com or in the teacher's evaluations. These examples illustrate
that the Internet and mobile technologies extend the reach of the
research paper far beyond classrooms and institutions. In fact,
Research 2.0 converges with offline human activity, extending its
causal force across several media, very much affecting real life.

The Research Paper 2.0

     The entire Internet user experience is embedded in knowl-
edge economies, which impact how people learn. For example,
Internet users' attention is managed and directed by large private
corporations like Apple, Microsoft, Facebook, Amazon, and their
partnerships and affiliations with the handful of multinational
                                                                         About Genres 239

conglomerates that produce and own the media. The data collec-
tion practices and design of these companies' websites direct users'
attention, which affects their research skills. The same Internet
users will also participate in the development of revolutionary
open-source, collaborative archives like Wikipedia, which models
an unprecedented effort in collective intelligence.

    By virtue of accessing and using the Internet, its users are research-
ers. As a landscape of big data, the Internet's primary purpose is to
facilitate research and its subsequent acts of storing, producing,
and retrieving huge amounts of information (as it was when it was
conceived at CERN). Unfortunately, the Internet's global multidis-
ciplinary, multi-sector, and multi-generational history and culture
are largely unknown by most contemporary students--even though
they interact with it every single day. Thus, the research paper in
contemporary web settings should be designed to directly address
any of the technological politics of blended learning and emerging
technologies.

    At best, research papers 2.0 will encourage students and instruc-
tors to reflect on how the Internet and its complex networked
features mediate their research and writing process. Specifically,
research 2.0 might include a much stronger emphasis on collabo-
rative and professional writing. Students may organize online writ-
ing groups via Google+ or LinkedIn based on their topical interests
to provide evidence of their ability to lead and contribute to a team.
They might also contribute to crowdsourced, annotated bibliogra-
phies of paper mill websites to help the school's integrity office,
or participate in one of the Wikipedia edit-a-thons sponsored by
Art + Feminism. Research 2.0--be it delivered through a paper,
ePortfolio, Wikipedia, or Prezi--might include ethical evaluations
of research scandals, the legality of citizen surveillance footage of
police brutality, and a comparative analysis of big data websites
like Data.gov or WikiLeaks.com. But not all of its topics need to
be digitally themed, but it can and should use digital technologies
and resources to refresh what the research paper can do in the 21st
century.

    One of research paper 2.0's primary objectives should be bring-
ing students into contact with research communities that syner-
gize online experiences with offline social events. Towards this
end, Wikipedia is an ideal space for (and subject of) research in
2.0 because it has been a subject associated with research writ-
ing conduct for over a decade. Most students' experience with
Wikipedia and academic writing is that its use is strictly forbidden.
240 Bad Ideas

When it is cited as a source in a research paper, teachers are
annoyed or infuriated because they can't understand why students
don't know better. Regardless of how much suspicion surrounds the
veracity of Wikipedians' knowledge, every Internet user consults
this information resource. Furthermore, students and teach-
ers would have a much different experience with Wikipedia, and
research, if students understood the site from the perspective of
its editors. Thus, the Wiki Education Foundation, an affiliate of
the Wikimedia Foundation--the non-profit organization that
runs Wikipedia among several other projects--has made strong
attempts to connect Wikipedia to educational institutions through
their Wikiedu.org platform.

     Due to technological, and thus pedagogical limitations, the
traditional research paper is incapable of translating the affordances
of research writing to online environments. Therefore, research 2.0
should respond to the significance of human interaction with the
Internet and the politics of big data. We live in a superabundance
of learning spaces, and thus, infinite possibilities for research.
However, few educational institutions and disciplines are cultivat-
ing the technical, scientific, and artistic competencies necessary for
editing, navigating, and managing the Internet's infinite retrieval
mechanisms. When students are taught how to recognize that
they have the power to diversify Internet content with high-quality
research, the research paper 2.0 could play a major role in balanc-
ing the dynamics of knowledge production between traditional
institutions and emerging media.

CITING SOURCES IS A BASIC SKILL
LEARNED EARLY ON

    Susanmarie Harrington

     Citing sources can seem simple: Follow the rules to show read-
ers what you read. Many English classes usually teach a particular
system for citing sources designed by, and named after, the Modern
Language Association (MLA). College students soon discover that
professors working in other disciplines have similar (yet different!)
systems for citing sources (one designed by and named after the
American Psychological Association, APA, is particularly common).
The belief that citing sources is simple can be traced back to forma-
tive experiences: Many writers connect their later success to a thor-
ough assignment in middle or high school that required them to
use the library, create an extensive bibliography, and write a long
paper that used quotations to support their points. People who
become expert in a field may not recognize the implicit skills they
have developed since that first experience. It can seem almost
second nature to follow rules for inserting footnotes, indenting
long quotations, and constructing lists of works cited: Citation is
merely a matter of following directions.

     It turns out it's more complicated than that: All the directions
about citing sources assume deep prior knowledge. Citing sources
is a specialized, almost ritualized, skill that provides readers with
information in specific, routinized ways. Style guides provide rules
about everything from how many spaces to put between sentences
to how to organize and format the bibliography. Style guides direct
academic writers to use footnotes or parenthetical notations, in
combination with bibliographies at the end of a piece, to tell read-
ers where information comes from--who wrote it, when, and
where it was published. For skilled writers, following complicated
rules comes easily--for beginning students, not so much.

    Why are these systems so complicated? One reason often
emphasized in school is accountability. Citing sources in very
particular and detailed ways allows readers to find any source mate-
rial the writer used, and allows readers to evaluate the quality of
the source material the writer used. But complex citation systems
have other purposes as well: They let writers demonstrate strong
command of highly specialized work. In other words, the rules let
writers show expertise.

    This expertise unfolds in nuanced ways. Writers choose texts
to quote in order to connect themselves to particular traditions of
thinking or researching; to put their arguments in the context of
other, more prominent authors, whose views are already accepted
by readers; or to put forth arguments or examples a writer wants to
contest, examine, or elaborate. So, selecting and discussing sources
is a matter of savvy diplomacy, persuasion, and argumentation.
Sure, it involves learning how to follow detailed directions about
how and where to place punctuation in order to indicate where
quotations start and end; more importantly, it involves learning
how and why writers associate themselves with sources, whether
they seek to agree with what they've read, argue with what they've
read, or apply what they've read to a new context. It involves
understanding that there are reasons for using evidence other than
to support a claim; writers might use sources to identify trends in
order to argue with them.

Capturing Complexity

    Different systems for citing sources may require different
formats on the page, but the variation in how research is presented
is intellectually even more significant. Humanists generally value
work that dwells closely and slowly on particular passages or
moments in text, and quotations are to be presented and analyzed.
Scientists generally value work that presents trends in phenom-
ena, with previous work grouped and summarized, with far fewer,
if any, quotations. There is no simple formula for citing or using
sources, or for organization that can teach writers everything there
is to know about what they are expected to do.

    Will today's seventh graders be prepared to pick up these
lessons in college without additional instruction? Probably not,
even though the Common Core State Standards (CCSS) do put a
premium on learning to cite evidence for claims and conclusions.
The Reading Standards mention that students should be able to
244 Bad Ideas

cite material accurately, and the expectation that students support
claims with evidence appears in grades 6 through 12. But the CCSS
don't distinguish the ways in which different disciplines might have
different ways of approaching the use of sources, and they don't go
into detail about the particular conventions writers should follow
to cite sources. The CCSS emphasize the kind of close reading that
is likely more common in the humanities. So students coming from
high school English classes will be prepared to move into college
English literature expectations for handling sources--but they may
not be prepared to do exactly what a sociology or political science
course expects, let alone biology or math.

     Students arrive in college prepared not only by high school
curriculum standards but also by their experience of reading and
writing in the world. In school, the details of citation systems
carry authority. Out of school, other strategies help readers eval-
uate information. Material on the web provides live links rather
than formal citations. Journalists don't use parenthetical citation
systems to indicate where their information comes from--they
simply identify it in the text by putting the source's name and qual-
ification. Graphs and charts, seen in posters, pamphlets, textbooks
or journalistic sources, may have a legend identifying the orga-
nization that supplied data. Nonfiction books have varied styles
for citation--from copious footnotes, extended lists of sources at
the back, to a list of works consulted without any attempt to map
where they influenced the book. Sometimes experts supply infor-
mation without citing sources: Reputable food bloggers dispense
authoritative information about, say, how to safely can produce
without necessarily linking to or identifying the scientific sources
for those recommendations. Outside of school, there are many
ways to convey credibility and indicate relationships to the sources
used for a piece.

     Writing with authority is complicated and needs to be learned
anew in each situation: successful writing isn't just about following
rules, but about establishing connections among readers and writ-
ers. Writing with sources is about participation in ongoing conver-
sations, situated in the complex, messy politics of social networks.

PLAGIARISM DESERVES TO BE
PUNISHED

    Jennifer A. Mott-Smith

                  "College Plagiarism Reaches All Time High"

        "Studies Find More Students Cheating, With High Achievers
                                   No Exception"

    Headlines like these from The Huffington Post and The New York
Times scream at us about an increase in plagiarism. As a society, we
feel embattled, surrounded by falling standards; we bemoan the
increasing immorality of our youth and of our society. Plagiarism,
we know, is an immoral act, a simple case of right and wrong, and
as such, deserves to be punished.

    However, there is nothing simple about plagiarism. In fact, the
more we examine plagiarism, the more inconsistencies we find,
and the more confusion. How we think about plagiarism is clouded
by the fact that it is often spoken of as a crime. Plagiarism is not
only seen as immoral, it is seen as the stealing of ideas or words.
In his book, Free Culture, Stanford law professor Lawrence Lessig
questions what it can possibly mean to steal an idea:

         I understand what I am taking when I take the
         picnic table you put in your backyard. I am taking a
         thing, the picnic table, and after I take it, you don't
         have it. But what am I taking when I take the good
         idea you had to put a picnic table in the backyard--
         by, for example, going to Sears, buying a table, and
         putting it in my backyard? What is the thing that I
         am taking then?
    Lessig was getting at the idea that when a person borrows an
idea no harm is done to the party from whom it was taken. His
248 Bad Ideas

example is important because it makes us question whether theft
is an apt way to think about plagiarism.

     But how is Lessig's idea of taking a picnic table different from
taking an idea and reusing it in writing? One obvious difference
is that in writing it is the acknowledgement of one's sources that
makes taking something okay. But another, less obvious but more
important difference is that taking ideas and using them in your
own writing is a sophisticated skill that requires a good deal of
practice to master. There are at least three important things to
understand about the complexity of using sources. First, ideas are
often a mixture of one's own ideas, those we read, and those we
discuss with friends, making it hard, or even impossible, to sort out
who owns what. Second, writers who are learning a new field often
try out ideas and phrases from other writers in order to master the
field. This process allows them to learn, and is a far cry from steal-
ing. Third, expectations for citing sources vary among contexts and
readers, making it not only confusing to learn the rules, but impos-
sible to satisfy them all.

     It is quite hard to separate one's ideas from those of others.
When we read, we always bring our own knowledge to what we're
reading. Writers cannot say everything; they have to rely on the
readers to supply their side of the meaning making. One difficulty
arises when you read an argument with missing steps. As a good
reader, you fill them in so that you can make sense of the argu-
ment. Now, if you were to write about those missing steps, would
they be your ideas or those of your source?

     Knowing about such difficulties, teachers and writers often
question whether it's possible to have an original idea. Many have
come to the conclusion that we always write recirculated ideas that
we have borrowed from others and reworked. But surely we know
when we reuse words? Surely we should be able to attribute them?
Perhaps not. Words are not discrete entities that can be recom-
bined in countless ways, but rather, they fall into patterns that
serve certain ways of thinking, the very ways of thinking (habits of
mind, you might say) that we try to instill in students. The fact is
that language is formulaic, meaning that certain words commonly
occur together. There are many idioms, such as "toe the line" or
"cut corners" that need not be attributed. There are also a whole
lot of co-occurring words that don't quite count as idioms, such
as, "challenge the status quo," "it should also be noted that...,"
and "The purpose of this study is to...," that similarly do not
require attribution. These are called collocations. When it comes to
                                                                         About Genres 249

academic writing, there are a great number of them that student
writers need to acquire and use. What this means is that not every
verbatim reuse is plagiarism.

    Moreover, imposing strict rules against word reuse may func-
tion to prevent student writers from learning to write in their
fields. When student writers reuse patterns of words without attri-
bution in an attempt to learn how to sound like a journalist, say, or
a biologist, or a literary theorist, it is called patchwriting. In fact, not
only student writers, but all writers, patch together pieces of text
from sources, using their own language to sew the seams in order
to learn the language of a new field. Because of the complex way
in which patchwriting mixes text from various sources, it can be
extremely difficult to cite one's sources. Despite this lack of attri-
bution, much research has shown that patchwriting is not deceitful
and therefore should not be punished. In fact, some scholars are
interested in exploring how patchwriting could be used by writing
teachers to help student writers develop their writing skills.

    The third reason that it is not always easy to acknowledge
sources is that expectations for referencing vary widely, and what
counts as plagiarism depends on context. If, for instance, you use
a piece of historic information in a novel, you don't have to cite it,
but if you use the same piece of information in a history paper, you
do. Journalists typically do not supply citations, though they have
fact checkers making sure they're right. In business, people often
start their reports by cutting-and-pasting earlier reports without
attribution. Furthermore, research has shown that the reuse of
words and phrases in science articles is much more common and
accepted than it is in the humanities; this may be because words
are regarded as neutral tools to be reused in objective discussions,
or because many scientific terms and collocations do not lend
themselves to being paraphrased.

    Additionally, in high school, student writers likely used text-
books that did not contain citations, and once in college, they may
observe their professors giving lectures that come straight from
the textbook, cribbing one another's syllabi, and cutting and past-
ing the plagiarism policy into their syllabi. They may even notice
that their university lifted the wording of its plagiarism policy from
another institution! In addition to these differing standards, which
seem to turn on differences in genre or field of study, research has
also shown that individual experts such as experienced writers and
teachers do not agree whether or not a given piece of writing counts
as plagiarism. Given such wide disagreement over what constitutes
250 Bad Ideas

plagiarism, it is quite difficult, perhaps impossible, for writers to
meet everyone's expectations for proper attribution. Rather than
assuming that writers are trying to pass off someone else's work
as their own and therefore deserve punishment, we should recog-
nize the complexity of separating one's ideas from those of others,
of mastering authoritative phrases, and of attributing according to
varying standards.

     While the feeling that plagiarism deserves punishment is
perhaps widely held in society, the understanding that plagiarism
is often not deceitful and does not deserve punishment is also
present. The latter understanding is held by writers who recog-
nize that originality is not about divine inspiration. Today, many
writers and writing teachers reject the image of the writer as work-
ing alone, using (God-given) talent to produce an original piece of
work. This image of a lone author capturing never-before-heard-of
ideas simply is not supported by writing research, which shows
that writers both recombine ideas to create something new and
collaborate with others when generating their texts. Interestingly,
the image of the lone, divinely inspired writer is only a few hundred
years old--a European construct from the Romantic era. Before the
18th century, there were writers who copied and were nevertheless
respected as writers. Rather than seeing copying as deceitful, copy-
ing can be taken as a sign of respect and as free publicity as well.

     Today, millennial students may copy without deceitful intent,
but for different reasons. Reposting content on their Facebook
pages and sharing links with their friends, they may avoid citing
because they are making an allusion; readers who recognize
the source share the in-joke. In school, millennials may not cite
because they are not used to doing so, or they believe that it's
better not to cite some things because using too many citations
detracts from their authority. In either case, these are not students
trying to get away with passing someone else's work off as their
own. In addition, writers from some cultures (particularly those
educated outside Western schooling contexts) may not see copying
without attribution as plagiarism because it is culturally accepted
that communal ideas are more favored than individual ideas. It is
also believed that educated audiences will know the source mate-
rial, so students may not recognize plagiarism as stealing; instead
it is a sign of respect and sophistication in writing.

     Despite these complexities of textual reuse, most teachers
nevertheless expect student writers to do their own work. In fact,
student writers are held to a higher standard and punished more
                                                                         About Genres 251

rigorously than established writers. What is more troublesome
is that teachers' determinations of when plagiarism has occurred
is more complicated than simply noting whether a student has
given credit to his or her sources or not. Some research has shown
that teachers let inadequate attribution go if they feel the over-
all sophistication or authority of the paper is good, whereas they
are stricter about citing rules when the sophistication or authority
is weak. They tend to more readily recognize authority in papers
written by students who are members of a powerful group (e.g.,
whites, native English speakers, or students whose parents went to
college). Thus, in some instances, plagiarism may be more about
social inequity than individual deceit.

    As we come to realize that (1) writers combine their ideas with
those of others in ways that cannot always be separated for the
purposes of attribution, (2) writers often reuse phrases in accept-
able ways, and (3) citation standards vary widely and are often in the
eye of the beholder, the studies and articles panicking over plagia-
rism make less and less sense. In looking at plagiarism from the
different perspectives offered by collaborative and culturally differ-
ent writers, we can see that much plagiarism is not about stealing
ideas or deceiving readers. Unless plagiarism is out-and-out cheat-
ing, like cutting and pasting an entire paper from the Internet or
paying someone to write it, we should be cautious about reacting
to plagiarism with the intent to punish. For much plagiarism, a
better response is to just relax and let writers continue to practice
the sophisticated skill of using sources.

BAD IDEAS ABOUT
ASSESSING WRITING
GRADING HAS ALWAYS MADE
WRITING BETTER

    Mitchell R. James

                    "To grade is a hell of a weapon. It may not rest on
                your hip, potent and rigid like a cop's gun, but in the

                            long run it's more powerful."--Larry Tjarks

    There are a number of problems surrounding the ubiqui-
tous practice of grading student writing. In Schools Without Failure,
William Glasser notes that grading tends to be perceived by students
as various levels of failure. In addition, Marie Wilson argues that
a focus on failure leads teachers to approach student writing in
search of deficiencies instead of strengths, which puts students in
a state of preventative or corrective mindsets when trying to learn.
These mindsets are especially troubling for students in writing
classes, where errors must be made in order for students to grow
and develop.

    Another problem with grading, Brian Huot notes in (Re)
Articulating Writing Assessment for Teaching and Learning, is that it
rarely communicates anything of value to students. When I take
a narrative that a student has written in one of my courses--
something that has evolved through several drafts and has greatly
improved--and I tell that student the paper is an 85%, what am I
saying? 85% of what? Am I saying the narrative is in the top 85%
of the class, the top 85% of narratives written by all college fresh-
men in the U.S., or in the top 85% of all the narratives I've ever
read? Or maybe I'm comparing what was executed in the narrative
to a rubric, and I'm suggesting the student met 85% of the objec-
tives on the rubric, such as effective dialogue, strong verbs, and
detailed description. But might a narrative that uses all three objec-
tives still be a poorly written narrative?
256 Bad Ideas

     The breakdown of communication inherent in this kind of
summative-only, end-of-the-paper/project grading is a grave issue.
As a case in point, Liesel K. O'Hagan and colleagues demonstrate
the lack of useful information gleaned by students when grading
is implemented in a classroom. As a part of the study, one student
wrote, "I don't even understand what the grade means on my
paper. The top says something like a B and then all the comments
say positive things and then there are all these errors marked. Then
the person next to me wrote only half as much as I did and has
even more errors marked and he got an A. It just doesn't make any
sense to me."

     So why are we still so dependent on grading? The simplest
answer is growth in student numbers. Education used to be only
for the wealthy and privileged. That changed at the start of the
20th century, and continues through our present time with such
acts as mandatory attendance laws, the GI Bill, and the growth of
open-enrollment colleges. As student numbers and diversity rose
in the classroom, the models of grading we use today came to frui-
tion, and those that had been used before were relegated to near
obscurity. However, it might be in the past where we can find the
answers to the present question: If grading writing is counterpro-
ductive, what else can we do?

     The grading process in place before the late 19th century hinged
more on direct contact between student work, course content, the
student, and the teacher. For example, in English classes, teachers
would respond to student writing in both written and spoken form.
There were many levels of communication between the student and
teacher, which provided more opportunity for the student to gain
an understanding and command of course content. In addition, a
student's success depended on demonstrating the skills taught. If
students could demonstrate the necessary skills (reading, writing,
or speaking) then, and only then, did they pass the course. This
more attentive and interactive approach is akin to what occurs in
assessment.

     Assessment and grading are not synonymous. Grading is a
silent, one-way evaluation, where a teacher assigns a letter, rife
with a set of socio-cultural significances, to a piece of student writ-
ing. Assessment, on the other hand, provides the opportunity for
two kinds of evaluation--formative and summative.

     Formative evaluation--done typically by responding to in-pro-
cess student writing several times during the semester--replaces the
punishment or praise of student learning, typically demonstrated
                                                           About Assessing Writing 257

through grading a final product or test, with a process that encour-
ages communication as a part of learning. When using formative
evaluation, teachers and students speak with one another often.
In addition, formative evaluation creates safe spaces for student
learning because students are not focused on trying to avoid fail-
ure but, instead, are searching for insight and growth. As grades
lose their power, the desire to evade punishment or failure can
dissolve into the desire to seek knowledge and learn something
new. Finally, because of the communicative nature of formative
evaluation, students develop the capacity to talk about and, in
some instances, even teach the material themselves as they work
with their peers to explain what they know.

    Summative evaluation follows extensive formative evaluation.
Summative evaluation is superior to grading because it assesses a
student's ability to meet a priori criteria without the use of a letter
grade. Summative evaluation methods such as student self-re-
flection on the learning process, ungraded portfolio assessment,
and contract grading all provide the opportunity for teachers to
assess and respond to student learning free of the socio-political,
socio-economic letter grade.

    Unfortunately, like most teachers, I have to provide grades in
the summative sense. If I don't submit a letter grade at the end of
a semester, I will not have a job. But providing end-of-semester
grades doesn't preclude providing formative assessment that can
help students revise a text or project so they will better under-
stand why they might receive an 85% as a final grade. If I had a
choice by my institution whether to provide summative grades,
however, I wouldn't do it again. In short, the enterprise of grading
student writing should be replaced by a combination of formative
and summative evaluation.

RUBRICS SAVE TIME AND MAKE
GRADING CRITERIA VISIBLE

    Anne Leahy

    In K-12, and in higher education, rubrics have become popu-
lar for evaluating students' writing. The straightforwardness of
a rubric--a list of criteria, of what counts, often in a checklist
form--appeals to the instructor or evaluator and to administrators
collecting data about students because it is a time-saving tool for
measuring skills demonstrated in complex tasks, such as writing
assignments. Rubrics, however, are a bad idea for writers and for
those who teach writing.

    A Rube Goldberg machine is an overly engineered mechanism
for a simple task. A rubric, by comparison, looks fancy and is often
quantitative--it looks incredibly well engineered with its seem-
ingly airtight checklist. In fact, it's overly engineered to organize
feedback into criteria and levels, rows and columns. Instead of
responding to writing in language--with oral or written feedback--
many rubrics mechanize response. At the same time, a rubric is an
overly simple way to ignore that an essay is a complicated whole; it
is impossible to tease its characteristics completely apart, because
they are interdependent. A rubric, then, is an odd way to simulta-
neously overcomplicate and oversimplify the way one looks at and
judges a written text.

    Let's begin with a look at the word's origins and uses to under-
stand where the problem with rubrics begins. The word rubric
comes from the Latin word for red. The red to which the word orig-
inally referred was the color of earth that contained the impure
iron that is ocher and that was used to make ink. A rubric is, unfor-
tunately and perhaps inadvertently, a way to focus on the impurity;
it's a red pen, with all its power to correct and to write over what
has been created. If one evaluates writing by looking for what's
260 Bad Ideas

wrong or what needs to be corrected or fixed, one misses potential
and fails to point toward improvement in the future. Moreover, the
rubric's simplicity implies that all writing can be fixed or corrected
and that this correction can be done in the same way across pieces
of written work and across students, instead of suggesting that
revision--sometimes re-envisioning--is a more rewarding and
fruitful step in becoming a better writer.

     Contemporary definitions for rubric suggest that it's a term
equivalent to a rule, especially for how to conduct a liturgical service
(like stage directions printed in red), or an established tradition. In
other words, rubrics work to maintain the status quo and prevent
experimentation, deviation from the norm, and innovation. If you
do x and y and z, the rubric says, your writing is good. But what if
you do x and y and b--and discover something you'd not known
before and isn't on the rubric? The rubric does not accommodate
the unexpected.

     Following the rules--the rubric--to the letter is the opposite
of what good writing does. Even writers as different as Flannery
O'Connor and Joan Didion have said that they don't know what they
think until they write it. So, writing is a way of thinking, of invent-
ing one's thoughts through language and inventing sentences that
represent thoughts. But a rubric is a set of preconceived parame-
ters--designed before seeing the products of the task at hand--
that applies across the board. While a set of assignment guidelines
can allow a writing task to be carried out in various ways, a rubric
becomes an evaluative tool that doesn't make sense if writing is
the individual exploration that many writers experience. A rubric
suggests that the task and its goals are understood before the writ-
ing itself occurs and that writing works the same way for everyone
every time. Even when a rubric works adequately to evaluate or
provide feedback, or even when teachers ask students to practice
particular techniques or know what they're looking for, using such
a tool sends the message to students that writing fits preconceived
notions. Students know that, on some level, they are writing to the
rubric, instead of writing to think.

     Another contemporary definition of the word is as a heading
or category. That definition suggests that using a rubric to evalu-
ate writing is a way to label a piece of writing (and, perhaps unin-
tentionally, label the writer as well). The more comprehensive and
detailed a rubric is, the less it is able to label efficiently. Rubrics,
then, cannot be all-inclusive or wide-ranging and also good at spec-
ifying and categorizing. These labeling tools do not often include

the possibility of either/or that recognizes multiple ways to achieve
a given goal.

    Rubrics, learning outcomes, assessment practices, and the
quantitative or numerical scoring of performance emerge out of
the social sciences. That's the underlying problem for using these
methods to evaluate writing and to encourage improvement. Why
must social science approaches (techniques adapted from science
to study human behavior) be used to evaluate work in the arts
and humanities? Tools like rubrics ask those of us trained in the
arts and humanities to understand the difference between direct
(product-based, such as exams or papers) and indirect (percep-
tion-based, such as surveys) outcomes. Social science methodol-
ogy asks teachers to see a text as data, not as language or creative
production. These terms, such as data, are not ones that writers use
to describe or understand their own writing and learning. Writing
instructors and administrators like me, especially those who use
rubrics not only for grading but for assessing entire programs, are
using tools with which we are not properly trained and that were
designed for other academic disciplines and data-driven research.
While rubrics may be moderately helpful in assessing a program on
the whole or providing program-level benchmarks, they are gener-
ally unhelpful, as currently used, in helping individual students
improve their writing.

    According to Classroom Assessment Techniques, a book by Thomas
A. Angelo and K. Patricia Cross, the top teaching goals for English
are writing skills, think[ing] for oneself, and analytic skills. The arts,
humanities, and English share think for oneself as a high-priority
goal. In addition, the arts, of which writing (especially creative
writing) might be considered a part, lists creativity as a top goal, and
the humanities considers openness to ideas (as an extension of think-
ing for oneself) as a priority in teaching. These skills are all very
difficult to measure, especially via a preconceived rubric, and much
more difficult than goals like apply principles or terms and facts, which
are among the top teaching goals for business and the sciences.
In other words, the most important goals for writing teachers are
among the most difficult to evaluate. The standard rubric is better
suited for measuring the most important aspects of learning in
other fields than in writing.

    Some rubrics attempt to be holistic, but when they begin to
succeed, they are already moving away from being good rubrics for
labeling or scoring. The more holistic the rubric is, the less effec-
tive it is at saving time--a feature that makes rubrics attractive in
262 Bad Ideas

the first place. While rubrics can be used for narrative or qualita-
tive feedback, they are unnecessary scaffolding in such cases and,
worse, invite prescriptive responses. That's what's needed in the
evaluation of writing: a move away from the prescriptive and toward
the descriptive, a move away from monitoring toward formative
and narrative feedback. Novelist John Irving has said that his work
as an MFA student in fiction writing saved him time because his
mentors told him what he was good at and to do more of that,
and what he was not as good at and to do less of that. What Irving
points to is formative and narrative response from expert mentors
and engaged peers who revise their work and explore their options
as writers.

     Formative and narrative feedback (as Mitch James writes about
in a previous chapter) involves the student in analyzing and think-
ing about his or her own writing. Self-reflection and awareness,
which are key in learning over the long haul, become part of these
types of evaluation. The simple technique of posing the ques-
tion "What if?" can compel a writer to try out options for writ-
ing, even when the writing task is specific in topic, audience, or
length. Importantly, these types of feedback are individualized, not
a one-size-fits-all response to a writing task. Feedback can be given
at any time, not only when the task is complete and there's no
going back, not only at a time designated to give all students feed-
back. While rubrics can be employed in process, the form encour-
ages end use in practice and discourages real-time or back-and-
forth exchange of information. Nearly real-time response can have
an immediate effect, and you don't need a rubric to do that. The
summative response that is based on rubrics takes time, becomes
linked with grading, and becomes removed from the ongoing prac-
tice of writing itself, all of which make rubrics a bad idea. Instead,
using formative types of feedback that are separated from grad-
ing often propels a writer into revision as he or she attempts to
strengthen the written piece and his or her own writing skills.

RUBRICS OVERSIMPLIFY
THE WRITING PROCESS

    Crystal Sands

     I still remember my first rubric-assessment training I received
from an educational assessment expert. I stared at the categories
from a sample rubric used to assess writing and began to panic.
I knew there were things that happened in my classroom, things
that happened in writing, that were not listed on that rubric. I was
a new writing teacher in my first tenure-track job, afraid to speak
up, but I finally did. "There's so much more to writing than what's
in this rubric," I said. A few other faculty members in the training
session clapped and cheered. I had not used rubrics when I assessed
my students' writing before, and I was about to be required to do
so by my institution. I was resistant, and I was not alone.

     Using rubrics to assess writing is a common, but sometimes
controversial, practice with a laundry list of pros and cons. While
I had some strong resistance to using rubrics early in my career, I
came to see their value before long. In that first job, I was teach-
ing 13 sections of basic writing classes per year, each of which was
capped at 30 students. Before I learned how to use rubrics, I did
not leave my house most weekends because I was too busy provid-
ing feedback on essays. After I completed my rubric-assessment
training, I found that I was able to leave my house on the weekends
more often, although still not much. That alone was enough to sell
me, as I was barely handling my heavy grading load.

     Opponents of rubrics argue, and understandably so, that there
is no way to reduce writing to a rubric, no matter how strong said
rubric might be. Rubrics that set out to provide a predetermined
focus for evaluating a piece of writing cannot possibly capture all
that there is to a text. Five or six categories, or even eight or ten,
would not be enough to measure the complexity of even a simple
                                                           About Assessing Writing 265

text. As Bob Broad noted in What We Really Value: Beyond Rubrics in
Teaching and Assessing Writing, while good rubrics effectively capture
some of the important elements in assessing writing, they do not
capture all of them. Does using a rubric send the message that
we are only evaluating the elements of the rubric? Perhaps. But I
would argue that this does not have to be so.

    Despite their limitations, rubrics have become a common
method of evaluating writing for a wide variety of sound reasons.
Research shows that students can benefit from rubric assessment
when rubrics are presented and discussed in advance. Knowing
basic expectations in advance can help students respond well to
an assignment and ease their writing anxiety, which is one of the
biggest struggles my students, especially online students, face
during their writing processes. Because rubrics provide clear expec-
tations and assessment criteria, students also improve self-assess-
ment and critical thinking skills when they are used. As students
engage in conversations about the rubrics and then work with
course rubrics to self-evaluate, they are engaging in the writing
process in a more confident manner.

    While not all rubrics are created equally, my experiences
working with my students to build rubrics for essay assessment
confirms the findings of research indicating that having students
help develop rubrics produces a significant increase in engagement
in peer review and self-evaluation. In my classes, students were
engaged and reported high satisfaction. I was working at a commu-
nity college with a high number of non-traditional working adults.
They approached their educations pragmatically and did not appre-
ciate being evaluated in a way that would be a mystery to them.
For these inexperienced writers, the rubrics provided an opportu-
nity for transparency, which was extremely important, especially as
a high number of them suffered from some fairly extreme writing
anxiety. I made it clear that even the best rubrics could not encom-
pass everything I was looking for in a text, but the rubrics gave me
a short-cut in providing my students with some basic information
about what makes a good piece of writing. This guidance was espe-
cially important for students who were coming to my classes with
little to no knowledge of what might make a strong college essay.
On top of this, my grading load was reduced, and because I was
working with nearly 400 students per year, this was important.

    As an alternative to an over-simplified dismissal of rubric
use, I argue for something in the middle--an understanding that
good rubrics can play a role as a part of writing assessment. I have
266 Bad Ideas

worked for several institutions that required standard rubrics for
all courses, and I cannot defend these rubrics. They have often
been extremely brief, limiting, and seem to focus more on program
assessment than on providing students with quality feedback. And
while program assessment is another potential benefit of rubrics,
I would argue that a rubric used for program assessment should
not be the same as a specific, detailed rubric written with a student
audience in mind. My experience as both an administrator and a
faculty member has taught me that, while program assessment and
student feedback should be separate, this is not always the case in
all programs or institutions. However, I think dismissing rubrics
outright is a mistake because doing so refuses to acknowledge the
benefits rubrics provide students and teachers, particularly for the
latter in terms of decreased workloads. We deserve at least part of
a weekend off.

     A paradigm shift that explores a balance between rubrics as a
part of writing assessment, and the realities of the teaching loads
of many writing faculty would be most beneficial to our field.
The reality that there are elements of writing that rubrics of any
reasonable length cannot capture should not be ignored. However,
neither can the research pointing to the benefits of more timely
feedback and stronger student self-evaluation. Additionally, my
work with rubrics has aided students struggling with fear and
confidence issues. And, while some could argue that rubrics might
provide students with a kind of false confidence, I would argue that
the benefits of the greater confidence I have seen in my students
outweighs any problems associated with students thinking writ-
ing is somehow being reduced to the rubric. In fact, I would argue
that conversations about rubrics can prevent this kind of thinking
from occurring in the first place. I let my students know that the
rubrics I use provide descriptions for the key elements I am look-
ing for, but I explain that there are more elements, some of which
I won't know until I see them. We discuss writing as a complex
beast, and the rubric discussion gives me a great opportunity for
this. Additionally, if a faculty member can use rubrics to cover key
elements of assessment, and then include several more specific or
unique comments on the student writing, then we are not, as some
might suggest, using rubrics to replace written feedback.

WHEN RESPONDING TO STUDENT
WRITING, MORE IS BETTER

    Muriel Harris

     When teachers of writing grade student papers, they include
written comments aimed at helping students improve their writing
skills. The rationale for such teacher comments and corrections is
based on two assumptions: (1) that the instructor and the institu-
tion need to know how well students are performing, and (2) that
students need to know how their writing skills measure up and
what they can do to improve. The expectation is that students will
read the comments and corrections and learn from them. While
some may think instructor comments and grades have long been an
integral part of a student's education, paper grading--as Mitchell
R. James explains elsewhere in this book--is a relatively recent
phenomenon in academia. And so now, highly conscientious teach-
ers, wishing to be effective and helpful, read students' writing and
offer a lot of advice, write suggestions for future work, note correc-
tions, and perhaps ask questions for the student writer to think
about. Teachers who spend extensive time writing on student
papers are apparently convinced that students learn from their
responses. Parents and administrators are happy because they too
assume that more teacher verbiage results in more learning--with
a corollary that an exceptional teacher therefore offers extensive
feedback. Unfortunately, there is a point of diminishing returns
when the comments become so extensive that students are over-
whelmed, unable to sort out what is more important from what is
less important. Some students react negatively because they are
convinced that a lot of comments equals a lot of criticism.

     Teachers take on the time-consuming mental and physical
effort with the best of intentions and dedication. They assume
students will read all the comments, find out what they need
                                                           About Assessing Writing 269

to learn, and will work on problems that have been labeled and
perhaps explained by these instructors. Similarly, when teachers
use correction symbols for students to locate in the textbook and
include encouragement and praise for what is well written, that
would seem to round out the kinds of feedback that students bene-
fit from. It also increases the amount of teacher comments on the
paper. Thus, a thoroughly graded paper might include along with
words of praise: suggestions; questions; indications about organi-
zation, clarity, and accuracy concerns; recommendations for future
writing; and annotations to indicate grammatical, spelling, and
word choice problems--plus, an explanation of how the grade was
determined. It would be comforting to note that such over-grading
of student papers is a rare phenomenon, but unfortunately, that's
not the case. Some teacher responses even exceed the total word
count of a student's essay. Such extensive response by the well-in-
tentioned, dedicated instructor is widely viewed as the expected
result that follows when students hand in their papers. There are,
of course, some who see written teacher responses as less effective
and have turned to methods that do not include commenting on
every paper, such as students getting feedback from other students
in peer-response groups.

    Although extensive commenting on student writing is not a
universal practice, it is widespread, widely accepted, and widely
practiced. Moreover, if writing comments and questions on the
paper has educational value, then for many teachers, even more
written response results in even more learning. Oh, that it were
so. The over-graded paper too often has little or no educational
value. Extensive written response is not productive for instruc-
tors because it is highly labor intensive in the time that it takes
instructors to read and write a response for each paper, much less
those for a whole class or multiple classes. Most teachers simply do
not have that much time to slowly, carefully read papers and then
think about what to note in the comments because they also need
additional time to prepare for and meet their classes. Extensive
marginal notes, along with a paragraph or four at the top or end of
the paper summarizing the teacher's feedback is counterproduc-
tive. Yet it persists. Unfortunately, the over-graded paper is a waste
of a teacher's time and far too often a total loss in terms of the
student's ability to understand and learn from all that instructor
prose.

    Multiple factors contribute to students' problems with read-
ing fulsome teacher responses and learning from them. One of
270 Bad Ideas

the most obvious student problems in decoding all that teacher
commentary is that students' critical reading abilities have steadily
declined. The class of 2015 had the lowest SAT scores in critical
reading--along with writing and math--since the SAT test was
overhauled in 2006. In 2006, the average critical reading score was
503, out of a possible 800; in 2015, the average critical reading
score had dropped to 495. As a result, too many students strug-
gle to critically read and understand their instructors' prose. To
compound the problem, many teachers now offer their responses
online, but as some studies have shown, reading online reduces
comprehension and memory of what was read.

     Another problem with reading teacher comments is that some
students lack an adequate command of English because of inade-
quate literacy skills in general. Even students whose literacy level
is adequate for college-level writing can be mystified by jargon that
some teachers inadvertently use, such as development or coherence.
I've heard students trying to guess what coherence means and fail
utterly. They wonder if their writing is stupid or wrong or just not
what the teacher wanted. Or, as another example, teachers may
note the need for transitions between sentences or paragraphs or for
more sentence variety. Even comments such as "your thesis needs a
tighter focus" is not intelligible for students who don't have a firm
grip on what a thesis is or what focus in a paper means. These terms
are part of an extensive vocabulary describing aspects of writing
that instructors become used to because it is the jargon of the field,
used in teacher-training classes and books on teaching pedagogy.
But most students, other than those studying to become teach-
ers of writing, do not spend class time learning this vocabulary.
Knowing a goal and having a strategy for how to get there can be,
for too many students, mission impossible.

     Yet another problem with extensive feedback from teachers is
that in the welter of prose, there is often a lack of hierarchy. Which
of the many comments does the writer focus on? As they read
through the instructor's writing, student writers all too often don't
know what to tackle first or what is most important. Sadly, such
students become overwhelmed by the lengthy marginal notes and
questions or excessively long responses so carefully crafted by their
instructors. Papers requiring revision tend to be especially over-
graded, perhaps because the teacher envisions how much better
the next draft will be when the writer works on all the aspects of
the paper that need to be rewritten. But writing center tutors hear,
instead, students' views on all the comments. They say a teacher
                                                           About Assessing Writing 271

"ripped all over my paper," or they ask tutors to tell them what
they should do. They don't know what to focus on first or where to
plunge in when thinking about what to revise. Students in this situ-
ation usually don't know how to prioritize among all the verbiage.

    When there is too much for the student writer to attend to,
another result is students' preference for selecting the low-hang-
ing fruit. They choose to focus on the more easily edited sentence-
level comments, such as correcting a misspelled word, rather than
tackling the more challenging comments about clarity, organiza-
tion, or clarifying a main point. They want to know how to fix the
comma error that is checked or how to revise the sentence marked
as awkward. And then there are students who choose to ignore
what the teacher has written because, if they don't need to revise
the paper, why bother plowing through the endless prose? But
they have been assigned to come to the writing center and often
don't want to hang around and talk about a paper they consider no
longer on life support. They refer to such papers as dead, as done
with or history. Why bother with a post-mortem?

    If there are so many reasons why extensive teacher response
to student writing is unproductive, and if more is generally less in
terms of what students learn from all that commenting, what does a
well-meaning teacher do? One possibility is to focus only on a very
few concerns the student can work on, and that includes reducing
the number of marginal comments. Make it clear that while there
are other aspects of the assignment that the student has handed in
that need work, the student writer should, for this paper, concen-
trate only on a few aspects the instructor suggests. Decreasing the
amount of teacher response can lead to closer attention to those
matters instead of getting lost in trying to cope with an overload.
If time permits, teachers can meet with students in conferences to
discuss revisions and explain on the spot when students need more
explanation.

    Another way to consider responding to student writing is to
recognize that not all writing needs to be graded. Taking the pres-
sure off by not grading every single bit of composing allows writers
to experiment, to ease the burden of a grade. That is liberating for
some students who constantly worry about the repercussions of a
grade as they compose every sentence. Students can also get feed-
back from peer groups, and in schools and colleges where there
are writing centers, they can get reader response from tutors. For
teachers who recognize that less really is more in terms of respond-
ing to student writing, students will be more likely to absorb and
272 Bad Ideas

learn from the limited, specific feedback they offer. Such students
will have a greater chance to improve their writing, and teach-
ers, instead of staring at their desks with piles of papers to grade,
will have more time to think about how to make class time more
productive.

STUDENT WRITING MUST BE
GRADED BY THE TEACHER

    Christopher R. Friend

    It's a common assumption that when students write something
for a class, the teacher should evaluate that writing and return
it with a grade. Chances are, those you work with take a differ-
ent approach to the writing you do professionally. When was the
last time your writing was graded? Odds are, not since you left
school. Since then, anything you've written had a specific purpose,
and you worked on it until it met your goal. Maybe a colleague or
manager decided when it was good enough, and maybe they even
gave you feedback about what worked well or not, but you didn't
get a score, a letter grade, or have your writing ranked against your
colleagues' work. But for some reason, this scoring/ranking system
has become the norm as a method of labeling the relative quality of
student writing. The whole arrangement teaches students to write
for an arbitrary measurement from an authority figure rather than
for a real audience.

    As Mitchell R. James explains elsewhere in this text, grades
are a fairly recent invention, in terms of the history of educa-
tion. It would seem that grades have been imposed upon a system
that had been getting along without them for hundreds of years.
This imposition is a reductive one, replacing feedback, commen-
tary, suggestions for improvement, and opportunity for discussion
with merely a single letter or number. The idea of an A paper and
giving numeric or alphabetic grades needs to end. Instead, we need
to help students think of writing as adults do--in terms of incit-
ing action and achieving goals. We need to help students become
skilled reviewers of other people's writing, a skill that is much
more useful than learning to write to please the teacher.

    That last point poses not only a problem prominent in the
history of writing assessment but also a perspective that may help
274 Bad Ideas

lead to improvement. Assigning a grade to a piece of writing is
fraught with inconsistencies (which James discusses at length),
as different graders notice different things within the same text.
But when students have only one teacher in their classroom, and
that one teacher's assessment carries all the weight and authority,
students learn to write for the teacher instead of expecting the writ-
ing to do anything on its own. (See also Elizabeth Wardle's chapter
in this book on "writing in general.") Grading becomes a myste-
rious label, reducing meaningful commentary to a single letter or
number. It puts the teacher in charge and abolishes the opportu-
nity for students to learn how to evaluate quality. Writing in graded
situations becomes writing for a grade, whereas writing in other
circumstances seeks effectiveness as a standard. When students
write for a grade, they come to see writing as transactional (given
to someone in exchange for credit) rather than actionable (created
with purpose and designed to achieve a goal). That's somewhat
like a journalist writing news reports to please the layout designer
rather than to meet the needs of the publication's readers. Writing
for the teacher creates an artificial environment that's harmful to a
writer's development.

     Writing for a teacher rather than an intrinsic goal may produce
work that the teacher deems excellent, but wouldn't it be better to
help writers develop the ability to independently assess the quality
of writing, either theirs or other people's? By expecting students
to write so that teachers can rate, rank, and label them, we implic-
itly tell students that our satisfaction is more significant than their
intrinsic aspirations. Writers should develop the purpose of their
writing, rather than having it determined elsewhere. Students must
learn that process through experience; grading will not teach them.

     Students don't learn how to write from a grade. They learn
how to write well by getting feedback from readers and from
reading and analyzing examples of similar writing from other
authors (such as their peers or professional authors writing the
same type of material the students are writing). Sure, teachers can
add marginal comments on drafts to provide some of this feed-
back, but as Muriel Harris argues in her chapter of this text, such
commentary frequently becomes overwhelming and meaningless
to students. Regardless of how many comments appear on a paper,
students know the grade is the only thing that counts in the long
run. But how exactly does a letter count? How does it fit in with
an overall view of a student's ability? And more importantly, given
the complexities of writing, how can one letter reflect the myriad
                                                           About Assessing Writing 275

aspects by which writing quality might be judged? If a letter grade
represents completion, how can teachers determine when writ-
ing is finished? If the letter reflects accuracy/correctness, how can
teachers account for style? And whose opinion of the quality of the
writing matters most?

    Indeed, grading does very little. Music theory teacher Kris
Shaffer says that "letter grades do an absolutely horrible job" of
three things that would help students improve their writing: (1)
determining whether students understand a concept well enough
to implement it, (2) identifying elements of student writing that
need improvement, and (3) helping students learn to better self-as-
sess. Shaffer makes his argument specifically about writing music,
but I've recast it here for writing words. Each of these three goals
presents a helpful perspective on developing authors' needs. An
author's ability to compose requires skill, understanding, and situ-
ational familiarity. None of those goals are met through a letter
grade. Grades help label, sort, and rank students; they don't inform
students, target instruction, or encourage self-awareness. Those
who have left school and begun their careers have long stopped
expecting grades to help determine what they do and don't do well
because grades aren't appropriate measures of learning. Schools
need to stop relying on grades, too.

    Instead, we should teach people how to improve their writ-
ing through peer review. Variations of peer review help us write
in many of our day-to-day situations. We learn what sorts of text
messages work best by observing how our friends text and respond
to us. We learn what makes an effective email by reading the ones
we get and responding or deleting as we see fit. We learn how
best to craft Facebook posts by seeing what kinds of content can
garner the most likes--at its heart a form of quick (and addictive)
peer review. Consider, too, all of the review features available on
websites such as Yelp, Amazon, LinkedIn, Angie's List, and so on.
Reviews offer feedback and critique by users/peers.

    With all these systems of peer feedback already available to us,
students need to learn to make use of them. Teachers could bene-
fit from saved time and energy if they incorporated peer review
systems of various flavors in their classes, reducing their workload
and providing a variety of feedback for their students. Students,
then, would learn to trust--and derive practical value from--the
feedback of a real audience beyond their teacher. Writers who can
peer review effectively become purposeful readers, thinking of
texts, from classmates' work to their textbooks, as devices used
276 Bad Ideas

to achieve goals, rather than as static documents designed only to
inform. The mantra that "you can't believe everything you read on
the Internet" makes rational sense but seems to fail us at crucial
moments. Thinking critically about the things we read takes longer
than clicking Like, retweeting, reblogging, or sharing; the efficiency
of social tools discourages complex questioning that challenges
and validates claims. In-class peer review helps writers think care-
fully about the implications of writing and the ways writing can
help solve problems.

     The interactive, social nature of writing (not just tweets) makes
peer review not only an effective source of feedback but also an
essential skill. True participation in peer review systems requires
that we act as reviewers ourselves. These peer-review skills should
be assessed by teachers, as they help us learn the real work of
writing. Because writing allows us to coordinate and collaborate,
it serves as an essential element in the effort to get things done.
In other words, situations, not teachers, define the importance of
writing. Learning about situations and the effects of writing comes
from reading and writing, not from being graded. Students should
learn to assess writing situations and learn how to improve that
writing--both theirs and their peers'--in situations that have more
at stake than just a grade.

     If grades tell nothing meaningful about writing ability, and if
learning to work as/with peer reviewers provides insights into and
feedback about writing performance, then the traditional struc-
ture of writing education is backward. If writing helps groups of
people get things done, then students need to learn how to form,
negotiate, and benefit from those groups. Grades get in the way,
and teachers cannot guide students through their own writing,
assessing, and reviewing processes if they are too distracted by
issuing grades. The teacher's view of student writing is but one
voice among a chorus of peers. Writing benefits from collabora-
tion, not top-down dictatorship. Learning to write means learning
to write with the support of peers, in an authentic situation, and
with a genuine purpose. Writing should not be done for a grade.
Teachers should not grade writing; instead, they should empower
their students to meaningfully assess the effectiveness of writing.

     If students learn to improve their understanding of writing by
collaborating in groups that use writing to achieve a specific goal,
then those groups should determine whether they met their own
goal. A teacher should help students learn to assess quality fairly,
to collaborate professionally, and to identify differences between

their own work and model writing they wish to emulate. Writing
classrooms can be laboratories in which students develop mean-
ingful, relevant writing skills. If teachers stop grading student writ-
ing and instead focus on review and collaboration skills, each class-
room would have a team of people qualified to assess the quality
of writing. Teachers, then, could grade whether students provide
beneficial peer review feedback and collaborate effectively--the
meaningful work of writing.

MACHINES CAN EVALUATE WRITING
WELL

    Chris M. Anson and Les Perelman

     Across the United States, writing is being evaluated by
machines. Consider the situation of Maria, a typical high school
student. In a high-stakes test situation that could decide whether
she's admitted to the university of her choice, she's given a prompt
to write about a topic such as whether originality is overrated,
or whether our society values certainty over skepticism. For the
next 25 minutes, she tries to create a purposeful piece of writ-
ing, developing its ideas, shaping its structure, considering its style
and voice, choosing appropriate examples, and honing it to suggest
to its readers--her evaluators--that she can think and write effec-
tively enough to be admitted to a good college. She even drops in a
bit of humor to lighten up the essay.

     She writes her essay for people who she imagines are like her
teachers--people who can read and form conclusions about her
essay from multiple angles, know irony or humor when they see
it, can spot an unsupported generalization, or can forgive a minor
grammatical error while taking note of a more serious one. But
instead of reaching those human readers, her essay is fed into a
computer system for evaluation. The machine scans the paper for
a handful of simple features, such as length and the percentage of
infrequently used words. In a few milliseconds, it spits out a score
that seals Maria's fate.

     To testing agencies, machine scoring is irresistibly alluring.
Instead of hiring, training, and paying warm-blooded human
beings to read and judge tens of thousands of essays, they think
that investing in a computer scoring system will save them large
amounts of money and time and will generate big profits. They have
faith that parents, students, school officials, and the general public
will think the machines are better than human readers. After all,
                                                           About Assessing Writing 279

computers are so accurate and consistent and reliable, right? Why
run the risk that the evaluator reading Maria's essay is cranky or
tired on the day of the evaluation, or is coming down with a cold?
Machines offer razor-sharp precision and metallic solidity, never
giving in to frustration or exhaustion.

    But as we'll show, although computers are brilliant at many
things, they're really bad at understanding and interpreting writ-
ing--even writing produced by fifth-graders--and that fact will
not change in the foreseeable future. Understanding why this is
true can prepare teachers, parents, students, and taxpayers to push
back against testing agencies and politicians who think that people
will be placated by the complexity of technology and seduced by
the promise that writing can be evaluated cheaply and efficiently,
justifying further cuts in educational funding.

Why Machines Make Lousy Humans

    First, it's important to understand that computers are not the
enemy. In fact, computers play an important role in research on
the language and writing that humans produce. There are some
things a computer can do in a couple of seconds that would take a
human researcher a lifetime (or two). Scholars of writing are the
last people to resist the further development of computers to work
with natural language--a term referring to the spoken or written
language produced by humans as part of their daily lives.

    But when it comes to evaluating writing, computers perform
badly. That's because natural language is extraordinarily complex--
far more complex than even the most sophisticated computers can
understand.

    Let's consider a few reasons why.
      · Computers don't understand meaning. They can

         compute the likelihood of two words appearing close to
         each other, but their judgment is always based on statis-
         tical probabilities, not an understanding of word connota-
         tions. Think of the verb to serve. We can serve our country,
         serve in a game of tennis, or serve the president. We also
         can serve a casserole to you. (A cannibalistic restaurant
         could even serve presidents for lunch, though the supply
         would be pretty limited.) Humans can easily differentiate
         between the realistic and absurd meanings of a simple word
         like serve; computers can't.
      · A computer can't differentiate between reasonable and
         absurd inferences either. In fact, computers are really bad
280 Bad Ideas

         at making any inferences at all. When we speak or write,
         large amounts of information are left out and inferred
         by the listener or reader. When we read, "Fred realized
         he couldn't pay for his daughter's tuition. He looked up
         his uncle's email address," the space between the two
         sentences is filled with information that we infer. Almost
         all human language works this way. Making inferences
         requires vast amounts of information and astronomically
         large networks, connections, and permutations in infinite
         contexts. Although computers can obviously store and
         search for massive amounts of data, they don't know how
         to put it together to infer. The computer would read the
         two statements above exactly the same as it would read,
         "Fred realized he couldn't pay for his daughter's tuition. He
         looked up his pet elephant's email address."
      · Most computer scoring programs judge logical devel-
         opment and effective organization by the number
         of sentences or words in a paragraph. If a system is
         programmed to see one-sentence paragraphs as unde-
         veloped, it will apply this principle to all essays even though
         one-sentence paragraphs can be used to good effect (as in
         the sentence at the top of this bullet list). When one of
         us (Perelman) tried to write the best essay he could, one
         of the most popular machine graders admonished him
         that a paragraph was underdeveloped because it had only
         three sentences. He then expanded the paragraph by insert-
         ing completely irrelevant material--the opening line of
         Alan Ginsberg's poem "Howl": "I saw the best minds of
         my generation destroyed by madness, starving hysterical
         naked." The computer then considered the new paragraph
         to be both adequately developed and coherent.
      · Computers get progressively worse at evaluating writ-
         ing as it gets longer (for obvious reasons--there's more to
         mess them up). The programmers know this. Although all
         commercial computer-scoring systems give higher scores
         to longer essays, paradoxically most limit the length of
         papers to around 1,000 words, about four typed pages. The
         Educational Testing Service's program Criterion, for exam-
         ple, almost always gives high scores to essays of 999 words
         but will refuse to evaluate an essay containing 1,001 words.
         However, many college papers are more than 1,000 words.

    The first myth to debunk about computer scoring systems
is that they can read extended discourse, especially to evaluate
students' writing abilities. They can't. They don't understand or
interpret anything that's fed into them. They miss humor and
irony, or clever turns of phrase, or any of a dozen aspects of prose
that we try to teach students. They can't discern purposeful stylis-
tic decisions. They think gibberish is acceptable, and they mark
perfectly reasonable prose that violates some simplistic criterion
such as the number of words in a paragraph as unacceptable. They
always interpret some aspect of writing the same way, without
considering the writer's intentions and context. They can't make
inferences between the lines of text. The complexity of human
language simply baffles them--or, more accurately, goes right over
their semiconductors. Writing experts have exposed these and
other limitations of machine scoring using both coherent and inco-
herent essays. The computers can't tell the difference.

    In one experiment, researchers at MIT created the Basic
Automated Bullshit Essay Language Generator (BABEL), which
produces gibberish essays. When they submitted essays produced
by BABEL to a system that scores tens of thousands of student test
essays, including the Graduate Record Examination, the computer
awarded the gibberish essays the highest possible score. Here is an
excerpt of a Babel Generated Essay that received the highest score
(6) from ETS's e-rater, along with the canned comments from
ETS's GRE preparation website.

         Careers with corroboration has not, and in all likelihood
         never will be compassionate, gratuitous, and disciplinary.
         Mankind will always proclaim noesis; many for a trope
         but a few on executioner. A quantity of vocation lies in the
         study of reality as well as the area of semantics. Why is
         imaginativeness so pulverous to happenstance? The reply to
         this query is that knowledge is vehemently and boisterously
         contemporary.

         The score: 6

         In addressing the specific task directions, a 6
         response presents a cogent, well-articulated analy-
         sis of the issue and conveys meaning skillfully. A
         typical response in this category:
282 Bad Ideas

            · articulates a clear and insightful position on the
              issue in accordance with the assigned task

            · develops the position fully with compelling
              reasons and/or persuasive examples

            · sustains a well-focused, well-organized analysis,
              connecting ideas logically

            · conveys ideas fluently and precisely, using effec-
              tive vocabulary and sentence variety

            · demonstrates superior facility with the conven-
              tions of standard written English (i.e., gram-
              mar, usage, and mechanics) but may have minor
              errors.

Obviously, the Babel gibberish essay does none of these things. So
why, with all these limitations, has computer essay scoring even
seen the light of day? We've pointed to the economic reasons and
the desire for profit. But there's another reason, and it's about
humans, not computers.

Why Humans Make Lousy Machines

     When we look at how humans read and evaluate students' test
essays, we find an interesting paradox. For years, groups of read-
ers have been trained--normed and calibrated--to read thousands
of essays in the most consistent and accurate way possible. This is
because when we allow people to read writing normally, they see it
subjectively, through the lens of their experiences (think of a book
club discussion). If a testing agency allowed this--if it couldn't
guarantee consistently of evaluation--it would be instantly sued.
Through a long process, readers can often develop consensus on
how to evaluate many aspects of papers, but such a process takes
more time and money than the testing organizations are willing to
spend. Instead, their training process turns humans into machines
so that they will look for exactly the same features in exactly the
same way, as quickly as possible. They're told to ignore facts
because they can't verify everything they read. They're constrained
to see the essays only through the lens of what the evaluators think
is important. They want to read beyond the lines of the assessment
criteria, but they can't. Because humans are required to read 20-30
essays per hour, they end up evaluating essays using the same
simple features used by the machines
                                                           About Assessing Writing 283

    In reading high-stakes, one-shot essay tests, then, both
machines and humans make lousy evaluators when we reduce their
reading process to a few limited features. Machines do this because
they can't do anything else. Humans do this because they're trained
to ignore everything else they might see and interpret in an essay,
including even how factual its assertions are, in order to score
only those things that the test makers deem significant and, more
importantly, can be scored very quickly (slow, thoughtful reading
costs money).

    To take a (not so extreme) case, imagine that we assume good
writing can be measured entirely by the number of grammatical
and punctuation mistakes in a text. A human can be trained to
act like a machine, hunting for grammatical mistakes and ignoring
everything else. A computer can be similarly trained to recognize
a lot of mistakes, even while missing some and flagging false posi-
tives. But both evaluators, human and computer, miss the point.
Writing is far more complex than a missing comma. The testing
agencies that fail to understand fully what writing is and how the
ability to produce it is best measured are at fault.

Taking the Machine Out of Writing Assessment

    When it comes to testing and evaluating our kids' writing,
machines alone aren't really the problem. It's what we're telling
the machines to do. And that's very similar to what we ask human
evaluators to do. What, then, is the solution?

    First, we need to stop testing our kids' writing to death.
Computer scientists (who are not writing specialists) were
attracted to the possibility of machine scoring precisely because
the regressive kind of human scoring they were presented with
looked so simple and replicable. We must start by critiquing the
testing machine writ large--the multibillion-dollar industry that
preys on school districts, misinformed politicians, naïve parents,
and exploitable kids under the guise of providing assessment data
designed to improve education. Nothing is improved by relentless
testing, especially of the kind that reduces writing to the equiva-
lent of running on a hamster wheel. No standardized writing test is
purposeful, motivating, or engaging, and it almost never gives the
writer any response other than a number.

    If the methods of this testing and evaluation are misguided,
what happens with the results can be deplorable. Because of relent-
less and unfounded accountability coming from politicians and
government officials who often know next to nothing about how
284 Bad Ideas

education really works, schools must demonstrate their success
through standardized tests. Teachers' pay raises or even their
jobs are linked to their students' scores on these tests, and entire
schools can be defunded or closed if they fall too far below a norm,
even though they may be located in an area of urban blight and
populated by kids who, through no fault of their own, do not have
advantages that support their early literacy development. So what
happens? The teachers, fearful of the consequences of poor test
scores, begin narrowing everything they do in anticipation of the
standardized tests. This process can bankrupt kids' education by
denying them richer learning experiences unrelated to the narrow
parameters of the tests. Worse, it bankrupts teachers' creativity
and freedom to apply skills and strategies they've learned as educa-
tors to create a meaningful, engaging curriculum--in other words,
to teach, in the best sense of the word.

     What's the alternative? It's not in evaluation, but in support.
It's to get testing off the backs of students and teachers. It's to
help young people to develop their writing abilities in authentic
situations that give them time to think and formulate ideas, gather
necessary information, structure and draft pieces of writing, and
hone them to accomplish meaningful goals, such as to inform or
persuade or entertain people who can make sense of what they
write. It's to put far more time into teaching than evaluating. It's
to re-empower teachers to use their best, most creative abilities
to nurture students' writing and give them multiple purposes,
contexts, and audiences. It's to recognize the meaning that writers
are conveying and not just simple formal elements of their prose.
It's to recognize that students are at different stages of develop-
ment and language proficiency and to teach accordingly.

     Why are we reducing writing situations to sterile, purposeless
tasks designed to yield a few metrics that are poorly related to the
meaning of the word "writing?" Test makers and evaluation agen-
cies will say that they aren't denying learners all the rich, meaning-
ful writing situations they should encounter, but that their tests
are a convenient, simple, cheap way to measure what they can
do. But they're not. More authentic kinds of evaluation, such as
student portfolios carefully read by teachers, are much better and
more humane methods because they focus as much on the devel-
opment of ability as they do on its measurement. And if computers
can't read a 1,000-word test essay, they won't even begin to know
what to do with a portfolio.

PLAGIARISM DETECTION SERVICES
ARE MONEY WELL SPENT

    Stephanie Vie

    With the advent of the World Wide Web, a kind of plagiarism
paranoia has begun to grip us with a growing sense that we must
do something to address the ease with which authors can copy and
paste their work. This issue certainly crops up in the university
setting. Some instructors may begin to see it as a personal affront
to their teaching, questioning whether students think they are too
clueless to notice. As plagiarism paranoia takes hold, faculty begin
to wonder how many other students are plagiarizing or have plagia-
rized in the past. Maybe John, since he seems to never be paying
attention. Or maybe Kim, since she doesn't write all that well. Or
what about Bob, because his essay was so well written? It seems
sad when instructors begin to fear that students are plagiarizing
because they've turned in well-written essays.

    In the wake of ongoing intellectual scandals, plagiarism (and
its resultant paranoia) has been a subject of discussion outside
the university as well; newspapers have reported on multiple ethi-
cal lapses by famous writers. Noted historian Stephen Ambrose
was accused of plagiarizing several of his books almost word-for-
word; he apologized immediately, blaming it on sloppy footnot-
ing. Similarly, Doris Kearns Goodwin was accused of plagiarism
and faulted poor note-taking. Susan Sontag, also accused of plagia-
rism in 2000, excused her borrowing as literary effect. Jayson Blair,
Kaavya Viswanathan, Jane Goodall, Alex Haley, Fareed Zakaria,
Jonah Lehrer: The list continues, with many of these authors
settling out of court or pulling copies of their work from further
publication. Famous speakers, including those in the academic and
political arenas, are also regularly called out for plagiarizing parts of
their speeches. Naturally, in response to what seems like rampant
288 Bad Ideas

plagiarism, and what author David Callahan has called a "cheating
culture," we look for solutions. Initially, plagiarism detection tech-
nologies like Turnitin.com or Blackboard's SafeAssign sound like
ideal solutions. These technologies promise to detect how much
writing is unoriginal in a piece, allowing the viewer of one of their
originality reports to assess the level of potential plagiarism in a
written document.

     However, plagiarism detection technologies are not a magic
bullet, nor the solution to the perceived problem of increasing
plagiarism in an Internet age. For one, research has shown that
plagiarism detection technologies like Turnitin don't work particu-
larly well. Debora Weber-Wulff, author of False Feathers: A Perspective
on Academic Plagiarism, has tested various plagiarism detection tech-
nologies from 2004 to 2013. Her tests illustrate a variety of prob-
lems with the use of plagiarism detection technologies for their
intended purpose. They flag false positives readily--that is, indicat-
ing material is plagiarized when it is not. Without careful reading,
the results make it look as though authors are plagiarizing when
they are not (e.g., flagging a bibliography or common phrases, and
thus indicating a high level of unoriginality in a document). False
negatives are also an issue, where the software does not discern
unoriginal material. In this case, actual plagiarized material is over-
looked by the plagiarism detection technology. This is a significant
issue when dealing with a technology whose main purpose is to
ferret out unoriginal material. If individuals are going to rely on
plagiarism detection technologies, they need to interpret the orig-
inality reports, which often include reports on the percentage of
potentially plagiarized material, incredibly carefully.

     In addition to the time it takes to review these reports, plagia-
rism detection technologies are expensive. Many academic insti-
tutions must pay for subscriptions to popular plagiarism detec-
tion technologies like Turnitin.com or Blackboard's SafeAssign.
Because of the high price invested in purchasing these tools, certain
schools will either mandate or strongly encourage faculty members
to use the software to offset that heavy investment. For example,
I work at the University of Central Florida, and at our institution,
we get a price break on Turnitin because we were early adopters
of this technology. This means we only pay $20,000 per year for
mandatory access to Turnitin. I was taken aback when I started in
2013 and was told all faculty members supervising dissertations
and theses must submit their students' work to Turnitin before a
defense. In addition, all faculty members' grant applications must

go through iThenticate, another arm of iParadigms LLC's massive
conglomeration of services that include GradeMark, PeerMark,
OriginalityCheck (aka Turnitin), and iThenticate for Admissions.
Other institutions will pay higher prices, such as the University
of Glasgow in Scotland, where a 2013 Turnitin renewal quote was
£25,000 per year, or around $37,000 USD. Florida State University
in Jacksonville was quoted a one-year renewal cost of $57,000 USD
in 2012. Compared to these prices, Blackboard's SafeAssign may
seem like a much better investment--after all, it's free because
it's available bundled with the learning management system
Blackboard. But of course, the learning management system itself
costs money to an institution, and these costs are comparable to
Turnitin--anywhere from $50,000 per year up to six figures for
large institutions.

    Plagiarism detection technologies have been critiqued because
they often disrespect the intellectual property of the author whose
work is being submitted. An author's work is submitted to a plagia-
rism detection site and then usually saved as part of the tool's data-
bases to be used in the future when new works are submitted for
originality checks. I use the passive voice intentionally here: An
author's work is submitted. It is often not the author him- or herself
submitting work to the plagiarism detection technology; it is more
frequently someone else submitting another person's work to the
tool for it to be checked. The problem then lies in whether the
author consented to his or her work being submitted to the plagia-
rism detection tool.

    In the instance of Turnitin, for example, student authors at
schools like McLean High School in Virginia have collected signa-
tures on petitions against the mandatory use of the service. These
students and others like them argue that, because their writing is
saved as part of Turnitin's massive database for use in checking
future papers for plagiarism, the company is profiting from their
intellectual property. The four student plaintiffs from McLean
asked for compensation, arguing that their papers were added to
Turnitin's database against their will; however, the district court
ruled in favor of Turnitin, setting a precedent for future argu-
ments. The district court granted summary judgment to iPara-
digms (creator of Turnitin) on the basis of two things: The court
argued that the students entered into binding agreements when
they clicked "I Agree" upon uploading their work. Second, the
court found that--according to the lawsuit Vanderhye v. iParadigms
LLC--Turnitin's use of the students' work in its databases was
290 Bad Ideas

"transformative because its purpose was to prevent plagiarism by
comparative use," and this did not impact the market value for
high school term papers.

     There may not be much of a market value for high school
papers, but these papers are indeed students' original work--and
if they don't consent to include that work in a massive database for
a for-profit plagiarism detection service, it is troubling that they
can ultimately be forced to do so or else risk their grades or their
ability to graduate. In the case of the graduate students I work with
at the University of Central Florida, I must submit their disserta-
tions or master's theses to Turnitin's iThenticate system--and I
can do this without notifying them and without their consent. It's
a condition of their degree completion, and if they care about their
intellectual property being stored forever in a plagiarism detection
technology's database for future use and profit, there's not much
they can do about it.

So What Do We Do?

     I have noted here that plagiarism detection technologies are
expensive, don't work particularly well, and often profit from the
intellectual property of others--frequently without their consent.
Plagiarism detection technologies engage in stereotypical under-
standings of writing and the composing process, and they frequently
fail to embrace current writing studies scholarship and best prac-
tices regarding the writing process. In that case, what should we
do?

     An entirely refreshing option is to give up on catching every
plagiarist. This would entail embracing some of the features of the
so-called Internet Age that I mentioned at the beginning of this
piece. Yes, it's true that the wealth of material available online has
made it easier to copy and paste. On one hand, this is true liter-
ally: I can highlight text, type control-C on my keyboard, and then
control-V to paste that text into a word processing document. As
easy as that, I have copied and pasted online material. But on the
other hand, this is true metaphorically as well. The idea of copying
and pasting--or what scholars like Harvard Law professor Lawrence
Lessig have termed remix--is well suited to the Internet Age. Today,
I can find hundreds of thousands of images, songs, sounds, and,
yes, words online, and I can mix them together in new and interest-
ing ways to create soundscapes, collages, and other transformative
works. This creativity has led to the creation of sites like Creative
                                                           About Assessing Writing 291

Commons, where authors can choose from a variety of ways to
license their original works, such as "Attribution--ShareAlike,"
which the site describes as allowing "others [to] remix, tweak, and
build upon your work even for commercial purposes, as long as
they credit you and license their new creations under the identi-
cal terms." Rather than the traditional all rights reserved emphasis
of copyright laws, Creative Commons licenses allow creators of
works to reserve some rights and indicate to others their level of
comfort with transformative use of their materials.

    What would be the value of giving up the fight to catch all
plagiarists and instead embrace more fully a remix culture? As film-
maker Kirby Ferguson explains, "Everything is a remix." Everything
already is borrowed, in some way or another, from earlier ideas.
Ferguson's TED Talk on the subject draws on examples like Bob
Dylan's and Danger Mouse's music, technological features like
the iPhone's multi-touch, and the movie Avatar, among others.
His goal is to illustrate that the boundaries between plagiarism
and homage, copying and allusion, are porous and these seem-
ingly black-and-white boundaries are truly gray areas. As Henry
Ford noted in a 1909 interview, "I invented nothing new. I simply
assembled into a car the discoveries of other men behind whom
were centuries of work."

    The advantage here of casting aside the hunt for plagiarists and
embracing a remix culture is that we can embrace the idea that
nothing we create will be entirely new and that's okay. For many
writers, we become blocked when we feel as though good writ-
ing must only be game-changing writing, the kind of thing that
says something new and entirely different, that no one has ever
said before. And who can blame students for finding it difficult to
compose something supposedly new when faced with timeworn
prompts asking them to write a five-paragraph essay about gun
control or the death penalty? Indeed, for those of us who teach
writing, helping new authors get past this focus on game-chang-
ing writing is crucial; they frequently believe that, in order to enter
into the conversation, they have to find something out there to
write about that no one has ever said or done before. But even for
more seasoned writers, the expanse of the blank page coupled with
the expectation of genius is incredibly daunting. The use of remix
allows for the creative inclusion of others' ideas, making a space
for works that are derivative or transformative of other people's
work. For all authors (not just students), this might involve delib-
erately weaving in others' words as a form of collaborative collage
292 Bad Ideas

to illustrate the transformative potential of such work, or relying
on Creative-Commons licensed materials and other public copy-
right licensed materials in projects. It also might ask us to learn
more about fair use rights and, further, exercise our fair use rights
as a form of empowerment.

     Readers who are interested in learning more about plagiarism
detection technologies may find Debora Weber-Wulff's multi-year
study of these tools satisfying. Her book False Feathers: A Perspective

     Many scholars draw connections between plagiarism and the
role of remix culture in the arts. Many beneficial articles tackle the
idea of creative remix: Adrian Chen's short Gawker article "Remix
Everything: BuzzFeed and the Plagiarism Problem" is a good
place to start, as it discusses how social media plays a signifi-
cant role in today's remix culture. Daniela Duca's "The Irreverent
Plagiarists: After Sherrie Levine, Michael Mandiberg and Hermann
Zschiegner" introduces readers to these artists and their ground-
breaking stances against more traditional understandings of copy-
right in art; Duca refers to them as "appropriating artists," argu-
ing that they ask us to question authorship and meaning through
their works. Another good example is Richard Prince's work--his
art installation New Portraits makes viewers question "What is art?
What is originality?"

     Readers interested in learning more about the Creative
Commons can visit their website where one can discover the
different licensing options available as well as search for licensed
work to use in their own creative endeavors. To get inspired, Kirby
Ferguson's TED talk "Embrace the Remix" and companion website,
"Everything is Remix" (are fantastic inspirations. And probably
one of the foremost names in remix culture is Harvard professor
Lawrence Lessig; his title Remix: Making Art and Commerce Thrive in
the Hybrid Economy is exceptional.

SAT SCORES ARE USEFUL FOR
PLACING STUDENTS IN WRITING
COURSES

    Kristen di Gennaro

     In the United States, many students planning to attend college
are required to take standardized tests, such as the SAT, as part
of the college application process. Currently the SAT includes
sections measuring critical reading, math, and writing skills consid-
ered necessary for success in college. In 2004, the College Board
(that controls and revises the SAT) introduced an essay component
as part of the test. Many college writing programs applauded this
change, as it supported the position that a test measuring writing
ability must actually require test takers to write, rather than simply
respond to multiple-choice or short-answer questions about gram-
mar, spelling, and mechanics.

     College administrators welcomed the change as well, seeing it
as an opportunity to reduce or even eliminate the writing placement
exams that incoming students take upon their acceptance or arrival
on campus. Indeed, using students' scores from externally admin-
istered admissions tests for internal purposes was immediately
seen as both time-saving and cost-effective for colleges. The prac-
tice also appealed to those who believe that students are subjected
to too much testing. Who would object to this multi-purpose test?

     Yet in 2014, just a decade after the SAT essay component's
debut, the College Board downgraded the essay to optional status,
meaning it is no longer a required section of the test. If the essay is
so useful for college writing faculty and administrators, why would
its creators essentially discourage its use? Wouldn't demand from
stakeholders ensure its ongoing success?

     When test users multi-task SAT scores, however, they fail to
realize that the test lacks validity for these additional uses. Most
                                                           About Assessing Writing 295

people understand test validity to mean that a test measures what it
claims to measure: A driving test measures driving skills and a writ-
ing test measures writing ability. What many people fail to realize,
however, is that a test in and of itself does not have or lack validity,
but the purposes for which it is applied can be more or less valid.
According to the American Educational Research Association, a
test's validity depends upon its intended use. For example, using
results from a driving test to award or deny someone a driver's
license is a valid use of a driving test, but using the same results
to award or deny high school diplomas would not be considered a
valid use. The driving test has little or no validity as an indication
of who deserves a high school diploma. A clear-cut case such as
this is easy to understand. Less clear are cases where different tests
adopt a similar format, such as the SAT writing component and a
college writing placement test.

    The SAT is a norm-referenced test. This means that scoring the
test involves identifying the median, or middle score, produced by
a group of test takers. Test takers' scores are then arranged above
and below the median to create a so-called normal curve (hence
the term norm-referenced), also called a bell curve given its shape.
The curve takes this shape because the vast majority of test takers'
scores fall under the largest area of the curve, slightly above and
slightly below the median score, creating the bell shape.

    Norm-referenced tests are designed to compare test takers
to the norm and to one another. Thus, spreading scores along a
normal curve allows for easy classification of test takers' scores as
average, above average, or below average in relation to the group.
For this reason, the results of norm-referenced tests are reported
in percentiles, not percentages, as percentiles indicate a test taker's
score in relation to the rest of the group. For example, a score at
the 95th percentile indicates that the test taker performed better
than 95% of the other test takers who took the same test, not that
the test taker answered 95% of the questions correctly. In fact,
a percentile score says nothing about how many questions a test
taker answered correctly or incorrectly, or about the test taker's
mastery of any particular area of knowledge or skill, but only how
the test taker compared with the rest of the group.

    Norm-referenced tests are useful for making decisions based
on group comparisons. The primary purpose of the SAT is to allow
test users, including students, guidance counselors, and college
admissions officers, to make comparisons across test takers from a
variety of secondary schools in order to determine which students
296 Bad Ideas

are most likely to succeed at certain colleges. The SAT, by design,
is not aligned with any particular curriculum, since it must be
relevant for test takers from a vast range of programs and schools
across the United States.

     The primary purpose of a placement test, on the other hand,
is to determine where in a specific program students should begin
their coursework. Programs following developmentally based
curricula, such as mathematics, foreign languages, and writing,
may rely on some form of placement testing for incoming students.
Unlike nationally relevant tests such as the SAT, placement tests
must be closely linked to the curriculum of the specific program for
which they were designed. Tests aligned with a particular program
or curriculum fall under the category of criterion-referenced tests.

     Criterion-referenced tests are useful when test takers need to
demonstrate mastery of specific knowledge, ability, or skills. The
driving test mentioned earlier serves as a good example of a criteri-
on-referenced test, since test takers have to demonstrate sufficient
knowledge of the rules of the road to not create a hazard to other
drivers or pedestrians. A test taker's performance, or score, in rela-
tion to other test takers is irrelevant. If a test taker performs better
than 95% of other test takers but all failed to respect the rules of
the road, no one is awarded a driver's license. Likewise, if every-
one studies and practices for the test and all perform well, they all
receive licenses.

     The purpose of a writing placement test is to determine which
course within a specific program best matches a student's writing
strengths and weaknesses. For a placement test to be useful, it
must be aligned with a program's course offerings. The best way
to achieve this necessary alignment is through the development of
locally designed placement tools, or tools that are adapted for the
local environment.

     In many cases, local placement testing involves having students
submit writing samples that are then evaluated by faculty members
familiar with the local course options. Students might be asked to
create their writing samples on-site, in response to writing tasks
designed by faculty, or may be required to submit portfolios show-
casing a variety of writing samples. More recently, several programs
are experimenting with directed self-placement, a type of self-as-
sessment process where students respond to questions intended
to raise self-awareness of their own strengths and weaknesses in
writing. Students might then select a course based on their self-as-
sessments, or programs might combine students' self-assessment
                                                           About Assessing Writing 297

responses with their writing samples to make placement decisions.
    So, there are at least two reasons for rejecting SAT scores as

a substitute for placement testing. One is that a test's validity
depends on its intended use, and since the SAT was not designed
as a placement test, it lacks validity for this purpose. The second
reason is that the SAT is a norm-referenced test not aligned with
a particular curriculum, while a college writing placement test is
a criterion-referenced test with results linked to specific course
content.

    Many people, especially college writing faculty, interpret the
College Board's decision to minimize the role of the SAT essay
test as an admission that it was a poor measure of writing ability.
According to Les Perelman, retired MIT professor and outspoken
critic of the SAT essay test since its inception, giving test takers
only 25 minutes to read, reflect, and respond intelligently to a
topic in writing is an "absurd" task. (See Chris Anson and Les
Perelman's chapter in this book for more on the validity of stan-
dardized writing tests.)

    While it's popular to criticize those in the testing industry for
creating bad or invalid tests, a test is not inherently good or bad,
valid or invalid. Judging the validity of a test goes beyond consid-
erations of format and content. Even a 25-minute writing task can
have validity for certain uses. And a test that has the desired format
and content coverage is only valid when used for the purpose for
which it was created. As soon as a test is used for an additional
purpose, its validity is called into question. Thus, rather than
blame the College Board for not designing the SAT essay along the
model of a criterion-referenced placement test, writing assessment
experts should blame those who multi-task SAT scores, misusing
them for purposes for which they were not intended. Perhaps the
College Board's decision to downgrade the SAT essay component
will prevent further irresponsible uses of their tests.

BAD IDEAS ABOUT WRITING
AND DIGITAL TECHNOLOGY
TEXTING RUINS STUDENTS'
GRAMMAR SKILLS

    Scott Warnock

    There is a sturdy tradition of generalized complaints that
student writing is terrible. While these complaints are an age-old
problem, in 1975 Newsweek published "Why Johnny Can't Write,"
alerting its readers about the nationwide bad writing of "your chil-
dren" and zeroing in on a few culprits, which included a newfan-
gled emphasis on "`creativity' in the English classrooms" and "the
simplistic spoken style of television." Recently, this criticism has
been articulated in a different way: Digital technology is ruining
students' grammar. So, as young Johnnys and Jennys peck out
texts or emails or social media posts, they are paradoxically--and
unwittingly--fueling arguments that their ability to use language
is disintegrating. People look at texting shortcuts or the abbrevia-
tion- and jargon-filled communicative environments of Facebook,
Twitter, Reddit, Instagram, and other social media sites, and lament
that digital writing is causing young people to butcher grammar.
An unstated implication of these beliefs might be that digital writ-
ing is harming the next generation's ability to think clearly.

    We need to put to rest the idea that digital forms of writing pose
a threat to overall writing ability. In particular, we must address
claims of specific cause-and-effect between digital writing and bad
grammar. There are three main problems with this bad idea: (1)
Complaints about writing deteriorating because of digital technol-
ogy are simply part of a history of complaining about the worsen-
ing grammar, writing, mechanics, or style of younger generations;
(2) the definition of grammar in this context is often wrong; and
(3) this bad idea is based on an unproven link between digital writ-
ing behaviors and other kinds of writing.
302 Bad Ideas

Language Panics

     First, the assertion that new forms of communication signal
the end of the world is nothing new. Even an intellectual giant
like the philosopher Plato was worried. Plato took a look at writ-
ing itself--that odd, scribing technology emerging during his
time--and sounded the alarm; in his work, Phaedrus, he expressed
concern that writing might be dangerous because it could damage
our ability to memorize and offered only the semblance of wisdom.
Since Plato's ancient worries, concerns have continued unabated.
Education professor Harvey Daniels calls these moments language
panics that "are as familiar a feature of the human chronicle as wars."
Daniels says that there has always been "the inevitable sense that
everything was fine until the moment at hand, 1965, or 1789, or
2500 B.C., when suddenly the language (be it American English,
British English, or Sumerian) began the final plunge to oblivion."

     Writing has a special place in our cultural commentary:
Everybody thinks they are an expert, but only when it comes to
seeing that things are getting worse--what some writing experts
call grammar rants. These rants and the beliefs they represent become
intertwined with the way people see writing, particularly in terms
of what is thought of as grammatical and mechanical mistakes. In
his article, "The Phenomenology of Error," writing scholar Joseph
Williams lists this history of fierce tirades against poor grammar
and writing, but he also demonstrates that many "rules of gram-
mar lack practical force." Williams takes a clever approach to make
his point. He repeatedly shows that people, including some famous
writers who express strong views about specific writing errors, fail
to notice such errors in their own writing. Williams states that we
often do not see errors unless we look for them, and he makes this
assertion directly about the way teachers read and criticize their
own students' writing. To further emphasize this point, Williams
embeds 100 such errors in his own article and asks readers, mostly
English teachers, how many they saw; doubtless, few noticed the
vast majority of them. As readers, we tend to see errors where we
want to, and we ignore errors where we do not expect to find them
(such as a published article about writing!). Williams ultimately
asks this: If an error is on the page but no one sees it, is it really an
error? Does it matter?

     The observations or even fears of digital technology-driven or
-facilitated error patterns are merely the latest in a long history
of misplaced generational critiques about writing. Whether it has
                                         About Writing and Digital Technologies 303

been pencils, television, computers, or cellphones, technological
culprits of bad writing have always been found: Arguments blam-
ing people ("kids these days!") extend back through time and are
based on skewed views of error and correctness. Those who study
the matter understand that languages shift as cultures evolve and
technologies change, and seeing such shifts as a kind of deteriora-
tion is to fall into step with the same, long history of uninformed
pessimism.

What Grammar is--and is Not

    These recurring language panics stem from the ongoing suspi-
cion that, for one reason or another, language is being eroded--
however flawed such suspicions may be. In this case, specific
complaints that digital writing behaviors affect grammar nega-
tively are grounded in misunderstandings about what grammar is.
Grammar can have a variety of meanings. In an often-quoted essay,
English professor W. Nelson Francis says the way people use the
term grammar can range from "the set of formal patterns in which
the words of a language are arranged in order to convey larger
meanings" to "linguistic etiquette." This difference of definition is
important because when people express opinions about poor gram-
mar, they use the word grammar as if they are talking about sacred,
official, absolute rules when they are instead providing views (and
accompanying biases) about how they think language should be
used correctly. In fact, commenting about Francis's article, English
professor Patrick Hartwell points out that linguistic etiquette is not
grammar at all, but usage.

    Williams, in his book Style: Lessons in Clarity and Grace, offers a
further clarification of how people muddle ideas like grammar and
correctness; Williams identifies three kinds of rules that people
often confuse:

      · Real Rules: These "define what makes English English,"
         such, he says, as an article preceding a noun: the book, not
         book the.

      · Social Rules: These "distinguish Standard English from
         nonstandard," such as not using ain't.

      · Invented Rules: "Some grammarians have invented a hand-
         ful of rules that they think we all should observe," Williams
         writes, such as not splitting an infinitive: to quietly leave
         would thus be wrong to a purist.

Native speakers of English, Williams says, follow Real Rules as
a matter of course. The Social Rules, though, are not based on
304 Bad Ideas

fundamental, inherent language quality; he says the only people
who self-consciously follow Social Rules are those "not born into
Standard English who are striving to rise into the educated class."
The Invented Rules are closer to what Williams (similar to Robin
Zeff) calls folklore. The grammar of the language and the systems
and structure of word order and word forms are not the same as
preferences of style or perceived niceties of language. When people
say "grammar" in such contexts, they mean something closer to
"how writing is seen by a particular audience," and, again, finding
error in such contexts is a function of a reader's judgment of a text,
not of the writer's abilities, talents, or knowledge.

     Of course, human beings have always used language to judge
and control one another. We understand what it means to say, "She
sounds educated." Teaching grammar in a rigid, this-is-inherent-
ly-better-than-that way is irresponsible--and it can be dangerous.
English professors Kenneth Lindblom and Patricia Dunn state that
such teaching "can help to perpetuate cultural prejudices regard-
ing class and race that are mirrored in what is often referred to as
the difference between `correct' and `incorrect' or between `proper'
and `improper' language use." In a critical response to that 1975
Newsweek article, linguist Suzette Haden Elgin articulates this prob-
lem of heavy-handed, absolute correctness, pointing out "there is a
real problem in trying, however gently, to `correct' language, since
there is no firm agreement about what is "correct':

         "Correct" English, by which I assume Newsweek
         means the so-called Standard American English, is
         a kind of consensus agreement among numerous
         differing dialects as to which shared items they are
         all willing to throw into the stylistic pot. "Correct"
         English is things like ending written sentences
         with periods rather than commas and putting "-ed"
         on the end of regular past tense verbs. "Correct"
         English is things like not using "ain't," and restrict-
         ing the negatives to one to a sentence, and putting
         most direct objects to the right of the verb. Things
         like that.

     These types of mistaken ideas about correct English can drive
the language panics mentioned. They fuel how people look for and
interpret errors and what they see as bad writing of all sorts.
                                         About Writing and Digital Technologies 305

Carrying over the Bad Habits of Digital Writing?

    Now digital technology has been tossed into the midst of these
flawed ideas. The few studies that have attempted to correlate
connections between digital writing behaviors, specifically texting,
and grammar woes have used instruments like multiple-choice
quizzes to measure things that have little to do with grammar.
Linguists have had a field day attacking this kind of research.
Linguist Josef Fruehwald says such studies demonstrate the misun-
derstandings about language and grammar, pointing out that the
quizzes that drive most of the research really measure "punctua-
tion, comma rules, spelling conventions, etc.," and these things are
"arbitrary decisions settled upon a long time ago, and have noth-
ing, nothing to do with human language." In other words, you may
not know the spelling difference between "accept" and "except,"
but that is not a grammatical issue.

    Going further, the idea that digital tools harm writing requires
not just a misunderstanding about grammar, but a belief that one
form of writing, such as texting, would influence or transfer, perhaps
inexorably, to another form, such as an argument paper in school.
Numerous studies have found this not to be the case. One research
team puts it bluntly: "Textism use does not appear to harm chil-
dren's literacy." In the journal Reading and Writing, another group of
researchers studied the relationship between texting and grammar
and found considerable inconsistency in writing patterns for differ-
ent tasks and age groups, concluding that "parents and educators
need not be concerned that children's grammatical knowledge is
being consistently or directly compromised when they make gram-
matical violations in their text messages." A small study by writ-
ing researcher Michaela Cullington, in which she reviewed papers
from a number of students, finds no examples of texting shortcuts
in otherwise formal school writing. Michaela writes that "texting
is not interfering with students' use of standard written English."
People often vigorously complain that texting is influencing other
sorts of writing, but most of those who have studied the matter do
not find such a connection.

Questions Not Just about Grammar

    The idea that digital technology is destroying grammar is
founded in new misunderstandings about digital writing and
306 Bad Ideas

age-old, generationally tinged misunderstandings about language
and grammar. Children today are creating texts at a greater rate
than any other generation in history. Indeed, the digital writing
they do can often appear unfamiliar to those who did not grow up
with such technologies. Historically, a default reaction has been to
view such unfamiliarity as a problem, to see the writing as lesser--
with the accompanying claim that the "grammar" is bad (perhaps
an articulation of "my generation is better than yours!").

     Quelling this bad idea might raise bigger-picture definitional
challenges--and not just about grammar. It may call into ques-
tion, now that digital communications are so ubiquitous, just what
people mean when they say "writing." As Zeff notes, even back
in 2007, students were seeing a difference between digital writing
and school writing: "They write constantly. Only they do not see
that format of communicating as writing." She says, "My students
tell me that writing is something you do in class for a grade. All
the other modes are talking." Redefining what we mean by writing
could help clarify some of these critiques.

     Regardless, as it stands now, screenagers, digital natives--or
whatever people choose to call them--may be the most literate
generation ever, yet some stubbornly persist in criticizing their
grammar and even claiming that they cannot switch from texting
shortcuts to other forms of writing. Instead of viewing e-communi-
cations as a cause of worry or harm, perhaps we might instead see
the use of digital writing as yet another example of how humans
find ingenious ways to make language, in all its systems and
nuances, work in new contexts.

TEXTING RUINS LITERACY SKILLS

    Christopher Justice

     Text messaging, or texting, refers to the communicative prac-
tice of sending brief messages on cell phones, other personal digital
devices, or online instant messaging services using conventional,
but more often abbreviated, graphic, or otherwise non-conven-
tional uses of language. One who texts is generally referred to as
a texter, and although texts are often composed with alphabetic
letters, texters are using an increasingly more sophisticated range
of visual and sonic media to communicate through this medium.

     Texting became commercially available for the public in
the mid-1990s, and since then, its popularity has skyrocketed.
According to the Pew Research Center, approximately 75% of
Americans in 2011 sent and received text messages. Due to this
popularity and the unconventional ways texters use language,
a potent public backlash against texting has emerged, prop-
agated further by the media and other cultural elites. As David
Crystal points out in his book Txtng: The gr8 db8, headlines like
these from the mid-2000s have become the norm for how many
people understand texting: "Texting and Emailing `Fog Your Brain
like Cannabis'"; "Texting Does Not Influence Literacy Skills"; and
"Texting Deprives Children of Sleep."

      Unfortunately, the myth has continued into the present: In
a 2012 Baltimore Sun article, the author reports on a study from
Pennsylvania State University that found texting negatively affects
students' grammar skills. More troubling, the article begins with
these words, "It probably comes as no surprise to those of us who
have read our kids' composition papers," and ends with these,
"OMG! One more challenge to teaching our kids to write!" Both
comments suggest that texting is a major problem causing students
to write poorly, a position that oversimplifies and overlooks
                                         About Writing and Digital Technologies 309

numerous other important factors that influence how people, espe-
cially students, write. Additionally, in a 2014 Los Angeles Times arti-
cle, a columnist argues that texting produces linguistic and intel-
lectual laziness, predictability, and desperation.

    The examples of these doomsday scenarios are too pervasive
to fully review here. Nevertheless, according to these positions,
texting causes people, especially children, teenagers, and college
students, to misspell words, poorly punctuate sentences, and
grammatically pollute sentences. (For a counterargument to this
bad idea, see Scott Warnock's chapter elsewhere in this collection.)
Given the often-limited space texters have to compose messages
(like Twitter's 140-character limit), many argue that texters' abili-
ties to compose complex, well-supported arguments is dwindling.
Texting also shortens attention spans and distracts significantly
when engaging in otherwise important, necessary activities such
as reading, working, or driving.

    In general, these arguments make this clear: Texting is a major
threat to our literacy skills. However, as linguist John McWhorter
claims, texting is a "miraculous thing" that marks "an emergent
complexity" with how we use language. Texting is a "new way
of writing" that we can use alongside traditional writing and "an
expansion of [our] linguistic repertoire," marking a new type of
bilingualism that reflects a positive development in our constantly
evolving linguistic selves. Or, as Crystal states, "Texting is one
of the most innovative linguistic phenomena of modern times."
Texting should be respected and taken more seriously as a sophisti-
cated form of discourse that has the potential to revolutionize how
we write and our overall relationship to language.

    Texting offers society many positive benefits. For starters,
texting's economic impact is significant: The industry that supports
texting's infrastructure is a lucrative business that employs many
people. In general, texting offers efficiency and convenience in how
we communicate. Texting allows us to receive information quickly
in catastrophic or dangerous situations or when conditions are not
conducive to speaking, such as in loud settings or when privacy is
needed. Texting offers us useful reminders along with advice, tute-
lage, and help. As Crystal notes, texting also offers intimacy while
preserving social distance. Moreover, Crystal argues, texting culti-
vates a playfulness in how we use language and communicate with
others. Play, as many who study ludology (the study of play) note,
can have a powerful, positive impact on communication, creativity,
self-esteem, and other behaviors.
310 Bad Ideas

     More specifically, the myth that texting leads to illiteracy must
stop for several reasons. One reason is that in many contexts, texting
allows writers more time than speech to formulate their thoughts,
and like other types of electronic media, texting also allows ample
opportunities to revise and organize one's thoughts. Second, the
sudden and rapid popularity of texting is radically disproportionate
to illiteracy rates. If texting causes illiteracy, and if so many people
are texting, why are literacy rates not rapidly declining?

     Additionally, while abbreviations are popular in texting,
they are not a new linguistic phenomenon; one need only read a
government contract issued through agencies such as the National
Science Foundation or Environmental Protection Agency to realize
how useful and ubiquitous abbreviations are. Our language is filled
with abbreviations such as a.m. or p.m. to denote time; B.A., M.A.,
J.D., Ph.D. to denote degrees; Mr., Sgt., VP, CEO to denote titles;
HIV, DNA, LSD, and others to denote scientific language; and
MD, JAN, or W to denote states, months, or directions. Acronyms
(abbreviations with vowels that spell new words) are equally popu-
lar: scuba, laser, NATO, OSHA, and AWOL are just a few examples.
Contractions are equally popular. Moreover, many of the abbrevi-
ations and otherwise truncated uses of language are instigated by
efficient uses of the keyboard, which is a provocative and clever
use of media and an important hallmark of literacy. Ultimately,
the abbreviated language that characterizes texting discourse is
a continuation of a historical trend that reveals how people have
creatively used language for conciseness and efficiency.

     A common criticism levied against texting points to how
texters' literacy skills supposedly decline after texting; however,
what more people need to realize are the impressive literacy skills
texters possess before texting. To some degree, texting is a magnet
for the literate. For example, the ability to text already suggests
relative media savvy. You can't text without having a basic under-
standing of how texting, cell phones, keyboards, and other media
work. Also, when people use informal language in their texts,
many understand there are already levels of formality appropriate
for different communicative contexts. Try abbreviating or truncat-
ing language when you don't already know the correct spelling of a
word or syntax of a phrase.

     Moreover, texting positively exercises texters' rhetorical skills.
Since texts are written in various styles, people must know how
to match the style of a text with its message, audience, and tone,
which for many is a sophisticated rhetorical act that we too often
                                         About Writing and Digital Technologies 311

take for granted. For example, texters often already have a sophis-
ticated sense of audience when texting because the medium facil-
itates frequent communication with vastly different audiences:
spouses, parents, bosses, friends, health professionals, grandpar-
ents, colleagues, lovers, and so on. Texting also requires people
to understand the rhetorical context of a situation: where they
will receive the message, what their location is. Understanding
these factors is critical in rhetorical communication. Tone is also
important in texting since the medium allows for different ways
to present tone through punctuation marks, attached photos, and
emoticons. Additionally, given the instantaneous nature of texting,
many frequent texters are often engaged in kairos, or the rhetorical
concept of understanding when the timing and overall context for
making an argument is ideal. In fact, Crystal even speculates that
perhaps a new branch of linguistics will be needed to study texting.
Such a field would acknowledge texting's many complexities and
draw from fields such as pragmatics, discourse analysis, sociolin-
guistics, orthography, and others.

    Since texting typically occurs on devices with access to multi-
ple forms of media, texting also can cultivate and encourage texters
to utilize various modes of communication. For example, instead
of relying only on alphabetic letters, texters can include voice
messages, images, photographs, music, emoticons, web links, and
other types of multimodal elements to make their points. More
importantly, determining which type of modality to use given one's
audience and message is an important rhetorical skill. Texting
enhances this skill, and given the popularity of cell phones, many
students have easy access to platforms that emphasize texting,
which enables them to quickly apply lessons learned about rhet-
oric and communication to their personal, academic, and profes-
sional lives.

    In fact, several researchers have found positive correlations
between texting and people's literacy skills. For example, Kate
Fox finds that texting improves texters' summarizing skills and
their overall ability to write more concisely along with their diplo-
macy skills. A group of researchers at Coventry University discov-
ered that the more pre-teenage children used text abbreviations,
the more likely they were to score higher on reading and vocab-
ulary tests. Conversely, in that same study, students with high-
er-level spelling and writing skills tended to use the most texting
abbreviations. Another researcher at the City University of London
found that texters' spelling or grammar skills were no better or
312 Bad Ideas

worse than that of non-texters', suggesting that texting itself
doesn't specifically affect one's literacy skills. Another group of
Finnish researchers concluded that texting's often informal style
allowed texters to engage in more creative uses of language. Other
researchers found that texting enhances students' ability to write
collaboratively. Another set of researchers argue that texters use
paralinguistics - or additional written or scriptive cues--to clarify
their meaning, thus potentially enhancing communication. Or, as
Clare Wood, a scholar who studies children's literacy development
and who has been at the forefront of texting research for years,
states, "Overall, there is little evidence that ungrammatical texting
behavior is linked to grammatical understanding or knowledge of
orthographic representations of language in children."

     Texting may even be particularly useful for helping people of
various ages specifically improve their writing skills. McWhorter
argues that when people think of language, they usually are
referring to speech, not writing. Because writing and speech are
radically different, the two should be distinguished. However,
McWhorter argues that as writing--a far more recent phenomena
than speech--advanced, some speech emulated writing, but some
writing also emulated speech. That's where texting first emerged.
For McWhorter, texting is a unique hybrid of speech and writing
because it is loose and informal, like speech, although texters still
rely on the "brute mechanics" of writing to communicate through
this type of "fingered speech." McWhorter points to how texting
is changing our conceptions of writing and speech because new
linguistic structures are emerging such as LOL or the use of a
slash ( / ) to denote what linguists call pragmatic particles. These
particles are usually spoken, but with texting, new forms of writ-
ten communication are used to socially negotiate meaning among
texters. Within the context of linguistics and writing studies, this
is an important development.

     New technologies have consistently threatened old ones, so
cries that "texting is killing civilization" are part of a long history
of trashing new media. In fact, even writing was despised by
philosophers such as Plato in ancient Greece. In the 20th century,
when film threatened radio, movies were demonized. When tele-
vision threatened film, according to film historian Virginia Wright
Wexman, the word "television" was forbidden in some studios.
And the same backlash is currently directed toward texting, video
games, social media, and other forms of digital media.
                                         About Writing and Digital Technologies 313

    However, if we consider the National Council of Teachers
of English's definition of 21st-century literacy, we see a notable
emphasis on the role technology plays in literacy. Two specific
goals stand out: In this century, literate citizens should be able to
"develop proficiency and fluency with the tools of technology" and
"create, critique, analyze, and evaluate multimedia texts." A third
goal--"manage, analyze, and synthesize multiple streams of simul-
taneous information"--challenges the notion that texting distracts
us. In the media- and information-saturated worlds we live in,
preventing distractions seems anachronistic; managing them
seems the wiser, more contemporary goal. We should consider
texting as not replacing formal writing, but instead, as a complex
complement to formal writing that allows people to augment their
existing writing skills in fresh, complex ways. Instead of perceiv-
ing texting as a threat to literacy, we should start understanding
texting as an ally. Scholars who study writing and language should
investigate more rigorously texting's many complex dynamics.

    Encouraging students to use texting to communicate with each
other while working on group projects seems logical. Using exam-
ples in class about language usage that relates to texting is relevant
to students' lives. Comparing texting's conventions to those found
in other types of writing is valuable. Asking students to reflect
on their texting behaviors will raise their awareness of texting's
strengths and weaknesses. Cultivating within students the notion
that texting is one useful medium within a spectrum of various
communications media will only help them discern when it's best
to text and when it's not. In a world rife with alternative discourses
and media, embracing the diverse opportunities for communica-
tion marks the best path to literacy.

GAMIFICATION MAKES WRITING
FUN

    Joshua Daniel-Wariya

    Recently, I received an email titled "Gamification: The Next
Frontier in Student Achievement." It asked, "When is a game more
than just a game?" The answer followed: "When it takes a classroom
from completing 30% of their assignments to completing 100%."
This, I suppose, should sound great--if not too good to be true--to
any teacher having difficulty getting students to complete assign-
ments. When I clicked the link for more information, I was taken to
a newsletter about a teacher named Beth who was struggling with
student engagement. By using a particular platform to gamify her
classroom, I read, Beth was able to "turn learning into an adven-
ture" and "spread her enthusiasm" to her students. Within one
year of this gamification experiment, Beth achieved 100% student
completion rates. The newsletter went on to state that Beth "even
led her district's professional development because, well, you can't
ignore that 30% to 100% jump."

    I have no clue if Beth is real, though I do suspect she is the
embodiment of the urban legend of gamification's many promises.
The email allows interested instructors to join Beth's online course
to see for themselves how she achieved her astonishing results.
Instead of units, assignments, and activities, we have quests, levels,
and Easter eggs. Instead of grades, we have experience points and
the ability to level up. Students can even power level by collaborat-
ing with classmates who have already completed major quest lines.
One area of course content provides the following instruction to
students for "Training for Epic Essays": "Many of your most epic
battles on this journey and in the rest of your life will require you
to communicate well. Good communication earns large amounts
of XP and unlocks many achievements. Refer to this folder any
time you need help writing the most epic essay possible."
316 Bad Ideas

     This course rehearses the notion that students view school in
general, and writing in particular, as not being much fun. But by
covering the monotony of writing with the excitement of games,
Beth achieves undeniable results. As philosopher and game
designer Ian Bogost says, "Everyone seems to agree that games
are powerful. And that power is mysterious and wild, like black
magic." Beth's course quantifies that power in the 70% increase
towards perfect student engagement. The underlying theory is that
by making her course look like a game, Beth made it fun.

     But what is actually required to make something fun? What
gives any activity the quality of fun? And why are games univer-
sally recognized as being so good at creating it? Is it because games
use the descriptive terminology of quests and levels, of epic battles,
or because they award experience points and trophies instead of
grades and diplomas? Following Bogost, here I take the position
that gamification rehearses a common, yet misleading, concep-
tion of fun as something like easy pleasure. To have fun means
people feel as though they are not working hard, or even not work-
ing at all, simply because they are escaping the monotony of hard
work to the adventure of a whimsical game. This process is some-
times described metaphorically as chocolate-covered broccoli.
Gamification covers the bitterness of something that is import-
ant, yet undesirable, with the sweetness of something that is not
important, yet desirable.

     This metaphor occludes something deeper about what makes
games fun and how writing might be made so. According to Bogost,
games are fun because they are "experiences we encounter through
play." Here, I want to suggest that a better way forward in making
writing fun is not to make it more like a game, but instead to consider
the specific conditions in which writing allows for and invites play.
While the terms game and play often seem synonymous, they are
not the same. While games can be described as a context of rules,
space, people, materials, and valorized outcomes, play is an activity
or way of moving about that context. Game designers Katie Salen
and Eric Zimmerman describe play as "free movement within a
more rigid structure." This means that any material, medium, or
environment has the capacity for play. People play when they move
their avatars through virtual spaces. People also play when they
move words and phrases around with respect to genre conven-
tions. Games, then, are not unique from writing because they have
play, but because they are conceived as experiences of play and
recognized as such. Writing has the same potential.
                                         About Writing and Digital Technologies 317

    My position is that writing can, and will, be fun when it is
conceived as an experience encountered through play. So what
would it mean to conceive writing as such an experience? First,
play is contextual. This means that play takes place within a
rule-bound network of people, objects, and space. The relation-
ship between play and rule structures can seem counterintuitive
because common sense tends to associate play with unconstrained
freedom, such as children playing freely in a yard with no appar-
ent rules or purpose. Pressed further, however, it becomes clear
that play is meaningful due to its situated-ness within specific
rule-bound contexts. For example, take the act of swinging a bat
at a ball. While people may play in this way nearly anywhere, any
particular swing only becomes meaningful when situated within a
particular context, such as a little league baseball game or a cricket
exhibition. Play--and even fun--does not equate to making writ-
ing easy. In order to truly engage with the play of writing we have
to embrace its difficulty, not gloss over it or cover it up with a gami-
fied lexicon. Gamification masks difficulty, when writers need to
engage it directly.

    Play is also creative and personal. When people play, it often
feels like it is purely for the sake of play. This does not mean that
play has no purpose, but that its purpose in any given moment
might be unpredictable, its context and duration indeterminate,
and its motivation idiosyncratic. I might, for example, for no other
reason I can articulate than because I feel like it, grab a tennis ball
and play with my dog in the backyard until she and I arbitrarily
decide we are finished. While such play might be highly personal
and done for the sake of itself, the paradox of play is that it is
simultaneously creative.

    This means that, even as I play with my dog for reasons I cannot
articulate, I'm connected with the world through the technology of
the ball, the familiar form of the game catch, and how poorly my
dog plays it. Through catch, I am confronted with the paradox of
play as both autotelic--individual and creative--that is inevitable
and inescapable. To conceive writing as an experience encountered
through play, writers must likewise embrace this unresolvable para-
dox. Even when our motivations for writing feel mysterious and
isolating, we must remember that even the tools of our trade--a
pen and notebook, a tablet and blank screen--call attention to our
never aloneness. We simply cannot write without the world around
us, and yet as we write, we create our own little world. To embrace
the paradox buried in that interplay is to make writing fun.
318 Bad Ideas

     So here we have it. Writing can and will be fun when it invites
and makes possible opportunities for play. Because writing situa-
tions provide writers with familiar rules and conventions, writers
have the opportunity to move within and through those forms to
create and strategize. And even though, like play, writing feels to
us so very personal, people paradoxically cannot go about the act
of writing or playing, without being deeply enfolded in the world
around them through their interactions with symbols, technolo-
gies, and objects.

     Certainly, gamification does have its potential upsides. The act
of turning a complex task like writing into something game-like
by breaking it down into simpler parts, organizing it into small
missions and quests, and providing clear pathways for team-
work might help writers set and maintain achievable goals. But
on a deeper level, it misses the opportunity to explore and exploit
the always already fun-making possibilities inherent in writing.
In terms of actual practice, what this realization suggests is that
teachers, students, and writers in general should not expect writ-
ing to come easily, for it to not feel frustrating at times, or for it to
not require hard work. Perhaps ironically, to truly conceive writing
as an experience encountered through play means to take it seri-
ously enough to realize how hard it can be. When we use gamifi-
cation to "add something sweet" to the surface of writing, we miss
all the playful opportunities present just below the surface that
are simply waiting for us to take them seriously enough that they
might unravel and reveal their many possibilities.

being used today, see Brian Burke's Gamification: How Gamification
Motivates People to Do Extraordinary Things (Bibliomotion), as well
as Kevin Wervach and Dan Hunter's For the Win (Wharton Digital
Press). Both provide current examples of the use of gamification in
professional and educational contexts.

     Game designers and scholars of rhetoric and writing have
published several notable works that critique gamification and offer
other ways of using play and games for educational purposes. See,
for instance, Jane McGonigal's Reality is Broken (Penguin), which
discusses the use of games to solve the problems of today's world,
such as hunger and climate change. Ian Bogost's Persuasive Games
(MIT Press) illustrates the ways games mount arguments through

computer processes. And Miguel Sicart's Play Matters (MIT Press)
is an excellent discussion of what play is and why it is important.

    Finally, scholars in writing studies have written a number of
books on the potential of games to help shape the future of writing
studies. See Albert Rouzie's Serio-Ludic Rhetoric (Hampton Press),
an early look at the ways digital writing technologies emphasize and
enable play. Additionally, Richard Colby, Matthew S.S. Johnson,
and Rebekah Shultz-Colby's collection, Rhetoric/Composition/Play
Through Video Games (Palgrave MacMillan) offers essays from a wide
variety of writing studies scholars and gives examples of gamified
classrooms, as well as more theoretical discussions about teaching
with and through videogames.

THE MORE DIGITAL TECHNOLOGY,
THE BETTER

    Genesea M. Carter and Aurora Matzke

     With the increasing dominance that cell phones, tablets,
music devices, apps, FitBits, Xboxes--you get the picture--play in
everyday life, the notion that humans are cyborgs, has emerged.
Technology has become fully integrated and relied upon in every-
day life, whether it's Amazon's Echo turning on hallway lights, or
the iPad blaring on the back seat of the minivan. Without a doubt,
technology makes our lives easier, better, and even more enjoyable:
It can be our secretary, butler, doctor, private tutor, and compan-
ion all in one. And the tech boom isn't just for the home or the
office; it can support student learning, too. Educators, parents, and
tech enthusiasts are eager to strategize how technology might help
support student learning--including the writing classroom.

     Beliefs about technologies have changed the way we think
about and understand the entire enterprise of writing education.
Marc Prensky, the researcher who coined the terms digital native--
to describe those born with unfettered access to technology (born
between 1982-1991)--and digital immigrant--to describe those not
born with this unfettered access to technology (born before 1982)--
tells us that today's students are digital learners, who, because of
the ease and access of technology in their everyday lives, expect,
if not demand, to use technology in the classroom. Prensky, and
the digital education scholars who agree with him, would have us
believe that educators, who primarily tend to be digital immigrants
in his definition, are "struggling to teach a population that speaks
an entirely new language." Yet, is this really the case? Furthermore,
what if emphasizing the technologies that students find familiar
and engaging in the writing classroom actually hinders learning?

     While many young people today may be digital natives, they are
also digitally naïve. Many don't know how to change their Facebook
                                         About Writing and Digital Technologies 321

privacy settings, check their school email accounts, or even how to
adjust the margins in a Word document. Consequently, parents
and writing educators (the digital immigrants) are tasked with
teaching their children and students how to safely and productively
integrate what we would now consider very basic technologies
into their writing processes. So, while integrating cellphone activ-
ities and applications into a course can be quite useful to engage
students, students' ability to understand and use digital devices
and information streams effectively and ethically--what we call
digital literacy--may hinge on less sexy (but much needed) instruc-
tion. We also might need to consider the premise that iPads and
other tablets in writing classes aren't all they're cracked up to be.
Or at the very least, we need to recognize that students are often
missing foundational digital literacy skills desperately needed for
their success beyond the classroom.

    One of the foundational digital literacy skills students need is
concentration. Several studies have shown that children who are
exposed to a lot of technology have rewired brains. They're better
at scanning for information and retrieving information, but they
are less able to concentrate deeply. Students are becoming habit-
uated to change and less able to sustain attention toward a task.
Yes, increased reaction times and visual-spatial abilities are linked
to technology use and media exposure, but being able to turn a
page or write a word really fast is minimally connected to making
one a stronger critical thinker or a more capable reader or writer.
Consequently, when writing educators make recent technologies
and media rich projects ubiquitous to their classrooms--when
they privilege audio essays, vlogs, digital storytelling, and Snapchat
collages--they should recognize that technology in the classroom
is not necessarily making students better writers and thinkers.
Teachers who use technology in the classroom should first "decide
what we want students to do" and then "find the best technol-
ogy to encourage that behavior," explains University of Colorado
Boulder professor Doug Duncan. Educators, administrators, and
policy makers cannot simply throw iPads through the door and
hope for the best.

    When technology isn't mindfully incorporated into the class-
room, it can become a distraction that significantly impacts learn-
ing. In 2015, Anya Kamenetz of National Public Radio reported
on a study about texting and technology use in the classroom that
was conducted by several science and engineering faculty at the
University of Colorado Boulder. The researchers determined that
322 Bad Ideas

on their campus "more than 75 percent of undergrads reported
texting while in class, and that in-class texting was linked to an
average drop of half a letter grade in the course." Additionally,
Princeton researcher Pam A. Mueller and University of California
at Los Angeles researcher Daniel M. Oppenheimer together deter-
mined that classroom cultures that have open-access technology
policies are linked to decreased grades and "shallower processing"
of course content. While the research more expansively takes on
education as a whole, the findings are worth noting. The habits
that are formed in the biology classroom will impact the habits
exhibited in the writing classroom. All students--not just writing
students--need to be taught how to be effective users of a range of
composing technologies. Writing teachers "need to inhabit an ecol-
ogy that supports their efforts over time," say Richard J. Selfe and
Cynthia L. Selfe, writing and technology experts. In order to create
these ecologies, technological initiatives must include funding and
support to ensure that teachers' objectives for integrating technol-
ogy into the classroom are generating the results they hoped for.

     Technology alone isn't a magic bullet. A 2015 study conducted
by independent researchers from the Organization for Economic
Co-operation and Development compared the computer use and
evaluative reports regarding academic gains of children in over
70 different countries. Their findings? There are "`no appreciable
improvements' in reading, mathematics or science in the countries
that had invested heavily in information technology." Furthermore,
initiatives that have focused almost solely on providing technolo-
gies to impoverished areas have not resulted in appreciable gains in
learning. Non-profits like One Laptop Per Child (OLPC) fall short
of the promise. OLPC itself laments that, "The great excitement,
energy, and enthusiasm that brought us together is gone. OLPC is
dead. In its place, is the reality that technology is a force in educa-
tion, and we all need to be vigilant about when, where, and how
it's used." Audrey Watters with Hack Education cited the real issue
at hand in 2012: "That last (missing) piece--training for teach-
ers--has long been something that gets overlooked when it comes
to ed-tech initiatives no matter the location, Peru or the U.S. It is
almost as if we believe we can simply parachute technology into
a classroom and expect everyone to just pick it up, understand it,
use it, hack it, and prosper." Laptops won't help if we continue to
ignore substantive, longitudinal teacher support.

     We agree that technology has the potential to enable neuro-
logically and physically diverse student populations to engage in
                                         About Writing and Digital Technologies 323

learning and writing in new and exciting ways--the importance
and necessity of these developments cannot be overstated. Yet,
for situations when digital technologies are thrown unreflective
into many classrooms, shouldn't we pause, reflect, and demand
evidence of the success of such applications and devices? Of course.
To do otherwise would be foolish.

    So, what is technology's place, then? Good technology use in
the writing classroom happens when teachers figure out what they
want their students to learn first and then determine what tech-
nology might help. There are ongoing professional development
opportunities for teachers regarding media and technology use in
the classroom. Teachers can also balance technology in the class-
room with more traditional hand-to-paper note-taking and writing
activities, erring on the side of less tech and not more tech, unless
they know why they're asking students to use it. Students can use
technology deliberately, to problem solve, collaborate, and engage
with a variety of real-life audiences that remain unavailable with-
out the technology. Finally, and perhaps most importantly: Writing
teachers, educators, and parents don't have to cave to the pressure
that comes with the belief that students are digital natives and,
therefore, need or require technology in the classroom for effective
learning. Let's better think through why technology is being used
and to what ends.

DIGITAL NATIVES AND DIGITAL
IMMIGRANTS

    Phill Michael Alexander

    As a mixed-blood Cherokee, I've always been troubled when
people use Indigenous phrases or images inaccurately to try to
present an argument: from mascots to the overworked use of the
phase pow-wow. I understand the precarious nature of using words
like native. That was why I rolled my eyes the first time I heard the
phrase digital native.

    Conceptually, the idea of the digital native almost makes sense.
The theory is that there is a profound difference between those
born during the most recent age of the personal computer and the
Internet and those born prior to the ubiquitous onslaught of digi-
tal technologies. Those born during this technological boom would
be native to digital and computer technology, and those who were
older would be the digital immigrants, coming to digital technolo-
gies later in their lives. The implication is that the digital native
is familiar with and proficient with technologies that the digital
immigrant is not, and because of this split in digital skill, it will
be difficult for the two to communicate. For context, imagine the
stereotype of the parent or grandparent who needs a child to set
the clock on the microwave or to program the VCR.

    In some small ways, this concept is rooted in reality. The cliché
is out there. A quick search reveals over 1,000 articles with the
phrase "digital native" in the titles, many claiming they will help
the non-native to understand how the digital native thinks and
works, treating those labeled as native as if they are alien to the
norm, or more frightening still, that the digital native has become
the norm and those who are not natives are now an outmoded
minority. An even less nuanced version of this argument is often
invoked as well: "These kids know everything about technology!"
326 Bad Ideas

Such a statement reveals the ultimate folly of the digital native as
a construct: It too easily leads to a sense of conflict or resignation.
What we have to realize is that while it is indeed useful to think
about the differences in the ways that people born in an age of
digital computing and those born prior to these digital technol-
ogies use these tools, to assert that the mere presence of digital
technologies so dramatically changes a skill like writing is simply
misplaced.

     More troubling is the other side of the binary. In 2017, when
there is talk of building a wall on the southern border of the United
States and discussion of mass deportations, "immigrant" is word
that carries the baggage of subjugation, fear, and the questioning of
legal rights. Words matter. To use the dichotomy of native/immi-
grant is dangerous. Such loaded words aren't fodder for avoid-
ing the more nuanced and important conversations about how to
write with the best available means of communication in an era
when the available means are multiple. When the digital native
is conceived to exist in rarified air above the digital immigrant,
problems arise. CNN features declare the world the property of
the digital native, while the digital immigrant becomes a "relic."
Huffington Post declares flatly that the digital native brings an idyllic
"equal level" to all people. The underpinnings of "native" are that
a thing or a place is home for a certain group. This leads to subtle
implications that those who are not digital natives are attempt-
ing to colonize, invade, or co-opt. It also falsely asserts that just
because a person is a certain age that person automatically knows
and possesses certain skills.

     The presence of digital technology has changed the way we
think about writing. There are new tools at our disposal, and those
digital tools are at times quite intimidating to those who learned
to write before computers were an available or viable technology.
There is a significant need to understand the way these technolo-
gies have changed our composing practices, but at the same time,
the computer (or tablet or smartphone) is just another step in the
evolution of a writing process that has always depended on tech-
nologies (paper, pencils, ink, etc.).

     The most common methods of communication are changing,
and that does matter, but it's not due to anything other than people
using the best available means to convey their messages to each
other. They can use pictures and video, but that's because the
means to use Instagram and YouTube and SnapChat exist now. It
doesn't mean that other people cannot, or that technology is the
                                         About Writing and Digital Technologies 327

domain of a specific generation. Indeed, multiple research stud-
ies (such as those from the Pew Research Center) confirm that
the uptake of digital technologies isn't strictly tied to generational
groups--it's tied to socio-economic status, race and ethnicity, and
access to broadband and smartphones. Digital technology is now
accessible in ways it wasn't previously, and those with access and
without pre-existing habits of using a specific format choose what
they judge to be the best mode of writing, while those who do have
pre-existing habits can either be curious about new modes of writ-
ing, or not. We have always written, and we will always write. To
assert that whole generations either own or are alienated from the
technologies used for writing is a needless limiter that attributes
false mastery and fosters a sense of futility. It doesn't represent any
reality on the ground. It's a myth.

    It's easy enough to see how writing with technology works by
looking at specific cases instead of attempting to generalize a native
skillset. Texting, for example, is changing the ways that people
understand communication, as they can now work in a method of
communication that teeters between real-time and archived, not a
phone call but also not an email (or a letter or note). It offers affor-
dances that older methods of personal communication did not. It's
a good thing. But there's the down side, too. Most people are now
confident--falsely--that they can find any information they need
with a Google search, making the gathering of support for argu-
ments sloppy. At the same time, a small percentage of people in
many age ranges don't understand the word Google as a verb and do
not possess the skills to critically analyze websites to know what is
reliable and what is simply material someone else published online
without concern for its validity.

    And more importantly, we can see that age--being "born into"
the digital world--doesn't bring greater proficiency if we simply
look at how young people understand digital security. A person
with an innate knowledge of the digital would understand secured
networks, Facebook permissions, complex passwords to avoid
hacking, and so on. But those same Pew studies noted above show
that 50% of young people don't use privacy settings and that nearly
40% don't understand the differences between secured and non-se-
cured communication. If anything, studies show that young people
think their parents understand security issues better and handle
that for them, a sure fire indicator that their native status in the
digital realm doesn't pass the first threshold of understanding the
gravity of digital environments.
328 Bad Ideas

     The first thing we can do to correct the misuse of digital native/
immigrant language is to recognize that the terminology itself is
troublesome. We can just stop calling younger generations digi-
tal natives and that will resolve part of the problem. We can refer
to them in some other way that recognizes their status as those
who have always lived with technology when that is important to a
discussion, but we can also try to move beyond considering this a
major issue. We could also relegate the divide to history, as those
of us who were among the first who were designated digital natives
are now in our 40s and are, in some senses, now the "old" that was
the original digital immigrant in this equation. It might be time to
stop thinking so hard about differences in experience based on age,
particularly when there's a larger difference based on economics.
And one based on gender. And one based on race. There are differ-
ences that are much more important.

     The harder work is in confronting the misconception itself.
This is best done by simply not treating users differently based on a
generational divide. One of my colleagues, Bob DeSchutter, works
with a group of seniors who regularly play the game Minecraft. They
don't behave differently, in terms of user-experience and knowl-
edge acquisition, than the young players from the local schools
who come to our open Minecraft play sessions. Regardless of age--
something we forget due to the fallacy of the digital native--is that
anyone who hasn't played a video game will need to be oriented to
game play, whether that person is 70 or 7. We have to untangle the
belief in inherent literacy from the anecdotal experience of encoun-
tering more literate people of a specific age range. Much like the
issue of race, it can be difficult to separate people from their reli-
ance on stereotypes and cultural expectations, but that is the only
solution to an issue of misconception. Observing instead of expect-
ing is the answer to combatting the myth of the digital native.

     We have to understand that as technology changes, culture
also changes, and as writers we have to think about how audi-
ences change and how composing practices change across time.
This is a difficult and nuanced, an always changing and complex
practice. We must always think about the words we use to speak
about important concepts. We have to work against the fatalistic
generalization that the young understand technology and the old
do not. Digital is not a place. You are not native to it, nor do you
need to apply for residence on its shores. You're not too old, nor
are you so young that you'll have magic powers that cause you to
innately understand everything digital. But digital technology does
                                         About Writing and Digital Technologies 329

shape how you write and will continue to shape how you write.
You need to watch, and take note, and learn, and follow the writing
wherever it takes you.

BAD IDEAS ABOUT
WRITING TEACHERS
YOU'RE GOING TO NEED THIS FOR
COLLEGE

    Andrew Hollinger

    When I first heard a teacher say, "You're going to need this for
college," I was a high school student. I heard the phrase again when
I began teaching 10th grade English, and I wondered, as a first-year
teacher, whether that was the teacher version of "Because I said
so," or if, more tragically, it was what teachers said in response to
the often asked, "Why do I have to learn this?" when they didn't
really know the answer. The teachers I worked with, however, were
very smart and some of the most student-centered educators I've
ever known, so it's hard for me to fully believe that.

    In fact, according to the National Survey of Student Engagement,
high school teachers and college writing instructors agree about
what skills and concepts are important: things like the writing
process, creating multiple drafts, peer review, practicing certain
genres. However, the survey also shows that the activities of high
school students do not include writing as many drafts, practicing
as many genres, or reviewing as many peers' essays as their teach-
ers agree is important. I don't believe that teachers are intention-
ally giving their students short shrift. Instead, my guess is that
between creating and executing lesson plans, dedicating class time
to benchmark assessments and testing practice, and staying on
top of all the paperwork and levels of management, practice time
slips away. So, when teachers say, "You're going to need this for
college," they might actually be saying, "Pay special attention to
this skill. I know that this will help with your college work, and we
won't be able to spend a lot of time practicing."

    If "You're going to need this for college" is shorthand for "Pay
attention to something important," why should we stop saying it?
334 Bad Ideas

Ignoring the Student

     Teaching doesn't need to be a magic show; there's no reason
not to let students see behind the curtain. Every year, about half my
course load is first-year composition classes, and every year some-
one asks, "Why do I have to take this class?" Often, the student
asking is frustrated that they have to spend money and time on a
general education course whose benefit isn't immediately obvious
to them.

     Dismissing the situation might lead the student to suspect you
don't know the answer or don't care about the student-teacher
relationship. Either way, at that moment, you've lost the student's
respect, interest, and motivation. Students who understand the
mechanics of learning may become better at learning; if we can't
answer "Why do I need this?" or "Why are we doing this?" then
maybe we should reconsider the necessity of that lesson, skill, or
learning objective.

Ignoring the Transition

     As a learning rationale, using the shorthand phrase "You're
going to need this for college" passes on the responsibility of
meaningfulness to the next level of education. This is not to say
that scaffolding skills (creating a sequence of learning/classes
that build on each other--what is otherwise called vertical align-
ment) isn't valuable. It definitely is. Practicing a specific genre
like a research report, for example, doesn't make much sense if
the student hasn't yet learned about structure and organization
and why a writer would want to impose a form on a piece of text.
Passing the buck isn't scaffolding, though. It would be like telling
students that we have to practice writing reports because college
classes require lots of reports--as though the only reason to teach
that genre before a student gets to college is because college teach-
ers don't have time to teach it themselves. For example, while writ-
ing research papers students will often ask, "What does it matter
how or if I cite my sources a specific way? Can't I just include the
link where I found it and be done?" A you're-going-to-need-it-for-
college teacher might respond, "This is just how they want it in
college." Another teacher might, instead, pause and break for a
mini-lesson on citations: why they look the way they do, what each
method of citation values or reveals about the values of the poten-
tial audiences, and how citations have evolved with each style-
book. The second scenario is messier and takes more time, but
                                                             About Writing Teachers 335

the students will better understand the why behind attribution; it
might even make their writing better as they spend time thinking
about the value systems of potential audiences.

    Worse than passing the buck, telling students that they'll need
something for college suggests that it is a school-only skill and
not something that might be important to their future work or
life. So the skills, lessons, and concepts that we teach have time
limits and boundaries. We know that isn't true, but students don't
yet see that. The campus where I work serves a larger-than-nor-
mal non-traditional student community--students who have come
back to school after years in the real world. Almost to a person,
these students are focused. They know what they want to accom-
plish. And almost to a person, they say something like, "I wish I
had paid more attention in high school/the first time I came to
college." Too many people seem to understand that calculus or
chemistry is necessary to being an engineer or pharmacist, but
people often only see writing as a means to an end: the stockholder
annual review brochure that communicates all the cool, real work
the company did that year.

Ignoring Potentials

    Our national obsession with college creates a social rift, a caste
system, between the educational haves and have-nots. Education,
as an institution, is a self-propagating system: We create our own
audience by recommending more and higher courses, certifications,
and credentials, and then we induct the best and brightest back
into the system to further propagate that system. This, in itself, is
not inherently unethical. All systems are interested in developing
self-sustaining processes. What is problematic is to suggest that
anyone not participating in the system is less for doing so.

    For students who do not plan on going to college (for what-
ever reason), hearing "You're going to need this for college" is
permission to stop paying attention because that skill has no larger
context than school now and more school later. What we teach,
however, does have larger implications. Sometimes it is the skill or
concept, and sometimes the reach is about helping students learn
how to learn, and how to enjoy or value their education. Whether
or not a person's formal education includes college, surely we want
our friends, neighbors, and coworkers to actively enrich their own
lives. Creating a knowledge and ability line in the sand at college
is a socially disruptive practice. We undermine our lessons, our
field, our accountability, and our expertise when we tell students,
336 Bad Ideas

"You're going to need this for college." More important, though, is
this: We quietly corroborate the argument that education is only
about economics, that there is no reason to learn other than to
achieve better pay or a nicer title. Those things are nice, to be sure.
But being educated should ultimately be a personal endeavor. We
learn because it's fulfilling, because we are meant to grow.

     If saying, "You're going to need this for college" is how we side-
step admitting that we don't know why we are teaching something,
then we need to think carefully about the assignments we foster
or prevent, the thresholds we set, and the discussions that accom-
plished and emergent teachers have about them. And if saying,
"You're going to need this for college" is a way to truncate the
conversation about why we are doing something in the classroom
and how it will benefit students, we need to give ourselves and our
peers permission to let learning get messy. In fact, it's not that tell-
ing students the learning they are doing now will make more sense
later or have a bigger payoff later (possibly, even, in college) that
is bad. It's ending the conversation there that's wrong, suggesting
that "later" is the pedagogical rationale and learning goal for some
lesson or skill. If we want students to be sophisticated learners--
and we should--whatever their personal and professional goals
might be, then we need to let them see behind the curtain, pick at
the machinery of learning, and let them ask difficult questions. We
need to show them how learning works, and that it can also work
for them.

DUAL-ENROLLMENT WRITING
CLASSES SHOULD ALWAYS BE
PURSUED

    Caroline Wilkinson

     Dual enrollment is a program that allows a high-school student
to take a college course and receive credit for both high school
and college. According to the most comprehensive study on dual
enrollment, in the 2002-2003 academic year, 70% of high schools
allowed students to take college courses. Depending on where
the student lives, many school districts and states also pay for the
student to take the college class. High schools and universities
offer dual enrollment because it addresses the growing national
interest in college readiness. This course would seem to be a bene-
fit to both the high-school students, who can make an early start
on their college careers, and the university that can target potential
applicants for enrollment. However, dual-enrollment programs are
problematic because the cultures of high school and college are so
distinct that a dual-enrollment course cannot provide the institu-
tional context of college (such as the instructor, the classroom, the
campus, fellow students, the technology in use, and so on).

     Unlike a college composition course, a dual-enrollment course
is held at a university campus or at a local high school. A college
instructor or high-school instructor will teach it. The constant is
that high-school students will be involved. When dual-enrollment
courses began to spread in the 1990s, composition scholar David
Schwalm explained that dual enrollment implies that a college
class can be duplicated in a different environment when, in fact,
it cannot because of the disparity between a high-school setting
and a college one. Institutional norms at the secondary level, such
as shorter class times and a higher number of students per class,
                                                             About Writing Teachers 339

impact the pedagogy of a dual-enrollment writing course when it
occurs at the site of the high school.

    College composition courses usually focus on writing as a
process so that a student will go through the actions of drafting
and revising one or more texts throughout the semester. Many
composition courses focus on peer review, where students read
each other's work and give guided feedback to one another, and on
conferences, where the student meets with a professor one-on-one
to go over what the student can most improve. This drafting and
revision process functions well in the college environment, where
class times can be flexible. However, at the high-school level, class
times can typically run 45 minutes with seven periods every single
day. Thus, there is less time for class discussion in dual-enroll-
ment courses. Since the class meets more during the week than a
college class would, the amount of reading or homework required
changes because of the institutional environment. In a dual-enroll-
ment course, it is nearly impossible to conference with students
one-on-one because the instructor has to be in the classroom at all
times to watch over all the students. The instructor cannot cancel
class so that conferences can occur; therefore, the way that writing
is taught is different because of the context of the classroom.

    If the main issues with dual enrollment are institutional, then
it would make sense to offer dual-enrollment writing courses at
the sponsoring university instead of the high school. This would
negate some of the problems with timing and number of students
that impact pedagogy. What the change in environment would not
account for is the maturity of the students in the class. Composition
scholars Kara Taczak and William H. Thelin studied the impact
of adding high-school students to a mixed composition course on
campus with college students. Although most of these dual-enroll-
ment high-school students performed well academically, they were
also considered a distraction to the instructor and college students.
The high-school students' familiarity with each other meant they
behaved in ways that potentially disrupted the norms of a first-year
college classroom that would otherwise be filled with students
who do not know each other. Although the institution of instruc-
tion had changed to an on-campus classroom, the culture of high
school continued.

    There will be cultural issues in dual-enrollment courses
because of the varied factors unique to these kinds of courses
that impact the teaching of writing. In order to save money, most
340 Bad Ideas

universities and high schools enter a partnership in a dual-enroll-
ment program so that a high-school instructor teaches the course.
Efforts at collaborative partnerships between high schools and
colleges frequently leave the dual-credit writing instructor in a
precarious space because this instructor will represent the college
curriculum and culture to high-school students. This high-school
instructor will need to be trained effectively by the sponsoring
university. Ideally, this training will ensure that the instructor
understands and possesses a specific curriculum to teach, is well
versed in the objectives of the specific composition course, and
employs the composition assessment policy of the university. If
the university fails to provide the instructor with this training, the
course will then fail the students because it will not represent the
same culture of writing as a course taught on campus.

     Additionally, high-school instructors may not have any expe-
rience in teaching college-level writing courses; most have expe-
rience only in teaching literature, creative writing, and speech or
journalism courses. This lack of experience teaching at the univer-
sity level--compounded by a lack of training from the university--
could result in conflicting information being relayed to students
about what college-level writing means. To complicate matters
even more, students who earn dual enrollment writing credit will
typically not need to take the first introductory writing course at
a college; as a result, they will remain unfamiliar with the writing
expectations of that college until later courses.

Alternatives in Dual-Enrollment Writing Courses

     If dual-enrollment programs are here to stay, as indicated by
the number of students that participate in them, then there can be
more effective ways to prepare students for writing at the college
level. There are already collaborative relationships between high
schools and colleges throughout the United States in the form
of the National Writing Project (NWP). The NWP offers profes-
sional development for educators in writing for local schools,
districts, and higher education. Faculty from universities and K-12
schools co-direct sites in their local area. This collaboration has
been successful in that there are nearly 200 sites in all 50 states.
One way to make dual-enrollment programs more effective is for
colleges to create better collaborative relationships with local high
schools building on the sites of the NWP.

     Colleges and high schools need to be in closer conversation with
                                                             About Writing Teachers 341

one another about the purposes and curriculum of the dual-enroll-
ment courses. They can do so by the college sharing its composi-
tion objectives, curriculum, sample syllabi, sample schedules, and
sample assignments with the schools. The National Alliance of
Concurrent Enrollment Partnerships (NACEP) serves as a national
accrediting body for dual-enrollment partnerships. NACEP works
to make sure that the dual-enrollment courses are just as rigorous
as the on-campus college courses by applying measurable criteria
in five categories: curriculum, faculty, students, assessment, and
program evaluation. Currently, NACEP has accredited 98 dual-en-
rollment programs according to these standards. Dual-enrollment
programs that want to be more effective can concentrate on the
following standards recommended by NACEP:

      · Courses reflect the theoretical and pedagogical orientation
         of the sponsoring department at the university.

      · University faculty members perform classroom observa-
         tions to demonstrate validity of the class.

      · High-school instructors meet the standards required of
         teaching a course at the college.

      · Professional development activities occur that offer both
         the college and high school a way to have conversations on
         what writing means and how it functions in a dual-enroll-
         ment class.

These standards provide college and high-school instructors with
strategies that will not only help them to address the institutional
and cultural issues of dual enrollment, but also instruct them
how to work within this setting to create a beneficial learning
environment.

    In order to make these partnerships effective, there should
be one contact at the university, such as the Writing Program
Administrator, that high-school instructors can come to with ques-
tions about materials and institutional knowledge of composition.
This same contact would also observe the instructors who teach
dual-enrollment at the high-school level and provide feedback
on the classroom. These liaisons could also provide high-school
instructors with representative assignments for college-level writ-
ing courses so that high-school instructors do not end up teaching
a literature course as a composition course.

    Colleges could provide a more collaborative relationship with
a high school through program work in the dual-enrollment writ-
ing program. Respect for where students are coming from in their
writing is central to composition. There should also be respect for
342 Bad Ideas

other levels of educators by college instructors. One way to create
a partnership between a college and high school is to provide fund-
ing for high-school instructors to participate. Christine Farris has
started a program at Indiana University, where she offers 35-hour
seminars in the summer that introduce high-school teachers to
current methods in college composition and ways to teach the
composition course in a manner that is consistent with the univer-
sity approach. The high-school teachers are also funded for the
summer seminar and participate in the fall and spring colloquia
and classroom site visits. This set of support mechanisms estab-
lishes a clearer idea of what is expected of college writing in the
dual-enrollment course and ensures high-school instructors have
a relationship with the college writing program. Dual-enrollment
programs are seen as ways to make money by many universities
because students or high schools have to pay a discounted tuition
in order to take them. It seems only fair that the university should
pay for the professionalization of the high-school instructors who
are teaching this course.

     Although the contexts of high schools and colleges will be
different no matter what, dual-enrollment instructors can also
reflect on ways to prepare students more in class, such as having
group conferences so students have the experience of discussing
their revision plans, and taking a field trip to the university campus
so students can see where the library and writing center are. These
experiences provide another way to show students they are in a
college class that differs from high school. Drawing upon the rela-
tionships formed in the NWP, following guidelines under NACEP,
mandating one person as the contact for dual enrollment in the
department at the university, and providing professionalization
benefits for dual-enrollment instructors will create more effective
dual-enrollment writing programs.

SECONDARY-SCHOOL ENGLISH
TEACHERS SHOULD ONLY BE
TAUGHT LITERATURE

    Elizabethada A. Wright

     In a 2015 Inside Higher Education blog post, author and teacher
John Warner recounts the frequent complaints heard across the
university about students' inabilities to write well. Warner's blog
illustrates why first-year college writing classes cannot fully remedy
these complaints. Offering suggestions to counter bad writing prac-
tices, Warner's article is one worth reading. Most first-year univer-
sity teachers of writing are guilty of issuing similar complaints
about incoming students' writing abilities, often asking, "What
is happening in high-school English classes?" College instruc-
tors lament students' infatuation with the five-paragraph essay,
the idea that grammatical correctness equals good writing, or
personal statements that assert opinions without support. While
university writing instructors bemoan what is happening in high-
school English classes, they would be better off looking at what
is happening in secondary English education classes--the classes
that prepare high-school English teachers for their difficult tasks
in the classroom. These classes teach very little about writing. As
Robert Tremmel wrote in 2001, the training of high-school English
teachers does not exclude lessons in writing, but it certainly mini-
mizes such lessons.

     A perusal of the requirements for secondary English educa-
tion programs across the country illustrates that while some such
programs do focus on instructing students how to teach writing, a
majority marginalize writing in favor of instruction on the teach-
ing of literature. However, a significant part of high-school educa-
tion focuses on writing (or should focus on writing). Those high
schools that have not decided writing is essential find problems
                                                             About Writing Teachers 345

meeting Common Core standards or, far more importantly, find
their graduates are ill-prepared for college or the demands of a
professional work position.

    There are plenty of secondary English programs at universi-
ties around the United States that focus heavily on the teaching
of literature instead of or to the detriment of writing. For exam-
ple, in the State University of New York system, SUNY Fredonia's
secondary English education training program makes its graduate
English education students take three of four core courses in liter-
ature. Students there must choose an additional 27 credit hours,
and the only choice not in literature is a course that emphasizes
not writing but grammar. Students only take one course in writing
pedagogy. And SUNY Fredonia is not an anomaly: I could list many
colleges that almost exclusively offer classes in literature, requiring
only one or two writing classes beyond first-year composition. It is
a huge problem that our focus on the discipline of English in this
country almost entirely circles around the study of literature, and
while literature is certainly worthy of study (I am happy to note
both my B.A. and M.A. are in English literature), it should not
subsume or replace the study of writing and rhetoric.

    Although the term rhetoric has pejorative popular connotations
in American culture, people who understand rhetoric (as Patricia
Roberts-Miller explains in the opening chapter to this collection)
know that a grasp of rhetoric and the ability to analyze the rhetor-
ical choices made by a writer are essential to good writing. While
literature classes do require students to write papers, the purpose
of these papers is to analyze a literary text and reveal a nuanced
literary understanding of that text. However, rhetoric classes focus
on persuading audiences. These classes teach students how to
make writing choices appropriate for specific audiences and situ-
ations; in other words, they teach students how to consider who
might read their texts and what this audience's relationship might
be both to the writer and the writer's purpose. Writing rhetorically
then is not just creating sentences and paragraphs that are gram-
matically correct; writing rhetorically involves understanding how
an audience feels about the situation that the writer is focusing on,
how the audience feels about the writer, and making sound choices
with this understanding. Teaching such writing involves teaching
strategies that will move the audience to accept an idea they might
otherwise reject. Teaching writing through rhetoric also involves
instructing students how to analyze other people's rhetorical texts
to see what strategies were used to persuade their audiences. Such
346 Bad Ideas

rhetorical analyses can help writers find strategies that they, them-
selves, might use.

     Recognizing the importance of rhetoric is not a new trend.
Students have been studying rhetoric far longer than they have
been studying literature. Aristotle wrote an important treatise for
his contemporaries on rhetoric. The earliest American universities,
such as Harvard, Yale, and Princeton, offered years of study in rhet-
oric. On the other hand, academic study of literature only started a
little more than one hundred years ago; prior to that, the study of
English meant the study of subjects in the English language (rather
than in Latin, Greek, or French). Only in the early 20th century did
the study of English come to mean a focus on literature, and with
this focus, the study of writing diminished significantly. In recent
decades, many scholars have written about this shift from the study
of rhetoric to the study of literature. A common understanding is
that as the study of rhetoric shifted from the study of oratory to
the study of writing (because of changes in technology), it became
far more onerous to teach rhetoric. As one of these scholars, James
Berlin, has observed, critiquing a number of orations is one thing,
reading up to 3,000 essays a year is another. The study of literature,
on the other hand, has not been as onerous--and far more presti-
gious, because of its freedom from the grading of so many papers.
Writing is a component of literature classes, but there tends to be
far less of it and far less study of how to write effectively.

     While some people might not think it really matters whether
secondary English education focuses on literature or writing, the
current concerns and complaints about students' writing abil-
ities reveals that it does matter. Without understanding how to
approach a rhetorical situation--a situation where a writer wants
to address an audience who has its own ideas about the situa-
tion--a writer cannot understand how to make writing effective. If
teachers themselves do not know about the importance of under-
standing rhetorical situations as a part of writing, students will be
less likely to become effective writers.

     Increasingly, however, high-school teachers recognize the
importance of rhetoric in the teaching of writing. As a group of rhet-
oric scholars observed at a national conference on high school and
college writing, high-school teachers work very hard to teach writ-
ing well. However, because of their educational background, they
end up focusing on grammatical correctness or personal writing.
The teachers recognized the importance of rhetoric and have been
introducing rhetorical concepts into their classrooms; however,
                                                             About Writing Teachers 347

without a thorough understanding of rhetoric, the concepts remain
formulaic, such as the writing of five-paragraph essays.

     My work with the College Board's Advanced Placement (AP)
English Language program also illustrates how the secondary
English education curriculum's lack of writing instruction hinders
both high-school teachers and students. This program offers a
college-level writing class to high-school students, as well as work-
shops and other training to help high-school teachers get ready to
teach a college level course, although this training is not manda-
tory. The program offers an annual exam to any students who pay
to take it, whether or not they have been in the AP class. The exam
tests students' abilities in reading comprehension and writing.

    The typical essay on the AP Central website suggests both the
student and the teacher are doing their best with what they know;
the teacher is teaching what she has been trained to know from
the few writing and many literature courses required in second-
ary English education teacher training. Typical responses to an AP
essay question that asks students to analyze the rhetoric of a writer
or speaker illustrate that students can do much well. For the most
part, students understand that they need a central claim, and they
need to support this claim. However, in their analyses, too many
students focus solely on elements of style, such as tone, diction,
or tropes and figures--aspects common to literary analyses, not
rhetorical analyses--suggesting that high-school teachers rely on
their education in literature to teach rhetorical strategies. While
elements of style certainly can be fodder for excellent rhetorical
analysis, without a fuller understanding of rhetoric, a student
cannot analyze and connect the writer's stylistic choices with
the writer's situation. In other words, the student essays do not
connect the writer's or speaker's use of the stylistic devices to the
rhetorical situation: the writer's purpose, audience, and context for
the text. Teacher training in English and its emphasis on literature
does not indicate that either teachers or students know that rheto-
ric is more than having a thesis and using a style.

      There are other examples of secondary English education
teacher training having a focus on literature to the detriment of
rhetorically based writing instruction. These examples can be
found in websites full of programmatic responses by English teach-
ers who want students to write well for the AP English Language
and Composition Exam. The instructions on such websites provide
formulaic methods, including fill-in-the-blank sentence structures,
that do not help students actually analyze a sample text to comment
348 Bad Ideas

on the relationship between the writer, purpose, and audience, or
why the writer made particular choices in the text.

     Hepzibah Roskelly, writing for the AP Program, suggests
that the way to understand the relationships between writer or
speaker, audience and context or purpose cannot be reduced to a
simple formula or dictum; there are too many variables. However,
because high-school teachers do not have the background in rhet-
oric necessary to teach writing well, they too often rely on formula
and dictum. Such reliance does a disservice to students. It is part
of what creates the negative commentary about students' writing
abilities. However, it is not the fault of the high-school English
teachers who teach it. It is a systemic problem created by our focus
on English literature at the near exclusion of rhetoric and writ-
ing. While this system may have helped decades of college profes-
sors focus on literature to avoid reading the thousands of papers
created by students, it clearly is not benefiting students or high-
school teachers.

     This problem, however, is not unique to high-school teachers
of writing. It is similarly a problem for first-year writing classes, a
majority of which are taught by graduate students in literature or
non-tenure-line faculty with degrees in literature, not writing. My
attempt in pointing this out is not to condemn these poorly paid
instructors but to focus on the system that encourages literature
at the expense of writing. If we are going to be serious about writ-
ing instruction in this country, we need to realize that the study of
literature does not prepare a person to teach writing--and students
of all disciplines need to know how to write.

     The teaching of writing is difficult. As someone who has been
teaching writing for almost thirty years, I still struggle in classes.
However, I have millennia of tradition to rely on. I know the many
elements that must be considered in writing. I know how to lead
students through an investigation of writing's context, of under-
standing the rhetorical situation. A quick tutorial in rhetoric
cannot compensate for the lack in our secondary English educa-
tion system. While a few prescient teacher-training programs do
focus on rhetoric, these few are not enough. Literature is not rhet-
oric. Nor is grammar instruction. As a matter of fact, grammatical
correctness is a rhetorical strategy, as is grammatical incorrectness.
What works for a writer entirely depends on the situation: a writ-
er's purpose, context, and audience. The educational system needs
to recognize the importance of rhetoric and put the time into train-
ing all English teachers how to teach writing. Literature is still
                                                             About Writing Teachers 349

important as it teaches us about ourselves and our world, but liter-
ature ain't writing--and writing and rhetoric are essential for our
students, and for the high-school teachers who teach English.

FACE-TO-FACE COURSES ARE

    Academia has seen a shift to online education, with many
courses being taught from a distance to accommodate students
who cannot attend traditional face-to-face (f2f) classes on campus
for various reasons, including familial obligations or work sched-
ules. To accommodate these students, the environment in which
classes are taught has changed to include correspondence courses
taught via mail and television-broadcast lectures, to courses taught
solely in a digital platform with students communicating remotely
through asynchronous (i.e., discussion boards) and synchronous
(i.e., video conferencing) methods. The method of ease associated
with online education makes access possible for students from the
comfort of home without actually setting foot in a classroom. But
make no mistake: The easiness comes from convenience of access,
not necessarily from the coursework itself. Online classes can be
just as--if not more--rigorous, educational, and pedagogically
sound than f2f classes, with the scholarship surrounding distance
education reporting no significant difference between learning in
online classes versus classes taught in f2f environments. However,
there remains a common misconception among instructors and
students alike that the online class will be less challenging or rigor-
ous than its f2f counterpart. From students to the general public--
and even among college instructors--most people continue to
think that traditional classes held in a brick-and-mortar classroom
are, simply put, better than online classes.

    In fact, a survey of online education conducted by the Babson
Research Group reported that many instructors question the value
of online education's worth. Words like validity and legitimacy often
arise when instructors discuss the merits of online education, and
352 Bad Ideas

when it comes to writing, they ask how and if students can learn
to craft their writing without forming a community of peers or
when f2f interaction with the professor is missing. This skepticism
from the faculty trickles down to the students and even filters into
societal thinking at large, with a 2013 Gallup poll suggesting that
Americans remain "tepid at best" when rating their experiences or
opinions of online classes and programs. Even businesses tend to
prefer graduates with degrees earned in f2f programs over those
who received solely online degrees.

     How did this myth associated with online education take
shape? In the past, some universities and the best faculty members
within refused to teach online for various reasons, including the
inability to see the student benefit from online education. When
powerhouse universities such as Arizona State University led the
charge in expanding education opportunities for those students
who would not normally have access, critics thought the gain was
only monetary, benefiting the university and not the students them-
selves. Many universities have joined the ranks of ASU, scrambling
to keep the pace in order to secure their share of distance students.
In addition, administrators may push departments to offer online
classes because they do not require a physical space, thus costing
less money to facilitate. Other concerns include the higher rate of
withdrawals from online students and the tendency for students
with a lower GPA to perform at an even lower level in the online
environment. Perhaps one area of cynicism surrounds the increase
of Massive Open Online Courses, or MOOCs, with thousands of
students taking a course simultaneously. Some may wonder just
how an instructor can interact with hundreds of students one at
a time, and in terms of a writing course, how she can respond
to thousands of pages of writing in one semester; however, these
open classes are markedly different than the average writing course
that strives to maintain low numbers and one-on-one interaction
with students.

     Certainly there are monetary benefits to universities adding
online courses, and all students may not succeed in the online
space; however, these factors are not necessarily synonymous with
a diminished education. Within writing courses, students' partic-
ipation and writing practice improves when classes are shifted
online. Additionally, the online classroom opens up a space for
diversity, with more students being willing to share opinions in
the safe space of an online classroom. For writing classes, the
majority of the interactions among peers and between peers and
                                                             About Writing Teachers 353

the instructor is communicated in written form, suggesting that
students have the opportunity to practice writing more than if they
were taking an f2f class. In terms of simple word count, online
students write a lot more than f2f students. Scholars also suggest
that students think more critically about the discussion prompts
they respond to because they are not required to think on the spot;
instead, they can carefully craft their posts and even revise and edit
afterward. Thus, numerous elements of the course encourage writ-
ing and thoughtful peer-to-peer and peer-to-teacher interaction.
Those interactions are different than f2f but certainly not inferior.

    While online education continues to grow at a rapid rate, the
pedagogy within remains cutting-edge, comparable to f2f classes.
For instance, societal changes and technological improvements
have prompted writing instructors to encourage students to create
multimodal texts, or texts that use more than one mode to commu-
nicate. These multimodal texts could be videos, podcasts, or
websites, just to name a few. Instructors often encourage students
to create these types of texts because students are interacting
with similar media on a daily basis in their extracurricular lives;
therefore, it seems natural to ask them to not only analyze these
documents for rhetorical effectiveness, but to also create similar
documents, in an effort to promote new literacies and effective
communication skills necessary for the 21st century. Teachers of
online classes have adapted their practices to include this type of
curriculum. For instance, in any specific unit that corresponds to a
writing prompt, an instructor may offer different media to analyze,
including podcasts, videos, and written text, encouraging discus-
sion among peers of the rhetorical effectiveness of such media. Not
only do students have the ability to return to this media at any
point in the online course, but they can also reread the archived
discussion posts for further clarification of concepts. Successful
practices of multimodal composition only solidify that writing, in
its various forms, can be taught just as well, if not better, than in
an f2f format.

    The online classroom itself can also be a democratic space:
The digital platform can further encourage inquiry and interaction,
as ideas are constructed as a community, with community being
society at large, not just peers in the class. When an instructor
asks students to find artifacts, research, and other items of inter-
est in pop or other cultures, those artifacts become representa-
tive of communities outside the classroom setting, thus widen-
ing the learning sphere. Students move from being merely passive
354 Bad Ideas

consumers of media, including books, videos, advertisements, and
so on, to becoming collaborators in knowledge-making who think
critically about the plethora of media they come in contact with
both in and outside the class. While this critical thinking can also
be possible in f2f and blended (part f2f, part online) classes, it is
perhaps not encouraged or acquired as seamlessly as in a solely
online environment where students have access to such media
at their fingertips, both in the classroom curriculum and on the
Internet.

     However, even with these advantages and enhancements that
the online classroom promotes, an online course is only as effec-
tive as the instructor and the way she has designed the course.
Instructor ambition and attention may cause student interest and
motivation to wane. If an instructor isn't active in the course, the
students may put in little effort as well. Online writing courses can
be successful at promoting writing skills, but only if the instruc-
tor re-envisions her pedagogical practices. For instance, instruc-
tors must create assignments that promote students taking control
of their learning, challenging them to share ideas and collaborate
with one another through the digital technology available in online
courses. Indeed, we would argue that f2f writing instructors can
learn from online pedagogy. As the world becomes increasingly
influenced by digital technology, f2f instructors can learn a lot
about enhancing their traditional classes with digital, multimodal
enhancements and online writing tools.

     Instead of using f2f classes as the barometer to measure online
writing instruction, the time has come for instructors, adminis-
trators, students, and others interested in the quality of education
offered in our universities to start recognizing that both f2f and
online writing classes can provide challenging, intellectually stim-
ulating educational experiences for students. Instead of viewing
online and f2f courses in opposition to each other, we need to view
them as parallel means of educating students. One fear may be
that online classes will replace traditional f2f courses; however, as
distance education continues to grow, universities remain commit-
ted to offering online classes in addition to f2f courses to accommo-
date both students who need access to remote courses and those
who need the local constraints of a f2f classroom. Online and f2f
classes are two paths available to students on their educational
journeys, and both can lead students to the same destinations.

ANYONE CAN TEACH AN ONLINE
WRITING COURSE

    Beth L. Hewett

     Online writing instruction (OWI) is an offshoot of traditional
writing instruction that occurs in classroom settings. Students prior
to the 1990s learned to write with a teacher in the physical class-
room; they composed their research papers and other essays in the
on-site setting, too. The use of computers and learning manage-
ment systems (the software that contains the course) for teaching
writing was somewhat experimental in the 1980s; however, it is
more common now, and more people are learning to write for their
courses online. Twenty-first-century writing instruction--which
occurs both in writing-specific courses and in other disciplines
where students write to demonstrate understanding of course
material--is increasingly offered online. Writing instruction can be
engaged in fully online settings, where teachers and students meet
solely online and at a distance using either the asynchronous (occur-
ring in non-real time and with a time lag between interactions)
or synchronous (occurring in real time and simultaneously) modali-
ties. In these cases, all of the teaching and learning occur without
any in-person, face-to-face interactions. Writing instruction also can
be engaged in hybrid settings, where teachers and students some-
times meet in person and other times interact via computer. When
an unprepared teacher--or just anyone--is assigned to teach writ-
ing-intensive courses online, problems abound. Teaching writing
online--in any subject, including a writing course itself--requires
extensive disciplinary knowledge, frequent online interaction with
students, and professional skills beyond those that are needed in
traditional, on-site classroom settings.

     The increasing popularity of OWI is partially due to educators
recognizing a global need for distributed education that digital
                                                             About Writing Teachers 357

technologies fill. It is also due to decreasing education budgets,
where fewer teachers are being asked to teach more students with-
out adding to the on-site institution's infrastructure. And, it can
be connected to a jump-on-the-bandwagon approach in that, "If
other institutions are offering online instruction, we should, too."
Finally, the popularity of OWI is influenced by students who want
to take courses online for convenience or necessity.

    Unfortunately, a top-down, administratively driven require-
ment for online writing-intensive instruction reveals an implicit,
pervasive belief that to teach writing online is intuitive and there-
fore simple to do. This belief results in pre-service online training
limited to the learning management system and how to complete
such tasks as providing content to students, collecting assign-
ments, offering exams, and posting grades. For example, writ-
ing itself is a discipline with its own content and skills. However,
professional development for OWI rarely addresses it as a disci-
pline, subject, or skill. In an online history course, teachers need
to be able to teach and write about history sufficiently well that
students learn the appropriate content. Asking students to write
papers, respond to short-answer prompts, and conduct content-
rich online discussions is a primary way to ensure some level of
content mastery. Therefore, history teachers (as well as chemistry,
sociology, mathematics, psychology, and any content-rich course
instructors) need to learn how to help students read and write
well in online settings. They also need to be able to read students'
sometimes weak writing well enough to understand their mean-
ing and to write well enough to communicate clearly with their
students. This essential literacy work is their job as much as it is
the job of English instructors.

    In a recent survey about OWI training at the college level, writ-
ing instructors expressed that they may receive online teacher
training more appropriate to other disciplines, such as how to quiz
for content knowledge through multiple choice and other tests.
And, although training in generalized online course design is often
provided to new online faculty, workshops regarding how to teach
writing online are rare. This lack of discipline-specific and writ-
ing-focused online training and professional development suggests
that administrators may have an idealized belief that instructors
are innately able to migrate writing instruction from the traditional
on-site to the online setting. Such reasoning implicitly suggests
that anyone can teach online writing-intensive courses. To teach writing
online (especially asynchronously), people often think that teachers
358 Bad Ideas

just need to frontload the content into the learning management
system, grade the papers, and check the discussion boards for
whether students are participating. This reasoning has the unfor-
tunate result of placing unprepared teachers in online writing-fo-
cused courses.

     Administrators may wrongly believe there is little work for
writing teachers to do, leading them to dismiss the heavy liter-
acy load of such courses. In fact, online teachers--especially those
who teach writing online--both read and write a great deal, in part
because teachers must write to students what they would normally
say orally in class. There is an intensive reading and writing cycle of
teachers writing instructions, reading papers, providing feedback
primarily through writing, and reading and responding to writ-
ten discussions. Any of these options require teachers to be espe-
cially conversant with writing instruction, to be explicit and clear
writers, and to be able to see what is occurring in student writing
without the opportunity to conference in person. Therefore, when
administrators do not recognize this heavy literacy load, they may
increase course sizes, wrongly thinking that since teachers are not
physically meeting students, they don't have much to do and they
can teach more students. Such ideas about teaching writing online
are both widespread and wrong, and they impede student success
just when more people are taking online courses that require them
to write.

     On the contrary, educators need extensive OWI-focused train-
ing. Effective online writing teachers need three types of skills:
They must be able to (1) teach writing, (2) specifically in a digital
environment, and (3) primarily through written communication.

     The first critical skill set is especially important to all teach-
ers who address literacy. Students learn to write by having oppor-
tunities to read, think, write, reflect, receive feedback, and write
again. Someone who teaches writing in any discipline should be a
good writing teacher with abundant knowledge and what might be
called a full toolbox of literacy skills and abilities. Unfortunately,
all too often, writing instruction is viewed as a lower-level skill
set designated to writing teachers alone or a subject most suited
to inexperienced graduate students and underpaid, often under-
trained part-time faculty. Furthermore, teachers of disciplines other
than writing often are not aware of or refuse to believe that their
job is also to teach and reinforce reading and writing literacies.
Among the knowledge all teachers need are basic theories of read-
ing and writing, such as how to teach students to annotate their
                                                             About Writing Teachers 359

books and to summarize important concepts. All teachers should
know how to assign papers with identified steps (called scaffold-
ing) like writing a proposal and a series of increasingly stronger
drafts. Teachers should know how to create writing assignments
that require students to learn the desired material efficiently, how
to provide useful feedback to help students improve their writing,
and when to address higher-level concerns like content and organi-
zation versus when to address lower-level concerns like style and
grammar. Furthermore, teachers need to develop content, instruc-
tions, and assignments that make sense for their writing outcomes.
This core literacy knowledge and these skills are ones that train-
ing can offer and reinforce, helping instructors to teach writing in
any content area more successfully. Without them, teachers cannot
move to an online setting successfully.

    The second critical skill set requires that teachers be able to
teach reading and writing in an online setting. The basics of teach-
ing these skills online begin with an understanding of the learning
management system the school uses (there are a variety of such
applications, including Canvas, Blackboard, and eLogic). All of
these systems have course spaces for providing announcements,
posting assignments, prompting discussions, enabling group work,
and returning completed assignments and papers--all of which
would be handled orally and with handouts in an on-site class-
room. To know the learning management system also means to
think differently--less linearly and more three-dimensionally--to
connect and scaffold discrete actions into a series of intuitive, inte-
grated interactions. Beyond thinking they can just migrate their
teaching from the traditional classroom setting to the online one,
teachers must learn when, why, and how their communication
should be addressed individually to one student or through the
larger class or small peer group. Using digital applications requires
learning their functionality for learning success. Equally import-
ant, online teachers must understand both the legal and moral
requirements of equal access as required by the Americans with
Disabilities Act. They must be able to understand how to use digi-
tal tools to enhance learning for students with physical disabili-
ties, emotional challenges, learning differences, multilingual abil-
ities, and varied socioeconomic backgrounds. These are learned,
not inherent, digital teaching skills.

    The third critical skill set requires that teachers use text, or
writing itself, as the primary means of communication in the online
environment. Although online teachers can offer video and audio
360 Bad Ideas

recordings and they can phone the student, their work typically
occurs through their own writing; similarly, students learn through
their own abilities to read and write. There is, therefore, a heavy
literacy load for both, which means that the teaching and learning
are reading- and writing-intensive and primarily without benefit
of voice, facial expressions, and body language. Online writing-in-
tensive courses therefore force students to read content, instruc-
tions, peer writing and comments, and teacher feedback; in other
words, they get to read a lot. Online writing courses also enable
students to write much more than in traditional on-site courses.
They write their essays, respond to discussions in writing rather
than through talking, write comments about each other's essays,
and write to teachers and peers to communicate. Similarly, their
instructors teach primarily through writing and mostly in response
to student writing. Whereas in a traditional face-to-face setting,
the writing teacher certainly must know the qualities of good writ-
ing, there are more opportunities for talking with students and
determining together where there are problems and what writ-
ers need to strengthen. In an online writing course, however, such
opportunities for individual, oral conferences are fewer--some-
times nonexistent--and teachers' written feedback and instruc-
tion must correctly and clearly convey all of that crucial informa-
tion. Furthermore, teachers must write especially comprehensible
assignments and instructions, use vocabulary about writing that
students can understand, write about the most important elements
that will take the students to the next proficiency level in subse-
quent drafts, and do all this work using written language that
conveys the teaching intention clearly. Even experienced teachers
need professional development in how to write for students who
may read at suboptimal levels.

     Because teaching students to write about their subject matter
online is more complex than merely taking a traditional course
and migrating it to the learning management system, teachers and
their supervisors benefit by actively learning from skilled OWI
teachers. Both initial training and ongoing professional devel-
opment opportunities help them grow as online educators and
increase their chances of retaining students who are improving
their skills. Students can have good experiences in online writ-
ing-intensive settings, and they can improve their knowledge and
writing abilities in online courses. As long as their teachers--of
all disciplines--receive appropriate training, professional develop-
ment opportunities, and instructive assessment that help them to
                                                             About Writing Teachers 361

improve their online teaching skills, students will receive useful
writing-intensive instruction.

ANYONE CAN TEACH WRITING

    Seth Kahn

    Every time I hear somebody complain about the poor writ-
ing ability of today's college graduates and students, I can't help
but wonder what people would think if they knew more about the
circumstances of many college writing instructors, who go by the
titles adjunct, contingent, term, or non-tenure-track faculty (I'll use the
word adjunct to stand in for all of those possibilities). In 2013, the
Coalition on the Academic Workforce found that adjunct faculty
members were teaching more than 70% of general education writ-
ing courses (first-year composition, or ENG 101, so to speak)
in the United States, reinforcing results from the Association of
Departments of English in 2007.

Who is Anybody?
    Unlike the stereotype of a college professor--a giant office

stuffed with books, an antique desk, expensive shabby chic clothes,
you know the image--adjunct faculty often face difficult work-
ing conditions that, I believe, rest on the myth that anybody can
teach writing. As of 2015, the current average salary for adjuncts
in English is $2,700 per section teaching 10 courses per year
(which is a huge work load) would gross only $27,000 total.
Yet, many campuses won't offer full-time work (usually 8 to 10
courses a year) as a result of the Affordable Care Act's require-
ment that employers provide health insurance to anybody work-
ing more than thirty hours per week. Because the pay is so low,
it's not unusual for adjuncts to become "freeway fliers" (teaching
courses on multiple campuses) in order to cobble together enough
money to live. Most adjuncts get no insurance or retirement bene-
fits. Adjunct teaching loads can also change semester by semester
(so that somebody might have two courses, then four, then one,
364 Bad Ideas

then three, etc.). Often, adjuncts don't know their schedules until
a semester is about to begin, when it's too late to find replacement
work anywhere else, it's too late to prepare for any new assign-
ments, and it's too late to update materials from prior semesters.

     Adjuncts, almost by definition, have no job security or protec-
tion against being fired at will. On many campuses, adjuncts share
incredibly cramped office space (I've heard of as many as 20 assigned
to an office with four desks and one telephone), if they have offices
at all adjuncts often discover that the safest place to store books,
laptops, phones and so on during classes is in their cars. Imagine
the challenge of needing to have a confidential discussion with a
student about a grade, or something sensitive somebody wrote in
a paper, and not even having a semiprivate place to do it. Under
those conditions, the truth of the matter is that nobody can teach
writing, at least not well.

     How we got to the point where so many faculty doing such
important work can be treated so poorly is a long story. English
Composition became an actual course in the late 1800s. According
to historian Donna Strickland, for decades most teachers of writ-
ing were English professors trained primarily to teach literature,
graduate students in literature (because there weren't graduate
programs in composition until the late 1970s), and faculty spouses
or retirees who had at least taught high-school English. If you've
never thought about specialized training for people who teach
writing, that's no surprise--the idea itself hasn't been around
for long. Because it's low level (English 101 is about the lowest
number a credit-bearing college course could have), and because
of its content (traditionally grammar concerns, citation formats for
research papers, and similar remediation that most people think
students should have learned in high school), it's not surprising
that decision makers would conclude that anybody can do it.

     Unfortunately, high-ranking administrators (deans, provosts,
presidents, chancellors) on university campuses often use that
conclusion to justify hiring and offering poor working conditions
to adjunct faculty. If anybody can teach writing, the argument goes,
then why pay experts well to do it? For whatever reason, even
though it's common to hear people complain about the poor writ-
ing skills of kids these days, it's just as common to hear the asser-
tion that teaching them to do better shouldn't be hard. We hear
these two arguments surprisingly often, and worse is that they
reinforce each other. If the people who teach writing don't need
real professional training, then why treat them professionally? And
                                                             About Writing Teachers 365

if we're not offering to treat them professionally, then why would
anybody pursue the training necessary to do it well?

Poorly Trained Faculty Can't Teach Writing Well

    I wish it were obvious that people better trained to do some-
thing would do it better than people who aren't trained as well.
That feels like such a truism it's hard to know what evidence to offer
to support it. But here's what we know: People without advanced
training in writing pedagogy tend to rely on outdated ideas about
writing, particularly that mastery of sentence-level skills like punc-
tuation and word choice leads to mastery of more complex writ-
ing tasks. As early as the mid-1970s, researchers had established
that this assumption was incorrect. (Several chapters on grammar
instruction in this book show why.)

    Mina Shaughnessy, who was a professor at the City University
of New York during the period when the system became open
admissions (so that anybody with a high-school diploma or equiv-
alent could be admitted without question), published an influen-
tial book called Errors and Expectations in 1979. One of her key find-
ings is that students struggle with sentence-level problems for any
number of reasons that often have little to do with their mastery of
mechanics simply teaching them mechanical skills doesn't solve
those problems. Likewise, compositionist Patrick Hartwell reports
in a well-regarded 1985 scholarly journal article titled "Grammar,
Grammars, and the Teaching of Grammar" that students are much
more likely to care about mechanical issues if they consider those
issues in the context of their own writing purposes instead of
worksheets and handouts.

    Another outdated but still common practice among non-spe-
cialist writing teachers is teaching the modes of writing: narration,
description, analysis, and argument. Teaching the modes suffers
from the same basic problem as starting from the sentence level--
the assumption that writers move neatly through these stages of
complexity simply doesn't hold. And Hartwell's argument that
students learn more when they work on writing they care about
also applies here as well. A course built on a series of tasks students
must do even if they have nothing to say that motivates or inter-
ests them is a course with, let's just say, limited potential. But too
many writing teachers are either required to teach such courses in
programs designed by non-specialists, or they design courses this
way because their models are the courses they took themselves.
366 Bad Ideas

     I could keep listing practices that writing programs heavily
dependent on adjunct faculty often use, but I hope the connection
is clear--poorly treated instructors often work in programs with-
out much regard for professional knowledge of the field, which
both disempowers the instructors and reinforces the sense that
what they do isn't important. The system at too many colleges is
stuck in a cycle of insisting that some work is lower value than
other work, then using the fact that it abuses the people who do it

     In its simplest form: Anybody who is trained and supported
well and treated like a professional can teach writing. The key word
is professional. The people teaching college writing courses have
graduate degrees, often more than one-- many have spent years
on the job. Many conduct research into effective teaching or do
other kinds of research that help them teach writing. Their train-
ing, experience, and expertise have earned them the support they
need in order to do their work well. That support comes in many
forms: resources they need like office space, computer access,
photocopying and library privileges; engagement in their depart-
ments by being invited to participate in department meetings and
curriculum development; job stability instead of constantly fluc-
tuating schedules that may change suddenly and without expla-
nation; and better compensation than most writing instructors
currently receive.

     All too often "Anybody can teach writing" translates to "It
doesn't matter who teaches writing," and as a result, nobody needs
to pay attention to writing instructors at all. In multiple surveys
conducted over the last five years, adjunct faculty report that even
more than pay and benefits, they want to be treated as profession-
als and colleagues. Also at the top of the list is job stability--know-
ing they have work from one semester, or better yet year, to the
next helps them avoid freeway flying and alleviates the stress of
uncertainty. It also helps them teach better by giving them time to
reflect on and improve their teaching in a stable environment.

     Finally, treating professionals as professionals means paying
people more than many of them earn now. The Modern Language
Association, which is one professional organization that represents
faculty in English and Writing Studies, recommends a minimum
salary of $10,700 per course. The National Council of Teachers of
                                                             About Writing Teachers 367

English, MLA, and many other organizations also recommend that
faculty teaching at least half of a full-time load receive benefits
(health insurance, retirement contributions) in proportion to their
teaching load. The finances might be complex, but it's clear that
investing in faculty leads to better results most recently, Amanda
Griffith of Wake Forest University and Kevin Rask of Colorado
College have found strong correlations between the instructional
budgets of institutions and the earning power of graduates from
those institutions. Investing wisely gets better results.

    It's fair to demand better for students, but not to demand
magic from a system that's currently built on a bad premise that
anybody can teach writing. If you're thinking about colleges for
yourself or anybody you care about, ask how writing courses are
staffed and how well supported the instructors are. The American
Federation of Teachers offers a useful list of questions in their "Just
Ask" brochure. If the answers sound like the college's representa-
tives think anybody can teach writing, think very hard about what
they're really saying.

Further Reading

    Donna Strickland's history The Managerial Unconscious in the
History of Composition Studies helps illuminate the labor prob-
lems at the heart of commodified composition instruction. Laura
McKenna's "The Cost of an Adjunct," Colleen Flaherty's "The
Case for Better Faculty Pay," and the joint report by the Modern
Language Association and Association of Departments of English,
"Education in the Balance: A Report on the Academic Workforce
in English," illuminates the false economy behind under-pay-
ing and under-supporting writing teachers. Finally, the American
Federation of Teachers webpage titled "Just Ask" gives students
and parents information necessary to decide whether a particular
college truly supports teaching and learning.

BAD IDEAS ABOUT WRITING
edited by Cheryl E. Ball & Drew M. Loewe

Bad Ideas About Writing counters major myths about writing instruction.
Inspired by the provocative science- and social-science-focused book This
Idea Must Die and written for a general audience, the collection offers
opinionated, research-based statements intended to spark debate and
to offer a better way of teaching writing. Contributors, as scholars of
rhetoric and composition, provide a snapshot of and antidotes to major
myths in writing instruction.

"Bad Ideas About Writing offers its readers a wealth of good ideas for
countering the dangerous myths, harmful stereotypes, unfounded
folklore, romantic delusions, and fanciful thinking that too often
surround questions about how best to improve written expression.
It features recommendations for achievable goals from an incredible
variety of top scholars and models good writing practices itself in its
contibutors' insightful, accessible prose.

Students, policy makers, parents, and instructors will all benefit
from its constructive criticism, which is made available to the public
online in an open-access format. For those tired of moral panics that
Johnny can't write, this book is a readable and refreshing correction
to hyperbole and humorlessness and provides a great replacement for
the just-so stories and dreary textbooks that currently fill too many
shelves on the topic of rhetoric and composition."
