In this introduction we will:
   Lay out the basic structure for the textbook

Getting Started

This textbook is divided into two parts with each of those two parts built around outlining and completing the process
of writing a single assignment. Ideally, each chapter is meant to be paired with one week of classroom time and so, the
idea is that by reading a chapter a week and then practicing the tools and techniques during class time where you can get
feedback from your peers and professor you will be slowly and methodically building strong reading and writing habits
that will help you throughout your university career. Each chapter has three videos that will give you the opportunity to
pause, rewind, and re-watch the brief lectures to ensure that you are comfortable with the terminology and techniques

   Part I: Chapters 1 through 6 will focus on writing a close reading essay while Part II: Chapters 7-13 will focus on writing
an argumentative essay in which you will make your own argument in response to an essay prompt. We will not get into
too much detail about Part II for now as it relies on Chapters 1-6 to lay the foundation for the skills needed to write
an argumentative essay. Instead, we will use this introduction to focus on your first assignment: writing a close reading
essay.

   A close reading essay is an essay that analytically reconstructs another author's complex argument in your own words.
In order to write a close reading essay, however, you will need a variety of other tools and skills including:

   Reading critically with a pen in your hand, taking notes
   Analyzing a text by looking for key observations and pieces of evidence
   Focusing your analysis on key portions of a text, rather than trying to cover the whole essay
   Reconstructing the author's complex argument based on the focused evidence you identify
   Expanding out to consider the full scale of the author's complex argument
   Writing a thesis statement that recreates an author's complex argument
   Expanding that thesis into an essay with logically constructed paragraphs
   Revising your thesis and your essay at multiple points throughout the process of completing your close reading

      essay

To begin acquiring and reaffirming these tools and skills, we are going to do a short writing activity that will help you
evaluate your strengths and weaknesses at this point. We are deliberately not going to give you a whole lot of specific
direction at this point and we want to see what skills and tools you already possess and what areas you may want to focus
on as a way of improving.

Try This!

Read David Bollier's "The Plot to Privatize Common Knowledge" and once you have completed reading it, write a brief
250-word essay reconstructing the author's argument. Again, we are going to use the upcoming chapters to build up a
vocabulary and skill set to help you improve your writing, but the point of having you write the essay at this point is to
assess what strengths and weaknesses you possess at this point.

       "The Plot to Privatize Common Knowledge," by David Bollier
       Over the past three decades, modern culture has become infatuated with the idea that knowledge should be
       owned like real estate or stock shares. The original idea, of course, is that copyrights, trademarks and patents
       reward people for their creative labors and thereby boosts the common good.
       But this line of thinking has come to resemble a kind of Market Fundamentalism: copyrights, trademarks and
       patents are the only morally legitimate and practical method for managing creations of the mind. There is no
       middle ground. You either believe in intellectual property rights, or you support "theft" and "piracy.
       This fundamentalist approach shuts down a broader discussion about how knowledge ought to circulate in
       our culture. To avoid any confusion, let me just say straight-up that I believe in copyrights and patents. In
       some cases, they provide significant and necessary incentives to invest in new works. But today, copyrights

                                                                                                                                                              Part I: Introduction | 2
       and patents are going far beyond their intended goals--such as the U.S. Constitution provision to "promote
       progress in science and the useful arts"--to become ends in themselves. Instead of carefully balancing private
       interests and public needs, copyrights and patents are becoming crude, anti-social instruments of control and
       avarice.
       This is the conclusion that I came to in my book Brand Name Bullies, which is filled with dozens of stories of
       copyright and trademark owners bullying citizens, artists, scholars and others with ridiculous legal threats.

       Silent Campfires

       One of my favorite stories about the alarming expansion of copyright law involves ASCAP, the American Society
       of Composers, Authors and Publishers, the organization that collects performance licensing fees from public
       establishments where recorded music is played.
       ASCAP decided that their domain should be extended to summer camps. Why shouldn't boys and girls
       singing around the campfire be considered a "public performance" that should pay royalties? A while back
       ASCAP approached the American Camping Association and said it wanted blanket performance licenses from
       hundreds of summer camps-- something on the order of $300 to $1,400 per season per camp.
       This caused quite a ruckus. When it was discovered that ASCAP wanted money for the Girl Scouts to sing
       "This Land Is Your Land" and "Puff, the Magic Dragon", the press went nuts. There were stories about camps
       resorting to non-copyrighted songs like "The Bow-Legged Chicken." An ASCAP official heartlessly told a
       reporter: "They [camps] buy paper, twine and glue for their crafts - they can pay for the music too." Eventually,
       after a huge public outcry, ASCAP backed down. But its claim to legal authority in charging summer camps for
       their "public performances" of copyrighted songs remains intact.

       Lawsuit Barbie

       The issue in so many of these battles is: Who shall control the "public meaning" of familiar images? Mattel
       is legendary in trying to protect the cultural "meaning" of Barbie. It has gone after any unauthorized uses of
       Barbie. It went after a series of photographs by Mark Napier called Distorted Barbie, which dared to depict
       Barbie as fat or as having Down's Syndrome. Even highly distorted images of Barbie that were essentially
       unrecognizable were deemed unacceptable by Mattel.
       Mattel went after a magazine that caters to adult collectors of Barbie dolls. Mattel even pressured the Seattle
       publisher of a book, Adios, Barbie: Young Women Write About Body Image and Identity, to change the title. The
       book was reprinted as Body Outlaws. This extreme clampdown on free expression spurred culture-jammers,
       such as the self-styled Barbie Liberation Organization, which substituted voice boxes of GI Joe with those in
       Barbie, so that GI Joe would say, "Let's plan our dream wedding," and Barbie would yell, "Vengeance is mine!"
       I am happy to report, a federal circuit court in the United States put a damper on Mattel's bullying litigation.
       The case involved Utah photographer Tom Forsythe, who made a series of 78 photos of Barbie for his Food
       Chain Barbie exhibit. It featured Barbie in enchiladas, stuffed into a blender and in other kitchen poses. Only a
       few of Forsythe's photos sold. He spent about $5,000 to mount the exhibit, and lost money. No matter; Mattel
       wanted to send a message that you can't mess with Barbie. It spent years litigating the case, requiring Forsythe
       to find pro bono legal counsel, which spent nearly $2 million defending him. Forsythe prevailed in the circuit

court, which delivered a stinging rebuke to Mattel for bringing a "groundless and unreasonable" trademark
dilution claim.

Watch Your Words

The privatization of words--language is one of the most basic form of commons-- is another disturbing trend.
The Japanese corporation that owns the "Godzilla" trademark has a habit of threatening all sorts of people who
use the phoneme "zilla," including a website called "Davezilla" that featured a lizard-like cartoon character.
The corporate obsession with owning words is really quite extensive. McDonald's claims to own 131 words
and phrases. The San Diego-based McDonald's actually claims to own the Irish prefix "Mc." It has successfully
prevented restaurant from naming their businesses McVegan, McSushi and McMunchies.
Ralph Lauren, the clothing line, went after Polo magazine, run by an equestrian organization, claiming it
was a trademark infringement for the U.S. Polo Association to use the word "polo" on its line of clothing!
MasterCard went after Ralph Nader for using "priceless" in his campaign ads when running for President in
2000. (Nader's free speech rights ultimately prevailed.) But the gay athletes who wanted to host a series of
athletic competitions in San Francisco could not use the phrase "Gay Olympics" because that phrase is owned
by the U.S. Olympic Committee, who gets to decide who can use it. "Special Olympics" for disabled kids is OK,
but not "Gay Olympics."
The TV demagogue Bill O'Reilly reportedly went ballistic when he learned that the comedian (and now senator)
Al Franken was using the words "fair and balanced" as a subtitle in his book that mocked various right-
wing pundit, including him. The federal court laughed Fox News' case out of court, and Franken won. But
pity the people who can't afford to hire Floyd Abrams, a prominent First Amendment attorney, to represent
them. A woman from Los Angeles dared to name her neighborhood newspaper the Beechwood Voice. She was
threatened with legal action by the Village Voice, which claimed that use of the word "voice" as a newspaper
name diluted its trademark.
These stories illustrate just how far Market Fundamentalism is willing to go in order to enforce its vision of
the world. It wants to commodify all of culture as private property, and require people to obtain permission
(and to make royalties) before embarking on any modestly derivative new creativity. This approach, not
coincidentally, favors the Disneys, Time Warners and Rupert Murdochs because it protects the market value
of large inventories of copyrighted and trademarked works. It directly stifles expression that is local, amateur,
small-scale or non-commercial in nature--the kind of expression that almost anyone outside a powerful
corporation would engage in. This amounts to a wholesale privatization of our cultural commons.

Patents Privatize Taxpayer-Funded Research

The Market Fundamentalist worldview is even more infuriating, if that is possible, when applied to patents
arising out of publicly funded research. Until 35 years ago, there had been a broad consensus that the
intellectual property rights of federal research should stay in the public domain, or at least be licensed on a
nonexclusive basis. That way, taxpayers could reap the full measure of value from their collective investments.
In the late 1970s, however, large pharmaceutical, electronics and chemical companies mounted a bold lobbying
campaign to reverse the public ownership of federal research. Since enactment of Bayh-Dole Act of 1980,

                                                                                                                                                     Part I: Introduction | 4
       authorizing universities to patent the fruits of federally funded research, we have seen a land rush to sell
       academic research that was once freely available to all.
       Between 1980 and 2000, the number of patents secured by universities grew ten-fold, bringing in more than
       $1 billion in royalties and licensing fees--a windfall enjoyed mostly by a dozen top research universities. This,
       in reality, is a privatization of the public's investments. Even though the public pays for the lion's share of risky
       basic research for new drugs, the long-term equity returns tend to go to drug companies and a handful of top
       research universities. In the United States, we have seen this with the cancer drug Taxol; the anti-depressant
       Prozac; the hypertension drug Capoten; and a number of HIV and AIDS therapies.
       The upshot is that citizens often have to pay twice for pharmaceuticals and other medical treatments--first,
       as taxpayers who finance the research, and second, as consumers who pay monopoly prices for drugs. This
       is a pure giveaway because it's not even clear that companies need exclusive patent rights as an incentive to
       commercialize new drug research.

       Corporations Loot Indigenous People's Knowledge

       Multinational corporations are no longer content to simply claim ownership of commons knowledge at home.
       Now they scour the developing world--in a practice known as biopiracy--to claim patents on the botanical
       and ecological knowledge acquired by indigenous people through the centuries. They move into Madagascar,
       Brazil, Guatemala and other poor countries to find plants and microorganisms that might be used in making
       new medicines and genetically engineered crops. But as Seth Shulman writes in his book Owning the Future,
       "Who, if anyone, should be able to claim ownership rights to the globe's genetic and cultural inheritance?"
       Sir John Sulston answers this question eloquently in his book, The Common Thread, which chronicles the race
       to de-code the human genome. A private startup company, Celera, was aggressively trying to put genomic
       sequences in one big privatized database. That way, it would have a monopoly over future use of the genomic
       data by licensing access to its database. Fortunately, a coalition of public-sector scientists published the data
       first, which is why the human genome is now in the public domain. Sulston answers, quite rightly, that the
       human genome must be treated as the "common heritage of humankind."

       Life Itself Can Now Be Owned

       We dodged a bullet there when the publicly funded scientists won the race to decode human genome. Yet
       the threat of private ownership of essential knowledge for the sake of profits is not by any means over.
       Further attempts will by the logical culmination of a path first opened by the U.S. Supreme Court's Diamond
       v. Chakrabarty ruling in 1980, which authorized the patenting of live, genetically altered microorganisms. The
       patenting of living organisms opened the way for an ecologically and ethically dubious future in which the life
       forms that are part of the sacred web of life can be owned and treated as commodities. Knowledge is treated
       as private property, not as a public good.
       One inevitable result of all these new ownership claims is the rise of new barriers to open sharing,
       collaboration and discovery among researchers and scholars. Patents are increasingly being granted for
       "upstream" research, which means that basic knowledge that everyone else must use for the field to advance, is
       becoming proprietary. Harvard, MIT and the Whitehead Institute, for example, have a patent on all drugs that

5 | Part I: Introduction
inhibit something known as NF-kB cell signaling. Since this physiological process is believed to have something
to do with many diseases such as cancer and osteoporosis, the patent deters anyone else from pursuing their
own scientific investigations in this area.
Things were not always this way concerning valuable knowledge. Contrast these stories with Jonas Salk, the
inventor of the polio vaccine. When journalist Edward R. Murrow asked him, "Who owns the patent on this
vaccine?" Salk replied, "Well, the people, I would say. There is no patent. Could you patent the sun?" This
story helps us remember that current notions about ownership of knowledge are not inevitable and universal;
they are the result of mounting market pressures to make our scientific and cultural commons into private
property.
The privatization of knowledge has only intensified as the courts--in the United States, at least--have lowered
the standards for obtaining patents while broadening the scope of what is patentable. It is now possible to
own mathematical algorithms embedded in software programs. The very tools needed to conduct scientific
research are now private property, available only for a steep fee.
Imagine what might have happened to biotechnology and computer science if contemporary patent rules had
been in place in the 1950s and 1960s. Neither the biotech nor the computer revolution would have occurred in
the first place. Too much fundamental knowledge would have been off limits due to patents.

Problem of the Anti-Commons

The over-patenting of knowledge sometimes results in what is called an "anti-commons" problem, in which
property rights for a given field of research are so numerous and fragmented that it becomes very difficult to
conduct research. The transaction costs for obtaining rights are simply too numerous and costly. For example,
there are thirty-four "patent families" for a single malarial antigen, and those rights, applying to different
pieces of the research agenda, are owned by different parties in many different countries. One reason that a
malaria vaccine has been so elusive is because the patent rights are so complicated and expensive to secure.
It is worth noting that openness, sharing and the public domain do not harm the market. Quite the contrary.
They invigorate it. In 2005, I co-hosted a conference called Ready to Share: Fashion and the Ownership of
Creativity. It explored the power of openness in apparel design. Precisely because no one can own the creative
design of clothes--they can only own the company name and logo, as trademarks--everyone can participate in
the design commons. The result is a more robust, innovative and competitive marketplace. This is exactly the
effect that Linux, the open-source computer operating system, had on the software sector. It has opened up
new opportunities for value-added innovation and competition in a marketplace until then dominated by the
Microsoft monopoly.
Yale Professor Yochai Benkler argues in his magisterial book, The Wealth of Networks, that a great deal of
knowledge production is more effectively pursued through a commons than through markets. Questions of
ethics aside, why doesn't money succeed at simply "buying" the knowledge it needs? Because money tends to
subvert the social dynamics that make the knowledge commons work. It can sabotage self-directed inquiry. It
undermines the social trust, candor and ethics that are essential to creativity and good research.

After You Have Finished Writing Your Essay

Now that you have a 250-word essay in which you reconstruct Bollier's complex argument, you are going to do a brief
self-evaluation of your work. Complete the Essay Self-Evaluation below. Each question requires a "Yes" or "No" answer.
For each "Yes" response, give yourself one point. For each "No" response give yourself zero points. Your final score will
be mark out of ten (ex: Seven "Yes" responses = 7/10). Be honest with yourself. This is not for grades and is meant as an
assessment tool so that you have a better sense of yourself as a writer and your strengths and weaknesses at this point.

Essay Self-Evaluation

   Taking Measure

         1. Do you begin your essay with a thesis focused on the purpose of the text? Remember: a thesis must be
             something a reader can agree or disagree with; a fact, summary or an opinion is not an argument.
            Y/N
            2. Does your thesis make an interpretive claim about the text (i.e. do you make a claim about the text that
            is not obvious and is more than a simple summary of the text)?
            Y/N
            3. Do you use the author's name and the title of the essay in your argument? Hint: if you do not, you are not
            making an argument about the text.
            Y/N
            4. Does your thesis statement quote specific parts of the text as evidence?
            Y/N
            5. Do you discuss a new aspect of the text in every paragraph (rather than repeat the same observation over
            and over)? Please answer "No" if your essay is only one paragraph.
            Y/N
            6. Do you stay focused on the assigned text and avoid irrelevant "evidence" from outside the text (ex:
            personal experiences, facts or opinions you have read somewhere else, vague references to history)?
            Y/N
            7. Do you avoid the five-paragraph essay (vague introduction, three body paragraphs for every piece of
            repetitive "evidence," a conclusion that repeats your introduction)?
            Y/N
            8. Do you cite from the text and use specific textual evidence while making your points in your body
            paragraphs and conclusion?

7 | Part I: Introduction
            Y/N
            9. Do you use the specific terms used in the text rather than generalizing terms like "people" or "society"?
            Y/N
            10. Do you culminate rather than simply repeat your essay in your conclusion? Do you finish with a claim
            about what your unique reading has discovered about the text?
            Y/N
     BONUS: Take a moment to read aloud what you have written. Were you able to read it from start to finish without
     stumbling? Does it make sense?
     Y/N

     Total: /10

Thinking Ahead...

Make sure that you keep reviewing your essay and your self-evaluation over the next few weeks as we will be using it for
a variety of purposes in the upcoming chapters. It is also useful to have it nearby to remind yourself of the progress you
are making. If you gave yourself a score that is lower than you would like to achieve in the future, this essay will serve
as a reminder and motivator in the weeks ahead. You will get better as we add more tools that will allow you better to
articulate your interesting and complex thoughts and insights.

   As you work through each chapter in this textbook, you will find yourself adding different tools to make your work
sharper and more coherent. This is a process and it does require patience and practice. Your first task is to slow down.
Chapter 1 is all about taking your time and analyzing a text before jumping to conclusions about what its "meaning" might
be. In order to build an effective and complex close reading essay, you must slow down and gather the best and most
compelling evidence from the author's text. In Chapter 1 we will explain and demonstrate this process and then you will
practice it.

                                                                                                                                                              Part I: Introduction | 8

Introduction to Close Reading

                           Every text has an argument, you just have to look for it. Pixabay/CC0 1.0

   Writing an essay at the university level means entering an ongoing scholarly conversation. Before you select an essay
subject, you should know that throughout history, scholars have addressed and articulated similar concerns and ideas;
many have dedicated their lives to these problems and arguments. So, rather than worrying about generating a new idea,
it would be wise to aim for active and informed participation in that conversation. This is done via the process of analysis.

       Analysis is when you read a text, find specific details from that text and use those details as evidence to
       examine that text's argument and purpose.
In order to analyze and contribute meaningfully, you must first understand all parts of a scholarly conversation.
Therefore, the ability to close read and understand others' writing is vital.
   We will focus the first six chapters on producing a close reading.
       A close reading first gathers specific evidence from a text and then analyzes those observations in order
       to provide a thorough examination of that author's complex argument.

                                                                                                                                              Introduction to Close Reading | 12
   Assignment

     For the first assignment, you will do a close reading of an essay and then write a 750-word essay analyzing an
     author's complex argument based on evidence from the text.

13 | Introduction to Close Reading
Gathering Evidence

Every close reading relies on evidence. Without evidence, a writer is simply stating their opinion. As such, writing an essay
begins well before you start writing with the process of gathering evidence. In fact, very little essay writing is actually
"writing." Rather, most of the essay writing process is:

   Gathering evidence (reading the text and taking notes)
   Pre-planning and pre-writing (outlining and brainstorming)
   Research (of definitions, other scholars' concepts, statistics)
   Drafting (early attempts at thesis paragraphs and body paragraphs that will be revised as the process continues).
We will outline how to gather evidence by modeling the task of slowing down and recording all the observations that are
to be had within a text. For a brief tutorial on the basics of finding evidence within a text, watch Video 1.1: Walk Through
Self Evaluation, then read the subsequent text.

        A YouTube element has been excluded from this version of the text. You can view it online here:

Reading Slowly

In these early stages of a close reading, it is not necessary to find an analytical angle right away or to identify immediately
the author's overall purpose. At the beginning of your close reading, your greatest asset is time; therefore, you should slow
down. Analyzing a text is a multi-stage process and finding evidence from a text is the very beginning of that process. The
tools we introduce in this chapter will not help you if you do not give yourself the time needed to apply them properly.

   By the end of the chapter you will be asked to write a brief paragraph wherein you reconstruct what you've identified
as the author's complex argument, but at this early stage of the chapter, we need to gather evidence with which we can
begin that reconstruction.

     You should not jump immediately to your thesis; instead, you need to gather complex evidence by reading slowly
     with a pen in hand. You should take this time to annotate the text you are reading with your observations and
     initial interpretations.

For now, it is enough to annotate what you are reading--make a note of things that are interesting, confusing, or repeated.
When your task is to analyze a text, resist the need to jump in and begin drafting your thesis right away. Instead, to ensure
you will eventually make an argument of adequate complexity, you should devote the time necessary to examine the text
thoroughly.
To examine a text closely, you should:

 1. Annotate your experience
2. Take notice
3. Be granular

1. Annotate your experience

You will always begin by reading with a pen in hand, writing in the margins, underlining, highlighting and otherwise
marking on the text, if you own the text, or by taking notes on a separate piece of paper if you are borrowing the text. You
can draw arrows linking different parts of the text in the margin as a way of following the author's logic and argument. If
you are reading online, you should get in the habit of annotating your reading experience in some way. You can do this on
paper, or with a digital text editor or PDF editor which allow you to highlight and make notes or comments. Hypothes.is
is a free general purpose web and PDF annotator that you can use for that purpose.

2. Take notice

During your first reading of a text, you should be looking for elements that jump out at you, that you think are interesting
or puzzling, or that you think may need more attention in a second reading. Underline or highlight words you do not
understand, then seek out definitions for those words. If you encounter a word that is new to you, it is likely that the
word is significant to the central message or theme of the text.

3. Be granular

Reading critically requires being granular. It is not enough to just flag whole sentences or even whole paragraphs. You
must get down to the level of the word. Begin by looking for some straightforward clues:

          a. What's interesting? What's strange?
       What words and phrases catch your attention in your first reading? This may take the form of repetitions; if a word
       or phrase is repeated, it is likely central to the author's purpose.

          b. What words or phrases are new to you?
       You will probably encounter words or phrases that you have never read or heard before. You may also encounter
       facts or concepts that you are learning for the first time. That's great! Make a note of them and then look them up,
       or seek out additional information.

          c. What patterns are present?
       What elements of the argument repeat? A common pattern is the use of synonyms or words that are similar
       thematically. If there are several synonyms or thematic terms, it is likely the author is focusing on a specific idea or
       argument that can be conveyed using these words. You might also consider larger sets of words. For example, if an
       author is using verbs like "flow" and "poured," nouns like "ocean" and "river" and adjectives like "wet" or "fluid," you
       might note that there are a lot of water-related words. Three or more words in a list of synonyms or thematically-
       related words or phrases probably indicates a pattern.

          d. What contrasts or opposites are present?
       Are there words that are opposites or words understood to be contrasts of one another? The author may use these
       to establish the main argument by comparing points or establishing a counter argument. It may also be that the

                                                                                                                                                                   Reading Slowly | 16
       author is offering a more nuanced approach to a subject, so it's important to look for subtle or implied contrasts
       that are not as stark as good/bad, black/white. For example, an author might use the word "infantilize" and then
       later "adult"--while the author does not juxtapose the words side by side, the two words are opposites and may be
       clues about the author's larger argument.

                                                   The use of contrasting language in a scholarly text is deliberate
                                                   and noteworthy. From Pixabay/CC0 1.0
As you write on the text and make your notes, remember that there is no such thing as too much data at this phase. The
more information you have, the more sophisticated your reading will be, and the deeper your understanding of the text.
You should try to compile exhaustive lists: at least 7-10 interesting words, 7-10 definitions of new words, 7-10 lists of
patterns, 7-10 contrasts.

   Reminder

     Remember: Do not jump into formulating an argument; you do not need to explain what anything means yet. Just
     gather as many observations and potential pieces of evidence as you can.

    The Ultimate Communications App

       The most amazing invention of all-time, and it belongs to all of us
       Charles Justice
       Source: On the Commons, The Ultimate Communications App
       I've just invented a new communication app. It can be used by almost everyone; It works anywhere and
       anytime, night or day; It doesn't need batteries, doesn't need to be plugged in, doesn't even need the internet;
       Once people start using it, it is so easy that it is almost impossible to stop using it; it becomes indispensable,
       and you are hooked, you cannot be without it; It can be tailored to suit any occasion; Its use facilitates an
       expanding network of people; It's use opens up incredible possibilities for creativity and cooperation.
       There are only two things that may be problematic with it: my new app takes about four years to download.
       Yes, you heard correctly, not four minutes but four years. And usually, only ridiculously young kids know
       how to download it, but, like I said it takes about four years. During that time, the system needs constant
       maintenance and TLC. The other snag is that once someone starts using it, it becomes common property,
       available to everyone free, and so I personally, can't get rich off of it.
       Are you ready to try my new free app? It's called language. OK, I lied. It's not a new app and I didn't invent it.
       But everything else I said about it is true, and it was invented by the first humans sometime within the last five
       hundred thousand years.
       What is language? A method of communication that is available to virtually all humans to use. A common way
       for us to share information and create enduring knowledge. One of the first, but not the first commons created
       by human collective agreement.
       Take a proto-language "Me Tarzan, you Jane". Start with naming, then add verbs to describe action and
       emotions. Once you begin to share information you are creating a common space of understanding amongst
       you and your fellow speakers. This common space can be called a commons.

23 | Your Turn!
What is a commons? A commons is a level-playing field. Everybody gets to breathe air, and we have that in
common with most other species. Here in the rain forests of the Pacific Northwest, fresh water is a common
resource.
We parcel up land into properties, but much land is held in common in the form of parks, trackless wilderness,
public rights of way and public spaces. The sunlight that falls to earth is common to all, plants and animals on
land, fish and the whales in the sea.
Before the human development of agriculture and domestication humans lived for millions of years in hunter-
gatherer bands of approximately thirty to a hundred people. If the band survived and prospered, eventually,
as population grew over generations, a new band would split off. As this process continued, a larger and larger
area of land would need to be occupied.
Eventually groups that originally were connected, would become separated permanently by mountains or
water barriers. Originally we had everything in common. Then because of our success in outgrowing our
original environment we ceased to have a common place and identity.
This is probably the basis for the evolution of different languages (see "Tower of Babel") If we go back far
enough in time, all of us living today have a common history, but over thousands of years different peoples
occupying different places have come to conflict and cooperation with each other.
Each of us has our humanity and human origins in common with everyone else alive today. Since then, we may
have got here in different ways, but we all share the present time in common. We, in fact, share this age in
common with the Earth's biosphere and all its manifest diversity.

The Observational Paragraph

The next step is to consider your list of observations carefully and narrow it down to the best two. Review the information
you have collected. What's connected? Group similar observations together and think about which observations are the
strongest and most interesting, and which observations are the most complex. Your small and focused pieces of evidence
or observations should be something you can literally put your finger on. Your observations must then be one to three
word phrases (ex. "Age of citizen"). Also consider whether your two best key observations support different elements of
the author's complex argument. Evidence that is too similar will end up building a repetitive argument that likely will not
develop the level of complexity that is required to write at a university level.

   Your goal is to look at the long list of evidence you just gathered and choose the best two pieces. Look at your entire
list of evidence and ask yourself:

   Which of these pieces of evidence points most clearly to the author's argument?
   Which of these pieces of evidence has the most interesting or complex language?
   Which of these pieces of evidence would I be interested in discussing?
   Which pieces of evidence overlap? Can I make groups out of certain pieces of evidence?

Look at your entire list of potential evidence, and, using these basic questions as your guide, focus in on two key pieces
of evidence. Going back to "The Plot to Privatize Common Knowledge" by David Bollier from the introduction to this text,
and the evidence we gathered in Video 1.2, we went through the list, and with the above questions in mind, decided that
the two pieces of evidence we wanted to focus on were:

                                                                                                                                                                       What Now? | 28
 1. The binary between corporations and the public because Bollier wants to establish that the corporations are being
      greedy in their rush to privatize knowledge of many forms, whereas the public, he argues, has a fundamental right
      to the "common good" of that knowledge.

2. The description of the copyrights and patterns as "anti-social instruments of control" because the author wants to
      ensure that the readers understand that copyrights and patents, when abused, are negative capitalist systems built
      around restricting, controlling and owning ideas and knowledge, and treating those ideas and that knowledge as
      property.

   Activity

     Write down what you've chosen as your two best pieces of evidence that you feel most clearly support the author's
     complex argument. For each of those pieces of evidence, write one sentence explaining why you chose that piece
     of evidence, and what portion of the author's argument that specific piece of evidence is supporting.
     Now that you have two pieces of evidence and justification for why you are using those specific pieces of evidence,
     you are ready to move to the next stage of pre-writing and draft an observational paragraph. The goal of an
     observational paragraph is to

          Explain why you've chosen each piece of evidence
          Link your two pieces of evidence together
          Explain how that evidence supports a specific complex argument that the author is making within the text.

This is not your thesis, but, rather, a pre-writing activity that is meant to be an initial gathering of ideas that you will
begin to shape into a more concrete close reading in the coming chapters. Do not worry about getting it all "correct" or
"perfect." Just get your ideas out and be willing to edit! While this paragraph will not be your exact thesis, it will contain
elements that you can use later to write a strong thesis statement that proposes your analysis of the author's complex
argument.

   When linking evidence into the author's complex argument you should consider:

   How does the author's specific language in the evidence I've chosen speak to the argumentative position the author
      is taking? In a basic way, consider whether the words that the author is choosing pointing towards a negative or
      positive attitude towards their general subject?

   Why has the author made the deliberate choice to use the words that you have chosen as specific evidence? What
      do those words mean? Why would the author choose those words and not an alternative?

   In what ways is the evidence that I have chosen a small compact example of the larger argument the author is
      making? In other words, how does the small specific piece of evidence chosen expand out to the author's larger
      complex argument?

Let's begin with an example and, after you read it, you can use it as a model to write your own observational paragraph.
Here is the observational paragraph we wrote using 2 key pieces of evidence we found in our analysis of the essay given
in the introduction to this textbook, David Bollier's "The Plot to Privatize Common Knowledge."

                                                                                                                                                                        Your Turn! | 30
   Examples

     Though he is quick to clarify that he "straight-up" believes in copyrights and patents, Bollier is also equally
     quick to establish his claim that contemporary corporations have converted these property rights and claims into
     "crude, anti-social instruments of control and avarice." He very clearly establishes a binary between these greedy
     corporations rushing to privatize, manage, and outright own songs, words and even prefixes, and the public who
     seek only to share "fundamental knowledge" for the sake of the "common good." Through continued use of this
     contrast, Bollier makes certain his readers cannot miss what is really at stake in this quest to manage "creations
     of the mind": an "over-patenting" of thought to the point where the average person can no longer access freely
     the accumulated wisdom of humanity.

Looking back over the list of data we gathered when examining Bollier's essay in Video 1.2, you will probably notice that
this paragraph is based on the observations of the binary between corporations and the public, and abusive of patents by
corporations being characterized as "anti-social instruments of control." Using this information, and the brief sentence
description as to why we chose the evidence that we did, we were able to draft an observational paragraph in which we
begin to propose what Bollier is really doing here.

Your Turn!

Go back to the list of evidence you gathered as you were reading Charles' Justice's "The Ultimate Communication App"; it
may also be useful to rewatch Video 1.3. After this, write a observational paragraph of your own based on your annotation
and observations of Charles' Justice's "The Ultimate Communication App." Select the two pieces of evidence you believe
best point to the author's complex argument and explain what makes those two pieces of evidence the strongest. From
there, construct one to two sentences in which you link those two pieces of evidence to what you have identified as
Justice's complex argument.

   Again, we are in pre-writing still and you do not need to worry about your observational paragraph being completely
polished. It is important at this stage to sift through all the evidence you've collected, choose what you think are the
strongest two pieces and begin to reconstruct the author's complex argument. We will revise this observational paragraph
later, but for now, it is important to write a first draft.

Thinking Ahead...

                                                   Get ready to organize your thoughts on the text. From
                                                   Pixabay/CC0 1.0

Compare the paragraph you just wrote to in response to Charles Justice's "The Ultimate Communication App." You will
likely see the improvement that gathering focused pieces of evidence brings to analyzing the author's complex argument.
Now that you are comfortable with information gathering and crafting an observational paragraph, we are going to take
the next step toward focusing that information into a purposeful thesis.

   When you revise an observational paragraph into your unique and controversial reading of a text, you will need to
capture the original text's main argument and highlight the article's main points (including any key concepts or theories)
while eliminating all extraneous or minor details. Review the observational paragraph you wrote and consider how you
might revise it into a purposeful thesis that analyzes the author's complex argument.

   In the next chapter we will be working on revising your observational paragraph into a 2 storey thesis statement. By this
we mean that you want to do a little more than summarize or simply restate what is in the text. You want your readers
to understand right away that this is your reading of the text that follows from the evidence within the text that you have
chosen. You are not summarizing, rather you are persuading your readers to see what they can learn about a text by
reading it your way.

                                                                                                                                                               Thinking Ahead... | 32

   Learning Outcomes
   In this chapter we will:

          Review the information you gathered in Chapter 1 and use it to create your unique, purposeful reading.
          Reconsider some of our old habits that prevent us from creating a focused reading.
          Decide which observations will be included in your essay and create your essay blueprint.
          Create a controversial claim that will focus your essay and give it purpose.
          Develop the two-storey opening that will establish and focus your interpretive reading.

35 | Chapter Overview
Drafting the Blueprint

Following the information-gathering stage described in Chapter 1, the essay blueprint is the next step toward purposeful
writing. The essay blueprint is NOT a summary (nor should it be confused with the essay roadmap, to be discussed
in Chapter 4). Drafting an essay blueprint is an exercise that demonstrates clear understanding, meaningful citing and
concise paraphrasing of the text's argument. In this sense, the essay blueprint is as much a reading comprehension
exercise as it is an organizational exercise. Your thorough understanding of the text you are analyzing will determine the
structure of your essay and its validity.

   When drafting the blueprint, be sure the evidence you use reflects accurately the content of the original text you are
analyzing. In an analytical essay you must combine different ideas, theories, and facts to construct a coherent argument.
In your blueprint you should consider the purpose and lay the groundwork for the analytical essay you will be writing.

   A good blueprint should distill the main points of the other writer's work and organize them in a way that best suits
your analytical reading. Keep your future essay in mind as you construct your blueprint, and remember that your essay
should lead your reader through the same analytical process you went through to arrive at the claim you are making.

   Before we start constructing the blueprint, let's watch Video 2.1: The Blueprint. This video describes some of the habits,
or "Don'ts," we want to avoid when taking an analytical approach to an article. This lecture uses David Bollier's "The Plot
to Privatize Common Knowledge," so have your diagnostic essay handy.

Turning Your Lists Into Your Blueprint

When preparing to write your analytical essay, make sure you have more information than you need. It is better to find
yourself debating which observations to include rather than being a couple of paragraphs into your essay and realizing
you have exhausted all the evidence you have gathered. In the following exercise, we'll learn how to avoid this type of
situation.

   Look back at the information you have gathered in your examination of Charles Justice's "The Ultimate Communication
App" and then answer the following questions.

   Taking Measure

     Have you annotated the article you are analyzing? (i.e written in the margins and underlined interesting words
     and phrases; drawn connecting arrows between aspects of the text you believe work together to deliver a central
     message)
     Y/N
     Have you made a list of at least 7-10 interesting words or phrases found in the article?
     Y/N

Why Construct an Essay Blueprint?

An essay blueprint is almost always written as part of an academic exercise. Although a good blueprint requires clear
and concise writing, as an academic exercise, it is primarily a test of your reading comprehension skills. A blueprint
demonstrates your ability to identify central arguments and key concepts and to restate theoretical concepts in your own
words and around your own claims. For this reason, blueprint construction also helps to develop the reading skills you
need to effectively prepare for essays and exams.

39 | Why Construct an Essay Blueprint?
Constructing Your Essay Blueprint

With your data and observational paragraph in front of you, read the original text again. This may seem like an exercise
in redundancy, but re-reading with the seeds of your own interpretation in mind will help you to confirm or revise your
reading of some passages and elements. Reading the text again may also help you find less obvious support that will
strengthen and make your reading or analysis more complex. As you read, you should ask yourself, "What is the purpose
of this text? What is the central argument? How does the author support the central argument?"

   Draft your blueprint: Once you have extracted and compressed the essential material in the original text, it is time to
begin structuring your blueprint. You do not necessarily need to present the author's ideas in the order they originally
appear. You may want to begin your blueprint by stating the author's central thesis, even if it does not appear at the
beginning of the original article. However, it is best to avoid a point-by-point analysis of the text as that will result
inevitably in summary, which you most certainly want to avoid at this level.

   You should begin your analysis with an examination of what you believe to be the most important and revealing piece
(or pieces) of evidence. Was there a moment in the text or a key repetition or consistent contrast that confirmed for you
what this text was really about? Begin with that. Using that strong base, you can move to your second and third strongest
pieces of evidence. Continue with all your evidence, building your analysis until you reach your final points which should
examine the less-than-obvious supportive aspects of the text. A close reading doesn't just rely on one or two obvious
statement that prove you are "right." Imagine that you are luring your reader into your understanding of the text: "Do
you agree with my reading of the first piece of evidence? The second? The third? Well, then perhaps you would like to
consider what I have to say about this part of the text that you may be surprised to find in this argument."

   Understand that not every essay you analyze will let you apply this formula, but the exercise of pushing your claim to
consider all aspects of the text is always worthwhile.

   In your blueprint, be sure to cite keywords and terms from the original text. Cite those words or phrases that you
believe are pivotal to the author's delivery of his or her main message and explain why. While quoting the author is
expected at this level, you never want to let these passages stand alone without analysis. So include the analysis of the
selected quotations in your blueprint. While you do not want to rush to your purposeful analysis and interpretation of
the text while conducting the information-gathering exercise detailed in Chapter One, it is good to start your meaningful
interaction with the text in these pre-drafting stages of organization.

   Review and Revise Your Essay Blueprint: Remember that a blueprint is an outline for the essay you will eventually
construct. It's purpose is to organize the information or evidence you've gathered from your annotated reading of the text
and to begin structuring your analysis of the author's purpose and argument. Don't just rush into your essay after you've
completed your blueprint, Reread the article then review your blueprint. Have you included everything you believe will
lead to your most interesting and controversial reading of the text? As you revise your blueprint, ensure that you have:

   captured the main argument presented in the original text
   highlighted the article's main points (including any key concepts or theories) and eliminated all extraneous or minor

      details
   presented clearly your interpretation and interaction with the text. Is it obvious that you understand the text you

      are analyzing? Is your interpretation of the text presented clearly?

Constructing Your Two-Storey Opening, Part 1

Now that you have created a blueprint with all the information you have gathered, it's time to develop an opening focus
and claim, also known as a thesis statement. This opening will function as an analytical lens through which you will
examine the details of the text. Your opening line needs to do more than simply restate what is in the text. Your opening
line is your first opportunity to impose your interpretation upon the text. You want your readers to understand right
away that this is your reading of the text. You are not summarizing, rather you are persuading your readers to see what
they can learn about a text by reading it your way. So your opening needs to contain some sort of controversial claim.

   It is helpful to think of the opening as a building with two storeys. The first storey identifies what the text you are
reading is doing while the second storey identifies why that text is doing what it is doing.

   The first-storey of your opening should make an observation that is factual and undeniable. By that we mean an
observation that is easily proven with evidence from the text. This level or "storey" makes a statement that is not
controversial and with which no reasonable person who reads the original text would disagree. A person reading such a
thesis thinks immediately: "Yes, this is true."

   Example

     In his novel Heart of Darkness, Joseph Conrad uses the imagery of dark and light.

Joseph Conrad was an established novelist and he used many literary techniques in Heart of Darkness. There likely are
other types of imagery throughout the novel. There there are probably similes and metaphors. He may have even used
onomatopoeia. But that does not matter, because the focus here is his use of dark and light imagery. Your opening should
begin with a focus that establishes this reading as yours. You do not want to write a vague claim then grab for anything
that fits. Focusing on a key textual element or concept based on evidence from the text establishes an approach that,
while it may seem obvious to you, may not be the approach everyone would take.

   This opening observation about Conrad's work is rather obvious. You need not have read the novel text to infer that
Conrad uses dark and light imagery--it's in the title: Heart of Darkness. But this level of focus is vital: you do not want say
anything that is not unique to the text or your analysis of it.

   The second-storey asks a question to interpret, give a point of view on, or add controversy to the facts of the first
storey. "Adding controversy" means taking a position on the facts--a position that a reasonable person could disagree
with or controvert. A person reading the second storey of your opening should think: "That's an interesting point of view,
now prove it to me!" By controversial, we do not mean that this observation has to be absurd or idiosyncratic. Rather, we
mean that it takes one position out of a number of possible positions.

41 | Constructing Your Two-Storey Opening, Part 1
   Example

     In the novel Heart of Darkness, Joseph Conrad uses the imagery of dark and light to represent the contrast
     between civilization and savagery.

The "second storey" part of this thesis statement is well-known, but it is not undeniably true. It is plausible, but it is
also debatable--it must be proven by analyzing evidence from the text. Another reader could disagree with this "second
story" and use their own evidence to controvert it. That's fine. In fact this should be your goal. Debate and discussion is
exactly where you want to be as a scholar and an interpretive reader. You should feel like there is something at stake
here. You should feel a little uneasy. You should feel like you need to prove the validity and worth of your reading. If
you are saying something that is undeniably true, then you are not moving past simply pointing at what is there. If you
are saying something that requires further analysis and evidence, then you are contributing to the ongoing scholarly
conversation. So, if you have found that controversial, debatable, and (most important when it comes to constructing your
analytical essay) defensible claim about a text, well, CONGRATULATIONS: you are extending and expanding the scholarly
conversation. You are a scholar.

   You can now use your opening focus and claim to reconsider and restructure your essay blueprint. A detailed
description and analysis of your evidence should follow your opening and support your focus. Let's return to our analysis
of Bollier's "The Plot to Privatize Common Knowledge." In Video 2.2: Creating the Two-Storey Opening, we will review
the information we have collected, the observations we have made, and the connections we have formed and use them to
create a two-storey opening that will establish and guide our meaningful analysis of the text.

                                                                                                                      Constructing Your Two-Storey Opening, Part 1 | 42

The observational paragraph we produced at the end of Chapter 1 already contains textual evidence and the author's
purpose:

   Example

     Though he is quick to clarify that he "straight-up" believes in copyrights and patents, Bollier is also equally
     quick to establish his claim that contemporary corporations have converted these property rights and claims into
     "crude, anti-social instruments of control and avarice." He very clearly establishes a binary between these greedy
     corporations rushing to privatize, manage, and outright own songs, words and even prefixes, and the public who
     seek only to share "fundamental knowledge" for the sake of the "common good." Through continued use of this
     contrast, Bollier makes certain his readers cannot miss what is really at stake in this quest to manage "creations
     of the mind": an "over-patenting" of thought to the point where the average person can no longer access freely
     the accumulated wisdom of humanity.

In our two-storey opening we present the interpretive leap we will be taking in our unique and purposeful reading of
Bollier's article:

   Example

     In "The Plot to Privatize Common Knowledge" David Bollier examines the perceived threat to "fundamental
     knowledge" and the "common good" posed by contemporary corporations who are converting property rights
     and patenting claims into "crude, anti-social instruments of control and avarice." He uses this examination as a
     warning to his readers that such "over-patenting," if continued unchecked, will result in much of what has been
     previously considered the shared and accumulated wisdom of humanity becoming "off limits" to the average
     citizen.

                                                                                                                     Constructing Your Two-Storey Opening, Part 2 | 44
Your Turn! (Part 1)

   Activity

     Now it's time for you to practice the skills we have been discussing in Chapters 1 and 2. Read the following
     essay: "Kids Around the World Just Want to Hang Out" by Michael Welsh and then use the granular information-
     gathering process we outlined in Chapter 1 to annotate or make notes as you read, highlighting interesting words
     (and their definitions), synonyms and related terms, and the author's use of comparisons and contrasts.

    Kids Around the World Just Want to Hang Out

       Michael Welsh

       Between 2009 and 2010 two very different cities, Stockholm, Sweden and Keene, New Hampshire, underwent
       a process of community visioning and master planning. High school students in both places were asked to
       provide input about their preferences and visions for their cities. High school students are interesting because
       in many ways they are pre-political. They are clients and consumers of the public services and environmental
       amenities around them but with little exception they have not experienced the costs associated with their
       provision. Asked what they like or want, in other words, they are much less likely than adults to think about
       things like taxes, public sacrifice, or the restraint of private choice that might be necessary to make that
       outcome happen. As a result they are less likely to self-censor or consciously limit their ambitions.

       Stockholm and surrounding cities boast a record of documented results from active planning, and high
       schoolers there predictably saw government providing public and environmental goods and services they
       valued for the future. High schoolers in Keene agreed that the government was a source of valued commons
       assets, but were hesitant to ask for more. When asked about their desired future many instead mentioned
       malls and amusement parks, while Swedish high schoolers wanted clean waterways, street art, and public
       transit. This difference, which goes beyond mere preference for environmental or cultural amenities, lies in
       the perceived capacity of utilizing government to provide these kinds of public goods in the future. This
       difference is significant and revealing, not just for the contrast it strikes between young people in these two
       cities, but also for the prospects for planning and governance as these high schoolers grow into their roles as
       wage earners, property owners, taxpayers, and voters.

45 | Your Turn! (Part 1)
Collecting and Comparing Statements From High School Students

In 2009 Keene city planners asked young people in high school about the features of their town that they
valued and would like to protect. Meanwhile a similar effort to solicit the visions and planning objectives of
students 4000 miles away in Stockholm, Sweden was already underway.

Since these two studies were not coordinated and the questions prompting all of these results were not
identical, a classification system between the categories of public or social and private goods has been used to
code student responses so they can be more readily compared. Private goods are items and services that can
be exclusively acquired through the market. A public good, on the other hand is defined as non-excludable,
which benefits every members of a community which no one can be prevented from using,"Public goods might
include a pleasing roadside garden or fireworks high above the crowd at a baseball game or benefits from
government action like national defense or environmental pollution control. Public goods are of interest to
the study of politics because they are, to one way of imagining it, one of the main reasons humans create and
submit to government. Government is the institution that creates and sustains the provision of public goods.
It has the power through taxes and other methods to coerce, if necessary, for their payment. Politics is the
public debate about which of these goods will be created and how they will be paid for.

Groups in both studies were asked to describe the problems they saw around them and their source. In Sweden
students overwhelmingly identified problems arising from insufficient government action or inadequate
protection or provision of public goods and services: They feared a decline in green spaces. They were
concerned with loss or erosion of public transit. They complained of a lack of bicycle paths or gathering
spaces. In fact, of fifty one areas of concern developed in the study of Swedish high schoolers, thirty two (63%)
directly translate as declining public goods (a decline in biodiversity, for example) or a lack of government
action (to stem a rise in crime, for example). Twelve percent were identified as problems resulting from a lack
or decline in private goods.

American students were more focused on their town of Keene as they wrote answers that described the
things they would change or problems that concerned them. Nevertheless, in their responses 62% (almost
identical to those in Stockholm) identified problems arising from inadequate provision of public goods (a need
for more public transportation or an improved public skate park, etc.), while 5% cited undesirable side effects
of business (too many chain stores, construction leading to displacement of wildlife and natural areas). A
substantial number (30% combined) identified government actions as a problem or saw problems in their town
from a lack of business or types of business.

The responses of students in both countries results are quite similar. Keene students seem to appreciate public
goods, like their Stockholm counterparts, but are also more openly critical of government and desirous of
private goods provided by markets.

The significant differences between Stockholm and Keene students arise in their vision of their town in the
future. In the Stockholm area 53% of high schoolers' responses sought increased public goods, with examples
ranging from "a better education," to a "healthy Baltic Sea," to less crime, to free public transportation. Added
to this were 22% of responses classifiable as the product of increased government regulation or intervention
(things like "more green homes" or more renewable energy, or a "car-free inner city").

The vision that Keene students promoted of their city was more mixed. Only 36% of responses envisioned a

                                                                                                                                                     Your Turn! (Part 1) | 46
       city with access to more improved public goods. These included some of the same things Stockholm students
       wanted: improved public transportation, green buildings, preserved parks and green spaces, biodiesel buses,
       or a new skate park. However, many more of these New Hampshire students envisioned increased private
       goods (28%) and hardly any (3%) envisioned a more active or responsive government.

       What's Going On Here?

       One could argue that American students seem less inclined to trust government than their Swedish
       counterparts. Young people in Keene (one of the most liberal areas of New Hampshire, according to recent
       voting results) are not offended by government regulation, bloated bureaucracy, or an oppressive "nanny
       state." They are not Tea-Partiers alarmed at creeping socialism. Students appreciated the parks, trails, and
       green spaces of the town. In fact, in a question about the features of their city they value - a question not
       asked of Swedish students - a full 73% of responses were government-provided or government-protected
       public goods. They liked the festivals and public activities as well as the fact that the town is "walkable."
       What they appreciated about the commercial side of their city was sometimes a specific establishment
       (Borders Bookstore, Dick's Sporting Goods, Brewbaker's Coffee Shop) but more often a general category: "new
       stores," "movies," "restaurants." Commercial establishments seemed to be appreciated because they provided
       "something to do" as opposed to providing goods themselves.

       Thus what distinguishes American high schoolers from their Swedish counterparts is not the things they value
       but rather what they expect to see the future, which affects the things they feel justified in seeking and
       their imagination of what's possible to obtain. When asked what they like about their town, Keene students
       articulated a list dominated 3 to 1 by public goods. But when asked about their desired vision of a future for
       the town, public goods and private goods were mentioned at about the same level. Further, a majority of the
       envisioned private goods involve things like a mall, an arcade, or low/no cost places to "hang out." Some spelled
       this connection out directly: "a mall or something for teens to do," or "more places to shop and hang out." What
       responses like these seek is a commercial realm or market that provides them with the things that approximate
       a public commons - a safe, pleasant, and conducive place to be or engage with others.

       But why do American teens seek these commons amenities from private sources like a mall or theme park
       instead of the public realm? Such places are rarely truly accessible to all (a defining feature of public goods)
       or even qualitatively equivalent to their public component. Gated communities feel safe but secluded and
       unspontaneous. Malls close before it gets too late, expect at least some spending by visitors, typically
       necessitate driving (or being dropped off), and employ security guards to prevent the kind of gathering that a
       public space invites. Knowledge of this is implied by one Keene high schooler who requested a mall "but get
       rid of some of the cops." With all of these shortcomings, why ask for private amenities and spaces over more
       public ones?

       A plausible answer is that these young people no longer consider government to be the entity most able to
       provide them with what they want. The era of big government was declared over before they were born,
       perhaps eliminating the possibility of more public goods as even a possibility. During their lives current US
       high schoolers have seen the total Federal outlays as a percentage of gross domestic product track steadily
       downward. Tax cuts are seen as a policy tool of first choice, and privatization or charging fees for what were
       once public services is common everywhere from parks to police protection. New research demonstrates that

47 | Your Turn! (Part 1)
young people engage in consumer choice ("political consumerism") as a means of making social change more
than any other age group. Older people in America people think change comes from voting. Younger people
instead practice "fair trade."
While more research is clearly called for, the upshot seems to be an ideology among American youth that
appreciates the things that government makes possible in their lives and society, but that lacks imagination
that these or similar things will continue to be available from government in the future. For almost a quarter
of Keene students, in fact, a positive vision of the future is one that merely holds back the loss of the public
goods around them. Call it an ideology of limited expectations from government. It functions as a preventative
against disappointment and redirects focus to the benefits promised by the private/commercial realm.
Limited government is not embraced by everyone in America, and planners and others should not read the
preferences and attitudes that might arise in surveys of young Americans as indifference to public goods.
Like their counterparts in Sweden it seems likely that American young people will support things like the
preservation of green and public spaces, or the expansion of mass transit. Nevertheless from within the
ideology of limited government expectations explored here it makes perfect sense for a young person to place
their future hopes on new stores that will not displace too much open space, even as they relax in a park
playing Frisbee with friends.

                                                                                                                                                     Your Turn! (Part 1) | 48

The contrast of "Stockholm students' vision v. Keene students' vision" and the list of synonyms titled "Lowered

   Two-Storey Opening

     In "Kids Around the World Just Want to Hang Out" Michael Welsh compares the responses given by two separate
     groups of high school students from Stockholm, Sweden and Keene, New Hampshire who were surveyed about
     "their preferences and visions for their cities." Welsh uses this comparison to convey a distressing reality he hopes
     his American readers will be motivated to address: while both groups of students seemed to have the same hopes
     and visions for a greener, cleaner future for their cities, the students of Keene displayed considerably less vision
     than their Stockholm counterparts, "limited expectations" of their government's ability or interested to help them
     attain their goals, and a worrying reliance on commercial companies to provide them the accessible, common,
     and entertaining spaces they desire.

53 | Watch This!
Blueprint

Point One: Analyze the similar desires Welsh identifies within the responses of both groups of students making note of
how the only difference seems to be the Keene students' "lack of vision."

   Point Two: Analyze how Welsh seems to point to the influence of commercialism on these students as only a possible
source of this "lack of vision" but also a source of inspiration and salvation for these hopeful but surprisingly uninspired
students.

   Point Three: Analyze how Welsh subtly insinuates the dangerous difference between a public commons and a
corporate sponsored commons

   Point Four: Analyze how Welsh discusses what is really at stake here and what is really lost. Free thought and innovation
are fostered in free and open common spaces. What will happen to the future if these spaces are no longer "free" but
sponsored by corporations with their own desires and agendas?

                                                                                                                                                                       Watch This! | 54

57 | Chapter 3: The Full Three Storey Thesis
Chapter Overview

   Learning Outcomes
   In this chapter we will:

          Evaluate the two-storey thesis that you wrote in Chapter 2.
          Edit and rewrite the two-storey thesis statement you wrote in Chapter 2.
          Add the third storey to your thesis to complete the first draft of a thesis that will lead to a university-level

             close reading.

59 | Chapter Overview
Revising Your Two-Storey Thesis

Your thesis statement is like a map for your readers: a reader should be able to look at your thesis statement and have
a general idea of the direction your essay will take. Chapter 1 of this text focused on reading, annotating, and analyzing
another author's text. Chapter 2 described how to turn your initial observations into a blueprint and then a first draft of
a two-storey thesis statement that proposes a focused analysis of another author's argument. So far the text has focused
on developing the habit of slowing down to read, re-read, and analyze a text. After gathering all the evidence in a text,
choosing the best two pieces, writing an observational paragraph that we then transformed into an essay blueprint, we
wrote an initial two-storey thesis. In this chapter we will begin the process of revising that initial thesis.

       Revision is when you sharpen your ideas by condensing your language and clarifying the steps of your
       close reading.

Revision is not something you do once, at the very end of the writing process. Revision takes place all the way through
the process of your writing on small and large scales. While later chapters will involve revising a completed close reading,
this chapter will focus on writing a second draft of your two-storey thesis and then describe how to add the third storey:
the scholarly concept.

   But what should you look for when examining your first draft? What focus should you take as you write a second, third,
or even tenth draft of your thesis? Let's begin with a self-evaluation of the two-storey thesis you wrote in the previous
chapter.

                                                                                                                                        Revising Your Two-Storey Thesis | 60

   Taking Measure

     Complete the self-evaluation of your two-storey thesis below. Your ideas are complex and therefore your
     thesis statement should be long enough to explain your thoughts. Eventually this thesis statement will be the
     introduction to your paper, so you want to make sure that it is strong before you begin writing your entire essay.

     Each question requires a "Yes" or "No" answer. For each "Yes" response, give yourself one point. Your final score
     will be a mark out of twelve (ex: 10 "Yes" responses = 10/12).

Revising Towards A Second Draft of Your

Two-Storey Thesis

Congratulations! You are done the first draft of your two-storey thesis statement and are headed towards a second
revision. One of the keys to revising your two-storey thesis at this stage is to remember that you are analyzing another
author's complex argument. You are not being asked to voice your own opinion on the author's topic, nor make an
argument that agrees or disagrees with the author's stance on the topic. Rather, you are being asked to identify the best
two specific words and phrases used by the author that most clearly point to their complex argument. Those two specific
pieces of evidence are the evidence that you are using to then analyze the author's complex argument in your own words.
Let's walk through the evaluation together.

   Components
In a two-storey thesis, it is essential to identify the author's audience (or who the author is making their argument for)
and in which genre the author is working. Knowing who the author is speaking to, is important because an author will
use different vocabulary, sentence structure, and tone to argue to different groups of people; an author would argue
differently, for example, if they were talking to a group of high school students in Toronto, Canada, than they would
speaking to a group of senior citizens in Calgary, Canada. As well, knowing what type of document the author is creating,
or the genre, will help you understand the conventions and discourse in which the author is participating. The same topic
could be discussed in a newspaper article or a magazine editorial or an academic journal article, but the language and
presentation will be markedly different across these publications.

   You can then use the understanding of the author's audience and genre to focus more tightly on the author's argument.
Remember: you are not reconstructing the author's entire argument. Instead, you are writing a short essay that examines
what you believe to be one of the more important arguments the author takes. To this end, you should focus on the
two best pieces of evidence in support of this selected argumentative path. As this level, your reader generally knows
there are many different ways to interpret an author's work in an essay: your close reading should include two pieces of
evidence that best support your interpretation of the author's audience and genre. Rather than looking at the whole essay,
you should focus on the one or two integral elements that you think offer the best evidence for your reconstruction of
one of the author's focused arguments. Your two-storey thesis statement must propose an examination of the purpose
and function of the author's essay; stating your opinion of the author's subject is not the goal of a close reading. Rather,
your thesis should combine the components of audience, genre, and evidence to produce your focused and unique
examination of the author's particular argument.

   First Storey: Evidence/Observations
This section asks you to examine the first storey of your two-storey thesis statement a bit more closely.

       A strong piece of evidence in a close reading is one you can literally put your finger on.

You can not put your finger on a whole sentence or paragraph, nor can you put your finger on statements like "the
author's example of..." or on general comments about the author's tone. In a close reading, your two pieces of evidence
should be two or three words or phrases and you should use them as direct quotes (that is, they should have "quotation
marks" around them to indicate that they are the author's words and not yours).

   This section also asks you to consider the connotative value of the words and phrases that you have selected.
Denotative meaning is the literal definition of a word or phrase; connotative meaning is the implied or suggested feeling

63 | Revising Towards A Second Draft of Your Two-Storey Thesis
or meaning attached to the word or phrase. Denotative and connotative are not polar opposites; both work together to
expand the value of a word or phrase. For example, a rose has a very specific denotation related to the phylum of plant it
belongs to; however, it has connotations of love, organic growth, and beauty. When reconstructing an author's complex
argument, you want to choose words or phrases from the author's essay that have the most connotative richness that you
can find.

   Does each piece of your evidence add a different portion of the author's complex argument to your thesis?
   Second Storey: Argument
This section examines whether your own arguments or opinions are clouding your close reading. You must make sure
that the second storey restates the author's argument in your own words and is not a declaration of your opinions on
the author's subject matter. This is done by ensuring your controversial claims from the evidence you have identified;
focusing on the evidence from the text ensures you are focused on the author's argument and not your own. You need
to identify the author's argument, via your interpretation of the text, in your own words, but you need to do so in such a
way that you give the author's argument enough time and space to be complex. As mentioned in Chapter 2, it will usually
take more than a few words to capture the author's argument, so do not be afraid to make your thesis statement into two
sentences. The author's argument is complex and therefore your proposed examination of that argument should also be
complex!
   Style
There are some simple checks you can do to make sure you are using university-level language to reconstruct the author's
argument. The Style section of the evaluation asks you to consider your choice of words and phrases. While "I" might be
an effective rhetorical device to make your own argument, it is not effective in a scholarly close reading because the focus
should be on analyzing the author's argument. Phrases such as "I think..." or "I believe..." are not just unwarranted, they
are redundant. There is no need to state such a fact--of course you think and believe what you wrote!
   The use of "we," "our," and "us" is simply too broad in this context--the reader has no sense of who is being represented
by these general pronouns. If you are struggling with this, revisit your identification of the author's potential audience,
and refer to this audience by name.
   We, along with our past students, compiled a list of words that are most often too broad to use in a university-level
essay, named the Control-F List, opens new window. When reviewing your thesis, and your essay, you should use the
"Find" function in your word processor (i.e. press Ctrl-F) and search for words like "society" and "people." Often when you
use words on the Ctrl-F list, you are using the broad term when you actually mean something far more specific. Authors
are rarely discussing a group as broad as "people" but are likely focused on a more specific set of individuals--like, "female
first-year university students in Canada," for example. It is extremely useful to get in the habit of saying what you actually
mean and using specific and precise language. Using the Ctrl-F list of broad words makes sure that you are analyzing
the specific topic and argument that the author is discussing. If you are struggling with the Ctrl-F list, go back to the
original text. Instead of using the generic term "society," identify the specific group of people the author is addressing
or examining. Instead of using the generic term "technology," identify the specific hardware or software the author is
discussing.

                                                                                                  Revising Towards A Second Draft of Your Two-Storey Thesis | 64

Now that we understand what makes a thesis statement strong, the following Video 3.1 walks through the differences
between a strong and weak two storey thesis using "The Plot to Privatize Common Knowledge" by David Bollier. It would
be useful for you to have the two storey thesis statement you wrote for Chapter 2 beside you so that you can reconsider
your own writing as you follow along.

compare in terms of specificity and complexity?

   Example

     Writing an argumentative essay aimed at university students as readers, Michael Welsh in "Kids Around the World
     Just Want to Hang Out" compares the responses given by two separate groups of high school students from

65 | Watch This!
Stockholm, Sweden and Keene, New Hampshire who were surveyed about "their preferences and visions for their
cities." Welsh uses this comparison to convey a distressing reality he hopes his American readers will be motivated
to address: while both groups of students seemed to have the same hopes and visions for a greener, cleaner
future for their cities, the students of Keene displayed considerably less vision than their Stockholm counterparts,
"limited expectations" of their government's ability or interested to help them attain their goals, and a worrying
reliance on commercial companies to provide them the accessible, common, and entertaining spaces they desire.

                                                                                                                                                                Watch This! | 66
Your Turn!

   Activity

     Now that you have watched Video 3.1 and looked at our A-Level thesis statement, you are going to revise the thesis
     statement that you wrote in response to "Kids Around the World Just Want to Hang Out" in Chapter 2. Begin by
     writing two sentences that outline the strengths of your thesis. Follow this with two sentences explaining what
     you would like to improve in a second draft of this thesis. Using these reflections, return to your original thesis
     and rewrite the first and second storey. This is the second draft of your thesis statement.

67 | Your Turn!
Adding the Third Storey

Now that you have built, evaluated, and revised your two-storey thesis, it time to complete your university-level close
reading thesis statement by adding a third storey. If the first storey is the bedrock on which you establish the author's
audience, genre, and best pieces of evidence, and the second storey is where you identify the aspects of the author's
complex argument you intend to analyze, then the third storey expands the scope to consider the larger ramifications or
consequences of your reading of the author's complex argument. The third storey is intended to relate the second storey
to the big picture or explain its larger significance.

   Remember the focus of the first two storeys. The first storey picks the best two pieces of evidence from the original
text. The second storey proposes your analysis of the author's argument. The third storey should expand to consider the
original text's argument as a whole and the larger world of the author's audience. Keep in mind that your thesis will likely
be different than your classmate's: each of you will choose slightly different evidence and audiences, leading to different
proposed analyses. Therefore, it follows that your third storey will be unique to you and your interpretation of the text.
The key is that your third storey should follow logically from your first two storeys and expand the scope of your close
reading to consider the breadth of the author's complex argument and the significance of your analysis.

                                                                                                                                                     Adding the Third Storey | 68
An Example Third Storey

An Example Third Storey

Let's revisit "The Ultimate Communications App" from Chapter 1. After careful reading of the text, and based on the
evidence we gathered, we might identify the last two paragraphs as the central paragraphs to the author's complex
argument:

   Example

     This is probably the basis for the evolution of different languages (see "Tower of Babel"). If we go back far enough
     in time, all of us living today have a common history, but over thousands of years different peoples occupying
     different places have come to conflict and cooperation with each other.
     Each of us has our humanity and human origins in common with everyone else alive today. Since then, we may
     have got here in different ways, but we all share the present time in common. We, in fact, share this age in
     common with the Earth's biosphere and all its manifest diversity.

First, let's choose an audience that the author is addressing. Again, there can be more than one potential audience for a
text. To make things simple here, we will look at this essay as if it were written for first-year university students based
on the language used, its genre (essay on a blog) and the particular argument it is making. However, be careful: you, as a
reader are not always the intended audience and when identifying an intended audience you should reflect on the tone,
language and argument in the author's essay.

   Then we can focus in on the contrasts of "cooperation" and "conflict" and the repetition of the word "common" as the
two best pieces of evidence. When pointing to the words in the text, remember they are not your words, so you must
cite them correctly as the author's. If you need a refresher on in-text citation, you can read more in Chapter 13. We then
follow with the controversial claim of our two-storey thesis statement:

   Example

     FIRST STOREY: In his essay "The Ultimate Communications App," Charles Justice writes for an audience of first-
     year university students in Canada. He uses the contrast of "cooperation" and "conflict" (para. 11) in combination
     with the repetition of the word "common" (para. 12) in closing his argument.

69 | An Example Third Storey
   Example

     SECOND STOREY: Justice is arguing that while humans have become distanced into "occupying different places"
     (para. 11) by technological, agricultural and domestication evolution, it is the shared history of humanity growing
     from the same original roots of collective language construction that unites every modern person to their human
     counterparts around the globe.

When adding a third storey to this two-storey thesis, you must consider the logical extensions of this argument as they
relate to the original text as a whole. In general, when developing your third storey, you might ask:

   Is the author offering a solution to a problem raised earlier in the text?
   Is the author warning of specific further consequences that will arise from a problem raised earlier in the text?
   What does the author want their reader to leave the text thinking or doing?
One danger at this stage is getting too ambitious and trying to make a broader or more general claim than you can
substantiate. For example, a third storey such as "Justice therefore argues we should all get along because we all share
the same human history" is a sweeping generalization and far too simplistic. Similarly, you must guard against adding
a third storey such as "Justice tells us that we should destroy all technology, like apps, and go back to the old ways of
communicating because they united everyone" because such a claim is not grounded in evidence from the text.
   Your third storey must follow logically from your first two storeys but it cannot stray outside of the focused purpose
of a close reading: analyzing the author's complex argument. You should be returning to the text itself, and perhaps make
use of additional pieces of evidence, to help you explain the larger argument the author is making. While your goal is
not to explain every potential argument in the text, in the third storey you should be explaining the importance of the
argument that emerges from the first and second storeys of your thesis.
   Watch Video 3.2: Adding a Third Storey to see how we can add third storey to the above two-storey thesis.

                                                                                                                                                    An Example Third Storey | 70

Putting it all Together

Putting it all together, we now have an effective three-storey thesis in response to "The Ultimate Communications App."

   Example

     FIRST STOREY: Charles Justice in his essay "The Ultimate Communications App" writes for an audience of first-
     year university students in Canada. He uses the contrast of "cooperation" and "conflict" (para. 11) in combination
     with the repetition of the word "common" (para. 12) in closing his argument.
     SECOND STOREY: Justice is arguing that while humans have become distanced into "occupying different places"
     (para. 11) to technological, agricultural and domestication evolution, it is the shared historical fact that humanity
     grew from the same original roots of collective language construction that unites every modern person to their
     human counterparts around the globe.
     THIRD STOREY: After Justice defines common as "a level-playing field" (para. 6), the author concludes with a call
     to arms encouraging humans to understand their ethical responsibility to each other, and to "share" (para. 12) the
     concerns of a globalized human population in "Earth's biosphere" (para. 12).
This full three-storey thesis expands on the second storey to identify the author's call to action--what he wishes his
readers to do after reading the text-- and offers further evidence from the text to support the larger concluding goal of
Charles Justice's "The Ultimate Communications App."

                                                                                                                                                         Putting it all Together | 72
Your Turn!

Return to the diagnostic essay that you wrote and self-evaluated in response to "The Plot to Privatize Common
Knowledge" in the introduction to this textbook.

   Activity

     First, following the steps detailed below, revise your diagnostic essay into a two-storey thesis focusing on the
     components laid out and reaffirmed throughout this chapter.
     First storey: Identify author's audience and genre and point to the best two pieces of evidence from the text.
     Second storey: Use the components of the first storey to focus your proposed analysis of the author's complex
     argument. How is the author trying to convince his audience to consider his perspective?
     Now that we have built a two-storey thesis, we are ready to build a third storey. Considering what you believe to
     be the larger scope of the essay, answer the following questions.

          Is the author arguing that something must be done? Why?
          Is the author offering a solution to a problem raised earlier in the text?
          Is the author warning of specific further consequences that will arise from a problem raised earlier in the

             text?
          What does the author want the reader to think or do after reading the text?
     Now add a third storey to your own thesis. Use other pieces of evidence from the text to support that third
     storey. Remember that your third storey should not repeat the second storey but rather add to it. The third storey
     expands the scope of the argument to consider the complete text and the author's larger purpose.

Re-read the essay "The Plot to Privatize Common Knowledge" to see how your thesis tracks through the essay as a whole.
Re-evaluate evidence and see if your first choices are still the best choices. Think of your thesis as a proposal for the
analysis you will conduct in the rest of your essay; when you re-read the original text, how well does your proposal stand
up?

   As an example, here is a two-storey thesis, based on our observational paragraph from Chapter 1 on "The Plot to
Privatize Common Knowledge":

   In "The Plot to Privatize Common Knowledge" David Bollier writes to an audience of adult readers interested in the
applications of copyright law. He examines the perceived threat to "fundamental knowledge" and the "common good"
posed by contemporary corporations who are converting property rights and patenting claims into "crude, anti-social
instruments of control and avarice." He uses this examination as a warning to his readers that such "over-patenting," if
continued unchecked, will result in much of what has been previously considered the shared and accumulated wisdom of
humanity becoming "off limits" to the average citizen.

The Full Three-Storey Thesis

Here is our full three-storey thesis built upon the two-storey thesis we wrote in response to "The Plot to Privatize
Common Knowledge."

   FIRST STOREY:

   Example

     In "The Plot to Privatize Common Knowledge" David Bollier examines the perceived threat to "fundamental
     knowledge" and the "common good" posed by contemporary corporations who are converting property rights and
     patenting claims into "crude, anti-social instruments of control and avarice."

SECOND STOREY:

   Example

     He uses this examination as a warning to his readers that such "over-patenting," if continued unchecked, will
     result in much of what has been previously considered the shared and accumulated wisdom of humanity
     becoming "off limits" to the average citizen.

THIRD STOREY:

   Example

     The results of this knowledge becoming "off limits," Bollier argues, is that the lack of public "fundamental
     knowledge" strangles the potential leaps forward "that are essential to creativity and good research" in advancing
     technological or scientific fields and will ultimately greatly slow humanistic progress towards improving the lives
     of the global population.

Additional Practice

You wrote and revised a two-storey thesis statement to "Kids Around the World Just Want to Hang Out" by Michael
Welsh. Compare it to the sample A-level two-storey thesis below:

   Example

     In "Kids Around the World Just Want to Hang Out," Michael Welsh compares the responses given by two separate
     groups of high school students from Stockholm, Sweden, and Keene, New Hampshire, who were surveyed about
     "their preferences and visions for their cities." Welsh uses this comparison to convey a distressing reality he hopes
     his American readers will be motivated to address: while both groups of students seemed to have the same hopes
     and visions for a greener, cleaner future for their cities, the students of Keene displayed considerably less vision
     than their Stockholm counterparts, "limited expectations" of their government's ability or interested to help them
     attain their goals, and a worrying reliance on commercial companies to provide them the accessible, common,
     and entertaining spaces they desire.
Now that you have a revised two-storey thesis statement from earlier in this chapter in response to "Kids Around the
World Just Want to Hang Out," re-read the essay and add a third storey. You can never practice enough!

                                                                                                                                                             Additional Practice | 76

In this chapter students will learn the basics of constructing a close reading essay and begin the early stages of turning
the three-storey thesis generated in the previous chapter into an essay skeleton. This will prepare them for the next
chapter, which asks them to build body paragraphs from this skeleton.

81 | Chapter Overview
Editing the Three-Storey Thesis

As we discussed in our previous chapter, spending the time revising your thesis statement is as crucial as writing your
initial draft. The basic components of your thesis include:

   An identification of the possible intended audience of the article being analyzed,
   The specific focused portion(s) of the text you've chosen to analyze,
   The best pieces of evidence from that specific portion(s) of the text,
   A proposed analysis of the author's complex argument.
As you review the three-storey thesis you wrote at the end of Chapter 3, keep these components in mind and evaluate
each piece of the argument separately. Once you have isolated and evaluated each of the components separately, then
re-read your thesis to consider how well they fit together. Do not try to do everything at once. Rather, give yourself
individual tasks for each revision pass and stay granular in your approach.
   In this particular stage of revision, pay special attention to the third storey that we added at the end of Chapter 3,
keeping in mind these specific questions:
   Is the author arguing that something must be done? Why?
   Is the author offering a solution to a problem raised earlier in the text?
   Is the author warning of specific further consequences that will arise from a problem raised earlier in the text?
   What does the author want their reader to leave the text thinking and/or doing?
Before you do the self-evaluation below, re-read your thesis and label each of your three storeys clearly in the margins.
You want to see plainly which sentences and thoughts belong to which part of your argument. Now that you have read
and re-read your three-storey thesis, let's do another self-evaluation.

                                                                                                                                          Editing the Three-Storey Thesis | 82

Follow along with Video 4.1 as we evaluate the example three-storey thesis that we generated at the end of Chapter 3.

   Example

     FIRST STOREY: Speaking to an audience of first year university students in Canada, Charles Justice in "The
     Ultimate Communications App" utilizes the contrast of "cooperation" and "conflict" (para. 11) in combination with
     the repetition of the word "common" (para. 12) in closing his argument.
     SECOND STOREY: From this, Justice is arguing that while humans have become distanced into "occupying
     different places" (para. 11) through technological, agricultural and domestication evolution, it is the shared
     historical fact that humanity grew from the same original roots of collective language construction that unites
     every modern person to their human counterparts around the globe.
     THIRD STOREY: Considering Justice definition of the common as "a level-playing field" (para. 6), Justice
     concludes with a call to arms extolling humans to grasp their ethical responsibility not only to each other but to
     "share" (para. 12) in the present concerns of a globalized population of humans in the entire "Earth's biosphere"
     (para. 12).

   Activity

     Now that you have completed your self evaluation, do another revision of your three storey thesis wherein you
     address the issues that you have flagged thus far while also paying special attention to the compact and complex
     language that you should be using. After you have finished rewriting your thesis, read it aloud to check for any
     awkward phrasing that prohibits the logical flow of your argument.

     While performing your evaluation of your three-storey thesis, you likely noticed that some of the questions were
     repetitions from the evaluation you did in response to your two-storey thesis in Chapter 2. That's fine! It is good
     to revisit what you have written, especially given that you have likely been making small changes as you read and
     re-write. You also likely noticed that there were a number of new questions added; in particular, there is a whole
     section dedicated to your third storey.

     Editing the Third Storey
     Now that we are getting ready to edit and rewrite our three-storey thesis, use these questions to guide your
     evaluation. In particular, focus on whether your third storey is adding to the complex argument established in
     your second storey. If the third storey repeats the second storey, it is likely due to one of two problems:

         1. The second storey is not complex enough and so the writer uses the third storey to make it more complex.
             Instead, the second storey needs to be made more complex and then the third storey needs to be added
             on top.

        2. The writer is not addressing the potential consequences and results of the analysis proposed in the second
             storey.

     As you rewrite your thesis statement make sure that the third storey extends the author's argument to consider
     the large scope and scale of that initial argument. This will likely mean returning to the text and adding another
     key word or phrase to help you arrive at at the expanded scope of the author's complex argument. Return to
     your initial list of observations and see if there is not another piece of specific evidence that can help you better
     address the potential consequences and results of the analysis proposed in the second storey.

     Lastly, ensure that your third storey follows and extends logically from the second storey. The third storey should
     not be going off in a whole new direction. Instead, think of the third storey as taking the first two storeys and
     opening them up to the larger scope of the author's argument. Remember that you are addressing the author's
     complex argument all the way through and what is present in the first two storey should still be present in the
     last storey.

                                                                                                                                                                        Your Turn! | 88
Editing and Rewriting for Precise and Muscular
Language

Connotative Value

Because you have completed a number of edits, it is likely that the components of your thesis are already quite strong.
Now you need to focus on being as precise as possible with your language, so that your analysis of the author's argument
is as clear and sophisticated as possible.

   Revisiting the evidence you've chosen in storey one is a good place to start. Ideally you want to choose words and small
phrases that are rich in connotative value. That is, language that can mean multiple complex things at once which then
also fit into the rich language around it. For example, identifying and focusing in on the fact that an author uses the term
"Facebook" six times is not that useful as the word "Facebook" is more informational and less descriptive or argumentative
and therefore does not have much in terms of connotative value. However, in "The Plot to Privatize Common Knowledge"
from the first chapter, the word "common" is very rich and deserves much more attention: by definition is carries the
meaning of sharing something (i.e. having something in common), as well as being meaning something that is regularly
occurring. These two meanings then get added to the author's definition of what a Commons is (i.e public and shared
property). Look at all the work that single word is doing! Therefore, when identifying the best pieces of evidence as the
base for your analysis of the author's complex argument, look for the language that is the richest in connotative value.

Ctrl-F List

As discussed in Chapter 3, the Ctrl-F is a tool meant to help you identify broad words so that you can chose more specific
vocabulary in your revision process. When applying the Control-F List, opens new window to your thesis, the intent is
not to say that you should never use words like "society" or "people," but rather to say that those words are so ambiguous
and general that they retain very little value. Instead, you should say what you mean! Instead of "society" or "people," you
mean "2017 first year university students in Canada." Look back through your thesis and ensure that you are replacing
those broad terms with language that speaks more directly to the author's audience and complex argument.

Verbs

A verb is an action word and most often the heavy lifter of any sentence you will write. As such, a strong verb will do the
work of three simple words and will provide your reader with a more compact and clear version of the argument you are
recreating. For example, think of the difference between the verbs "move" "run" and "gallop."

   "Move" as a verb is far too broad and simple. What part of the body is being moved? In what manner?
   "Run" is better as it implies a speed and a specific action with a body but is still generic.
   "Gallop" is much better as it carries with it the connotations of a horse and gives the imagery of that specific

      locomotion. As well, using that word also brings up the connotations of animalistic movement. Instead of needing an

89 | Editing and Rewriting for Precise and Muscular Language
adverb, as "move" and "run" likely would, "gallop" is a word that is doing a lot of work on its own.
                                                                                               Editing and Rewriting for Precise and Muscular Language | 90
Your Turn!

   Activity

     To begin, go back into your thesis and literally circle all of your verbs. Once you have done this, ask yourself
     whether any of these verbs can be elevated to another verb that is more complex and richer in connotative
     value. As an example, look for the verb "use." Think of what might be meant by "using" a smartphone. "Using" a
     smartphone ranges from texting a friend, to playing a videogame, to browsing the Internet, to hammering a nail.
     All of these are "uses" for a smartphone. Instead, an author would speak to the specific activity that is taking place
     on that cellphone.
     As you replace some of the weaker verbs, try not to think of this as a synonym-finding activity. You are not simply
     right-clicking and finding a longer word. Rather, you should be looking for verbs that carry more weight and point
     towards the argument that the author is making. You should consider, in a simple way, whether the verb you have
     chosen implies a negative or positive attitude. Does the negative or positive attitude implied by the verb match
     the negative or positive attitude that is within the author's complex argument?

sophisticated as possible.

                                                   and having to backtrack. From Pixabay.

Congratulations! Now you are ready to begin structuring your essay. Good news: you already have a logical blueprint in
hand in the form of your three-storey thesis.

   The next step in the pre-writing phase is creating a roadmap or outline for your essay. Taking the time to review your
thesis statement and imagine paragraph-by-paragraph how your essay will flow before you start writing it will help in
your revision process in that it will prevent you from writing parts of your essay and then having to delete them because
they do not fit logically. You will also find that having a roadmap ahead of time will make the actual writing of your essay
faster as you will know what is in each paragraph ahead of time.

   A paragraph is a full and complete unit of thought within your essay. When you begin a new paragraph, you are
signalling that you've completed that idea or point and are moving on to a new idea or point . The simplest way to create
an essay outline is to look at your thesis statement, break it into its components, and then give each component its own
paragraph by walking through each of the three storeys in sequence. Keep in mind that some components of an argument
are more complex than others and may need two (or three or five) paragraphs to complete. But for now we'll keep it simple
and break our thesis into its basic parts. Let's begin with our previous thesis statement, and then go storey by storey.

93 | The Three-Storey Thesis as a Roadmap
Introduction

We will be discussing more complex essay introductions in Part II when we learn about writing essays about our
own arguments, but for a close reading, your thesis should be as compact and clear as possible. When drafting your
introduction, the key thing to remember is that you do not need to examine every aspect of the author's whole argument
right away. Your introduction will be comprised of your thesis that is specific and gives your reader the basic signposts
of audience, genre, evidence (first storey) and complex argument (second storey) and your proposed unique reading of
the article (third storey). While a close reading introduction should include your full three-storey thesis this does not
mean the validity of your argument is a given or that your argument is concluded before it even begins. Your analytical
argument must be supported by logically unpacking all its components in a thoughtful process. This will force you to walk
your reader through the components of your claim and the supporting evidence until it culminates in your conclusion
with your final interpretive statement on the author's complex argument.

                                                                                                                                                                     Introduction | 94
First Storey

   Example

     In his essay "The Ultimate Communications App," Charles Justice writes for an audience of first-year university
     students in Canada. He uses the contrast of "cooperation" and "conflict" (para. 11) in combination with the
     repetition of the word "common" (para. 12) in closing his argument.
Our first step is to take apart our first storey and describe the evidence for our forthcoming argument.

       Remember: an argument without evidence is an opinion!
Underline each element of the storey to identify how many paragraphs you will need. Let's assume that we need to
dedicate a paragraph to each of our pieces of evidence.

   Activity

     Paragraph 1: quote and unpack the contrast of "cooperation" and "conflict" (para. 11)
     Paragraph 2: quote and unpack the repetition of the word "common"
Now we have the first two paragraphs of our essay! In the next chapter, we will discuss the specifics of those paragraphs
but for now, know that you need a paragraph for each of your two pieces of evidence.

95 | First Storey
Second storey

   Example

     From this, Justice is arguing that while humans have become distanced into "occupying different places" (para.
     11) to technological, agricultural and domestication evolution, it is the shared historical fact that humanity grew
     from the same original roots of collective language construction that unites every modern person to their human
     counterparts around the globe.

Now that you have a solid foundation of evidence, you are ready to propose our analysis of the author's complex
argument. In the second storey part of our essay you want to explain how the two pieces of evidence from the first
storey overlap and how that overlap produces the author's complex argument. Look again at your second storey to see
the elements that deserve their own paragraph. Underline each part of the complex argument in the second storey so
you know what deserves its own paragraph.

   Activity

     Paragraph 3: Overlap the contrast of "cooperation" and "conflict" with the repetition of the word "common" by
     explaining what the two pieces of evidence have to do with each other? How are they similar? How do they
     contrast with each other?
     Paragraph 4: Explain how those two pieces of evidence lead to Justice's argument that "humans have become
     distanced into `occupying different places' (para. 11) to technological, agricultural and domestication evolution"
     Paragraph 5: Explain how those evolutions are offset by the fact that "it is the shared historical fact that humanity
     grew from the same original roots of collective language construction that unites every modern person to their
     human counterparts around the globe."

Now we have linked our evidence from the first storey into the complex argument that the author is making. Notice
that each paragraph is rooted in the original text. Remember: the purpose of a close reading is to reconstruct the
author's argument. Every paragraph must return to the author's argument and present a new complex component of that
argument.

                                                                                                                                                                   Second storey | 96
Third Storey

   Example

     After Justice defines common as "a level-playing field" (para. 6), the author concludes with a call to arms
     encouraging humans to understand their ethical responsibility to each other, and to "share" (para. 12) the
     concerns of a globalized human population in "Earth's biosphere" (para. 12).
Now we are ready to add the third storey! Again, take the third storey of your thesis and give each part its own paragraph.
Underline each part of the third storey so that you know what deserves its own paragraph.

   Activity

     Paragraph 6: Explain what Justice means by "a level-playing field" (para. 6) and how it links to " the same original
     roots of collective language construction that unites every modern person to their human counterparts around
     the globe."
     Paragraph 7: Explain how this level playing field leads to "a call to arms encouraging humans to understand their
     ethical responsibility to each other, and to "share" (para. 12) the concerns of a globalized human population in
     "Earth's biosphere" (para. 12).
Again, notice how each paragraph includes specific words and phrases from Justice's work while adding something new
to that thought.

Conclusion

In Part II, we will discuss conclusions in more depth. For a close reading you must culminate the reading you proposed
in your three-storey thesis. While there is a certain satisfaction that comes from analyzing the author's argument and
guiding your analysis logically to the end of an essay, this does not mean that you copy and paste your thesis from the
introduction into the conclusion. You cannot simply close by return at this level. You need to do more than restate
your introduction in your conclusion. Your conclusion should be a reconsideration and culmination of the reading you
proposed in your thesis presented for a final time in the light of the analysis you conducted in your body paragraphs.
What have you and your readers learned from your analysis of the text?

   Your essay outline now looks like this:

   Example

     Introduction: First two storeys of your three-storey thesis
     Paragraph 1 (First Storey): Quote and unpack the contrast of "cooperation" and "conflict" (para. 11)
     Paragraph 2 (First Storey): Quote and unpack the repetition of the word "common"
     Paragraph 3 (Second Storey): Overlap the contrast of "cooperation" and "conflict" with the repetition of the word
     "common" by answering what the two pieces of evidence have to do with each other? How are they similar?
     Contrasting?
     Paragraph 4 (Second Storey): Explain how those two pieces of evidence lead to Justice's argument that "humans
     have become distanced into "occupying different places" (para. 11) to technological, agricultural and domestication
     evolution"
     Paragraph 5 (Second Storey): Explain how those evolutions are offset by the fact that "it is the shared historical
     fact that humanity grew from the same original roots of collective language construction that unites every
     modern person to their human counterparts around the globe."
     Paragraph 6 (Third Storey): Explain what Justice means by "a level-playing field" (para. 6) and how it links to
     " the same original roots of collective language construction that unites every modern person to their human
     counterparts around the globe."
     Paragraph 7 (Third Storey): Explain how this level playing field leads to "a call to arms encouraging humans to
     understand their ethical responsibility to each other, and to "share" (para. 12) the concerns of a globalized human
     population in "Earth's biosphere" (para. 12).

105 | Chapter Overview
Writing the Essay

Now you have arrived, finally and purposefully, to the writing of your interpretive, analytical essay. You have read the
article you are analyzing several times, you have gathered information that you have decided is interesting and relevant,
you have analyzed the article's many aspects, you have crafted a thesis that encapsulates your interpretive claim and
analytical purpose, and you have plotted your potential course in your essay outline.

   The actual writing of the essay is challenging, but it is a task that has been made a little easier by your thorough analysis
and preparation. The writing should still be a little difficult, however, as you must continue to question and interpret,
even as you draft and revise the essay. It would be a mistake at this point to think the analytical process is over and you
need now just plug your observations into your outlined paragraph structure. Your essay is still very much a living and
evolving thing and you must remain active and engaged as you create your final product. Keeping in mind your goal to
be an active analyst rather than a passive conduit, it is important to complete this checklist before you begin writing to
make sure you have equipped yourself with the tools you need to complete this task:

   Taking Measure

     Take a survey of your immediate area as you prepare to write your essay, then answer the following questions:
     Do you have a hard copy of your three-storey thesis at hand?
     Y/N
     Do you have a hard copy of your outline ready for easy access and alteration?
     Y/N
     Do you have a hard copy of the article you are analyzing, complete with your annotations and marginal
     comments?
     Y/N
     Do you still have hard copies of the lists you compiled during your initial and subsequent analyses of the article?
     Y/N
     Do you have a more refined list in hard copy of what you believe to be the most important and interesting
     moments from the text?
     Y/N

If you replied "No" to any of these questions, you are not prepared to begin writing your essay. Just because you have
done all this work does not mean the sentences will now just flow from your brain onto the page. It is important that you
have your accumulated claims and observations at hand as you work through the final stages of producing your essay. At
many times during this process you will find yourself returning to the notes and lists and claims you have made. You may
even find yourself questioning your earlier work, adding to it, or revising it. This is fine. Better to be questioning what you
have written than to disengage your brain and start simply plotting points on the page.

   The thesis you produced through your work in the previous chapters is still in many ways a working thesis that will be
further complicated as you bring it more closely into contact with textual evidence. For this reason, it is vital that you do

                                                                                                                                                             Writing the Essay | 106
not yet place your thesis into your essay. Better to have it exist for now on a piece of paper separate from your essay so
you can reflect upon it as you write your body paragraphs. Through this repeated obvious contact between your thesis
and the textual evidence, you will be able to produce topic sentences for each of your body paragraphs.

   As for the annotated version of the original article and your lists of observations, these never lose their crucial
importance to your writing process. Remember, you compiled more information than you would be able to include in
your essay. Now you can select from your best ideas rather than struggle to find points and evidence as you write. The
outline you have planned is an important tool, but you may need to alter your roadmap as you write your essay. You may
even need to select different evidence from what you had planned on using. So, keep all your annotations, lists and notes
handy. You don't want to lose creative momentum while searching for new material.

   If you can now answer "Yes" to each of the questions in the checklist above, you are ready to begin writing.

Big Beefy Building Blocks: Filling Those Body
Paragraphs

Let's first watch Video 5.1 on what body paragraphs are supposed to do.

        A YouTube element has been excluded from this version of the text. You can view it online here:
        https://pressbooks.library.ryerson.ca/writehere/?p=486

Returning to the metaphor of the three-storey thesis, your body paragraphs are the steps you use to take your reader
from the claim you make in your introduction (the first storey), through your focused analysis of textual specifics (the
second storey), and into your perceived importance of your reading which you aim to culminate in your conclusion (the
third storey). As such, your body paragraphs need to lead your audience through your reading of the article in a way that
delineates clearly the validity of your claims and the logic of your conclusion. This is where our evolving thesis and the
outline we created in Chapter 4 are so important.

   For the purposes of demonstration, we will be using the thesis and outline we developed for our analysis of Charles
Justice's "The Ultimate Communications App." Your task in this chapter will be to develop and use a thesis and outline for
an analysis of Michael Welsh's "Kids Around the World Just Want to Hang Out." Pay attention to how we create our essay,
then develop your own body paragraphs for your analysis of Welsh's article which you will bring to class. You should also
be developing your thesis and outline for your midterm essay so you will be ready to workshop elements of your essay in
class.

   In developing our first and second storeys--our focus and claim--for our thesis on "The Ultimate Communications App,"
                                                                                                       Big Beefy Building Blocks: Filling Those Body Paragraphs | 108
we built a purposeful analytical statement around the textual element we perceived to be the most important, namely,
Justice's contrast of "cooperation" and "conflict" in conjunction with repetitions of "common." This contrast demonstrates
that while language is the tool we often use to express our differences and dissatisfaction, it is also the manifestation of
a common desire to share and connect. Here is our three-storey thesis with our first storey italicized and our second
storey bolded:

   Example

     Speaking to an audience of first year university students in Canada, Charles Justice in "The Ultimate
     Communications App" utilizes the contrast of "cooperation" and "conflict" in combination with the repetition of the
     word "common" in closing his argument. From this, Justice is arguing that while humans have become distanced
     into "occupying different places" through technological, agricultural and domestication evolution, it is the
     shared historical fact that humanity grew from the same original roots of collective language construction that
     unites every modern person to their human counterparts around the globe. Considering Justice definition of
     the common as "a level-playing field," Justice concludes with a call to arms extolling humans to grasp their ethical
     responsibility not only to each other but to "share" in the present concerns of a globalized population of humans
     in the entire "Earth's biosphere."

109 | Big Beefy Building Blocks: Filling Those Body Paragraphs
Keep Your Thesis Close

It is important to have a hardcopy of your thesis handy so that you can always remind yourself of your claim as you
determine the purpose and structure of your body paragraphs. As you imagine what your first body paragraph will look
like, it is worth remembering one of the central notions we discussed in Chapter 2.

   Example

     You should look to begin your analysis with an examination of what you believe to be the most important and
     revealing piece (or pieces) of evidence. Was there a moment in the text or a key repetition or consistent contrast
     that confirmed for you what this text was really about? Begin with that. Using that strong base you can move to
     your second and third strongest pieces of evidence. Continue with all your evidence, building your analysis until
     you reach your final points which should examine the less-than-obvious supportive aspects of the text. A close
     reading doesn't just rely on one or two obvious statements that prove you are "right." Imagine that you are luring
     your reader into your understanding of the text: "Do you agree with my reading of the first piece of evidence? The
     second? The third? Well, then perhaps you would like to consider what I have to say about this part of the text
     that you may be surprised to find in this argument."

We have identified as central to Justice's argument his examination of language as a human invention that drives debates
and divisions but is more importantly developed out of a desire to connect. Our first body paragraphs will analyze aspects
of the text that establish this "common" tendency to connect. This is the approach we have sketched in our essay outline.

   Example

     Paragraph 1 (First Storey): Quote and unpack the contrast of "cooperation" and "conflict."
     Paragraph 2 (First Storey): Quote and unpack the repetition of the word "common."
     Paragraph 3 (Second Storey): Overlap the contrast of "cooperation" and "conflict" with the repetition of the word
     "common" by answering what the two pieces of evidence have to do with each other? How are they similar?
     Contrasting?
     Paragraph 4 (Second Storey): Explain how those two pieces of evidence lead to Justice's argument that "humans
     have become distanced into "occupying different places" through technological, agricultural and domestication
     evolution."
     Paragraph 5 (Second Storey): Explain how those evolutions are offset by the fact that "it is the shared historical
     fact that humanity grew from the same original roots of collective language construction that unites every
     modern person to their human counterparts around the globe."

                                                                                                                                                      Keep Your Thesis Close | 110
Keeping your outline and three-storey thesis always in view, work through your lists and annotations to find the specific
textual elements you will use in each of your purposeful, analytical paragraphs.

   Watch Video 5.2 to see how we create the first five paragraphs of our analytical essay on Justice's "The Ultimate
Communication App".

111 | Keep Your Thesis Close
Body Paragraphs

So, your essay-in-progress currently has five full body paragraphs. Remember, you do not want to include your thesis in
the essay proper just yet. Better to keep the thesis and the body paragraphs separate for easy reference and comparison.
Remember that your thesis is still evolving and may change slightly as the writing of body paragraphs forces you to
confront specific aspects of the text under analysis. Here's how the essay looks so far (with some explanatory notes
detailing how we arrived at each paragraph):

Body Paragraph I

   Example

     In his coy opening paragraphs, Justice describes the many uses of language as if they are features of a "new
     communications app" he "just invented." Justice notes how language use "facilitates an expanding network of
     people" and "opens up incredible possibilities for creativity and cooperation." Such clever itemization of language's
     many features enables Justice to establish language as a tool that has at its root the human desire to connect and
     work together. Though centuries of migration and conflict may have turned the world into a "Tower of Babel"
     in which populations are divided by different languages, "all of us living today have a common history" in which
     language was developed first and foremost to create community.

       Please note: As we noted in our essay outline, a good entry point into our analysis of Justice's article is to
       quote and unpack the contrast of "cooperation" and "conflict." Returning to our notes and our annotated
       version of Justice's essay, we see how language is described as a point of conflict, a "Tower of Babel," but also,
       conversely, as a tool that undeniably "facilitates an expanding network of people" and encourages "creativity
       and cooperation." Looking toward the explication in our second paragraph of Justice's repetition of
       "commons," we end this first body paragraph with a transitional comment on "community."

                                                                                                                                                               Body Paragraphs | 112
Body Paragraphs

Body Paragraph 2

   Example

     Justice stresses that such a created community is often defined by "a commons," which he defines thusly: "A
     commons is a level-playing field. Everybody gets to breathe air, and we have that in common with most other
     species." He establishes language as one of the first such commons, "available to everyone free" and a "common
     way for us to share information and create enduring knowledge." Thus, whether it is being used to foster
     cooperation or perpetuate conflict, language has always been a commons accessible to all members who wish to
     contribute meaningfully to their community.

       Please note: To establish further our particular reading of Justice's article, we now must now quote and
       unpack the repetition of the word "common" and demonstrate how this repetition is connected inextricably
       with Justice's contrast of "cooperation" and "conflict." Looking at our annotated version of the text, we see
       that the word "common" or "commons" is used 18 times by Justice. Referring to our lists, we see we have
       listed "commons" as a "New Word"; we have paired it with "cooperation" in our lists of "Similar Words"; and
       we have contrasted it with "private space" in our "Contrasts." We can see through these repetitions that
       explaining the importance of "a commons" and then establishing language as one of the first examples of "a
       commons" is a driving force in Justice's argument.

113 | Body Paragraphs
Body Paragraphs

Body Paragraph 3

   Example

     Justice defines language as "a method of communication that is available to virtually all humans to use"; a
     "common property, available to everyone free." Justice thereby establishes language as a common human right
     and desire--an inherent need that is obvious even in the simple naming and describing of a "proto-language" like
     "Me Tarzan, you Jane": "Once you begin to share information, you are creating a common space of understanding
     amongst you and your fellow speakers." Even if that common space is used to express difference--Tarzan is not
     Jane--it is still a vital tool that ensures even those who do not share opinions, backgrounds, or identities can still
     share ideas.

       Please note: Now we have begun the analysis of the evidence upon which we developed the second storey of
       our three-storey thesis. Essentially, we will be justifying and enacting our claim here, analyzing evidence to
       demonstrate how Justice is doing what we claim he is doing. In our outline we established our goal in this
       paragraph to overlap the contrast of "cooperation" and "conflict" with the repetition of the word "common" by
       answering what the two pieces of evidence have to do with each other. We have prepared for this paragraph
       rather nicely with the concluding sentence in Paragraph 2 that first makes this connection. Now we can
       review our collected information for more evidence to analyze in this paragraph.

                                                                                                                                                               Body Paragraphs | 114
Body Paragraphs

Body Paragraph 4

   Example

     Justice notes that sometimes such differences, even when expressed, still lead to divisions that may seem
     insurmountable. "We parcel up land into properties," Justice writes, marking our divisions from one another.
     In more extreme cases, we are "separated permanently by mountains or water barriers" which seem to end
     definitively any sense or hope of unity: "because of our success in outgrowing our original environment, we
     ceased to have a common place and identity." This insurmountable division seems an unavoidable result of human
     evolution and prosperity, Justice claims--as the earliest groups of humans thrived in their shared landscape,
     "eventually, as populations grew over generations, a new band would split off." Such splits would drive groups of
     humans further afield from one another, resulting in a mutual forgetting of their "common place and identity" and
     likely the "evolution of different languages."

       Please note: You can see we have moved fully into our analysis of what this essay is really about and our
       argument about what is really at stake here. This paragraph is dedicated entirely to analyzing information
       that bolsters our claim that one of Justice's driving motives is examining how humans have become distanced
       into "occupying different places" through technological, agricultural and domestication evolution. It is vital here
       that we do not just state evidence from the essay, but that we connect all cited material directly to our
       interpretive claim. You should also note how the notion of bridging the distance between different groups of
       people is carried from the last sentence in Paragraph 3 to the first sentence in Paragraph 4.

115 | Body Paragraphs
Body Paragraphs

Body Paragraph 5

   Example

     Yet, Justice claims, even as humans mark their property or separate themselves by mountains and water, it seems
     inherent in the human creation of place that "much land is held in common in the form of parks, trackless
     wilderness, public rights of way and public spaces." Justice utilizes much natural imagery when defining "a
     commons" like language: "The sunlight that falls to Earth is common to all, plants and animals on land, fish and
     the whales in the sea." Further, Justice asserts that "here in the rain forests of the Pacific Northwest, fresh water
     is a common resource," implying, even as he invokes the human naming of a region, that this does not override
     the deeper human tendency to share resources and foster a space that is mutually beneficial.

       Please note: We have established as one of Justice's driving motives his desire to inspire his readers to
       rethink differences that may seem unavoidable, unbridgeable, and in fact fostered by seemingly natural
       human evolution. We now explain how those evolutions are offset by the fact that it is the shared historical fact
       that humanity grew from the same original roots of collective language construction that unites every modern
       person to their human counterparts around the globe. Justice employs a lot of natural imagery to ratify his
       interpretation of "a commons" like language being connected to and representative of a natural human desire
       to share.

                                                                                                                                                               Body Paragraphs | 116

essay, it is a good time to pause and reflect on the components of a successful body paragraph. You crafted an outline
that evolved from the focus and claim of your thesis and in that outline you decided what you wanted each paragraph to
do. As you can see, there is more to constructing a paragraph than restating your thesis and citing from the text. While
your purpose will always guide the shape of your essay and your actual writing may alter the planned outline slightly,
it is important to remember that there is a structure here. Each paragraph should contain a structured argument that
positions it as a supported, supportive, and connected piece of your overall argument

                                                                                        From Pixabay.

While each paragraph will look a little different and deal with a new aspect of the text,
there are some elements that a paragraph must contain if it is to be a contributing part of
a cohesive argument.

   Example

     Claim + Evidence + Warrant

When it comes to body paragraphs, especially body paragraphs in essays for introductory college and university courses,
we recommend using an abridged version of the Toulmin Method. Stephen Toulmin was an English philosopher who
created a model for the persuasive argument. For the purposes of this text, which is designed to introduce scholars just
beginning their postsecondary careers to the act of successful analytical writing, we will consider a version of the Toulmin
model that consists of Claim, Evidence, and Warrant. Each paragraph must contain an interpretive claim derived from
the original claim expressed in your thesis statement. A claim is a statement you want your reader to accept or at least
consider. To facilitate this acceptance you must provide textual support or evidence. This evidence will serve as a ground
or basis for your claim. In a close reading such as the ones we have been conducting thus far, the evidence is something
117 | It's More Than Cut and Paste: The Parts of a Paragraph
that is undeniably in the text you are analyzing. The warrant is an explanation of how the evidence supports the claim.
The warrant may be a simplistic demonstration or it may be a larger argument, but it always proves the validity and worth
of the claim as a way of reading the evidence. The warrant is a combination and interaction of the claim and the evidence
that produces your interpretation of the text. Evidence--whether it is in the form of a cited passage or a paraphrase--must
be irrefutably from the text you are analyzing. A warrant, however, is more controversial--it is something that is not
undeniably in the text, but is rather a statement and a demonstration of what you think a text is doing. It is a directive for
how you want your readers to consider the original text.

                                                                                                          It's More Than Cut and Paste: The Parts of a Paragraph | 118
Claim, Evidence and Warrant

   Body paragraphs will often begin with a claim, then cite some evidence, then               From Pixabay.
develop the warrant by reading the evidence through the claim; however, you should
not regard these three elements as immovable parts of a rigid formula of 1+1+1=3. Claim,
evidence and warrant should work together more organically than that. You will rarely
make a claim without connecting it immediately to evidence. Nor will you simply cite
evidence without reading it through the lens of your claim. Better to keep an eye to
your thesis and outline and make sure you are always reading the text the way you
want your audience to consider it. To understand exactly how this works, let's compare
our intended purpose for Paragraph 1 as detailed in our outline with the actual
Paragraph 1 as it appears in our essay. In the final version of Paragraph 1, the evidence is
bold and the claim is in italics.

   Paragraph 1 (First Storey): quote and unpack the contrast of "cooperation" and
"conflict"

Example

Body Paragraph 1:

In his coy opening paragraphs, Justice describes the many uses of language as if they are features of a "new
communications app" he "just invented." Justice notes how language use "facilitates an expanding network
of people" and "opens up incredible possibilities for creativity and cooperation." Such clever itemization of
language's many features enables Justice to establish effectively language as a human tool that has at its root the
human desire to connect and work together. Though centuries of migration and conflict may have turned the world
into a "Tower of Babel" in which populations are divided by different languages, "all of us living today have a
common history" in which language was developed first and foremost to create community.

The whole paragraph works toward our analysis that Justice is really writing about how language, so often used as a
demonstration of what divides us, is really symbolic of our common desire to work together, and how if used properly, it
can overcome any difference or distance. The whole paragraph is essentially the warrant, punctuated by the transitional
last line that claims Justice believes "language was developed first and foremost to create community." Our choice of what
evidence we use is not arbitrary and indicates our intended reading of this text. Our description of Justice's writing as
"coy" and "clever" persuades our reader toward our interpretation of the text--an assertion that what is undeniably in the
text is doing what we in fact claim it is doing.

119 | Claim, Evidence and Warrant
Topic Sentences and Transitions

In the end, you want your body paragraphs to build (like blocks) to your conclusion. Transitions are the glue that hold
these blocks together. You should work on building topic sentences that both develop and support the thesis in a logical
manner. Avoid such easy, empty transitions as "firstly," "secondly" and "finally." Your reader should be able to understand
they have been moved from one aspect of your argument to another without a tell-tale "secondly" informing them that
the first point is over and the second point is about to begin. Again, this is where keeping a close eye to your thesis and
your outline is so important. If you know where the essay is going, you can transfer your readers smoothly from the
analysis of one aspect of the text to the next with meaningful connections and statements rather than empty transitional
phrases. Witness the transition from the final sentence in Paragraph 2 into the first sentence and then the topic sentence
of Paragraph 3.

   Example

     Thus, whether it is being used to foster cooperation or perpetuate conflict, language has always been a commons
     accessible to all members who wish to contribute meaningfully to their community.
     Justice defines language as "A method of communication that is available to virtually all humans to use;" a
     "common property, available to everyone free." Justice thereby establishes language as a common human right
     and desire--an inherent need that is obvious even in the simple naming and describing of a "proto-language"
     like "Me Tarzan, you Jane..."

The bolded sentence above is the topic sentence of Paragraph 3--it is what we want this paragraph to do. The final
sentence of the previous paragraph and the opening sentence of the current paragraph work well to demonstrate that
language, whether it is used to argue or agree, is a "commons" desired by and available to everyone. Such a connected
argument solidifies our claim that Justice is establishing language as the tool that facilitates arguments but produces
understanding and community through these arguments.

                                                                                                                                        Topic Sentences and Transitions | 120
Incorporating Cited Passages into Your Own Writing

We will talk more about citation in research papers in Chapter 13. For now, when dealing with a close reading of one
article, keep in mind a few cardinal rules.

       Do not let cited passages stand alone as sentences!

Remember that you are presenting your reading of this text, so it is not enough to simply let a cited passage speak for
itself. You need to be selective in the passages you choose. Larger quotes usually do not work in short paper. You must
always be interacting with the text and demonstrating how the author continues to deliver the message you identify as
central, as we do in this excerpt from Paragraph 5.

   Example

     Justice utilizes much natural imagery when defining "a commons" like language: "The sunlight that falls to earth
     is common to all, plants and animals on land, fish and the whales in the sea." Further, Justice asserts that "Here
     in the rain forests of the Pacific Northwest, fresh water is a common resource," implying even has he invokes the
     human naming of a region, that this does not override the deeper human tendency to share resources and foster
     a space that is mutually beneficial.

Another reader may read Justice's text and NOT see what we see. It is therefore important that we not simply cite without
analyzing. We must show how the text is doing what we claim it is doing, therefore it is vital that we couch cited passages
within our declarative sentences. While paraphrasing is sometimes useful, it is best to cite and analyze in essays such
as this one so that we do not make claims about the text that cannot be supported with evidence. It is important to
remember that...

121 | Incorporating Cited Passages into Your Own Writing
The Author's Subject is Not Your Subject

In the process of analyzing an article there is often a tricky moment where the subject of the article threatens to become
indistinguishable from the subject of the analytical essay. Remember that the author's subject is not your subject; the
author's text is your subject. Maintain a critical distance and always make it clear that these are another author's claims
that you are analyzing.

       Do not present the author's claims as if they are facts!

Make a note of the language we use in this passage from Paragraph 4.

   Example

     Justice notes that sometimes such differences, even when expressed, still lead to divisions that may seem
     insurmountable. "We parcel up land into properties," Justice writes, marking our divisions from one another.
     In more extreme cases, we are "separated permanently by mountains or water barriers" which seem to end
     definitively any sense or hope of unity: "because of our success in outgrowing our original environment we
     ceased to have a common place and identity." This insurmountable division seems an unavoidable result of human
     evolution and prosperity, Justice implies--as the earliest groups of humans thrived in their shared landscape,
     "eventually, as population grew over generations, a new band would split off."

They may not seem like much, but phrases such as "Justice notes," "Justice writes," and "Justice implies" are pivotal parts
of any paragraph that incorporates cited passages. It is important to continually remind your reader and yourself that you
are analyzing another author's argument and not repeating irrefutable truths. Always be examining how the author's text
works, and use citations to examine specific aspects of the argument, not present the argument as true. Without that
angle of investigation, you will get caught summarizing an argument rather than analyzing it.

   Now let's watch how we use claim, evidence, and warrant, topic sentences, and cited passages, to create our final two
body paragraphs. Watch Video 5.3 on the inner workings of a body paragraph.

                                                                                                                             The Author's Subject is Not Your Subject | 122

Exit Strategy: Composing the Final Body Paragraphs

We have arrived at the crux of our argument, the apex of our analysis. Best now to review once again our three-storey
thesis, paying particular attention to the third storey.

   Example

     Speaking to an audience of first year university students in Canada, Charles Justice in "The Ultimate
     Communications App" utilizes the contrast of "cooperation" and "conflict" in combination with the repetition
     of the word "common" in closing his argument. From this, Justice is arguing that while humans have become
     distanced into "occupying different places" through technological, agricultural and domestication evolution, it is
     the shared historical fact that humanity grew from the same original roots of collective language construction
     that unites every modern person to their human counterparts around the globe. Reiterating his definition of
     the common as "a level-playing field," Justice concludes with a call to arms extolling humans to grasp their
     ethical responsibility not only to each other but to "share" in the present concerns of a globalized population
     of humans in the entire "Earth's biosphere."

It is also a good idea to remind ourselves of some of the questions we were asking when we developed this third storey in
Chapter 3.

   Example

     When adding a third storey to this two-storey thesis, you must consider the logical extensions of this argument
     as they relate to the original text as a whole. In general, when developing your third storey, you might ask:

          Is the author offering a solution to a problem raised earlier in the text?
          Is the author warning of specific further consequences that will arise from a problem raised earlier in the

             text?
          What does the author want their reader to leave the text thinking or doing?

In the body paragraphs that flow from this third storey, we will reach a little further and make connections that solidify
our reading of this text. We can make these leaps with confidence having established our analysis in the five body
paragraphs leading to this. As always, it is important to have our outline close at hand so we can remind ourselves of what
we need these final paragraphs to do.

                                                                                                             Exit Strategy: Composing the Final Body Paragraphs | 124
   Example

     Paragraph 6 (Third Storey): Explain what Justice means by "a level-playing field" (para. 6) and how it links to
     "the same original roots of collective language construction that unites every modern person to their human
     counterparts around the globe."
     Paragraph 7 (Third Storey): Explain how this level playing field leads to "a call to arms extolling humans to grasp
     their ethical responsibility not only to each other but to "share" in the present concerns of a globalized population
     of humans in the entire "Earth's biosphere."

Our final sentence in Paragraph 5 facilitates nicely a transition into the claims we want to make in our final body
paragraphs about Justice's identification of language as "a commons" and a "level-playing field:"

   Example

     Further, Justice asserts that "Here in the rain forests of the Pacific Northwest, fresh water is a common resource,"
     implying even has he invokes the human naming of a region, that this does not override the deeper human
     tendency to share resources and foster a space that is mutually beneficial.

Keeping that transition in mind, here are the two paragraphs in which we strengthen and finalize our claim about why
Justice was motivated to write his essay. They mark the logical extension from our granular analysis of the text to our
claim about the text's purpose:

   Example

     Body Paragraph 6:
     This mutually beneficial space is a worldwide commons manifested and made accessible by language. Despite the
     fact that "in outgrowing our original environment we ceased to have a common place and identity" and despite
     this initial "outgrowing" producing varied groups with diverse languages and varying levels of prosperity, Justice
     still believes that language, the one commons that is accessible to all, can be the "level-playing field" upon which
     all groups can interact and share. Like most successful technological innovations, this "new communications
     app" is intuitive and accessible, addresses a common need, and possesses the ability to perform tasks thought
     previously to be impossible.
     Body Paragraph 7:
     Justice's clever analogy of language as a "new communications app" encourages his readers to consider language

125 | Exit Strategy: Composing the Final Body Paragraphs
in a new way. He want his readers to shirk off the notions of defeatism and division that often accompany
discussions of language and recognize it instead as a "free" application that is linked ineluctably with the very
"humanity and human origins" we have "in common with everyone else alive today." Viewed in this way, the many
languages across the globe present a challenge, but they do not simply create a frustrated and disconnected
"Tower of Babel." Instead, they represent a gigantic "level-playing field" that spans the entire commons that is the
"Earth's biosphere."

                                                                                                       Exit Strategy: Composing the Final Body Paragraphs | 126
What Now?

We have moved successfully from our essay outline to the body of our essay. Now it is time to review what we have
written thus far, account for any anomalies or missing information, create our conclusion--which is so much more than a
simple summary of what we have already written--and finally add our introduction to our essay.

Chapter Overview

   Learning Outcomes

   In this chapter we will:

          Review our essay-in-progress and create a conclusion that is not a repetition of what we have written but
             rather a final claim about the purpose of the entire text in the light of what the focused reading has
             revealed.

          Review our entire essay--thesis and body paragraphs--and edit for clarity and consistency.
          Demonstrate how a conclusion is not the end of analysis but rather an invitation to readers to engage in

             conversation.
          Demonstrate the need to say something new in the conclusion so that every aspect of the essay remains

             relevant to the unveiling of the analyzed article's purpose.
          Ensure that there is a logical progression from our initial claim through the body paragraphs, and into the

             culmination of the argument in the conclusion.

We have decided to dedicate an entire chapter to writing conclusions because, in our experience, the conclusion is the
most misunderstood of all the components of the analytical essay. Most students seem to understand that a claim needs
to be made in the introduction and that evidence needs to be analyzed in the body paragraphs. But these same students
often share the widely held misconception that a conclusion exists simply to repeat the points already made in the essay.
We think the pervasiveness and persistence of this notion has a lot to do with the five-paragraph essay form that is
taught in elementary, junior high, and high school.

You Cannot Live on Hamburger Alone: Moving
Beyond the Five-Paragraph Essay Form

The major limitation the five-paragraph essay format is that it puts form before content. That presupposition creates
problems at the university level: the limiting of ideas, the illusion of purposeful structure, and general repetitiveness. You
may know this form it by its other name: the hamburger model. A quick examination of a "hamburger" outline for an
essay on Charles Justice's "The Ultimate Communications App," will reveal many of the limitations inherent in the five-
paragraph essay, especially as it relates to the conclusion:

Top Bun

Introduction as Top Bun

The main purpose of a five-paragraph essay is to prove that its writer has read the text under analysis. No position of
inquiry needs to be taken, no controversial way of reading the text needs to be proposed. Like the sesame seed-adorned
top bun of a hamburger, the introduction is the showiest element, covering everything that will be discussed in the
remaining essay:

   Example

     In "The Ultimate Communications App," Charles Justice writes about the importance of language. He compares
     it to a "communications app," he defines it as "A common way for us to share information and create enduring
     knowledge," and he compares different languages to the "Tower of Babel."
While the author appears to be pointing at some of the more important moments from Justice's article, this introduction
promises to do little beyond that pointing. These elements are in the text and they are part of Justice's discussion on
language, but it looks as if little will be done by way of investigating how or why Justice or the author of this proposed
analysis discuss these particular aspects.

133 | Top Bun
Meat Patties

   The structure of the five-paragraph essay also calls for just three body paragraphs, which means the introduction
usually includes three main points. This is a serious limitation of the hamburger model: Why are there only three points?
Must an analytical writer have always and only three points to discuss on any given topic? What if the author feels only
two points are worth discussing? What if the author believes four points are needed for a meaningful analysis? Using
this approach, the writer becomes trapped by the form and either inflates or ignores ideas to fit into a rigid structure of
disconnected, observational paragraphs:

   Example

     Body Paragraphs as Meat Patties
     Three separate points that stack one on top of the other, but do not connect:

         1. Body Paragraph One on language as a "communications app"
        2. Body Paragraph Two on language as "a common way"
        3. Body Paragraph Three on language as a "Tower of Babel"

This is the most misleading aspect of the five-paragraph essay: the illusory notion that inserting data into the awaiting
slots can create analysis. But the hamburger approach makes filling these spaces the end and only goal. When writing a
five-paragraph essay, success is achieved not by connecting one's reading of specific aspects of a text but by finding three
things to fill the space between the top and bottom buns. Without the evolution of an actual analysis, there is little for
the conclusion to do but repeat what has been written.

                                                                                                                                                                     Meat Patties | 134
Bottom Bun

Conclusion as Bottom Bun

It is safe to say that nobody gets particularly excited about the bottom bun of a hamburger. It is a lesser version of the
decorative top bun, does not add anything in the way of flavour, and functions only to give form to the burger. If you
ordered a burger at a restaurant and received one with two bottom buns you would return it and demand a top bun,
would you not? The bottom bun is unremarkable and unwanted. It needs to be there but it needs to do little beyond take
its place.

   When writing a five-paragraph essay, students use the conclusion as little more than the bottom of their essay--a
paragraph that simply marks the end of the essay. If you are familiar with the five-paragraph essay, you will most likely
be familiar with this scenario: after finishing the third body paragraph we go back to the introduction and copy or
paraphrase the entire thing into our conclusion and add empty transitional phrases such as "To summarize...," or "In
conclusion...," or, most egregious, "As I wrote in my introduction...." The progress through the essay has changed nothing
and the conclusion, rather than providing a space for reflection or final judgement, does nothing but reiterate the vague
claim made in the introduction and repeated through the body paragraphs. So is the purpose and the opportunity of the
conclusion in analytical writing in analytical writing often missed and misinterpreted.

Writing Your Conclusion

   The common belief that goldfish have three-second memories is most likely a myth, but the metaphor still works for
describing the problematic repetition inherent in the five-paragraph essay. It is highly unlikely you will be writing for
goldfish at any point in your scholarly career, and it is equally unlikely that readers of your work will possess three-
second memories. Your readers do not need to be reminded repeatedly of your essay's focus and purpose.

   The audience of your midterm essay, similar to the audience of our analysis of "The Ultimate Communications App,"
will certainly not need to be reminded of your thesis in your conclusion--they will not have forgotten it since reading your
introduction. This type of essay simply isn't long enough for the focused reader to forget its purpose. Nor do you have
the space in a short essay such as this one to repeat your thesis at the expense of examining different aspects of the text
under analysis. Rather than treating your conclusion as if it is a return to your thesis, consider it as a final questioning
and presentation of your thesis from the new position you have arrived at through your analysis.

   Your thesis identified a focus (first storey) and built an interpretive claim (second storey) around that focus with an eye
to making a final claim about what text is really doing. In your conclusion, you have arrived at the point where you can
confidently make your final claim about the entire text. Essentially, your conclusion should justify your particular reading
and make a final declaration on the benefit and consequence of discussing the text in the way you have. Remember that
you are inviting others to discuss and debate this text with you, so your conclusion is not intended to shut down all future
conversation on the essay, nor is it a final proclamation of your reading as the "right" and "only" reading of the text. While
you do not want to end your essay with an arms-in-the-air disavowal of everything you have done or a pleading "What do
you think?" to your readers, you do want your readers to consider the implications of your reading of this text upon their
understanding of it. You want your readers to recognize your interpretation as a valuable contribution to the ongoing
scholarly conversation.

   In many ways, your conclusion is your own assessment of the writing you have completed to this point. You cannot
write a conclusion without first reassessing your essay as it now stands. For the purposes of demonstration, let's review
our analytical essay-in-progress on Justice's "The Ultimate Communications App" and determine exactly what we have
left to say.

Three-Storey Thesis: Introduction

Speaking to an audience of first-year university students in Canada, Charles Justice in "The Ultimate Communications
App" utilizes the contrast of "cooperation" and "conflict" in combination with the repetition of the word "common" in
closing his argument. From this, Justice is arguing that while humans have become distanced into "occupying different
places" through technological, agricultural and domestication evolution, it is the shared historical fact that humanity
grew from the same original roots of collective language construction that unites every modern person to their human
counterparts around the globe. Reiterating his definition of the common as "a level-playing field," Justice concludes with
a call to arms extolling humans to grasp their ethical responsibility not only to each other but to "share" in the present
concerns of a globalized population of humans in the entire "Earth's biosphere."

139 | Three-Storey Thesis: Introduction
Body Paragraphs

In his coy opening paragraphs, Justice describes the many uses of language as if they are features of a "new
communications app" he "just invented." Justice notes how language use "facilitates an expanding network of people"
and "opens up incredible possibilities for creativity and cooperation." Such clever itemization of language's many features
enables Justice to establish effectively language as a human tool that has at its root the human desire to connect and
work together. Though centuries of migration and conflict may have turned the world into a "Tower of Babel" in which
populations are divided by different languages, "all of us living today have a common history" in which language was
developed first and foremost to create community.

   Justice stresses that such a created community is often defined by "a commons," which he defines thusly: "A commons is
a level-playing field. Everybody gets to breathe air, and we have that in common with most other species." He establishes
language as one of the first such commons, "available to everyone free" and a "common way for us to share information
and create enduring knowledge." Thus, whether it is being used to foster cooperation or perpetuate conflict, language
has always been a commons accessible to all members who wish to contribute meaningfully to their community.

   Justice defines language as "A method of communication that is available to virtually all humans to use;" a "common
property, available to everyone free." Justice thereby establishes language as a common human right and desire--an
inherent need that is obvious even in the simple naming and describing of a "proto-language" like "Me Tarzan, you Jane":
"Once you begin to share information you are creating a common space of understanding amongst you and your fellow
speakers." Even if that common space is used to express difference--Tarzan is not Jane--it is still a vital tool that can ensure
that even those who do not share opinions, backgrounds, or identities can still share ideas.

   Justice notes that sometimes such differences, even when expressed, still lead to divisions that may seem
insurmountable. "We parcel up land into properties," Justice writes, marking our divisions from one another. In more
extreme cases, we are "separated permanently by mountains or water barriers" which seem to end definitively any sense
or hope of unity: "because of our success in outgrowing our original environment we ceased to have a common place and
identity." This insurmountable division seems an unavoidable result of human evolution and prosperity, Justice implies--as
the earliest groups of humans thrived in their shared landscape, "eventually, as population grew over generations, a new
band would split off." Such splits would drive groups of humans further afield from one another, resulting in a mutual
forgetting of their "common place and identity" and likely the "evolution of different languages."

   Yet, Justice claims, even as humans mark their property or separate themselves by mountains and water, it seems
inherent in the human creation of place that "much land is held in common in the form of parks, trackless wilderness,
public rights of way and public spaces." Justice utilizes much natural imagery when defining "a commons" like language:
"The sunlight that falls to earth is common to all, plants and animals on land, fish and the whales in the sea." Further,
Justice asserts that "Here in the rain forests of the Pacific Northwest, fresh water is a common resource," implying even
has he invokes the human naming of a region, that this does not override the deeper human tendency to share resources
and foster a space that is mutually beneficial.

   This mutually beneficial space is a worldwide commons manifested and made accessible by language. Despite that fact
that "in outgrowing our original environment we ceased to have a common place and identity" and despite this initial
"outgrowing" producing varied groups with diverse languages and varying levels of prosperity, Justice still believes that
language, that one commons that is accessible to all, can be the "level-playing field" upon which all groups can interact
and share. Like most successful technological innovations, this "new communications app" is intuitive and accessible,
addresses a common need, and possesses the ability to perform task thought previously to be impossible.

   Justice's cunning misrepresentation of language as a "new communications app" encourages his readers to consider
language in a new way, to shirk off the notions of defeatism and division that often accompany discussions of language
and recognize it instead as a "free" application that is linked ineluctably with the very "humanity and human origins" we

challenge, but they do not simply create a frustrated and disconnected "Tower of Babel." Instead, they represent a gigantic
"level-playing field" that spans the entire commons that is the "Earth's biosphere."

Your Turn!

Now would be a good time to revisit the Diagnostic Self-Assessment Checklist from our first class and use it to assess
the introduction and body paragraphs for your close reading of Michael Welsh's "Kids Around the World Just Want to
Hang Out." Read what you have written and answer the following questions. We recommend strongly that you return to
this list when you reach a similar point in the writing of your midterm essay.

   Taking Measure

     Do you begin your essay with a thesis focused on the purpose of the text?
     Y/N
     Does your thesis make an interpretive claim about the text (i.e. do you make a claim about the text that is not
     obvious and is more than a simple summary of the text)?
     Y/N
     Does your thesis explain why your specific reading is worthwhile?
     Y/N
     Do you avoid plot summary (rather than simply repeat what the author has already said)?
     Y/N
     Do you discuss a new aspect of the text in every paragraph (rather than repeat the same observation over and
     over)?
     Y/N
     Do your paragraphs transition smoothly from one to the other so your analysis progresses and builds throughout
     your essay?
     Y/N
     Do you stay focused on the assigned text and avoid irrelevant "evidence" from outside the text (ex: personal
     experiences, facts or opinions you have read somewhere else, vague references to history)?
     Y/N
     Do you avoid the five-paragraph essay?
     Y/N
     Do you cite from the text and use specific textual evidence while making your points?
     Y/N
     Do you use the specific terms used in the text rather than generalizing terms like "people" or "society"?
     Y/N
     Take a moment to read aloud what you have written. Is it strong grammatically? Does it make sense?

                                                                                                                                                                       Your Turn! | 142

143 | Your Turn!
What Now?

You will most likely notice that you replied "Yes" more often now than you did when you evaluated your diagnostic essay.
Some of these questions may even seem silly now in light of all we have worked on this term. Still, these questions may
draw your attention to places where you have lost your focus momentarily, or dedicated a little too much page time
to summarizing the author's argument, or committed a grammatical error or two. Remedy these situations, review your
essay one more time, and begin constructing your conclusion.

In Conclusion

Your conclusion is as much a final assessment of your essay as it is a final commentary on the essay you are analyzing.
It is vital at this point to reread the article and reread the essay you have written before writing your conclusion. Your
task here has been to not just write but to justify your reading of this text. Your conclusion should constitute that final
moment where you drive home what you perceive to be at stake in this text and how you believe the author best delivered
that message.

   Our analysis of "The Ultimate Communications App" is that Justice's concerns over a perceived misunderstanding of
the power of language is what drives this text. Justice is motivated to write about this misunderstanding because it leads
to a missed opportunity to unite diverse groups in a mutually beneficial conversation that could encourage them to
work together to preserve the very "Earth's biosphere" that could serve as "a commons" for us all. We also appreciate
Justice's use of language to convey its importance. In our conclusion then, we should make obvious how Justice proves
the importance of language through a presentation of language in an innovative way that only further demonstrate how
versatile and vital it is:

   Example

     Conclusion
     Justice does well to present language as "The Ultimate Communications App," for in the technologically-driven,
     always-connected world of his intended audience, access to the latest, most innovative internet and smartphone
     applications is almost always regarded as advantageous. The pretence of promising a new and free
     communications app that "can be used by almost everyone" and "works anywhere and anytime, night or day" is
     used by Justice to engage and enrapture his audience who presumably would be interested in an application that
     appears to be the manifestation of a "level-playing field" offering everyone equal access to the world's information.
     Though readers will eventually realize that Justice has "lied" and has not invented a new communications
     app, they will have likely also realized that they have already completed the "four years" required to properly
     "download" language and are already well-equipped to not only share but also contribute to humanity's "enduring
     knowledge." Justice's demonstration that the creation of an ultimate communications app would be welcomed
     almost universally is coupled with his eventual revelation that this "app," language, has existed for centuries and
     has been mastered by billions. Justice thereby inspires his audience to use their mastery of language to connect
     across the "manifest diversity" of their shared biosphere and foster the innate human desire for community and
     communication.

You will notice in our conclusion that we cite passages from "The Ultimate Communications App" that we have not cited
before. This is intentional. While you do not want to begin an entirely new argument in your conclusion, you should still
aim to say something new-to build upon your argument with new evidence. Review the material you have gathered in
your earlier readings of the article and decide what evidence would work best with the final point in your conclusion. In
our case, a rereading of our third storey reminds us of our claim that Justice's paper is really a "call to arms" to his readers.
Keeping that metaphor in mind as we reviewed our notes, we were reminded of the passage in which Justice reveals to
his readers that they are already sufficiently "armed" to respond meaningfully to this call:

145 | In Conclusion
Example

There are only two things that may be problematic with it: my new app takes about four years to download.
Yes, you heard correctly, not four minutes but four years. And usually, only ridiculously young kids know how to
download it, but, like I said it takes about four years. During that time, the system needs constant maintenance
and TLC.

                                                                                                                                                            In Conclusion | 146
Supporting Your Claim

After reviewing our thesis in light of the essay that we developed from it, it seems that we have managed to stay pretty
well on point. Remember, your thesis is a claim you are making about the text you are analyzing, not an itemized list of
everything you are going to write about. So, while paragraphs will deal with aspects of the text not mentioned in your
introduction, they should not deal with them in a way not clearly detailed in the introduction.

   We notice that in our first, sixth and seventh body paragraphs, and in our conclusion as well, we make much of Justice's
novel presentation of language as a new "communications app." Obviously, we regard this metaphor as a vital part of the
text and a key device used by Justice to deliver his message. We should alert our readers in our thesis of the central role
we believe this technique plays in Justice's essay. We need to make a few minor adjustments to our thesis before we insert
it into our essay as the introduction.

Putting it All Together

Here, finally is our complete analytical essay of Charles Justice's "The Ultimate Communications App," with conclusion
and revised introduction:

   Example

     Speaking to an audience of first year university students in Canada, Charles Justice in "The Ultimate
     Communications App" presents language as a new "communications app" that can inspire worldwide
     "cooperation," overcome any "conflict" and produce an equally accessible and beneficial "commons." Through
     this novel presentation of language, Justice argues that while humans have become distanced into "occupying
     different places" through technological, agricultural and domestication evolution, it is the shared historical fact
     that humanity grew from the same original roots of collective language construction that unites every modern
     person to their human counterparts around the globe. Reiterating his definition of the common as "a level-playing
     field," Justice concludes with a call to arms extolling humans to use all aspects of this "new app," language, to grasp
     their ethical responsibility not only to each other but to "share" in the present concerns of a globalized population
     of humans in the entire "Earth's biosphere."
     In his coy opening paragraphs, Justice describes the many uses of language as if they are features of a "new
     communications app" he "just invented." Justice notes how language use "facilitates an expanding network of
     people" and "opens up incredible possibilities for creativity and cooperation." Such clever itemization of language's
     many features enables Justice to establish effectively language as a human tool that has at its root the human
     desire to connect and work together. Though centuries of migration and conflict may have turned the world into
     a "Tower of Babel" in which populations are divided by different languages, "all of us living today have a common
     history" in which language was developed first and foremost to create community.
     Justice stresses that such a created community is often defined by "a commons," which he defines thusly: "A
     commons is a level-playing field. Everybody gets to breathe air, and we have that in common with most other
     species." He establishes language as one of the first such commons, "available to everyone free" and a "common
     way for us to share information and create enduring knowledge." Thus, whether it is being used to foster
     cooperation or perpetuate conflict, language has always been a commons accessible to all members who wish to
     contribute meaningfully to their community.
     Justice defines language as "A method of communication that is available to virtually all humans to use;" a
     "common property, available to everyone free." Justice thereby establishes language as a common human right
     and desire--an inherent need that is obvious even in the simple naming and describing of a "proto-language" like
     "Me Tarzan, you Jane": "Once you begin to share information you are creating a common space of understanding
     amongst you and your fellow speakers." Even if that common space is used to express difference--Tarzan is not
     Jane--it is still a vital tool that can ensure that even those who do not share opinions, backgrounds, or identities
     can still share ideas.
     Justice notes that sometimes such differences, even when expressed, still lead to divisions that may seem
     insurmountable. "We parcel up land into properties," Justice writes, marking our divisions from one another.

                                                                                                                                                       Putting it All Together | 148
     In more extreme cases, we are "separated permanently by mountains or water barriers" which seem to end
     definitively any sense or hope of unity: "because of our success in outgrowing our original environment we
     ceased to have a common place and identity." This insurmountable division seems an unavoidable result of human
     evolution and prosperity, Justice implies--as the earliest groups of humans thrived in their shared landscape,
     "eventually, as population grew over generations, a new band would split off." Such splits would drive groups of
     humans further afield from one another, resulting in a mutual forgetting of their "common place and identity" and
     likely the "evolution of different languages."

     Yet, Justice claims, even as humans mark their property or separate themselves by mountains and water, it seems
     inherent in the human creation of place that "much land is held in common in the form of parks, trackless
     wilderness, public rights of way and public spaces." Justice utilizes much natural imagery when defining "a
     commons" like language: "The sunlight that falls to earth is common to all, plants and animals on land, fish and
     the whales in the sea." Further, Justice asserts that "Here in the rain forests of the Pacific Northwest, fresh water
     is a common resource," implying even has he invokes the human naming of a region, that this does not override
     the deeper human tendency to share resources and foster a space that is mutually beneficial.

     This mutually beneficial space is a worldwide commons manifested and made accessible by language. Despite that
     fact that "in outgrowing our original environment we ceased to have a common place and identity" and despite
     this initial "outgrowing" producing varied groups with diverse languages and varying levels of prosperity, Justice
     still believes that language, that one commons that is accessible to all, can be the "level-playing field" upon which
     all groups can interact and share. Like most successful technological innovations, this "new communications app"
     is intuitive and accessible, addresses a common need, and possesses the ability to perform task thought previously
     to be impossible.

     Justice's cunning misrepresentation of language as a "new communications app" encourages his readers to
     consider language in a new way, to shirk off the notions of defeatism and division that often accompany
     discussions of language and recognize it instead as a "free" application that is linked ineluctably with the very
     "humanity and human origins" we have "in common with everyone else alive today." Viewed in this way, the many
     languages across the globe present a challenge, but they do not simply create a frustrated and disconnected
     "Tower of Babel. Instead, they represent a gigantic "level-playing field" that spans the entire commons that is the

Chapter Overview

   Learning Outcomes
   In this chapter we will:

          Differentiate between writing a close reading of another author's argument and creating your own
             argument.

          Close reading an essay prompt to identify initial potential paths and/or topics to make your own future
             argument.

          Identifying what document might be the most effective base for your own future argument.
          Analyzing that document to identify the strongest pieces of evidence for your own future argument.
          Building an initial two-storey thesis argument of your own.

155 | Chapter Overview
Moving From a Close Reading to Making Your Own
Argument

Chapters 1 through 6 of this textbook focused on close reading. Those chapters walked through how to identify another
author's argument and analyze it by focusing on key pieces of evidence in the first storey, linking that evidence to a
specific argument within the text in the second storey, and then expanding the scope of the argument in the third storey.

   However, not every assignment at the university level is a close reading. It is very common for a professor to give
students an essay prompt or question (or a series of prompts or questions) and ask that students construct an argument
to that question or prompt using scholarly research. In these cases, the professor is asking you to make an argument of
your own. Chapters 7 through 13 of this textbook will describe how to write an effective university-level essay in which
you make your own argument.

   The good news is that the principles that we used to construct a three-storey close reading are exactly the same as the
ones we will outline in the coming chapters. In order to make your own argument, you will:

 Begin with evidence that you acquire by analyzing a specific text in your first storey
 Combine that evidence with scholarly research to make a complex argument in your second storey
 Expand the scope of your argument in your third storey by considering the full results or consequences or solutions

   to the argument you raised in your second storey

   As such, you will need the tools you developed in Chapters 1 through 6 as you close
read other documents to get evidence for your first storey; you will also need to close
read scholarly research to support your own argument in your second and third
storeys.

   The major difference, however, between a close reading of another work and
making an argument of your own is the focus. In your close reading, you analyzed the
author's complex argument. When making your own argument, you will be close
reading other documents and arguments and incorporating them into your
argument, but the focus is always your own argument. You will use the same tools but
add further complexity and your own ideas and analysis.

                                                                                         From Pixabay.

When asked to construct your own complex argument, you should first do a
close reading of the essay prompt(s) and question(s), as we outlined in Chapter 1,
patterns, key words, new words, and contrasts.

Forming your own argument is a slow and deliberate process and begins with the essay prompt or assignment guidelines
that you are given. After you have read the assignment guidelines very carefully and asked your professor any initial
questions, begin each of your assignments by identifying what you are being asked to do.

Using the following assignment prompt as an example, do an initial close reading of the question, make a list of any
patterns, key words, new words, contrasts you find within the prompt. Notice that this prompt also includes a quote from
an article; you will need to read the article to completely understand what is being asked of you.

   In the case of more complex questions and prompts, it is useful for you to flag references used in the text that you may
need to learn more about.

   Example

     In "Kosovo Attains Status (on Facebook) It Has Sought for Years," (http://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/13/world/
     europe/kosovo-seeking-recognition-follows-the-crowd-to-facebook-social-media.html?mcubz=0) Dan Bilefsky
     reports:
     "Last month, Kosovo declared victory, after its officials said Facebook approved a number of changes, including
     giving users registering from the diamond-shaped area on the Balkan Peninsula the option to identify themselves
     as citizens of Kosovo, rather than the decidedly less attractive option for many there, Serbia. They can also use
     the Facebook function that allows users to `check in' on the website from locations within Kosovo, like a cinema
     or a bar."

Thinking about this development in the Balkans, as well as other political demonstrations, such as the Arab Spring, Black
Lives Matter and Occupy Wall Street, for example, consider the role the Internet has played in protest. Choose ONE
protest movement and ONE social media platform, and discuss the power dynamic created between the government
and its citizens. What is the role of the Internet in affecting the balance between governments and citizens? You may
consider expanding to consider movements like #metoo and consider what power dynamics are being critiqued in on
your chosen social media platform. In what ways has this technology been conducive to balancing or unbalancing these
power dynamics? Has it been useful or harmful?

Choosing and Analyzing Your Central Document

By now, you've probably noticed this chapter's repetition of the phrase "your own argument." The word argument is key.
A professor never wants your opinion. Opinions are feelings and thoughts that cannot be proven and cannot be disagreed
with. Evidence is the key difference between opinion and argument. While you may begin your essay writing process by
examining our opinions, you should be ready to move them aside quickly and replace them with an argument grounded
in evidence.

   The first storey of your own argument should:

 1. Choose a central document and explain its significance to your argument
2. Analyze that central document to focus on two key pieces of evidence

Based on your work in Chapters 1 through 6, you should be familiar with other authors' use of central documents or
examples to make their arguments. For example:

   Example

          In "Kids Around the World Just Want to Hang Out," Michael Welsh uses the responses given by two
             separate groups of high school students from Stockholm, Sweden, and Keene, New Hampshire, who
             were surveyed about their preferences and visions for their cities as his focused central document.
             Welsh argues that the students of Keene displayed considerably less vision than their Stockholm
             counterparts, "limited expectations" of their government's ability or interested to help them attain their
             goals, and a worrying reliance on commercial companies to provide them the accessible, common, and
             entertaining spaces they desire.

          In "The Plot to Privatize Common Knowledge," David Bollier uses the focused central document of the
             book Adios, Barbie: Young Women Write About Body Image and Identity, which outlines Mattel's
             aggressive litigation to protect its intellectual property. He uses this Barbie example to support his
             larger argument that "over-patenting," if continued unchecked, will result in much of what has been
             previously considered the shared and accumulated wisdom of humanity becoming "off limits" to the
             average citizen.

When choosing a central document, you want a specific document that will provide at least two focused pieces of
evidence you can analyze meaningfully. Look again at the example assignment prompt from earlier in this chapter and
note how that prompt explicitly identifies the central document you need when it asks for "ONE protest movement and
ONE social media." Not every assignment prompt will be that overt, but, at the undergraduate level, you are expected
to focus on a small number of examples-your one or two central documents-that support your focused and complex
argument within the context of the assignment's guidelines. For this textbook you are only going to focus on ONE central
document to create your argument.

   Therefore, this central document should be short and manageable. As we do our example essay prompt about social
media and protests, you will need to identify a precise central document that will provide your argument with strong
supporting evidence of your argument. Imagine the scope of your essay. Let's say, for example, you are being asked to

                                                                                                                  Choosing and Analyzing Your Central Document | 162
write an eight-page essay. It would be impossible to write an eight-page essay arguing anything about "The Internet" --
think how much you would have to discuss and consider; it would be everything from smartphones, to Internet-enabled
appliances, to self-driving cars, and would include every app and website and function of "The Internet." That scale of
argument would require a series of books! Similarly, you cannot write an eight-page essay about "Social Media." Think
about all the different kinds of "social media" and all the different users of those social media and then all the different
ways all those different users engage on those social media. Again, that would be a series of books. You cannot even write
an eight-page essay on "Facebook." Instead, if you wanted to write an eight-page essay on "how ONE protest movement
used ONE social media to balance or unbalance the power dynamics between government officials and their citizens in
harmful or useful ways" from the prompt above, you would need to focus in on a specific part of Facebook (say a Facebook
group) and then a specific aspect of that Facebook group (such as the photos posted, the front page, or one discussion
thread). Only then are you at a level that is focused enough for an eight-page argument.

   In response to the prompt above, we will chose Occupy Wall Street's Facebook page, as an example. By looking at
a small slice of Occupy Wall Street's Facebook page, more specifically the comments in response to the posts on the
Facebook page, you can gather two specific, focused pieces of evidence which you can then turn into a specific and
focused argument in our second storey.

   Remember that at the undergraduate university level, you will only ever be asked to write one focused and precise
argument at a time. As such, you need to be focused and precise in limiting your scope to an appropriate central
document.

     This process of choosing a short, specific central document is essential to making your own university-level
     argument, regardless of of your discipline or faculty. Again, keeping in mind the eight-page scope, what short,
     specific central document might you choose if you were asked to write:

         1. A psychology essay on the impact of Youtube music videos on high school students?
             b. A history essay examining Canada's role in World War II?
             c. A philosophy essay asking you to argue the modern applications of Plato's Republic?
             d. An English essay asking you to discuss the role of gender in Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet?

                                                                                                                                                                       Your Turn! | 164

Analyzing a Central Document

Let's pause here to acknowledge that you will often be asked to write and research about topics that have complex

personal and cultural complex histories. For example, in focusing on Occupy Wall Street's Facebook page, we eventually

choose to analyze a post about the Israel-Palestine relationship and Black Lives Matter. Both topics are vast and are likely

to generate passionate discussion between all sides and parties involved. This is an opportunity to ask questions, to learn

more about these topics if you are unfamiliar with them, to listen to those who know a bit more at this point, and to

potentially discuss them further with your classmates. You are going to be asked to discuss complex and difficult topics

throughout your university career and learning a wide variety of facts while also listening to a wide range of perspectives

will best equip you to contribute meaningfully to these discussions.

                               Now that we have focused on a specific part of Occupy Wall

                               Street's Facebook page, we need to analyze the text to get the

                               best pieces of potential evidence. This will help us make an

                               argument about how protest pages on Facebook, like that of

                               Occupy Wall Street, can positively or negatively affect the

                               relationship between a specific government and its citizens.

                               Writing about Occupy Wall Street's Facebook page in general

                               is not specific enough to support an argument. Instead, you will

                               focus just on the Home page. You will then go through the

                               Home page of Occupy Wall Street's Facebook page and begin

                               in Part 1 of the text textbook: make a list of patterns, key words,

                               new words, and contrasts. These elements could be found in

                               the words and phrases of the document, but you should also be

                               looking for them in (if applicable) any videos, photos, or audio

that are also present in your document. On a separate piece of paper, write down all of your observations in list format. It

is also very helpful with ephemeral and ever-changing virtual spaces, like Occupy Wall Street's Facebook page, that you

take screen grabs or save the versions of the pages and posts that you are looking at so you can some back to them later.

This will help you get at observations about the content of the central document and can be potential evidence on which

to base your future argument.

                                                                      Analyzing a Central Document | 166
Better Understanding the Medium of Your Central
Document

However, we should not just restrict ourselves to the content of Occupy Wall Street's Facebook page. We should also
consider the medium of Occupy Wall Street's Facebook page. By this, we mean, you should not limit yourself to just the
information given on the page (images, videos, words, audio) but should also look at how the Facebook page organizes,
creates, maintains and distributes information. How a document presents its information is just as important as the
information it presents. Understanding how the document organizes, displays and distributes information will help
you better understand its rhetorical intention and effects. This is not limited to thinking about Facebook organizational
pages --you should ask this of every central document, were it a survey, a letter, a newspaper article, or some other type
of document.

   In order to better understand the medium you are being asked to analyze, you can begin with some basic general
questions:

   What specific language is unique to the medium being used? How is your specific user using this language? ("Like"
      "Shares" Group")

   What mechanics are UNIQUE to your SPECIFIC central document you've focused on - i.e. a word limit, a focus on
      photographs, the image disappears after a set amount of time etc.

   What numbers are present on the page? What actions or documents are the numbers related to? How large are the
      numbers?

   What is the most common action on this page? Posting text? Posting photos? Commenting?
   How active is this page? How frequent is user activity?

                                                      From Pixabay.

167 | Better Understanding the Medium of Your Central Document
Analyzing a Specific Central Document

While these questions are specific to analyzing Facebook groups or pages, these questions about activity, audience, and
the unique structures, properties, and language of any central document will help you analyze the form of your central
document, no matter the medium.

   As the Occupy Wall Street Facebook group is a changing virtual document, analysis of it must be pinned to a specific
time and date. In our case, we analyzed a specific comment thread on a specific post on the Occupy Wall Street Facebook
page on August 6th 2016. As you narrow your focus on your Central Document, remember that the purpose is not to make
an argument about the topic of the post (i.e. Israel and Palestine) but rather, the role of Facebook in protest movements.

                                                                                                                               Analyzing a Specific Central Document | 168

observations):

                                                                                                                                Analyzing a Specific Central Document | 172
   Links to outside pages and events was the most common action on the home page
   The majority of the links are to actions and event from across the globe
   The Facebook group was updated regularly (at least once a day) with consistent activity in the form of comments on

      each post
   In the post "From #Ferguson to #Gaza #BLM," which includes a link to a video titled "Black Lives Matter has zero

      F***S left for Israel," commenters are struggling to connect the events in Ferguson, Missouri in the United States to
      Gaza in the Middle East, as the post is prompting. Instead, people are calling each other names like "idiots" and
      asking questions like "What the hell does BLM have to do with geopolitics in the Middle East?"
In this brief example, you can see how we have narrowed our focus from the community page, to the timeline, to the posts
on the timeline, to a specific post on the timeline, to specific comments on that post. This is the level of focus and detail
that is required to write an eight-page university-level argumentative essay. With this focus, the two pieces of evidence
will use are the the inflammatory name-calling and the confusion about how the two situations are related.

Building an Initial Two-Storey Thesis for Your Own

Argument

Now that you have gathered evidence, you have built the foundation for the first storey of your complex argument. That
first storey will look a lot like the first storey you built for your close readings: you are pointing to the best one or two
pieces of evidence on which you are going to base your argument.

   Obviously, you can't discuss everything in your central document, so you need narrow your focus, like you did with your
close readings, to the two best pieces of evidence. You can do this by looking at the list of evidence you gathered when
close reading your central document and asking:

   Which pieces of evidence are the most interesting?
   Which pieces of evidence are the most important?
   Do your pieces of evidence address both the content and the medium of your central document?
   Are there two pieces of evidence that are similar and might combine to make an effective argument?
   Does each piece of evidence add something different to your potential argument? (You do not want two pieces of

      evidence repeating the same idea.)

For example, look through your list of evidence from Occupy Wall St.'s Facebook page. After thinking through all of
the questions above, you may chose to focus on the comments on one post and from there, focus in on the repetition
of commenters linking to their own local projects as the first piece of evidence and the repetition of commenters
mentioning their local cities in their posts. Therefore, your first storey might look something like this:

   Occupy Wall Street's Facebook page showcases that users of the page have a difficult and often frustrating time linking
global events to local events and concerns that are more personal to them. This is demonstrated by the comments under
the post "From #Ferguson to #Gaza #BLM," wherein discussion of the event leads to participants calling each other
names like "idiots" and angry confusion over how the Black Lives Matter is related to the Middle East (ex. The post "What
the hell does BLM have to do with geopolitics in the Middle East?").

   As you can see, not only do we state our two selected pieces of evidence, we also identify the central document (The
Occupy Wall Street Facebook page) and the specific aspects of the central document we will be examining (a post and its
comments thread).

   Now we are ready to move onto the second storey. This is where we begin making your argument about our central
document. We want to remain focused just on our central document for now. For example, our second storey, using the
example from the Occupy Wall Street Facebook page, would be about only the specific page, or perhaps Facebook groups
and pages used for protest movements, but not Facebook as a whole. Remember too that an argument is a statement that
can be agreed or disagreed with. Therefore, look at your two pieces of evidence and ask:

   What is the significance of the evidence that you have chosen?
   What argument about the specific document can you make based on the evidence you have chosen? (Remember to

      stay focused at this point and not expand beyond that central document.)
   In what ways do the pieces of evidence overlap? What argument might be derived from that overlap?
   What are the benefits for the user/reader arise when interacting with your central document and how do those

      benefits relate to the evidence you've chosen?
   What problems for the user/reader arise when interacting with your central document and how do those problems

      relate to the evidence you've chosen?

                                                                                                Building an Initial Two-Storey Thesis for Your Own Argument | 176
As you move into your second storey and begin making your argument, answering these questions will help you connect
your argument to the evidence you've chosen.

Do not be too precise in drafting your thesis at this point. Try to make it specific and complex but don't limit yourself by
thinking that you have to get it exactly right at this stage. You will be doing more research and revising, so your thesis
will change and sharpen over the process of writing your essay. At this stage, aim for one or two sentences that make an
argument about your central document using the evidence you've selected.

Now that you have a two-storey thesis and an initial argument, you are ready to move onto the next stage: research and
incorporating outside voices. Notice that you didn't begin with research. This is key because the argumentative essay you
are writing must be based on your argument. You do not want to begin with research and then simply replicate someone
else's argument--you want to make your own argument supported by others' research and ideas!

   As you move on to the next chapter, it is useful to begin asking some questions before you head to the library or the
library's website:

 What words or phrases in my thesis might need further scholarly
   definitions?

 What types of statistics might be useful to support my argument?
 Within what discipline am I writing? Who are the experts within that

   discipline?
 Are there other terms or words that might be useful search terms

   when looking for scholarly research about my argument?

                                                                          From Pexels.

   When you go to the library with specific questions and goals in mind,
you will find your research will go faster and be more relevant!

               Now that you have a thesis statement, you need to find evidence that supports

               your arguments. Think about a conversation you've had with your friends when

               you wanted them to agree with you. Whether it's picking a restaurant or a movie

               on Netflix, you had to argue for why your choice was the best. While you probably

               started with your own personal belief that Restaurant A is the best place in town,

               or Movie B is the greatest masterpiece of all time, you might have moved towards

               evidence outside of your own personal beliefs. You may have pointed out the

               restaurant had amazing ratings or tweets from celebrities who ate there. In short,

               you had outside evidence that supported your argument. Sound familiar?

               the scenario above,

               you already know how

               to gather evidence.

               Every time you use

Google to look up reviews for restaurants and movies, you are

doing research. Academic research is more intensive than your

typical daily Google research. It can take hours to collect your

evidence. You will have to figure out your search strategy, what

types of evidence you need (scholarly articles, statistics, books,

news reports), and use different types of search engines and

databases to find them. Ultimately, you will have to evaluate

what you find. One of the main things to remember from this

chapter is that not all information is reliable. There is a lot of

non-credible information out there, especially on the internet

where anyone can publish. Putting the keywords of your thesis

into Google and hitting enter will just not cut it. You are From Pixabay.

How Information is Produced

Thanks to the internet, all kinds of information is available to us 24/7. We can find out what's going on instantly on
social media or with a quick Google search. However, this quick and easy access to information creates the false belief
that the information we find is accurate and that all information is free. Scholarly and evidence-based information is
not free. In fact, university libraries pay millions of dollars each year to subscribe to academic journals and databases
and to purchase scholarly books for your research needs. Remember, as a student you have a unique privilege to access
expensive information to which the general public does not have easy access. Moreover, scholarly and other types of
information that contain extensive research take time to produce, as evidence must be gathered, analyzed, and reviewed
by experts.

   When considering different types of information for your paper, it's important to recognize how creation process
influences that information. Some information sources go through reviews and editing that make it more credible for
your research. This list below represents how the progression of information is connected to information sources:

        Social Media gives us instant access to what's happening, but it is often emotional and biased. It might contain

         little to no analysis or verification of what is actually happening.
 The next day

      News media gives us a breakdown of the event and verification from authorities of what happened. While there
         may be some analysis, there is no in-depth, big picture analysis yet.

 The following weeks
      Popular sources like magazines and news documentaries publish their reports. While there is more analysis of
         why it happened, popular sources likes these do not contain evidence-based research.

 Months later
      Scholars are starting to research the event using their subject area's lens.
      It will be months before a study is published because of the amount of time it takes to conduct extensive
         research, write the paper, and submit it to an academic journal, where it must be reviewed by peers who may
         recommend the article be revised before it can be published.
      Articles written by scholars offer the most in-depth analysis of the event and the information is double-
         checked for bias and error.

 More than one year later
      Books are written on the topic.
      Such books can vary from
            firsthand accounts by those affected, to
            easy-to-read and sensational books for the general public, and finally, to
            academic books where a professor might take her scholarly article and expand it into a book.

Types of Information

Finding Credible Information

For your academic assignments, you will be asked to consult credible sources like academic books and peer-reviewed
journal articles. Different writing assignments can also require other sources of information like government statistics or
personal interviews.

   As a researcher you want to use sources that are credible. Credible sources provide information that is factual and can
be verified. You also need to be aware of bias in your sources. Bias refers to a source's intent or purpose. It is possible
for credible sources to have some bias as they might learn towards one particular research methodology or viewpoint,
but they will still use sources to support their argument. What to watch out for is sources that have extreme bias. These
sources are overtly one-sided, lack factual information or provide little to no evidence to back up their arguments.

Scholarly Peer-Reviewed Sources

We've talked a lot so far about how the standard source in university-level research is scholarly peer-reviewed articles.
Peer-reviewed articles are the agreed-upon method of disseminating original research conducted by professors,
scientists and other experts. In fact, when writing your own papers in your subject area, you should model their style and
prose.

The Peer Review Process

A journal is a scholarly publication containing articles, letters to the editors and book reviews written by researchers,
professors and other experts. Journals focus on a specific discipline or field of study and are published on a regular basis
(monthly, quarterly, etc.). The intended reading audience is other experts and not the general public. The authors are
considered experts because they have PhDs and have specialized in-depth knowledge of current and past theories and
years of training in research and analysis.

   When a professor writes a research article, she will submit it to a peer-reviewed journal to be published. However,
before the journal will accept the article, it will be reviewed by experts in the same area of study, hence, her peers. If her
peers deem her research lacking validity, she will be asked to make changes or her article might be outright rejected. This
is why assignments ask you to use articles published in peer-reviewed journals as they contain rigorous research and use
a critical lens when picking what gets published.

   It is also important to keep in mind that there are many theories or schools of thought within a discipline, and
professors chose to conduct her research through one particular theory. An economics professor, for example, could
write her article through a Marxist or a Neoliberal lens. You need to develop an awareness of the different theories in
your subject area as this will help you identify what lens the author is using to conduct their research. This is also
important if an assignment requires sources from different theories or if you must support your thesis with sources from
one particular theory.

   Experts like professors often publish their evidence-based research in non-peer-reviewed sources like books and
newspapers. These sources are still considered authoritative and contain expert research and are often reviewed by
editors for accuracy, but they do not count as peer-reviewed sources. It is important to know the difference if your
professor specifically requests that you use articles from peer-reviewed journals. Not to worry, library databases are
designed to help you locate peer-reviewed articles. We will go over how to find peer-reviewed journals in the section
below called "Where to Find Authoritative Research Documents".

The Need to Remain Critical

The peer review process is the agreed-upon method for checking credibility in the academic world but it is not without
its flaws. Articles with inaccurate research methods and, therefore, flawed conclusions have been published. However,
thanks to the work of journalists and other diligent experts, these papers have been retracted and the research removed
from the Journal. The work of researchers can also be funded by outside corporations and many journals insist that
authors state their conflict of interest within their paper. If you come across an admission of conflict when reading an

189 | Scholarly Peer-Reviewed Sources
article, it will be up to you to evaluate whether or not you feel the research was influenced by the corporation's own
agenda.

   You also need to be vigilant when using Google to find peer-reviewed journals as there are non-credible journals
parading themselves as peer-reviewed. Your library provides you with access to databases that contain authorized peer
reviewed journals and filters out the non-credible ones. Overall, even though the peer review process works to evaluate
research, you as the reader need to remain critical and conduct your own evaluation of what you are reading.

                                                                                                                                       Scholarly Peer-Reviewed Sources | 190
General "Popular" Sources

"Scholarly" and "popular" are terms used to describe a source's content, purpose, audience and more. Popular sources are
intended for a more general audience and they can range from entertainment magazines to well researched investigative
articles from the New York Times. With most scholarly sources we can rely on the peer review process to evaluate the
authority and credibility of the research presented to us. With popular sources, it is up to you to determine whether the
source is appropriate for your own research.

   So what are Popular Sources?
   Magazines,
   newspapers (from your local daily news to the New York Times),
   books (online and in print),
   websites, social media, blogs and wikis etc., and
   media (including podcasts, movies and award-winning documentaries).

191 | General "Popular" Sources
When to Use Popular Sources

This depends on your assignment, but if you are permitted to use popular sources, there are excellent sources like
newspapers, personal interviews and government reports that will help you advance your own argument. Sources,
such as magazines and newspapers, are very useful for current commentary on a topic or issue. Governments and
organizations such as large non-profit charities, release reports and data on a regular basis. The Canadian Census is
one great example of the type of information you can access for free from government websites. Investigative journalist
reports and organizations, like the YMCA, often release in-depth pieces on current issues such as poverty levels in large
cities and provide data and analysis. All of these types of documents can be excellent sources of information with up-
to-date statistics and analysis. However, you must also be aware that some newspapers, blogs and non-government
organizations, such as policy think-tanks, have specific political viewpoints that you will have to be aware of. It is up to
you to evaluate whether or not to use a popular source in your assignment.

                                                                                                                                            When to Use Popular Sources | 192

Where to Find Authoritative Research Documents

Your textbook and course readings may be good starting points to help you understand your research topic. However,
you'll need to do more in-depth research to find sources that support your thesis.

   The creation of information--publishing in electronic or print formats--and describing and indexing information so that
it can be easily found are very expensive endeavors. The information business is a multi-billion dollar global enterprise.
While you can find some research for free on the internet, it remains true that much of the academic or scholarly content
written by authoritative researchers is kept behind paywalls. That is where your libraries come in.

   Your academic library in particular, and to some extent your public library, subscribe to huge collections of scholarly
articles found in databases, to individual journals in electronic and/or print formats, and to books and e-books with
scholarly content that can support the arguments you make in your research papers. Libraries also subscribe to indexing
and abstracting services that help to make information easier to find. Libraries may even have powerful search engines
on their websites that look like Google and search for all types of resources, from scholarly journals to trade magazines
and newspapers, books and e-books, DVDs and streamed videos, and possibly even websites and visual images including
photographs.

   Many libraries use discovery layers or services such as Summon from ProQuest, Primo from Ex Libris, or Ebsco
Discovery Service. These services may be rebranded by your library as in the case of Ryerson University Library
and Archives that calls its installation of Summon "Search Everything" and Athabasca University Library that calls its
installation of Ebsco Discovery Service simply "Discover." These products bring together in one search data from the
traditional library catalogue of books and audio-visual resources plus journal articles, newspaper articles and other
resources from databases to which the library subscribes as well as out of print and open access resources in large
digital depositories. Look for a search box on the library's home page and near it you'll hopefully see an Advanced Search
option. Using the advanced option helps you, the researcher, think about how information is organized, indexed and made
findable in a database's search engine.

   Libraries also have specialized encyclopedias, dictionaries and other reference works, in print and/or electronic
formats that can provide a quick background on a topic new to you. If your professor specifies that they want you
to use scholarly articles, you would not be allowed to cite these reference works as a source. However, these works
are important for finding quick facts, definitions, or brief background information that may be helpful in verifying
information from another source. Scholarly reference works may even include the names of the authors and cite other
resources on the topic.

   Two digital reference collections that are commonly available in university and college libraries in Ontario are Gale
Virtual Reference Library (GVRL) and Oxford Reference. Both contain brief articles about a wide variety of subjects.
Lengthier articles are often signed and include bibliographical references.

   Librarians create and maintain subject-specific research guides that can usually be found on library websites. These
guides can help you navigate the best possible resources in your subject area. For example, a guide on History of Canada
or a History of the Caribbean may point you to databases such as America History and Life, Historical Abstracts, and
Worldwide Political Science Abstracts. The subject research guides are often referred to by librarians as research guides,
resource guides, course guides, pathfinders, or LibGuides (the name of a specific publishing tool for guides). If your
institution does not have a helpful research guide for your discipline, you may want to consult a guide from another
academic institution.

   Databases on offer will vary from institution to institution. A database may contain a large collection of full-text articles
from many different journals, or it may contain full-text articles from some journals and also bibliographical citations
with or without abstracts (summaries) of additional articles that are not available in full-text format. MLA International
Bibliography is one database that used to contain only citations but now includes links to some full-text content that

197 | Where to Find Authoritative Research Documents
the company hosting the bibliography provides to the subscribing library. Access to databases will normally be restricted
to members of a research community, since these are licensed products that a university pays for on behalf of its own
students, faculty, and staff. Some public libraries make databases available online to library card holders or to anyone
at computers inside the library. Specialized databases often have search features that are unique to the discipline. For
example, historical databases normally allow a researcher to limit a search to the historical time period when an event
happened. Do not confuse this with the date of publication of an article or book.

   This type of research is new for most post-secondary students. Many students face challenges when trying to
understand, access and use these new types of resources. The next part of this chapter will emphasize how to find
scholarly journal articles and other credible sources that you can use to inform and support your research paper.

Search Strategies: Plan, Refine, and Modify

Search engines such as Google allow you to use ordinary or natural language. You can type a fully formed question and
you will likely get some relevant results. The research databases that libraries provide work differently. For best results,
you should break down your research question into main concepts that can be expressed as a keyword or a short phrase.
You will also want to identify related terms for your concepts, including synonyms that mean the same thing or almost
the same thing (e.g. corn OR maize) and variant spellings (e.g. jewelry OR jewellery; color OR colour). Failure to consider
variant spellings and terms in use in different regions of the world could cause you to miss out on important research by
scholars who are accustomed to using a variant word for the concept. Your keywords and phrases become your search
terms. You can connect your terms with special words called Boolean operators. This will be explained more fully shortly.

   Let us use this hypothetical research question:
Are comics a good way to teach William Shakespeare's plays to high school students?

   Concept 1: comics OR graphic novels OR manga
Concept 2: teaching OR study OR learning
Concept 3: secondary school OR high school
Concept 4: Shakespeare
Concept 5: drama OR plays OR theatre OR theater

   What are some ways that you might measure success in the study of a play? A student must understand what they have
read. This points to the topic of reading comprehension. Another possible measure is memory retention. These ideas
could be expressed in additional concepts:

   Concept 6: reading comprehension
Concept 7: memory retention

   In this case, there are probably too many concepts broken out. You may want to reorganize your list and prioritize three
or four concepts to search at the start. If you search for too many concepts, you may get no results.

   After exploring your research question and finding some supporting articles, you might develop a thesis statement
along the following lines:
Comics and graphic novels are important tools for teaching secondary school students Shakespearean drama. Their use
of visual narratives bring enhanced meaning to the late sixteenth and early seventeenth-century English language and
improve both reading comprehension and memory retention.

199 | Search Strategies: Plan, Refine, and Modify
Boolean Operators

Databases and search engines use Boolean logic. Named after mathematician George Boole (1815-1864), Boolean logic
is the key to successful database searching. By using the Boolean operators AND, OR, and NOT (sometimes expressed
as ANDNOT) between search words, a researcher can focus or broaden a search query to create sets of results. The
operators are normally expressed in uppercase letters so as not to confuse them with the words used as non-operators.

   When you see a simple search box and type in words, the search engine generally inserts the AND operator between
every word. By using an advanced search option, you are encouraged to think about the way you want to focus your
search.

OR Operator

The operator OR is used to broaden a search by combining two or more variables into one set. The operator OR is used to
combine synonyms and variant spellings (e.g. theatre OR theater) of a word into one search. Any one of the search terms
must be present. More than one can be present.

   A Venn diagram (also known as a set diagram) can visually display how a database's search engine handles search terms
and the Boolean operators. Each term is searched separately and all of the relevant hits (articles, books etcetera identified
in the database as containing that term) are grouped into separate sets, one set per term as represented by each circle.
In the diagram that follows, three different related terms are being searched: comics shown by the circle in the upper left,
graphic novels shown by the circle in the upper right, with manga shown by the circle at the bottom of the diagram. Some
of the hits also contain one or both of the other search terms and this is represented by the overlapping of the circles. In
the example, since the OR operator is being used, the search finds all of the hits containing any of terms and combines
them all into one large pool of results. Because all of the results in all three sets are included, they are all represented
using the same blue colour.

   To reiterate, by broadening a search using the OR operator, the results of a search can be much larger and more
comprehensive than a set of results from a search that does not make use of related terms, synonyms, and, variant
spellings joined with the OR operator.

   Example Venn diagram using the OR operator: comics OR graphic novels OR manga

201 | OR Operator
AND Operator

The operator AND is used to narrow or focus a search by finding a subset of results containing all of the keywords or
search terms. For simplicity, the example depicted by the Venn diagram that follows contains only two key concepts and
no synonyms or related terms. On the left, the pinkish-coloured circle labelled graphic novels represents the hits (articles,
books etcetera in the database) that contain the words graphic novels. A second, yellowish-coloured circle on the right,
represents all of the hits that contain the word teaching. The two sets of searches overlap since a small number of the
hits contain both graphic novels AND teaching. This subset is shown in the diagram in the orange portion where the two
circles or sets overlap. It is labelled AND because it represents the portion of the hits from the two concepts that contain
both the first AND the second concept. The AND operator is the most commonly used Boolean operator.

   Example Venn diagram using the AND operator: graphic novels AND teaching

   If you decide that you still have too many results when you searched for only two concepts, you can refine your search
by adding a third distinct concept. This will narrow your results considerably because it is more precise. The following
Venn diagram demonstrates what happens when you modify the search used in the previous example by adding a third
keyword: Shakespeare. [Note that most databases allow both upper and lower case when searching for proper names.]
In this example the set of hits dealing with Shakespeare are represented by the blue-coloured circle shown beneath the
pinkish circle representing graphic novels and the yellowish circle representing teaching. All three circles overlap to some
extent since one, two, or all three keywords may be applied to the same articles, books etcetera in the database. In this
example, the small, almost triangular-shaped orange patch labelled AND in the centre of the diagram represents the
relatively small subset of hits that contain all three concepts: graphic novels AND teaching AND shakespeare.

203 | AND Operator
NOT Operator

The operator NOT is used when you want to search for the first term and to exclude items that contain the second term.
Teaching is a very broad term that is often qualified by broad levels such as primary, elementary, intermediate, secondary,
higher, or, post-secondary. While you may want to specify a level that you want to look for by trying a search such as
teaching AND secondary, you could decide to qualify or narrow the search by excluding a level that you are not interested
in by using the NOT operator. The following Venn diagram illustrates the concept teaching as shown by the circle in
green on the left. The concept post-secondary is shown by the light grey-coloured circle on the right.. While there is
some overlap with both concepts shared by some articles and books, when you use the NOT operator in the example of
teaching NOT post-secondary, you exclude those hits that had both teaching AND post-secondary (not shown). That is why
the desired set on teaching resembles a circle with a piece removed. [Remember that the NOT operator is sometimes
called ANDNOT. The Help information in a database will give you directions if you can simply use NOT or have to use
ANDNOT as your Boolean operator.]

Putting Together All of Your Search Concepts Using
Boolean Operators AND, OR, NOT

Remember our original research question?
Are comics a good way to teach William Shakespeare's plays to high school students?

   We can express this question using the following three key concepts that are shown on separate lines
Concept 1: comics OR graphic novels OR manga
AND
Concept 2: shakespeare
AND
Concept 3: teaching NOT (post-secondary OR university OR college)

   Using the Advanced Search features of a database reminds you that the Boolean Operators are key to good searching.
   Here is a screenshot showing what this search might look like using the advanced search options of a database.

   In this example of an advanced search, you, the researcher, are given options on how the search is conducted. There
are three main columns and multiple rows.

   The columns on the left are by default labelled All Fields and have a drop down box that allows you to specify if you want
to restrict your search to specific fields such as Author fields or Title fields or Subject fields. Think of fields as subsets of
data that are indexed in the computer to allow more precision in searching. For our purposes, we will use the default All
Fields.

   The middle column is where you input your search terms, keeping each key concept on a separate line or row. Our first
concept comics OR graphic novels OR manga is typed into the middle search box with the Boolean operator OR typed
in capital letters so that the computer knows we want to use the operator to expand our search for this one concept to
include the related terms that we identified.

   The third column of the Advanced Search screen shows by default the AND operator with a drop down box allowing
you to change it to one of the other operators, OR, or NOT.

   In this example, we want to search for the first concept AND also the concept of Shakespeare. Continuing down to the
second row, we will use the default All Fields setting in the first column, then type our concept search term shakespeare in
the middle column. Although Shakespeare is a proper name and is capitalized in the English language, databases normally
ignore initial capitals in a name so you do not have to capitalize Shakespeare. In the third column, we again want to use
the AND operator because we want to add a third key concept that deals with teaching on the next row.

   The third row uses a slightly more complex expression of the concept than we looked at when examining the use the
NOT operator. We want to find articles and books that discuss the teaching of the earlier concepts, but exclude works

205 | Putting Together All of Your Search Concepts Using Boolean
Operators AND, OR, NOT
that discuss teaching at the post-secondary level. We can express this limitation using the words in the example: teaching
NOT (post-secondary OR university OR college). We can include some related terms that also indicate the concept post-
secondary. In the example, the words university and college are deemed very similar or related to post-secondary so all
the words are grouped using the OR operator and nested within parentheses or round brackets. A researcher who is
more familiar with terminology used in the field of education may include a fourth term, higher education, as a key way
of expressing the concept of post-secondary teaching. Looking at the Advanced Research screenshot, the third row read
from left to right has in the first column the All Fields default, the concept, i.e. teaching NOT (post-secondary OR university
OR college), that we want to search in the middle column and on the right, the operator column can be ignored since we
will not be going on to fill in a fourth row. We will leave the fourth row empty.

   The Advanced Search screen includes many additional options to limit or refine your search. These are displayed lower
on the page beneath the columns and rows that we used to input our search terms. The example screenshot has an option
to set a Publication date range with two boxes that you can use to indicate a start and an end to the date range that you
want to specify. For our purposes, we will leave this option blank.

   Additionally, the screenshot shows at the bottom the option to choose one or more categories beside the label Show
content type, The default is Any type. There is a drop down menu that allows you to choose one or more of many
categories of content, for example, Archival material, Art, Article, Artifact. We can run our search without using any of
these additional options.

   Although we constructed our search strategy using an Advanced Search screen interface, once the search is run the
computer may express the search in one single line:

   (comics OR graphic novels OR manga) AND (shakespeare) AND (teaching) NOT (post-secondary OR university OR college)
   In this instance, parentheses nest the synonyms separated by the OR operator, indicating that the operation within
the parentheses must be done first to treat the synonyms as one concept. Databases apply algebraic logic to the
processing of your request. Recall from elementary mathematics that items in brackets are done first, division is done
before multiplication, and later in the order of completing a calculation come addition and finally subtraction. You may
have known this sequence as BEDMAS. Similarly, there is a sequence of operations when Boolean operators are used
in database searching. This controls the hierarchy of completing steps. Items in brackets or parentheses are solved or
searched first. When brackets or parentheses are absent, the hierarchical sequence of operations begins with AND,
followed by NOT and finally OR. By keeping your concepts on separate rows in an Advanced Search screen, you are more
likely to use the Boolean operators correctly and the database will insert parentheses around your separate concepts.
After you are skilled at the use of the parentheses and the Boolean operators, you may be able to input all of your search
terms correctly using a single search box.

   Activity

     Experiment with proper and improper use of parentheses. Compare your results when you use the following two
     search strategies:
     (graphic novels OR comics) AND shakespeare
     versus
     graphic novels OR comics AND shakespeare

Smart Searches

While the use of Boolean operators is key to searching, there are a couple of additional search tips that can help you
construct a smart search strategy.

   Truncation
In an effort to maximize the power of a search engine, you may want to make use of a handy shortcut called truncation,
which is usually represented by the asterisk symbol.

   For example, if you wanted to know how teaching is conducted in Canada or by Canadians, you might use the OR
operator and search: canada OR canadians OR canadian.

   But it is simpler to start with the common root of all of these words, canad and then place an asterisk after it (i.e.,
canad*) to indicate that you want to search both canad and other words that begin with these five letters. This should
search all of the following words: canad, canada, canada's, canadian, canadians, canadiens, canadiensis. Most databases
recognize the asterisk as a truncation symbol. In some instances, a database may make use of the question mark ? or
another symbol--this will be explained in the database's help pages. Many databases do search automatically for singular
and plural spellings of a word at the same time, but if in doubt, try using the truncation symbol.

   Exact Phrase Searching
   If you want to search an exact phrase consisting of two or more words, place them all within quotation marks. Searching
for "reading comprehension" is more specific than just using reading comprehension, which a search engine will treat as:
reading AND comprehension.
   In a sample search, "reading comprehension" found one-fifth as many results as the broader search, reading
comprehension, but the smaller result set is more relevant to the intended purpose.
   Refining and Modifying A Search
   If you are using a robust search engine, you will frequently find results across multiple formats. The search results
may include links to information about books, e-books, journal articles, magazine articles, book reviews, and newspaper
articles. You can make use of the options available in the search engine to refine your search.
   Depending on the nature of your research, you may only want to see the scholarly articles that are written by experts
in the field of study and include features such as extensive references. Professors often direct students to make use of
scholarly and specifically peer-reviewed articles from scholarly journals. If you select the scholarly option in the search
engine, it will exclude links to information about books, non-scholarly magazines, newspaper articles, etc. Letters to
the editor, opinion pieces by an editor, and book reviews are other kinds of non-scholarly writing that may appear in a
scholarly journal. If you want only journal articles, you may be able to limit your results by content type such as journal
articles, thereby excluding the non-scholarly articles and book reviews that are normally not peer-reviewed.
   Some databases or search engines will allow you to refine a search by other elements such as date of publication,
discipline, subject term, language of publication and other options.
   If you have a limited time for your research, you can try to limit your search to articles that are available in full-text
format online or in print at your local library. If you have time for a more comprehensive search, you can expand your
search beyond full-text articles to include locally available print resources and articles that are not available locally except
through an interlibrary loan service.
   You can make use of the information available in your search results to help you select the most appropriate articles
for your research. There may be abstracts or summaries of the articles displayed, or you may be able to look into more
information about an article and discover things like subject terms or descriptors used to describe the article. These
words may help you uncover synonyms for search terms that you had not previously considered. You can modify you
search strategy by applying new words.

                                                                                                                                                               Smart Searches | 208
Understanding a Search Result

The following is a sample search result for an article in an online journal:

   The first element is the title of the article, "How graphic novels ... in children"
   The second element is the name of the author in inverted order (last name, first name)
   The third element is the source, in this case a journal called Literacy. More specifically, it is volume 47, issue 2, of the

      journal that was published in July 2013. When you cite a source like this, you must include some or possibly all of the
      information about the source, depending upon the requirements of the citation style that you are using in your
      paper (MLA, APA, Chicago).
   The fourth element is a brief excerpt from the content of the text, such as part of the abstract or a summary of
      what the article is about.
   The fifth element tells you the type of source, in this case a journal article that is available in full text online.
   If you have a More information element, it may show you more information about the resource, including page
      numbers, DOI (Digital Object Identifier--like a URL that is unique for this article, but more permanent), and
      keywords used to describe the content of the article.

The next sample search result is for a book published in electronic format:

   The first element is the title of the book, including both the title proper, and following the colon, the subtitle of the
      book.

   The second element is a complete list of authors or creators displayed by last name, first name and middle initial,
      with individual creators separated by semi-colons. The presence of the More option indicates that one or more
      names are omitted from the display. (Note that it is unclear what roles these creators played. Are they editors,
      contributing editors, authors of a part of the book, or illustrators? Viewing the cover image or possibly the title page
      and table of contents may be necessary to clarify the roles of the named creators. It may not be necessary to name
      all of them depending on your chosen citation style.)

   The third element is the year of publication, 2013.
   The fourth element is a note about the book that in this case contains the beginnings of the list of contents, starting

      with part 1.
   The fifth element tells you the format i.e. this is an ebook that is available in full-text online.
In order to cite this work properly, you may need more information than what is shown. For example, the name of the
publisher is required by most citation styles. If your search engine includes a citation tool, you may find suggested ways to
cite this work. Remember that the suggested citation may contain errors and you should carefully verify the information
that it provides.

When Your Results are Limited or Inappropriate

 1. Check your spelling. You may have misspelled the terms. Consider also your use of hyphens or open and closed
      compound words. Have you included alternate spellings or accounted for differences in Canadian, British, or
      American spelling?

2. Try the search without using quotations around exact phrases, in case the search engine that you are using does
      not consistently support this level of searching.

3. Consider better terms to describe your concept. If you are unhappy with the search results for a term like post-
      secondary, try using an alternate such as higher education, or, try searching using the OR operator: post-secondary
      OR higher education.

4. If you used a geographic term such as the name of a country or geographic region in your search, re-try it without
      the geographic name. This should broaden your search and return more citations. If you have limited your results to
      Canada, you may find there is little published with a Canadian context--there may be a fair amount of articles about
      the topic in other countries like the United States or the United Kingdom (Great Britain), where the populations are
      larger.

5. If your thesis topic is very narrow or very current, there may not be very much published in scholarly journals at
      this time. You may want to consider revising your topic.

For very current topics, the types of publications that will be first to report on it are likely to be newspapers, social media
posts, and personal weblogs. Scholarly journal articles may appear months or even two years after they are submitted
to the editor of a journal. Books generally take even longer to write and get published. Therefore, you may not find
any scholarly articles that relate directly to your topic. In such circumstances, if peer-reviewed journal articles are a
requirement for the assignment, you may need to step back and look at a broader view of the topic to find other research
that you can apply to your own research topic.

   If you do a search for the thesis example from earlier in this chapter, you would probably find articles about the use
of graphic novels to teach reading comprehension in general, but not specifically for teaching graphic adaptations of the
dramatic works written by Shakespeare. You may be able to apply some of this general research to your own thesis. Or,
the research results may be about reading comprehension at the elementary level, not the secondary level. Again, you
may be able to apply these findings to your argument. You may find an article or book chapter that discusses the use
of graphic novels in teaching Renaissance literature in general but not specifically Shakespeare. Because Shakespeare
is generally considered to belong to the the Renaissance period, it may be safe to apply such findings about reading
comprehension of Renaissance literature toward William Shakespeare.

215 | Chapter Overview
Editing Your Two-Storey Thesis

In Chapter 7, we began the process of building an initial two-storey thesis statement based on our own argument. We will
revisit this thesis in a moment, but you may remember that it already seemed quite long and complex. However, we are
not yet done. We have chosen our key pieces of evidence, and we have formulated an analytical argument based on our
interpretation of this evidence. Now we need to move on to the third and most essential step: stating the significance of
this interpretation.

   First, however, let's review what we've got so far. If you recall, our prompt asks us to focus on ONE protest movement
and ONE social media as we consider how the Internet affects power dynamics between governments and citizens . We
have been asked to consider certain questions:

 1. What power dynamics does the Internet create between governments and citizens?
2. What is the role of the Internet in affecting the balance between governments and citizens?
3. In what ways are these technologies conducive to balancing or unbalancing these power dynamics?
4. Are these technologies useful or harmful?

As a comprehensive answer to these questions would probably involve thousands of pages of writing, we have narrowed
the prompt down and, as it asks us to do, focused on a single protest movement (Occupy Wall Street) and its use of a
single form of social media (Facebook). However, Occupy Wall Street's Facebook page contains a lot of information. We
have thus narrowed our focus down further by choosing one day (August 6th, 2016) and examining the activity on the
page pertaining to that day's post.

   Our exploration of the evidence we have found via this examination has allowed us to come up with the following
working two-storey thesis:

   Example

     First storey: Occupy Wall Street's Facebook page showcases that users of the page have a difficult and often
     frustrating time discussing, and perhaps linking, global events to events and concerns that are more local, and
     perhaps personal, to them. This is demonstrated by the comments under the post "From #Ferguson to #Gaza
     #BLM," wherein discussion of the event leads to participants calling each other names like "idiots" and angry
     confusion over how the Black Lives Matters is related to the Middle East (ex. The post "What the hell does BLM
     have to do with geopolitics in the Middle East?").
     Second storey: Such interaction on the page demonstrates that while Facebook pages do provide a useful tool
     for distributing information and bringing large communities together, users often end up using inflammatory,
     escalating or insulting language that stunts potential deeper discussions of the complex topics posted.

What we have so far is as follows:

 1. First storey: In our specific examination of the Facebook page, we have noticed something interesting about the
      way people are using the page. We have focused on the comments of one particular post that is fairly typical of the
      posts on this page: a post we can use to represent something larger than itself, as other posts (and comments) on

                                                                                                                                         Editing Your Two-Storey Thesis | 216
      the page operate in similar ways. We have therefore given ourselves access to specific evidence that we will
      eventually use to develop conclusions with a wider application. We are going to answer the questions in the prompt,
      but if we jump to broad answers too soon, we risk ignoring the evidence at hand in favour of vague opinions or
      assumptions. We are instead focusing on the narrow evidence of our central example. It's worth noting that this
      narrow evidence doesn't speak directly to the issue raised by our prompt; therefore, leaping immediately to "This
      says X about government/citizen power dynamics" would be premature and leave our readers confused.
2. Second storey: The evidence alone is not a thesis. It is interesting, but why is it interesting? What does it tell us? In
      our second storey, we take our specific evidence and interpret it. It is important to note that not everyone who
      gathers this evidence will interpret it in the same way. Others might see other aspects of the evidence as more
      important or decide that it has a different meaning. However, these others will still be focusing closely on the
      evidence.
This will not be our essay's final thesis. We are, at this stage, just beginning our examination of the evidence. As we
continue to think about it and to incorporate secondary research, which we will discuss below, our thesis will develop
and become more complex.
   At this stage, we should pause for a moment and evaluate what we have so far. As we have discussed, editing must take
place throughout the essay-writing process, not simply at the end.

Adding a Third Storey

Now that we have our central evidence (first storey) and our initial interpretation of that evidence (second storey), it is
time to move on to the third storey. As you know from your close reading, the third storey can be tricky. In a nutshell,
the third storey deals with the significance of our first and second storeys. We have identified some key evidence and
presented an interpretation of that evidence, but to tie everything together, we need to explain why our interpretation is
important.

   In order to do so, we need to connect our interpretation of specific evidence to the larger implications of that
interpretation. The impulse to go broad, not narrow, will be satisfied in the third storey, with one caveat: the fact that
we're dealing with larger implications doesn't mean we can forget about our evidence. The third storey needs to be
connected firmly to the first and second.

                                                             From Pixabay.

In this type of essay, the content of the third storey will necessarily vary depending on the kind of approach the writer
has taken to the evidence. Perhaps the third storey will provide the solution to a problem raised in the second storey,
or an observation that this problem has no solution (and why). Perhaps the argument in the second storey will lead to
a surprising realization about the meaning of the evidence in relation to the larger issue it represents. The third storey
should, in a way, be satisfying: not broad and simple, but a revelation that will demonstrate that the thinking we have
done in this essay provides insight into the issue we are exploring.

   To move towards the third storey, look at the second storey and ask:
   What is the significance of the conclusions you have drawn from the evidence?
   Why does your second storey matter? Why is it important that you have interpreted the evidence in this way?
   How do the specific observations and argument you have made connect to the larger issue you are discussing?
   What does your second storey reveal?
If we look back at the second storey about Occupy Wall St.'s Facebook page, we can begin formulating possible answers to
these questions. It's important to note that the third storey we come up with at this point will not be the final version. We
have not yet taken our secondary research into account, and we have a lot more work to do with our primary evidence as

                                                                                                                                                       Adding a Third Storey | 220
well. As we work at analyzing our evidence and applying secondary ideas to it, the thesis will inevitably change, becoming
more complex and specific. However, even at this early stage, it's important that we not take refuge in generalities. Our
new third storey will be as complex and specific as we can make it.

   Example

     FIRST STOREY: Occupy Wall Street's Facebook page showcases that users of the page have a difficult and often
     frustrating time discussing, and perhaps linking, global events to events and concerns that are more local, and
     perhaps personal, to them. This is demonstrated by the comments under the post "From #Ferguson to #Gaza
     #BLM," wherein discussion of the event leads to participants calling each other names like "idiots" and angry
     confusion over how the Black Lives Matters is related to the Middle East (ex. The post "What the hell does BLM
     have to do with geopolitics in the Middle East?").

                                                                                                                                                                     Watch This! | 222
     SECOND STOREY: Such interaction on the page demonstrates that while Facebook pages do provide a useful tool
     for distributing information and bringing large communities together, users often end up using inflammatory,
     escalating or insulting language that stunts potential deeper discussions of the complex topics posted.
     THIRD STOREY: The Occupy Wall Street Facebook page's tendency to strengthen local connections while
     potentially simplifying and weakening links to larger social and political contexts with inflammatory language
     acts as an indicator that despite the increased reach of an online community, the divisive discussions among its
     users are likely to affect its ability to influence governmental policy and provide a base for civilian power. Users
     who wish to turn the Internet into an effective tool for providing a counterpoint to corrupt, dictatorial, or simply
     misguided governments will need to address this simplification and attempt to ensure that the broad reach of the
     social-media platform does not replace the broadness in scope of the movement itself.
Notice that this third storey does not lose sight of the first and second storeys that precede it. It deals with more than just
the Occupy Wall Street Facebook page but is ultimately rooted in your observations about that page. This particular third
storey acknowledges the problem identified in the first storey and analyzed in the second storey, then explains what this
problem means in the context of the broader issue.

     Take your own two-storey thesis and come up with a potential third storey. Remember that your third storey may,
     at this point, be a little less specific than you would like it to be, though that doesn't mean you shouldn't try for as
     much specificity as possible.
     Ask yourself the following questions:

         1. Look back at the questions posed in your prompt. Have you answered some of them? All of them? If you
             haven't answered some of them, why are these answers missing? Can you revise your third storey to
             address them?

        2. Are you having a hard time coming up with a third storey? If so, you may need to look back at your first
             and second storeys. Are they specific enough? Does your second storey provide you with a genuine
             argument? Is a certain vagueness in your approach making it difficult to identify the meaning of your
             argument?

        3. Does your three-storey thesis give you something concrete to discuss? Can you imagine the discussion
             going on for eight double-spaced pages? Can you imagine concentrating on your central document on
             every one of those pages instead of quickly abandoning it and moving towards a more general and
             opinion-based discussion?

By the end of this exercise, you should have an initial three-storey thesis. It will not be perfect. It will, and must, change
as you continue to work on the essay. However, it will give you a starting point, a sort of base camp from which to venture
out as you continue to explore.

The Three-Storey Thesis: The Importance of
Outlining

The Outline: Basics

The third question in the previous section asked whether you could imagine your discussion of your central document
continuing throughout your paper. If you answered "yes" to that question, you can test your assertion by drafting an
outline.

   In Chapter 4, we spent some time writing a detailed outline of our close reading. As that chapter explains, an outline
will save you time later in the essay-writing process because it acts as your roadmap. Picturing the outline as a map can
be useful. Just as a map will provide you with an overview of many possible routes to your destination, allowing you to
work out which ones to avoid and which ones will get you most quickly and effectively to your destination, an outline
will highlight potential roadblocks (tangents, ideas without evidence behind them, ideas that go nowhere, undeveloped
points, weak points that rely on opinion, etc.) while also revealing promising connections. The outline allows you to see
where you're going and decide on the best way to get there. If you eventually decide the approach in your outline is
flawed, you can modify it later.

   In the case of a research essay, the outline has another function as well: it will demonstrate which aspects of your
argument currently lack secondary evidence. You have spent some time with your primary document, but you have not
incorporated your research. We'll begin discussing research and how to work with it in our next section. For now, just
keep it in mind as you move through the outline.

   Chapter 4 includes the suggestion that your essay's outline follow the trajectory of
your three-storey thesis. This remains a good method of organization. Keep in mind,
however, that there is no one cookie-cutter method for structuring an essay. If your
impulse is to look at the sample outlines in these chapters and follow them exactly, you
are relying too strongly on the idea that an essay should follow a formula. An essay
does not have a set number of paragraphs, and sometimes, taking a structure-based
risk--for instance, spending some time on what appears to be a tangent, but turns out
to provide an essential part of your argument--can be very effective.

   As we move through the outline, we'll begin to acknowledge an element that did not
turn up in Chapter 4's outlining exercise: research. We'll be discussing research in
more detail in the next section, where we'll also go more deeply into how you might
incorporate it into your essay. For now, as we go over an outline based on the three-
storey thesis we constructed above, we will simply acknowledge the potential for From Pixabay.
research. When a point seems as if it might need some research, we'll make note of it.
Don't worry: we'll revisit these notes in the next section. As you read, try to think about
why the essay may need secondary support in particular paragraphs.

225 | The Three-Storey Thesis: The Importance of Outlining
Introduction

The introduction of a research essay has the same basic purpose as the introduction of a close reading: to explain your
initial argument as specifically and with as much complexity as possible, on the understanding that it will be even more
complex and nuanced by the essay's conclusion. However, it is also in your introduction that you will first have a chance
to incorporate the most important of your secondary sources: the ones that are key to your argument.

   As you outline your introduction, consider the same questions that likely arose when you wrote your close reading:

   Do you get to your argument relatively quickly? You'll have more room in this essay than you did in your shorter
      close reading, but perhaps not as much as you think. It may be tempting to start very expansively, with two
      introductory paragraphs:one in which you discuss the problem behind the essay in detail, another in which you
      offer the solution to that problem. However, if you do so, you risk beginning with a paragraph in which, argument-
      wise, nothing happens. Your introduction is a good opportunity to lay the foundations for your argument, quickly
      taking the reader to a place in which the argument can be complex and specific.

   Do you introduce your argument's main subject as well as its context? The temptation here is often to start
      extremely broadly ("Since the dawn of time, humans have communicated with each other"; "Throughout human
      history, people have formed social groups"). This sort of "universal opener" may feel like a way of putting your
      argument in context, but it tends to be far too broad. If you are analysing one post on one Facebook page, it is not
      necessary to begin at the dawn of time.

   On the other hand, contextualizing your argument is a good idea. Begin, perhaps, with the larger problem you are
      discussing, then move swiftly to your specific body of evidence. Remember that your third storey will acknowledge
      the connection of your body of evidence to the larger issue it represents. An acknowledgement of the larger issue in
      your introduction will give you something to circle back to.

   Have you explained the essentials of your complex, specific argument? You will be fleshing out this argument in the
      body of your essay, and it will appear in its complete form in your conclusion. It may be tempting to begin by
      "hiding" your argument, saving it for a revelation in your conclusion. However, a clear argument will itself provide a
      roadmap for the rest of your essay. It won't tell the reader the exact twists and turns of the discussion, but it will
      give you something concrete to develop into an even more interesting thesis.

   Research-Related Considerations: Have you incorporated your secondary research into your thesis in such a way
      that it provides an insight into your unique argument? We'll return to this concept later on.

                                                                                                                                                                    Introduction | 226
Body

You may recall that in Chapter 4, our outline mimicked the shape of the three-storey thesis itself, with early paragraphs
dealing in detail with the specific evidence we were examining, paragraphs in the middle of the paper leaning further
into interpreting that evidence, and the final body paragraphs providing the revelation of the second storey's ultimate
significance. A similar structure will work here as well, though again, be aware that when you become more comfortable
with essay structure, you may choose to play around with it for the sake of your argument's efficiency and effect.

   For now, we'll be starting with the same basic trajectory as Chapter 4. Note, however, that because this essay is longer,
we will be using more paragraphs. It is worth noting that you need not stick with the number of paragraphs you come up
with in your outline. Your approach may shift over time as you research and draft your essay.

227 | Body
First Storey

   Example

     FIRST STOREY: Occupy Wall Street's Facebook page showcases that users of the page have a difficult and often
     frustrating time discussing, and perhaps linking, global events to events and concerns that are more local, and
     perhaps personal, to them. This is demonstrated by the comments under the post "From #Ferguson to #Gaza
     #BLM," wherein discussion of the event leads to participants calling each other names like "idiots" and angry
     confusion over how the Black Lives Matters is related to the Middle East (ex. The post "What the hell does BLM
     have to do with geopolitics in the Middle East?").

Our first storey has provided us with the key evidence we will be examining in our argumentative essay. As in the close
reading, our essay should be evidence-based, which means we must examine this material as closely as we did the article
we analyzed earlier in the course. Dedicate some paragraphs to exploring the evidence closely. The beginning of our
essay's body might look something like this:

          Paragraph 1: Examine and discuss the comments in terms of their statistical make-up (i.e., what proportion of the
       comments are dedicated to local problems, and what might that tell us?).

          Paragraphs 2 & 3: Examine and discuss particular key comments (those related, in this case, to the name calling or
       questions/confusion linking Black Lives Matter to the Middle East) in terms of their specific content and phrasing.

          Paragraph 4: In contrast to the comments discussed above, examine the elements in the comments section that
       break away--or appear to try to break away--from local concerns in order to deal with larger implications.

          Research-Related Considerations: Examine and discuss the evidence above in terms of external research on the
       larger problem you are exploring.
   When we return to the concept of research in the next section, we will discuss some of the things we might do with it.
Maybe it will get a dedicated paragraph of its own. Maybe it will be spread throughout the three paragraphs. However, for
now, remember that we must ultimately look at our evidence in terms of supporting material. This material will not pull
us away from our examination of our evidence; it will give us insight into the evidence we are discussing.

                                                                                                                                                                     First Storey | 228
Second Storey

   Example

     SECOND STOREY: Such interaction on the page demonstrates that while Facebook pages do provide a useful tool
     for distributing information and bringing large communities together, users often end up using inflammatory,
     escalating or insulting language that stunts potential deeper discussions of the complex topics posted.

We have looked closely at our evidence. Now we need to move a step further in our interpretation of it. If we go through
our second storey carefully, we can see which aspects of it offer concrete ideas that can be discussed further in relation to
the evidence; we can also arrange these aspects into an order conducive to moving our argument forward. For instance,
we might consider arranging the next few paragraphs as follows:

          Paragraph 5: Discuss the function of this particular post as an information distributor and community unifier
       by concentrating on the identities (where apparent) and/or stated aims of the commenters. Are they treating it
       primarily as a source of information? A place where a wider community can come together? Something else?

          Paragraph 6: Explain the patterns you have found in the comments as an effect of the social space itself. If many
       of the comments seem insular, why might they be so? If the broader community seems disunified, what in the post
       and/or the comment section is allowing the insularity of the sub-communities within the larger community to
       remain?

          Paragraph 7: Draw in elements that seem not to fit. Not all the comments are insular. How are those that are not
       insular treated by the group? Are they ignored? Do they contribute to the conversation? Do they ever come from
       the same people who post the insular comments, or do they originate from a distinct sub-community?

          Paragraph 8: Discuss the effect of the online community's structure in light of the idea of the Facebook page's
       purpose. Do the patterns you have found confirm or deny the "usefulness" of the page? What, in this context, does
       "usefulness" mean? Is the word itself becoming inadequate (i.e., too vague and general) for your purposes?

          Research-Related Considerations: Apply broader secondary perspectives to this specific example in order to gain
       insight into what it demonstrates.
   Notice that while we are still working with the evidence introduced in our first storey, we are now asking more specific
questions about it. How does it work? Why does it do X? What is its effect? How do the different puzzle pieces you have
collected fit together? We are also introducing a few nudges towards our third storey. We have not quite asked what the
ultimate significance of our observations is yet, but we're getting there.

229 | Second Storey
Third Storey

   Example

     THIRD STOREY: The Occupy Wall Street Facebook page's tendency to strengthen local connections while
     potentially simplifying and weakening links to larger social and political contexts with inflammatory language
     acts as an indicator that despite the increased reach of an online community, the divisive discussions among its
     users are likely to affect its ability to influence governmental policy and provide a base for civilian power. Users
     who wish to turn the Internet into an effective tool for providing a counterpoint to corrupt, dictatorial, or simply
     misguided governments will need to address this simplification and attempt to ensure that the broad reach of the
     social-media platform does not replace the broadness in scope of the movement itself.

Our second storey digs deeply into the material at hand and examines some of the effects of how it works. Our third
storey is what we get when we then ask, "And...?" All of this information is interesting, but if we stop with our second
storey, we're asking our readers to draw conclusions from our observations. Instead, we must move towards some
understanding of what our observations mean.

          Paragraph 9: Draw conclusions from your evidence as it relates to the page itself. Moving on from the idea of
       "usefulness" in paragraph 8, discuss what "use" the comments have (they allow users to connect over local issues)
       and what "use" they fail to have (they de-emphasize larger issues, which are obscured by the localization of user
       concerns).

          Paragraph 10: In light of this concept, return to the idea of social media as an influencer of government policy. Is
       there a disconnect? What does it mean? Does this disconnect seem rooted in the structure of the page, the identities
       of the users, the culture that has formed around this particular form of social media, or something else? How do you
       know? And...?

          Paragraph 11: Zoom in on a possible reason for the disconnect: the tendency of social media's reach to reveal the
       rhetoric being used within in-groups. Turn this, potentially, into a call to action regarding future use of social media
       in social and political activism.

          Research-Related Considerations: While it's unlikely you will introduce new research at this point, you may use
       this section to return to some of the research you have cited previously to emphasize its significance or repeat it in
       light of the more complex conclusions you have reached.
   Here we have circled back to the larger question without losing sight of our specific evidence. We have also uncovered
some unexpected issues along the way, including the seemingly contradictory observation that broad reach does not
necessarily equal broad effect. As we move through our second and third storeys, we need to delve beneath the surface
instead of latching onto the first easy answer and repeating it in every paragraph.

                                                                                                                                                                    Third Storey | 230
Conclusion

Your conclusion is where you bring everything together in a way that would not have been possible in your introduction.
As you know, you should not simply repeat the points you have already made. The reader has just finished reading those
points; if you make them again more concisely immediately after you have made them in depth, the reader will see
only repetition, not development. However, you can, in your conclusion, provide a "This is where it all comes together"
moment. This is where the completed puzzle appears in all its glory, and you state its implications succinctly.

Now take a look at our outline all at once. This is what we've got:
          Introduction: Present and contextualize the initial complex thesis.
          Paragraph 1 (First Storey): Examine and discuss the comments in terms of their statistical make-up (i.e., what

       proportion of the comments are dedicated to local problems, and what might that tell us?).
          Paragraphs 2 & 3 (First Storey): Examine and discuss particular key comments (those related, in this case, to the

       name calling or questions/confusion linking Black Lives Matter to the Middle East) in terms of their specific content
       and phrasing.

          Paragraph 4 (First Storey): In contrast to the comments discussed above, examine the elements in the comments
       section that break away--or appear to try to break away--from local concerns in order to deal with larger implication.

          [Research-Related Considerations: Examine and discuss the evidence above in terms of external research on the
       larger problem you are exploring.]

          Paragraph 5 (Second Storey): Discuss the function of this particular post as an information distributor and

       Are they treating it primarily as a source of information? A place where a wider community can come together?
       Something else?

          Paragraph 6 (Second Storey): Explain the patterns you have found in the comments as an effect of the social space
       itself. If many of the comments seem insular, why might they be so? If the broader community seems disunified,
       what in the post and/or the comment section is allowing the insularity of the sub-communities within the larger
       community to remain?

          Paragraph 7 (Second Storey): Draw in elements that seem not to fit. Not all the comments are insular. How are
       those that are not insular treated by the group? Are they ignored? Do they contribute to the conversation? Do
       they ever come from the same people who post the insular comments, or do they originate from a distinct sub-
       community?

          Paragraph 8 (Second Storey): Discuss the effect of the online community's structure in light of the idea of the
       Facebook page's purpose. Do the patterns you have found confirm or deny the "usefulness" of the page? What, in
       this context, does "usefulness" mean? Is the word itself becoming inadequate (i.e., too vague and general) for your
       purposes?

          [Research-Related Considerations: Apply broader secondary perspectives to this specific example in order to
       gain insight into what it demonstrates.]

          Paragraph 9 (Third Storey): Draw conclusions from your evidence as it relates to the page itself. Moving on from
       the idea of "usefulness" in paragraph 8, discuss what "use" the comments have (they allow users to connect over local
       issues) and what "use" they fail to have (they de-emphasize larger issues, which are obscured by the localization of
       user concerns).

          Paragraph 10 (Third Storey): In light of this concept, return to the idea of social media as an influencer of
       government policy. Is there a disconnect? What does it mean? Does this disconnect seem rooted in the structure
       of the page, the identities of the users, the culture that has formed around this particular form of social media, or

          Conclusion: Bring the elements of your argument together in such a way that you can present their implications.
   As we move from the development of our initial three-storey thesis to the drafting of our essay, the outline can, as
Chapter 4 points out, serve as a bridge between the two stages. However, it can also show us areas of our argument that
currently seem vague or repetitive: areas that may need more support and development. In the next section, we will be
discussing what the outline can mean in terms of the incorporation of research into your paper.

Research: First Steps

The Research Essay

When we hear the words "research essay" or "research assignment," our first impulse may be to think of a work that

that takes other people's ideas and sews them together into a single document: a sort of patchwork quilt. However, a

good research essay operates rather differently. "Research" is not an excuse to coast on the knowledge of others but an

opportunity to use that knowledge to support and add complexity to our own original ideas.

                                     The word "support" is often used in conjunction with

                                     research, and it is a good place to start. Let's unpack the word a

                                     little. What does it mean to "support" an argument?

                                     We've already seen some examples of support happening

                                     earlier in this text. An argument is not complete without

                                     evidence to back it up. However, as you will notice as you move

                                     through these chapters, using evidence in support of an

                                     argument is not as simple as just presenting it, then standing

                                     back and letting the reader figure out what it means.

                                     Supporting evidence must be developed. Support is more than

                                     the evidence itself. It consists of the evidence and the

                                     interpretation of that evidence. If you make an assertion on its

Photo by Ron Dyar on Unsplash        own, you have an argument without evidence: an opinion. If
                                     you make an assertion and follow it with a list of evidence, you

                                     have an argument without development: an observation. If you

                                     make an assertion and follow it with a detailed discussion of

                                     how and why the evidence demonstrates its validity, you have

an argument with support: a thesis.

In a research essay, you must expand your consideration of evidence beyond your own close reading. Therefore, you

must also expand your understanding of "support" to include not just an interpretation of your primary work but an

interpretation of secondary works that you will apply to your primary work. These secondary sources are not the primary

focus of your investigation, but they can be used to give you insight into this investigation: insight you would not gain

with a simple close reading.

Let's take a look at a few common types of evidence and how they might be used in a research essay.

                                                                                            Research: First Steps | 236
Research Types

The opposite of a patchwork research paper--a paper in which the writer sews together other people's ideas to create a
single work--is what we might call a "nominal research paper": a paper in which secondary sources are shoehorned in,
that is, used superficially because research is a requirement, not because they have been incorporated into the writer's
argument. To avoid both the patchwork error and the shoehorn error, you must understand how you are using your
research. It is therefore useful to think of research in terms of types.

   Think back to our project on Occupy Wall St.'s Facebook page. We already have our primary source: the post and
comments we are examining closely in the essay. We have noticed a lot of things by close reading this source, and we
have come up with a potentially solid thesis and a detailed outline. Are there any kinds of external information that might
help us make our thesis even better?

237 | Research Types
Corroborate, Contrast, Contextualize

When you are searching for sources to help you support your argument, resist the impulse to look only for documents
that pertain to your exact subject matter. Sometimes, students will be frustrated because they have searched exact terms,
such as "Occupy Wall Street" AND "Facebook," and have come up with nothing. However, remember that you are creating
your own unique argument. Trying to find papers that have made exactly the same argument you want to make will nudge
you towards the "patchwork" model and away from the opportunity to put together something new and interesting of
your own.

   Instead, look for papers on similar subjects or on the broader categories into which your specific discussion fits. Other
writers interested in social media and its use in protest movements will have produced papers on the subject. Exploration
of this material can be very profitable for you.

   You may find material that corroborates yours. If Author A's paper on some other protest movement's use of social
media has come to conclusions that seem to confirm your own (when you consider both papers in light of the broader
subject), you might present some of Author A's research and compare it closely to your own.

   You may find material that contrasts with yours. This material is just as valuable as the corroborating material. Perhaps
you can use it to explore the differences between the contexts of the two discussions (is Author B examining a different
type of social media or a different variety of protest movement? Did the users approach the social media in a different
way? Did the protest movement originate from a different social context or cultural background? Is Author B herself
working from assumptions that are fundamentally different from yours, or does Author B's paper genuinely offer a
complication you will have to take into consideration as you revise and refine your thesis?).

   You may find material that contextualizes yours. Perhaps Author C has written a paper on the history of protest
movements, or on the way communities seem to work online, or on social upheaval and the Internet, or on Occupy
Wall Street's origins and modus operandi. All four of these subjects are relevant to your paper, but they are also broader
in scope. It is often very helpful to look at secondary research on the categories to which your primary document
belongs. You will, for instance, be able to discuss the Occupy Wall Street Facebook page more knowledgeably if you know
something about Occupy Wall Street.

   Corroboration, contrast, and contextualization will all give you ways of approaching your subject matter that would
remain inaccessible to you if you limited yourself to a close reading. The secondary works you consult will provide
factual information you would not otherwise have, as well as analytical ideas that come from perspectives that might not
otherwise have occurred to you. You do need to be careful that you are engaging with these works instead of merely
replicating them, but we'll discuss this issue in more detail below.

   Our three "c" terms are still rather broad. Let's break them down a little and look at some more specific types of
information you will find in your sources.

                                                                                                                                 Corroborate, Contrast, Contextualize | 238
Definitions

We'll be discussing the Facebook page in the context of some larger questions about protest movements and social
media, and therefore, we'll probably need to use some specialized vocabulary: vocabulary that doesn't count as common
knowledge. We may find it helpful to define our terms.

   In the age of the Internet, definitions may seem easy to come by, but we need to be careful. It's a little too easy to do a
Google search on a key term and scoop up the first definition we find. Dictionary definitions are rarely used in academic
papers, simply because they are usually very general and brief. If we are using a term specialized enough that it needs
a definition, a dictionary definition will be far too broad for our purposes. Like all types of research, definitions should
appear in a paper for a reason, not simply to take up space.

   More specific definitions can be found in scholarly works that deal in detail with the broader subject matter we are
applying to our primary example. In this case, perhaps our library research has turned up a paper by Author D on the
use of social media during the Arab Spring, and the paper's author has written of something she calls "social resistance."
You realize when you read the paper that though the author is speaking of an entirely different movement using the
Internet in a different way, we have been discussing the concept of "social resistance" as applied to the Occupy Wall
Street movement. We would thus take our definition (properly cited) from the paper on the Arab Spring. Our definition
will be much more detailed and appropriate than it would be if we went to Dictionary.com, for example, and looked up
the words "social" and "resistance" in turn. If we did that, the definition cobbled together would be much vaguer. It would
also not provide us with something even more interesting: the opportunity to relate our argument to the argument made
by Author D.

239 | Definitions
Data and Statistics

   When you are examining the Occupy Wall Street page, you may collect
data of your own. For instance, you could count insular comments and
comments broader in scope, then compare the two numbers. The
comparison will tell you something about the specific document you are
examining.

   However, while our data will be useful in a discussion of our specific
evidence, it may not help as much when we go to connect our primary
document to our broader subject matter. That is where other people's data
and statistics will come in handy. Say Author E has made an exhaustive study
of how American political activists use Twitter. The subject matter of his
paper is not exactly the same as yours, but his statistics may be used to
corroborate yours (if they seem to support what your own data and
observations reveal), contrast yours (perhaps Twitter and Facebook operate
in different enough ways that it will be instructive for you to examine the From Pixabay.
differences between the two sets of data), or contextualise yours (if the
statistics are broad enough for your data to fit within them).

                                                A statistic is not the same thing as an
                                             inarguable fact; data can be manipulated or
                                             presented in biased ways. It is therefore important not simply to present statistics and
                                             move on but instead carefully examine the works in which they appear. Where is Author
                                             E getting his data? Does he present it confidently or cautiously? Does he cite the
                                             statistics of others, or does he allow his statistics to stand alone? Always ask questions
                                             about the material you cite, and always be aware that this material is being presented by
                                             human beings, not machines. Like you, the authors on whom you are drawing are
                                             interpreting the material at hand, not simply announcing a series of facts.

"Factual" Material

We are putting the word "factual" in quotation marks here because we need to be careful about what we treat as a fact
in an analytical paper. Let's say you are reading Author F's expository paper on the origins of Occupy Wall Street. She is
going to present a lot of factual material, including dates, names, and descriptions of events to which there were many
witnesses. Yet Author F's paper will inevitably involve interpretation. Perhaps she goes into extreme detail about the
movement but spares only a few sentences for the opposition to the movement. A casual reader might assume there was
not much opposition instead of recognizing that Author F has simply left it out (which she may have done for any number
of reasons).

   Students sometimes ask why they must cite secondary sources containing factual material so well-known that it
appears in hundreds of sources. One good reason is that while there are hundreds of sources that contain the
information, all of them present it in subtly different ways. Our readers need to know which sources we are drawing on
so they can evaluate our work in light of the quality of our sources. As well, we need to be able to decide, while reading a
source, what is fact and what is interpretation. It is thus a good idea to consult more than one source when we are looking
for factual information.

   It is also worth noting that citation demonstrates to the reader that we have not simply made up a piece of information.

241 | "Factual" Material
Analysis

Almost all of the types of sources mentioned above--corroborative, contrastive, contextualising, and containing
definitions, data, statistics, or facts--will ultimately be analytical in nature. As we have discussed, no matter how you are
using a source, you will need to take its interpretive elements into consideration. However, can a source be used primarily
for its analysis?

   Analytical material will certainly be useful to you, and you are encouraged to draw on it. Yet such material can cause
problems when used in certain ways. The next section will go into more detail about how to incorporate other authors'
analysis while still ensuring that your argument remains your own.

                                                                                                                                                                          Analysis | 242
Engaging With Research

Whether an analytical work is extremely specific or sweepingly broad, it will tend to constitute an interpretation of
evidence leading to a conclusion: an argument. You are already familiar with this concept, as you have been working with
it throughout the course. It is important to remember, as you work with sources, that their authors are writing arguments,
not reporting inarguable fact. It is equally important to remember that these arguments belong to their authors. You may
draw on them, but you must avoid adopting them in place of an argument of your own.

   Research will help you explore various aspects of your thesis. What it will not do is provide you with an argument. When
you draw on a source, you are doing so because it allows you some insight into your own unique argument; you are not
adopting someone else's argument and "proving" it via your own data. Imagine Author G has come up with an argument
about why social media is not an effective tool in protest movements. If we read this argument and decide that now our
argument is also, "Social media is not an effective tool in protest movements," and we demonstrate it by presenting data
that backs it up, all we are doing is adding to Author G's body of evidence and thus arguing his point for him.

   Engaging with research requires us to analyze research material just as we do our primary document. Author G has put
together an interesting argument, but he's used specific evidence and interpreted it in a specific way. Why has he chosen
this approach? What assumptions lie behind his argument? Is that argument as simple as it seems on the surface? The
close-reading skills you learned in the first half of this course are relevant here, as close reading your secondary sources
will help you discover how they will be useful to you.

   Once we do understand Author G's approach, we incorporate his work into our paper by treating it as what it is:
an argument. If we quote or paraphrase Author G, we don't simply leave the cited material sitting in the middle of
our paragraph and move on without comment. We use it. We comment on how one of Author G's ideas applies to our
evidence. We remark on the discrepancies between his approach and ours. We can take one of his ideas further or in
a different direction. We could disagree with one of his points, then explain how this disagreement strengthens our
argument.

   Secondary evidence is still evidence; its meaning and its significance to your argument remains unclear until you
interpret it.

243 | Engaging With Research
The Scholarly Concept

One especially useful type of secondary source is a type that provides you with a scholarly concept. Let's spend a moment
defining this term.

   A scholarly concept is what you get when you take an author's idea or theoretical approach and apply it to your own
primary material. Again, this is not the same thing as adopting someone else's argument and plugging your evidence into
it. It is more like performing an experiment with the same tools used by another scientist, though in the process, you
approach the tools themselves critically instead of taking them for granted.

   An example may help clarify this definition:
   Imagine Author H has written an article on the 2017 Women's March as a viral phenomenon. Using her knowledge of
feminist theory in combination with her knowledge of the Internet as a communal space, she has examined the protest as
both a physical and a virtual phenomenon, then unpacked the significance of her observations. Her article is not taking
the same approach as yours, and the broad issues it examines are a bit different, but the combination of feminist theory
and the exploration of the Internet as a community has provided us, potentially, with a scholarly concept: a theoretical
approach we can extract from Author H's article and apply to our paper. We ask ourselves the question: "If I take this
idea that Author H has had and look at my evidence in light of it, what will happen?" The results will probably not mimic
Author H's exactly, and we don't want them to do so. We are using the scholarly concept to cast a certain type of light on
our subject matter; we are not writing Author H's paper for her or allowing her to write ours.
   Author H's paper is still an argument, and we are still going to interpret it as we go. We are not going to take it at face
value; in fact, even as we are adopting Author H's scholarly concept, we may find that we disagree with some or all of her
argument. Again, we are using Author H's material, not simply reproducing it.
   The idea of the scholarly concept will come up again in later chapters. For now, practice thinking of research not as a
source of facts or arguments you can borrow but as a source of ideas you can apply.

                                                                                                                                                      The Scholarly Concept | 244
Questions to Ask

When you are exploring the ways in which research might fit into your work, it is often useful to ask yourself a series of
pointed questions. These questions will prompt you to think of research as more than something that needs to be plugged
in at the last minute; they will encourage you to think in terms of the research improving your argument and making it
more complex.

   You can come up with your own list of questions, but here are some that may help you on your way:
 1. What concepts am I discussing that may need to be defined? What might be some good (complex, specific) sources

      in which to find these definitions?
2. What aspects of my thesis might be strengthened via the use of data and statistics?
3. What aspects of my thesis might be strengthened via a focus on historical or factual information about the broader

      categories into which my primary example fits?
4. What aspects of my thesis might benefit from the introduction of alternative perspectives (arguments that seem to

      contradict mine, arguments regarding related but distinct subject matter, etc.)?
5. Where in my thesis would use of a scholarly concept be beneficial?

245 | Questions to Ask
Application

In terms of the three-storey thesis and outline we've been working with in this chapter, we can try answering these
questions. The answers will give us at least a broad idea of the kinds of sources we might consider looking for when we
research this paper. We can refine our answers as we progress through the writing of the paper. Just for instance, at the
beginning of the research and development process, the terms that need to be defined will probably be fairly general
ones. Later, as we become more knowledgeable about our subject matter, more specific terms can come into play.

   1. What concepts am I discussing that may need to be defined? What might be some good (complex, specific) sources in
which to find these definitions?

   So far, terms of interest to us might be: "social media," "protest movement," "community," "insularity." Note that all these
terms have dictionary definitions. We are, however, interested in using the terms more specifically. To define them in
more detail, we can look for scholarly articles on related subjects: community and the Internet, the social aspects of social
media, protest as a social force, community as inwardly focused. As we search, we may find better, more specific terms
to replace or refine these general ones.

   2. What aspects of my thesis might be strengthened via the use of data and statistics?
   We are examining the content of the comments section, but we're also paying some attention to how it is structured,
how many comments derive from each sub-community, etc. Perhaps finding comparable studies of other protest
movements and/or other forms of social media will help us. We could also search for articles on social media that do not
relate to protest or political change. A comparison between the behaviour of social activists online and, say, the behaviour
of fans of the television series Game of Thrones might prove instructive. What would it mean if we found similar patterns?
What would it mean if the patterns we found differed radically? Wider statistical studies can also be helpful, as they allow
you to contextualize your own small study, examining how (and if) if fits into the wider pattern. Therefore, look for articles
that takes statistics-based approaches both to comparable studies on specific documents and wider studies on larger
patterns.
   3. What aspects of my thesis might be strengthened via a focus on historical or factual information about the broader
categories into which my primary example fits?
   We are studying one Facebook post on the Occupy Wall St. Page. The post itself gives us a body of evidence with
which to work, but it doesn't tell us much about Occupy Wall St. as a movement. We might do some reading on the
movement. Examining the Occupy Wall St. web presence will help, but so will finding scholarly articles on the movement's
development. While we may not use all the information we uncover, it will provide us with some context for our
discussion.
   We don't, however, need to stop there. We could read up on the Internet and protest movements, the way Facebook
(as opposed to other forms of social media) tends to be used by protest movements (or, in comparison, by other groups),
or the different ways in which official groups (such as governments) and counter-cultural groups (such as protest-based
organizations) use social media. Again, we won't use all this information, and we'll have to resist the urge to repeat it
rather than apply it, but understanding of context can be a great help in this kind of research paper.
   4. What aspects of my thesis might benefit from the introduction of alternative perspectives (arguments that seem to
contradict mine, arguments regarding related but distinct subject matter, etc.)?
   Is it possible to see the insularity we have found in this comments section as less of a weakness than we think it is? We
might search specifically for sources that treat community insularity as a strength. Perhaps we'll eventually refute these
sources, or perhaps we'll be able to incorporate their perspectives into our thesis, producing something more complex
and subtle than "insularity is here, and it's a problem."
   5. Where in my thesis would use of a scholarly concept be beneficial?
   We need to look for aspects of our approach that currently seem vague or lacking in focus. What elements of our

                                                                                                                                                                      Application | 246
thesis would benefit from the application of a specific theoretical concept? In this case, we might consider looking
for articles on communities and how they work. The study of communities and communication between and within
communities is a major scholarly area. Because our paper--when we drill down to its essence--is really about communities
and communication, a specific article dealing with this subject may offer us a theoretical perspective that will allow us to
apply relevant concepts to our body of evidence and see what happens.

In this chapter, we have taken Chapter 7's two-storey thesis and added a third storey, which we have used to create a
working outline for our essay. In addition, we have started to to consider how we might incorporate research into our
paper. Notice that we have not yet modified our thesis or our outline in view of our research; the placeholders remain.
However, we can see how the modifications could eventually happen. In Chapter 10, we will be examining in more detail
how research can be incorporated into the thesis and the essay's body.

standing on the shoulders of giants." When we reflect upon Newton's output in the fields of mathematics, astronomy, and
physics, it rather quickly becomes apparent that Newton was himself a giant whose broad shoulders are forever crowded
by thousands gazing into a distance he has made visible. As Newton's own self-assessment reveals, he became a giant not
through some solitary moment of inspiration, but through joining and furthering the ongoing conversation.

   Discourse--the respectful reception of other ideas and the reflective response to them--is the lifeblood of all scholarly
disciplines, all universities and colleges, and all university and college courses--such as the ones in which you are
currently enrolled. Your research essay, like all research essays, is a vital contribution to this discourse. Universities and
colleges exist primarily as a space to foster the ideas that the works of others inspire in you, the responses to these
works that you develop, and the dialogues between you and others as you consider complementary and contradictory
responses.

   One of the goals of this text is to prepare you to enter this conversation and make sure your contributions are taken
seriously at this level. One of the key components of a meaningful essay at this level is the proper balance of your ideas,
the examination of primary evidence, and the elevation of your investigation through the proper use of scholarly sources.
You are using secondary sources to elevate and complicate your reading of your primary evidence, not replace it. Use
secondary sources to support your claim. Your interpretive claim is always driving your analysis. Your interpretive claim
determines how secondary sources are applied to your primary evidence and what inferences you derive from that
application.

   In creating your research paper you are performing two essential tasks:

                                                                                                       Standing on the Shoulders of Giants: Using Your Essay to Look

2. Selecting a particular scholarly discourse to which you would like to contribute meaningfully
You make these selections because discussion of both in the light of each other will result in an elevated understanding
of the primary source and a useful extension of the scholarly discourse. You cannot join an ongoing discourse by waving
vaguely and making generalizations. You can join an ongoing discourse by examining a specific example in detail and in
the light of how it extends and further complicates the scholarly conversation. This is the hope we have when we select
and analyze the example we have been working on in Chapters 7 and 9.

Finding Our Scholarly Conversation Partners:
Primary and Secondary Sources

Let's have a look at the three-storey thesis we developed in Chapter 9 so that we can identify the larger discussion we are
having:

   Example

     Occupy Wall Street's Facebook group page showcases some flaws as users of the space have a difficult time
     breaking away from their own "villages" in order to link those global events to their local concerns. This is
     demonstrated by the comment field under the post "From #Ferguson to #Gaza #BLM," wherein discussion of the
     event turns to users calling each other names like "idiots" and wondering aloud about the two topics are related
     (ex. The post "What the hell does BLM have to do with geopolitics in the Middle East?") rather than discussing the
     event promoted. Such interaction in this space demonstrates that while Facebook groups do provide a useful tool
     for distributing information and bringing large tribes together, that users often struggle to attach that awareness
     to action or viewpoints beyond local/personal concerns or interests; instead of users speaking to each other
     in an attempt to foster stronger global connections and consciousness, users often end up posting their own
     disconnected content and/or insulting content without the necessary conversation around the complex topics
     posted The Occupy Wall Street Facebook page's tendency to strengthen local connections while weakening links
     to larger social and political contexts acts as an indicator that despite the increased reach of an online community,
     insularity among its users is likely to affect its ability to influence governmental policy and provide a base for
     civilian power. Users who wish to turn the Internet into an effective tool designed to provide a counterpoint to
     corrupt, dictatorial, or simply misguided governments will need to address this insularity and attempt to ensure
     that the broad reach of the social-media platform does not replace the broadness in scope of the movement itself.

We have done well here to narrow our focus to a manageable primary example. "Facebook" would be much too wide a
focus, and even "Occupy Wall Street's Facebook page" could get a little unwieldy. The primary source we are selecting for
closer examination is a specific post on Occupy Wall Street's Facebook page--"From #Ferguson to #Gaza #BLM"--and
the subsequent dialogue it sparked.

   Now we need to review the evidence we gleaned from this primary example and decide which pieces we think would
best benefit our analysis. In particular, we want to use those examples that really inspire and support the claim of our
second storey: "Such interaction in this space demonstrates that while Facebook groups do provide a useful tool for
distributing information and bringing large tribes together, users often struggle to attach that awareness to action or
viewpoints beyond local/personal concerns or interests; instead of users speaking to each other in an attempt to foster
stronger global connections and consciousness, users often end up posting their own disconnected content without the
necessary conversation around the complex topics posted."

                                                                                                             Finding Our Scholarly Conversation Partners: Primary and

It is now essential that we find the scholarly articles needed to elevate our analysis of our primary evidence. As a
reminder of how to do this, let's return to the hypothetical research question from Chapter 8 and review how we broke it
down into searchable keywords and Boolean Concepts:

In this case, there are probably too many concepts broken out. You may want to reorganize your list and prioritize three
or four concepts to search at the start. If you search for too many concepts, you may get no results.

Scholarly Articles

Our current thesis is far larger and more complex than the previous example, so, for the purposes of clarity and
manageability, let's first break each storey down individually:

   Example

     FIRST STOREY: Occupy Wall Street's Facebook group page showcases some flaws as users of the space have a
     difficult time breaking away from their own "villages" in order to link those global events to their local concerns.
     This is demonstrated by the comment field under the post "From #Ferguson to #Gaza #BLM," wherein discussion
     of the event turns to users calling each other names like "idiots" and wondering aloud about the two topics
     are related (ex. The post "What the hell does BLM have to do with geopolitics in the Middle East?") rather than
     discussing the event promoted.

Concept 1: Occupy Wall Street AND Facebook
   Concept 2: Facebook AND villages
   Concept 3: Facebook AND local problems
   Concept 4: Online Activism OR Social Movements
   Concept 5: Online Activism AND Miscommunication

   Example

     SECOND STOREY: Such interaction in this space demonstrates that while Facebook groups do provide a useful
     tool for distributing information and bringing large tribes together, users often struggle to attach that awareness
     to action or viewpoints beyond local/personal concerns or interests; instead of users speaking to each other
     in an attempt to foster stronger global connections and consciousness, users often end up posting their own
     disconnected content without the necessary conversation around the complex topics posted.

Concept 1: Facebook groups AND global connections
   Concept 2: Social Media AND Social Movements AND Debate
   Concept 3: Social Media AND local AND global
   Concept 4: Social Media AND Protest AND Organization

263 | Scholarly Articles
   Example

     THIRD STOREY: The Occupy Wall Street Facebook page's tendency to strengthen local connections while
     weakening links to larger social and political contexts acts as an indicator that despite the increased reach of an
     online community, insularity among its users is likely to affect its ability to influence governmental policy and
     provide a base for civilian power. Users who wish to turn the Internet into an effective tool designed to provide
     a counterpoint to corrupt, dictatorial, or simply misguided governments will need to address this insularity and
     attempt to ensure that the broad reach of the social-media platform does not replace the broadness in scope of
     the movement itself.
Concept 1: Facebook OR Social Media AND Civilian Power
   Concept 2: Facebook OR Social Media AND Protest
   Concept 3: Occupy Wall Street AND Fail*
   Concept 4: Social Media AND insularity AND online community
   Concept 5: Social Media AND Social Activism AND

                                                                                                                                                             Scholarly Articles | 264
Scholarly Articles

You'll notice that our concepts range from the specific to the vague. Such search terms may seem contradictory to all
the advice we have been giving so far about focus and specificity. What is important to understand when looking for
scholarly sources that support our primary example is that this search often goes in the opposite direction from focus
and specificity. It is highly unlikely that we are going to find a scholarly source on the Occupy Wall Street Facebook post
"#ferguson2palestine: October 21 @ 7PM - JOIN US!" and such an article is not what we are looking for anyway, so it
would not help us to plug the words from that post into a search engine when searching for scholarly articles. You will
notice we use the asterisk truncation feature in our search "Occupy Wall Street AND Fail*." This will widen the net to find
variations of fail like failing, failings, failure, and failures.

   We are looking for sources that represent the larger discussion we are
entering. We are looking to ways to join that larger discussion using our
primary example. We are looking for articles that question whether social
media is a facilitator of online communities or an incubator for insularity. So
we will type these broader terms into various search engines with the goal of
finding articles that deal with similar subjects--articles we can use to elevate
the examination of our example. We will then use the specifics of the smaller
social world of our chosen post to challenge the scholarly discussion we have
discovered.

       Article: "Productive Provocations: Vitriolic Media, Spaces of Protest and Agonistic Outrage in the 2011
       England Riots"
       Authors: Anthony McCosker (Swinburne University, Faculty of Life and Social Sciences) and Amelia Johns
       (Deakin University, Centre for Citizenship and Globalisation)
       Abstract: The intense social upheaval that spread through a number of UK cities in the riots and protests
       of August, 2011, signalled the terrifying speed with which passionate disaffection can turn to uncontained
       violence. At stake in the dense and volatile debate that ensued, and in the acts of violence themselves,
       were contests over spaces as well as competing models of democracy, publics and citizenship, including the
       appropriate use of social media. Within these debates, almost universally, rational deliberative discourse and
       action is assumed to be the only route to legitimate "civil" society. So what is to be made of the violent
       physical contest over city squares, streets and property, as well as contests over acts of participation and

                                                                                                                                                                     Watch This! | 266
       demonstration played out online through the hundreds of eyewitness videos posted to sites like YouTube and
       the endless flow of often vitriolic words in blogs, comments spaces and social network sites? This paper uses
       a video posted to YouTube titled `Clapham Junction Speaker (London Riots 2011)' to examine the passion and
       provocation that flowed beyond the city streets to enliven, intensify and sustain forms of protest and civic
       engagement. We argue that the aggressive and antagonistic tenor of the Speaker's twenty minute monologue,
       the bitter vitriol that flowed through the comments space, and even the act of posting it constitute significant
       elements of a generative, `agonistic' public, to use Chantal Mouffe's term, that operates in multiple spaces and
       outside of the rationalising discourse demanded by mainstream media and government. This paper develops a
       richer understanding of these spaces of protest, and the concept of provocation central to these events.

You will notice that the article we have chosen does not focus on the exact subject of our representative example. This
is fine. Applying the research and ideas of scholars to examine another topic is a long-standing scholarly practice. There
are countless postcolonial or feminist or Freudian readings of Shakespeare's plays that use the claims and findings of
academics to create new readings of different subjects. Just because you are standing on the shoulders of giants does not
mean you have to look in the same direction. Creating new applications with the articles you find is a major part of joining
the scholarly conversation.

Joining the Scholarly Conversation: Using Your
Primary and Secondary Evidence

So, we have our primary material and we have one scholarly secondary source. Of course, your essay will use several
sources, but for the purposes of brevity, we'll use just this source in the examples to follow. First, here are a couple of
problematic uses of primary and secondary sources.

   We find that one of the best approaches for students preparing to write a research essay using primary and secondary
evidence is to imagine taking part in a conversation--perhaps an introduction of two people you know very well but who
do not know each other. In this conversation, you will have to take a leading role, but you are hoping that the people you
are introducing will hit it off and begin conversing with each other as well. Two mistakes students make when facilitating
this scholarly conversation are:

 1. Dominating the conversation to the point that neither the primary or secondary sources contribute meaningfully.
2. Being a passive conduit and contributing very little in the hope that both sources will somehow carry the

      conversation all by themselves.

                                                   From Pixabay.

                                                                                                           Joining the Scholarly Conversation: Using Your Primary and
                                                                                                                                                         Secondary Evidence | 268
Dominating the Conversation

Let's look at some examples of these mistakes and then examine ways to remedy them.
   The first mistake involves acting like a domineering, interrupting, and inattentive conversation partner--the sort of

person who finishes other people's sentences, most often in ways the interrupted person did not intend. This sort of
mistake most often manifests itself in essays in which the student paraphrases the sources, making them say things they
are not really saying for the sake of proving their own argument, or using minimal, even one-word citations and plugging
them into their own argument out of context. In this way, the writer ignores what either source is saying because the
primary concern is making the conversation arrive at the desired conclusion no matter what the cost. Here is an example
of this sort of "bullying" of sources using our primary evidence and our secondary article:

   Example

     As McCosker and Johns confirm in "Productive Provocations: Vitriolic Media, Spaces of Protest and Agonistic
     Outrage in the 2011 England Riots," "aggressive, antagonistic behaviour" like the "unchecked flow of racial bigotry"
     and the "vitriolic expression and aggressive interaction" found in the comments section of the Occupy Wall
     Street Homepage demonstrate how such pages "simply give voice to and perpetuate forms of bigotry and incite
     hatred and further violence." As commenters call each other "idiots" and "terrorists" and "Zionist pigs," they
     demonstrate how "volatile debates erupting online" serve as "modes of incitement" for real world violence. When
     one commenter accuses another of having a "racist God," or when one calls another's religion a "fake story,"
     they demonstrate the "angry, adversarial and provocative speech" that fosters only divisiveness and violence. The
     original message and intent of the Occupy Wall Street movement is lost in the "angry tenor of speech" dominating
     the comments section as people reply to each other's comments with "simple people like simple slogans" or "lol
     dumb post."

Here we see the author using McCosker and Johns's article as if it is about the Occupy Wall Street page, which it is not,
and as if it agrees with the author's assessment of the primary evidence. This secondary source is misused to support
what the author wants it to say about the subject. Also, the citations are short snippets used without context. Exactly
what are McCosker and Johns referring to when they describe "aggressive antagonistic behaviour?" Exactly what are
they referring to when they discuss "angry, adversarial and provocative speech?" And what is the context of each of the
harsh phrases the author has lifted from the comments page? If you review McCosker and Johns's article, you'll see there
are several times here where the author has clipped a citation to make it serve the desired argument. McCosker and
Johns' point is a little more qualified when describing the "volatile debates erupting online." They write of the "dense and
volatile debates erupting online," implying a more nuanced reading of online discussions than simply pointing at their
potential for danger. The author needs to decide how to read the primary evidence then determine if McCosker and
Johns' argument as it exists in their essay can support that reading.

269 | Dominating the Conversation
Passive Conduit

The second mistake occurs when the writer hopes that the sources will somehow speak to themselves and arrive at a
meaningful conclusion without much help. In these sorts of conversations, the student has become a non-contributor,
sitting passively as the sources speak at each other rather than speaking to each other in light of the conversation the
student is trying to facilitate. This sort of non-conversation occurs in papers in which the student quotes large passages
from one or several sources with minimal purpose or interaction. It is as if the student has said, "Source A, meet Source
B," then departed quickly rather than get in the way of the magic that will hopefully happen as these two sources make a
meaningful connection. Using once again our primary evidence and our secondary article, here's what happens when the
student hopes the sources will speak to and for themselves:

   Example

     As McCosker and Johns claim in "Productive Provocations: Vitriolic Media, Spaces of Protest and Agonistic
     Outrage in the 2011 England Riots," it is the "lack of consensus, the evident irrationality and passionate
     individualism, as well as the intensity of emotion revolving around the continuous generation of provocation and
     (re)action that reveals the positive capacity of unmoderated comment spaces. That is, while not always dialogic
     in the strict sense of an ongoing conversation or consensus, the comment field as described here enables the
     emergence of `a `life politics' able to reach the various areas of personal life, creating a `democracy of emotions'
     (Mouffe, 2005: 15)." This can be seen in the comments on the Occupy Wall Street Facebook page, when after
     a series of vitriolic comments and insults, contributor Tara Lambert is able to say, "I am seeing the seeds of
     divisiveness being sewn within OWS and BLM. Start us fighting amongst each other and we are no threat to the
     power abusers, the oppressors. I am seeing those who should be natural allies, being pitted against each other
     and suspicion injected into activist circles. History keeps repeating itself."

To borrow Tara Lambert's metaphor, I think we can see the "seeds" of the argument the author of this paragraph is trying
to make, but the author relies far too much on large citations from the primary and scholarly sources. Neither source is
being put to use and the author's intention is not clear. This author needs to inject purpose into this paragraph and use
the evidence to support the claim.

                                                                                                                                                               Passive Conduit | 270
Purposeful Conversation

Now that we have looked at the mistakes made most often when trying to create this sort of conversation, let's use the
same information and develop a more useful, more purposeful conversation. Remember to let these sources speak, but
also remember that the purpose of this conversation is all yours. Secondary sources allow you to gain a richer, more
informed, and complex vantage point on your primary material. However, you must avoid relying on secondary sources to
act as your "answers." You are using secondary sources to elevate and complicate your reading of your primary material,
not replace it. Use secondary sources to support your claim. Your interpretive claim is always driving your analysis. Your
interpretive claim determines how secondary sources are applied to your representative example and what inferences
you derive from that application. Here's an example of how we elevate our analysis of our primary evidence so that it
becomes part of a larger scholarly discourse:

   Example

     While it is discouraging to read the comments section of the Occupy Wall Street Facebook page and see
     commenters calling each other "idiots," "losers," and even "Zionist Pigs," it may be beneficial to regard these
     debates and dialogues in the same light as McCosker and Johns regard similar online discourse in "Productive
     Provocations: Vitriolic Media, Spaces of Protest and Agonistic Outrage in the 2011 England Riots." McCosker and
     Johns claim "[t]he kinds of provocative, often vitriolic and antagonistic but massively multiple expression acts
     throughout the comment fields... enact agonistic forms of contest as an alternative model of citizenship, acts that
     incorporate forms of passion and conflict but are no less productive for it." While there are several instances on
     the Occupy Wall Street Page of people responding to posts with less-than-civil comments like "Grow up" or "lol
     dumb post"--as McCosker and Johns say of similarly vitriolic online discussions of the 2011 England Riots--these
     "modes of civic participation can be initiated in ways that might become part of legitimate public discourse,
     before the eruption of violent destruction in the form of riot and looting." Such debates may be the first step in the
     Internet functioning as a tool for individuals to confront their own insularity and deal with difference peacefully
     before moving toward unification through a common goal.

In this example, there is a fine balance between this author's intent and the sources used. Neither overwhelms the other.
The author keeps an eye to both purpose and context here, using but never altering the meaning of the primary and
secondary sources, to support and complicate a deeper reading of the Occupy Wall Street Facebook page.

at least one scholarly source and then ask yourself the following questions. For every no response, revisit what you have
written, revisit the sources you have read, and revisit the notes you have taken, and then determine what you need to do
to improve that aspect of your paragraph.

     Have you selected specific aspects of both the primary and secondary sources that will enable you to produce a
     meaningful contribution to the ongoing scholarly conversation that is both an extension and a complication of
     the current discourse?
     Y/N
     Is this paragraph still very much part of your argument and analysis? Are you using primary and secondary
     sources to work toward the examination you proposed in your thesis?
     Y/N
     Do you clearly identify the author of each source as you use it?
     Y/N
     Does your use of the sources in your paragraph constitute a moving forward? Do you use your primary and

Setting the Stage: Getting the Primary and Secondary

Sources into Your Introduction

Now let's return to one of the last things we said in Chapter 9, which was a promise of what we planned to do in this
chapter: "In Chapter 10, we will be examining in more detail how research can be incorporated into the thesis and the
essay's body." Now that we have some experience developing purposeful paragraphs that balance our claims with the
supporting evidence of both primary and secondary sources, let's return to each storey of our thesis and connect our
ideas to specific aspects of our researched material.

   Example

     Occupy Wall Street's Facebook group page showcases some flaws as users of the space have a difficult time
     breaking away from their own "villages" in order to link those global events to their local concerns. This is
     demonstrated by the comment field under the post "From #Ferguson to #Gaza #BLM," wherein discussion of the
     event turns to users calling each other names like "idiots" and wondering aloud about the two topics are related
     (ex. The post "What the hell does BLM have to do with geopolitics in the Middle East?") rather than discussing
     the event promoted in the original post. Such interaction in this space demonstrates that while Facebook groups
     do provide a useful tool for distributing information and bringing large tribes together, users often struggle to
     attach that awareness to action or viewpoints beyond local/personal concerns or interests. Instead of speaking
     to each other in an attempt to foster stronger global connections and consciousness, users often end up
     posting their own disconnected content and/or insulting content without the necessary conversation around
     the complex topics posted. The Occupy Wall Street Facebook page's tendency to strengthen local connections
     while weakening links to larger social and political contexts acts as an indicator that despite the increased reach
     of an online community, insularity among its users is likely to affect its ability to influence governmental policy
     and provide a base for civilian power. As Anthony McCosker and Amelia Johns note in "Productive Provocations:
     Vitriolic Media, Spaces of Protest and Agonistic Outrage in the 2011 England Riots,"while examining the online
     discourse around the violent protests in England in 2011, such online comments "remain almost primarily
     dissociated, impassioned expressions relaying a range of points of view without an internal dialogical order." Users
     who wish to turn the Internet into an effective tool designed to provide a counterpoint to corrupt, dictatorial, or
     simply misguided governments will need to address this insularity and attempt to ensure that the broad reach
     of the social-media platform does not replace the broadness in scope of the movement itself. As McCosker and
     Johns claim, properly attuned, such dialogues "can be conceptualised as acts of multiple initiations--of a space
     of protest, of a constitutive public, of passionate expression of the conditions of existence, of provocations for
     further exchange."

There are no hard and fast rules for incorporating scholarly support into your thesis. Some authors choose to begin
by citing a scholarly source they will either examine or debate then follow the cited passage immediately with their
particular thoughts or criticisms. There are many approaches that you will no doubt encounter as you gain experience
and move through disciplines. When dealing with first-year writers, we prefer the approach of establishing your reading
in the first and second storeys, then situating it within a larger discourse in the third storey. This ensures that your

275 | Setting the Stage: Getting the Primary and Secondary
Sources into Your Introduction
approach to your primary material is focused and comes from something you want to say about the text. Once you have
established your approach, it is easier to situate it within a larger discourse without losing the specifics of the argument
that make it your own.

   Now that we have a good grasp on how to use primary and secondary
material, we now must consider how to best organize our essay and how
to cite our sources properly. The next chapters will look at how we build
our argument using multiple sources and how we make sure we are
always clear on whose sources we are using. Keep working on your essay

   Learning Outcomes
   In this chapter we will:

          Determine the scholarly conversation that best defines and supports your approach to your subject.
          Decide what primary evidence you should analyze first and what scholarly support best develops your

             reading of the evidence.
          Use your primary and secondary sources effectively, never letting cited passages stand alone and showing

             how your sources support your argument.
          Develop transitions from one argument to another and from one scholarly source to another so that your

             ideas progress in a logical way.

281 | Chapter Overview
Revisiting Body Paragraphs

The last chapter focused on developing your essay's body with your research in mind. In developing your paragraphs you
must consider what kind of research furthers the analysis of your primary evidence and facilitates your entry into the
larger academic discourse represented by your primary example. The following self-evaluation will help you review and
evaluate how well you integrated secondary sources into your body paragraphs.

   Taking Measure

     Answer "yes" or "no" to each question below. If you answer "yes," give yourself one point. If you answer "no," be
     sure to revisit your body paragraphs and rectify your problematic use and integration of your secondary source(s).
     Your final scores will be a mark out of five (four "yes" responses = 4/5).

            1. Did you let your sources speak without manipulating them into supporting your desired reading of the
            primary evidence?
            Y/N
            2. Did you let your sources speak without taking their argument out of context to prove your own
            conclusions?
             Y/N
            3. Did you actively direct the purpose of the scholarly conversation with sources by NOT citing large chunks
            of text in place of your own interpretation of the primary evidence?
             Y/N
            4. Did you discuss citations by contextualizing the author's arguments before trying to apply them to your
            reading of your primary evidence?
             Y/N
            5. Did you use secondary sources to advance and complicate your reading of the primary example AND not
            as a substitute for your own analysis and interpretation of the primary evidence?
             Y/N

                                                                                                                                               Revisiting Body Paragraphs | 282
Effectiveness of Your Sources

Using your sources to elevate and complicate your reading of the primary example is an ongoing process. You will have to
evaluate whether your original sources allow for the deep reading of your primary evidence that brings something new to
the scholarly discussion of your larger topic. To do this, you will have to ask yourself some basic questions (while focusing
on your third storey): what aspects of your topic/subject do your sources not address? What are the limitations of the
arguments in your sources? Are there details in your sources that remain implicit that you need to draw out and clarify
before applying to your reading? Given your sources' conclusions, what problems might arise when you apply them to
your topic? In short, you will need to consider the limitations and shortcomings of your research. Keep in mind that the
purpose of doing so is not to discredit your sources and omit them in favour of other sources, but instead to further
develop your reading.

   Let's look at the example from Chapter 10 of the thesis with the secondary sources included.

   Example

     Occupy Wall Street's Facebook page showcases some flaws as users of the space have a difficult time breaking
     away from their own "villages" in order to link those global events to their local concerns. This is demonstrated
     by the comment field under the post "From #Ferguson to #Gaza #BLM," wherein discussion of the event turns
     to users calling each other names like "idiots" and wondering aloud about how the two topics are related (ex.
     The post "What the hell does BLM have to do with geopolitics in the Middle East?") rather than discussing the
     event promoted in the original post. Such interaction in this space demonstrates that while Facebook pages
     do provide a useful tool for distributing information and bringing large tribes together, users often struggle to
     attach that awareness to action or viewpoints beyond local/personal concerns or interests; instead of users
     speaking to each other in an attempt to foster stronger global connections and consciousness, users often end
     up posting their own disconnected content and/or insulting content without the necessary conversation around
     the complex topics posted. The Occupy Wall Street Facebook page's tendency to strengthen local connections
     while weakening links to larger social and political contexts acts as an indicator that despite the increased reach
     of an online community, insularity among its users is likely to affect its ability to influence governmental policy
     and provide a base for civilian power. As Anthony McCosker and Amelia Johns note in "Productive Provocations:
     Vitriolic Media, Spaces of Protest and Agonistic Outrage in the 2011 England Riots," while examining the online
     discourse around the violent protests in England in 2011, such online comments "remain almost primarily
     dissociated, impassioned expressions relaying a range of points of view without an internal dialogical order." Users
     who wish to turn the Internet into an effective tool designed to provide a counterpoint to corrupt, dictatorial, or
     simply misguided governments will need to address this insularity and attempt to ensure that the broad reach
     of the social-media platform does not replace the broadness in scope of the movement itself. As McCosker and
     Johns claim, properly attuned, such dialogues "can be conceptualised as acts of multiple initiations--of a space
     of protest, of a constitutive public, of passionate expression of the conditions of existence, of provocations for
     further exchange."

In considering our use in the thesis of McCosker and Johns' essay, we might start by backtracking to ask what the authors
mean by "dialogical order"? Moreover, if online comments are mostly "dissociated, impassioned expressions" without a

283 | Effectiveness of Your Sources
"dialogical order," then what about offline forms of political discourse? Are they more logical and less impassioned forms

of expression with "an inherently dialogical order"? What might be the value of impassioned and seemingly disassociated

speech?

               To begin, we can define dialogic[al] expressions as those in

               dialogue with other utterances or expressions. In other words,

               our communication is relational and contextual, as it depends

               on what was said before and what the speaker anticipates will

               be said in response. Linguist Mikhail Baktin theorizes that all

               language is by nature relational and dialogical. So if all

               expressions have a dialogic order, might we conclude then that

               all communication is successive/consecutive and logical? We

               cannot, because language is relational and contextual, but

               speakers respond also to their own particular, acknowledged or

               unacknowledged, personal or political contexts--not only to

               others' communication--so misunderstandings and

               impassioned reactions are common enough in any discursive

From Pixabay.  community.
                  Communication is not tidy by nature and especially not in

               the "global village." We alluded to this idea in our thesis in the

               second storey with reference to McLuhan's "tribes." For

               McLuhan, tribal communication (and ritualized practices)

suggests a multi-sensory, impassioned engagement but also a potentially chaotic and unruly one. This is also true of

"global tribes" in the "global village." So if all communication is potentially disorderly, and especially communication in

online communities, then are Facebook pages useful political tools after all? We might still conclude they are indeed viable

political tools; however, all communication is potentially complicated, sometimes confusing and certainly open to

overheated exchanges. The internet is merely a reflection of the difficult and muddled reality that is human

communication. But the question still remains, is the internet then a viable political tool?

Before we answer the above question, let's take inventory of what we have accomplished so far. We have teased

out details and meanings in our secondary source that were at first implicit, such as the meaning of language having

a "dialogical order." We concluded thoughtfully that while all language is dialogical, this does not prevent

misunderstandings and seemingly unconnected responses in online communication. We complicated our understanding

of the McCosker and Johns argument further, in its application to our thesis, when we noted that all communication

is both inherently dialogical and non-dialogical, whether the communication happens online or offline, but that online

communication is, as McLuhan suggested of tribal communication and by extension electronic communication,

inherently susceptible to being incoherent and impassioned. These are ideas we will need to include in our revised thesis.

To answer our outstanding question though, we might seek out further research to help us conclude whether online

communities, such as Facebook pages are useful political tools. Let us turn to the following open source:

                                                                                              Effectiveness of Your Sources | 284
Article

Article: "FCJ-194 From #RaceFail to #Ferguson: The Digital Intimacies of Race-Activist Hashtag Publics"
   Author: Nathan Rambukanna (Wilfred Laurier University)
   Abstract: This paper explores the rough, emergent and partial public culture of race-activist hashtags through the

discourses of #RaceFail, a critical race quarrel that started in the sci-fi and fantasy blogosphere, and expanded from
there into a broader, sustained discussion over social media; and #Ferguson, a recent race-activist hashtag raising issues
around censorship, filtering and `gated discourse'. It ends with a discussion of how the frictions between the neoliberal
desire to reduce hashtag publics to product publicity, and the activist desire to use hashtags to further public sphere
awareness of political issues, is exemplified in the controversy over Facebook's `algorithmic filtering' of #Ferguson, and
how, nevertheless, critical race hashtags are tapping into a developing tradition of vocal social media-supported dissent.

   Having read the article, let's pull out some paragraphs that are crucial to our reading of our primary evidence and that
we will work with, in conjunction with the McCosker and Johns article, to further develop our third storey, the political
usefulness/viability of Facebook pages.

     Rambukanna writes:
     In fact, since the dawn of the Internet age, discussion of the democratic potential of Internet-mediated space has
     been one of the major top level conversations. Yet a lot of that discussion gets mired in an orthodox Habermasian
     take on what we should consider a democratic public sphere--that is, one where rational critical discourse on
     matters of societal importance (such as, most critically, the actions of the State) can take place; populated by
     citizens stepping out of their private roles as interested individuals and into a public space where they become
     participants in disinterested discussion and debate (Habermas, 1962).
     While one can argue the merits of Habermas's public sphere, what of the other kinds of discussion and debate that
     are facilitated by networked technology? Taking its cue from critical public sphere theorists such as Nancy Fraser
     (1992) and Michael Warner (2002), this paper explores those other publics: more-or-less subaltern, more-or-less
     rational, more-or-less critical, and almost certainly partial, affective, interested and loud. The paper is interested
     in angry publics. It is interested in fringe publics. It's interested in the kinds of publics that do politics in a way
     that is rough and emergent, flawed and messy, and ones in which new forms of collective power are being forged
     on the fly, and in the shadow of loftier mainstream spheres. These are the publics born of frictions, in Anna Tsing's
     sense, `the awkward, unequal, unstable and creative qualities of interconnection across difference' (2005: 4).
     ...
     The political role of communication media cannot, therefore, be to `fix' a broken system of public sphere
     communication, but rather to `un-fix' staid communication patterns, to re-figure the public conversation about
     important issues and topics (such as inequality, racism, sexism and abuses of power) with a view to cracking
     open stable systems of meaning-making, and working--as Peters reminds us we need to do (1999: 30)--to build
     better communication across and between cultural and subcultural spaces. We need to work with and through
     the `productive friction[s] of global encounters' (Tsing, 2005: 3), to tap the unpredictable and raw energy that is
     concomitant with our increasing interconnection.

   As we did with the McCosker and Johns article, we will need clarify some details in the above source that are more

285 | Article
or less implicit and that we will want to expand on before applying this secondary source to our thesis. For one, we
need to ask, what is the nature of "a democratic public sphere"? How does it engage in political discourse? Moreover, if
communication in these public spheres is indeed "broken," as Rambukanna suggests, then what is their political value?
What can we hope to derive from online communities engaged in political discourses?

   Rambukanna clearly states that "democratic public spheres," where online political communities engage in democratic
discourses, are not places where people engage in "rational critical discourse" on socio-political issues. Moreover, such
politicized individuals are also not "disinterested" in their political interactions or in "debates." In other words, they
are "impassioned," to quote McCosker and Johns. In fact, for Ramabakunna, these individuals are "partial," (read: highly
subjective, biased or narrow-minded) "affective," (read: emotional or impassioned) "interested," (read: engaged) "loud"
(read: boisterous, vulgar and rowdy) and their political engagement style is "rough and emergent, flawed and messy." They
are "angry" online political communities "born of friction," meaning they are disorderly, sometimes hostile and discordant
online spaces where conflicting and divergent viewpoints are the norm.

   Rambukanna's view of "public democratic spheres" is similar to McCosker and Johns' depiction of online communities.
The authors would agree on the nature of the political discourse and communication that occurs online on sites like
the Occupy Wall Street Facebook page. It is discontinuous--not dialogical--impassioned, "insular" or "partial" and often
vulgar, even insulting. They accept this nature of communication as more or less normal--to be expected--for public
spaces are not, as Ramabukanna argues, spaces where "interested" individuals participate in "rational critical discourse"
or "disinterested discussion and debate" on political issues. The authors also concur that these flawed and volatile online
spaces are still engaging in valuable discussions. Rambukanna acknowledges soberly that "public sphere communication"
is "broken" and technology or "communication media" cannot solve or "fix" it, but it can "`un-fix' staid communication
patterns, to re-figure the public conversation about important issues and topics...cracking open stable systems of
meaning-making." For Rambukanna, the only way to challenge systems of inequality is to work through the "friction" and
diverging viewpoints and harness the passion of committed individuals to work for change. Here, his ideas are very much
aligned with McCosker and Johns, who suggest that impassioned and "vitriolic" speech can be "productive" and addressed
legitimately through public discourse before said speech escalates into violence.

   To return to our thesis and the third storey, keeping in mind both McCosker and Johns' and Rambukanna's
understanding of online communication, we might qualify our thesis as follows:

   Example three-storey thesis

     Occupy Wall Street's Facebook page showcases some flaws as users of the space have a difficult time breaking
     away from their own "villages" in order to link those global events to their local concerns. This is demonstrated
     by the comment field under the post "From #Ferguson to #Gaza #BLM," wherein discussion of the event turns
     to users calling each other names like "idiots" and wondering aloud about the two topics are related (ex. The
     post "What the hell does BLM have to do with geopolitics in the Middle East?") rather than discussing the
     event promoted in the original post. Such interaction in this space demonstrates that while Facebook pages
     do provide a useful tool for distributing information and bringing large tribes together, users often struggle to
     attach that awareness to action or viewpoints beyond local/personal concerns or interests; instead of users
     speaking to each other in an attempt to foster stronger global connections and consciousness, users often end
     up posting their own disconnected content and/or insulting content without the necessary conversation around
     the complex topics posted. The Occupy Wall Street Facebook page's tendency to strengthen local connections
     while weakening links to larger social and political contexts acts as an indicator that despite the increased

                                                                                                                                                                            Article | 286
     reach of an online community, insularity, hostility and discord among its users, which is typical of both on- and
     offline communication, could potentially affect its ability to influence governmental policy and provide a base for
     civilian power. As Anthony McCosker and Amelia Johns note in "Productive Provocations: Vitriolic Media, Spaces
     of Protest and Agonistic Outrage in the 2011 England Riots," while examining the online discourse around the
     violent protests in England in 2011, such online comments "remain almost primarily dissociated, impassioned
     expressions relaying a range of points of view without an internal dialogical order." Yet they are also confirmation
     that communication does not "naturally invite understanding, connection or societal harmony--despite a common
     [mis]conception that this is the case," as Nathan Rambukanna underscores in "FCJ-194 From #RaceFail to
     #Ferguson: The Digital Intimacies of Race-Activist Hashtag Publics". Users then who wish to turn the Internet
     into an effective tool designed to provide a counterpoint to corrupt, dictatorial, or simply misguided governments
     will need to address this insularity and attempt to ensure that the broad reach of the social-media platform
     does not replace the broadness in scope of the movement itself. They will also, as Rambukanna says, need to
     work "to build better communication," despite the inherent volatility and fractiousness of such communities
     and the diverging viewpoints expressed therein, if they wish to foster dialogue and connection leading to the
     creation of new political networks of change. As McCosker and Johns claim, properly attuned, such dialogues
     "can be conceptualised as acts of multiple initiations--of a space of protest, of a constitutive public, of passionate
     expression of the conditions of existence, of provocations for further exchange."

Starting a Conversation with Your Sources

As promised in Chapter 10, we will now address how to incorporate multiple sources, and indeed we've already practiced
this strategy in building our argument/developing our three-storey thesis.

   Incorporating multiple sources and getting them into
conversation is the practice of using your sources to lay down
building blocks or a framework within which to read your topic,
or an aspect of it, and eventually develop your own ideas about
it. It is useful as a scaffold upon which to build your argument.
While you may agree or disagree with one or the other source,
the point here is to actively use them in dialogue with each
other to draw out a point you want to make about your reading
of the primary source. You might reference points of similarity
between them and the significance of differences in their
arguments, but always with intention to draw some conclusion
from this interaction about your reading and understanding of From Pexels.
your topic. You might also consider how one source's ideas
respond to and qualify the ideas or claims of your other source.
Your role then becomes to clarify their positions and moderate
the conversation with the intent of eventually coming to a new perspective or new insight. A word of caution: always be
clear regarding what source you are using and whose ideas you are referencing. Also be clear about what ideas belong to
your sources and what ideas are your own.

   Let's look at an example. In Chapter 10, we already engaged in
a conversation with McCosker and Johns' article. We will now
use that source in conjunction with Rambukanna and get these
two talking to each other.

   Similar to McCosker and Johns in "Productive Provocations:
Vitrolic Media, Spaces of Protest and Agonistic Outrage in the
2011 England Riots," Rambukanna examines online political
spaces and the way they "do politics." He notes that
interactions in these online communities are both difficult and
challenging and yet possibly constructive in effecting political
or social change. He argues that online communities are often
"angry" public spaces where committed and impassioned
citizens engage in political discourses that are "flawed and
messy." Despite these challenging interactions, however, these
communities have the potential to "crack[...] open stable
systems of meaning-making." In other words, it is precisely
their frustration and rage that can be harnessed and directed
toward disrupting the status quo. Without constructive From Pixabay.
conflict, activism becomes too insular.

   Furthermore, Rambukanna, illustrates via the race-activist
#RaceFail how participating in angry exchanges or "`un-
fix[ing] staid communication patterns" leads to disrupting or

289 | Starting a Conversation with Your Sources
changing social systems (in this case, actively increasing awareness of race issues in the SFF sphere, leading to publishers
actively seeking authors of colour as well as to the publications of anthologies and conferences dedicated to race
issues in sci-fi and fantasy). For the most part, McCosker and Johns would agree with Rambukanna, as they too argue
that "excesses of emotion and acts of often aggressive provocation" are "paramount" in civic and political engagement.
McCosker and Johns also make it clear that passion and provocation are in fact productive because they prevent the
very "disaffection" or disillusionment that can lead to violence. Online communities are the public forums and outlets
that give the disenfranchised a voice before their frustrations turn destructive. For McCosker and Johns, this is their civil
function or utility. Yet neither Rambukanna nor McCosker and Johns address the very real and alternative possibility that
an excess of online rage (and cyberbullying) might also lead to a total breakdown of communication, increased insularity
or entrenched viewpoints and offline violence. Some restraint and sensibility are also necessary in public debates on
online communication forums.

   In short, in light of the above research, the heated and passionate exchanges on the Occupy Wall Street Facebook
page, even those that seem off topic or hostile, have the potential to lead to political activism so long as these disruptive
voices are judiciously addressed or engaged and made relevant so their seemingly unrelated or acrimonious comments
lead to constructive change and not violence. While it may not be possible to reach consensus in democratic spaces and
open forums, like the Occupy Wall Street page, marginal voices must have an outlet and cannot be ignored, if such public
spaces are to be considered democratic spaces and function as political tools.

Transitioning Between Ideas

Just as it is important to introduce and transition into a quote or paraphrase, it is equally important to use transitions to
connect ideas from one sentence to another or from one paragraph to another. Ideas in an essay relate to and build upon
each other. Ideas in one sentence or paragraph develop and elaborate on the ideas that precede them. It is important to
create a logical progression of ideas and arguments for readers and to be clear about how specific paragraphs connect to
each other.

   Transitional words or phrases link your ideas together and
help you transition from one sentence to another or one
paragraph to another and subsequently move from one idea
and argument to another smoothly and logically. There are
various types of transitions that will signal to your reader the
direction of your ideas and paper. For instance, additive
transitional words like "and," "also," "moreover," "furthermore,"
or "in addition to" all suggest that you are continuing with the
same argument. However, words such as "however," "but," "yet,"
"nevertheless" or "on the contrary" suggest a counter argument
or shift in your thinking. To conclude on a point, you might try
transitional words like "in conclusion," "therefore," "hence,"
"consequently," and so forth. To emphasize a point, words like
"in fact," "indeed," "to highlight," or "more importantly or From Pexels.
significantly" work well. In short, there are a number of ways
to transition from one point to another and it is important that
you use effective transitions to help you build and develop your
ideas and arguments smoothly and in a way that is easy for your
audience to follow.

   Such transitional words appear in the above example when we put McCosker and Johns into conversation with
Rambukanna. When showing commonality between their ideas, we used transitional expressions such as "like" or "they
too," and when we showed difference between their arguments and our own, we used words like "yet" or "in contrast". To
draw together their ideas and show how they applied to our argument, we used "in short."

          Re-read and revise your entire essay for the final time.

299 | Chapter Overview
Revising Your Thesis and Body Paragraphs

Before you begin revising your work, it would be useful to review both the three-storey thesis that you wrote as part of
Chapter 9 and the paragraph-by-paragraph skeletal outline that you created as part of Chapter 11. It may even be useful
to print these two documents and read them side-by-side so that you can compare the structure and content of what
you had planned to argue with what you actually argued in your essay. This is not to say that your initial thesis and your
outline need to be identical to what you wrote in your essay. Rather, they provide the broad outline of your thoughts and
argumentative structure and will help you assess the strength of your argument during this revision stage.

   Broadly, the most effective way to revise your essay is to make it unfamiliar to yourself. Because you know the
argument you want to make, there is a danger that you will make assumptions and logical leaps within the work that an
outside reader would not make. Therefore, you need to approach your essay as if someone else wrote it so that you can
objectively evaluate its strengths and weakness. Some strategies to help you do this include:

   Printing your essay and reading it as a hard copy: Often when we read on our computer screens, even in a word
      processing program, we gloss over the text and do not read as carefully as we should. Moreover, reading on a
      computer provides an environment with many potential distractions. Print your essay and read it.

   Read with a pen in your hand: Taking notes and responding by hand in the margins on your own work will ensure
      that you are remaining an active reader of your own argument.

   Read your essay in a different room: This is similar to reading
      a hard copy of your work. Moving to a different writing
      environment will help defamiliarize the text and provide you
      with a new perspective on your own argument.

   Read your essay out loud: Reading your own work out loud is a
      great way to hear how your argument sounds. This will be
      helpful for understanding your whole essay and whether the
      paragraphs link together logically.This technique will also help
      you identify any awkward style or errors in grammar or
      punctuation. If you stumble over a sentence when you are
      reading it out loud, there is likely something in that sentence
      that needs to be fixed.
                                                                                                               From Pixabay.

Now that you have taken steps to make your essay and argument
seem less familiar, you need to set some specific goals for your
revision. You have a lot to reconsider, so setting specific goals will
help you revise your essay effectively. You need to reconsider the
final version of your thesis that you have been complicating and reformulating during this process. And you need to
reconsider your use of primary and secondary evidence, as well as your analysis of these elements. In this way, it is
useful to edit in small, iterative waves with specific goals for each wave. It is very difficult, for example, to revise
paragraph-to-paragraph transitions, grammar, thesis construction, and integration of research in a single pass. Instead,
each of these concerns should be separated into its own wave and you should read your essay with that one specific
concern in mind.

   At this point, revising your essay means asking a number of questions of your own writing. By asking one specific
question as you read your essay, you will stay focused in your revising process and strengthen your argument from many
directions. You will be asking both large- and small-scale questions; some questions will address your writing at the

                                                                                                                          Revising Your Thesis and Body Paragraphs | 300
word, sentence, and paragraph level, and some will concern your essay as a whole. Again, you cannot address all these
issues at once, so give yourself a specific task with each reading of your essay.

301 | Revising Your Thesis and Body Paragraphs
Potential Questions to Ask

1. At the paragraph level:

   Does each paragraph have a unique argument that complicates the overall thesis?
   Does the topic sentence reflect the argument being made in that paragraph?
   Does each paragraph have a distinct progression from beginning to the middle to the end?
   Does the paragraph go off on any tangents? Does it remained focused, from the first sentence to the last, on the

      argument within that paragraph?
   How long is each paragraph? Are some too short? Are some too long?
   Do any paragraphs repeat key parts of the argument?
   Does each paragraph connect logically to the next paragraph?
   What is the job of each paragraph? For example, one paragraph may be for analyzing a detail from your central

      example, while another will be incorporating scholarly research. Is it achieving its job?
   Is the analysis of the central example done effectively?
   Is the research integrated and activated effectively?
   Although the argument is being reformulated as new evidence is added, is the argument clear in each paragraph?

2. At the sentence level:

   Do the sentences make sense syntactically? (Did you stumble when you read them out loud?)
   Does each sentence add something new to the paragraph?
   Do any sentences repeat the same idea?
   Does each sentence connect to the next sentence?
   How long is each sentence? Are some too short? Are some too long?
   Are there any run-on sentences?
   Are there any sentence fragments?

3. At the word level:

   Are key terms defined with a scholarly definition?
   Are the verbs effective? Are the verbs precise and demonstrative?
   Are the pronouns used (I, you, we, us) effective and appropriate for the genre of writing?
   Is each word clear and logical?
   Are words repeated? If so, is the word being repeated central to the argument being made in that paragraph? Is it

      central to the argument being made throughout the essay?

                                                                                                                                                Potential Questions to Ask | 302
4. At the the essay level:

   Does the argument get stronger as evidence is added?
   Does the argument build logically?
   Is the argument clear at each stage of the essay?
   Is there missing research that might strengthen the argument?

5. Proofreading:

   Is every word spelled correctly, including author's names, cities and unique vocabulary?
   Are all words used correctly?
   Is each sentence correct grammatically?
   Is all punctuation used correctly?
   Are in-text citations used properly?

     After having asked and answered these questions, return to your essay and make any adjustments to your essay
     that you feel you need to make.

Concluding Your Argument

Now that you have gone through your essay and revised with specific questions in mind, you are ready to write the
conclusion to your essay. Your conclusion should contain a full and complex version of your thesis that incorporates
the analysis and details you have added to your introductory thesis. Everything you learned in Chapter 6 about
concluding a close reading can be applied to concluding your own complex argument:

   The conclusion is not the "bottom bun" of your argument. The conclusion should be used as a space to take stock
      of your entire argument and let your readers exit your essay with all the components linked together compactly and
      logically.

   The conclusion is not a summary of your argument. Your reader has just read your essay. Like Chapter 6 tells us,
      readers are not goldfish--they do not need a reminder of your thesis.

   The conclusion is not a final proclamation about what is "right" or "wrong." The conclusion should be utilized as a
      final opportunity to place your argument within the scholarly discussion that has already taken place. This is the
      last chance for your readers to assess the total of your argument and consider the further implications of your
      analysis and argument.

Your conclusion is the accumulation of your analysis, your scholarly research, your complex argument, and your three-
storey thesis all working together. In many ways, your conclusion is a response to the initial thesis you present in the
introduction to your essay and, as such, you need not repeat it. Instead, your thesis will have grown more complicated
and complex as you've added analysis and scholarly research, which should refine and sharpen your initial argument into
one that is more complex.

   A strong conclusion also acknowledges the scholarly discussions that your essay is participating in and places your final
argument within that discussion by pushing your reader to consider further thoughts and arguments that might arise.
This can be tricky, because conclusions, above all else, are for concluding. You do not want to introduce a new idea or
facet into your argument in one sentence, and then end your essay. Instead, all components of your argument included in
your essay deserve the time and space to be explored. In this way, resist introducing new evidence in your final paragraph
or asking rhetorical questions. Instead, return to the third storey of your thesis and write your conclusion as though it is
answering the question the third storey has posed. What elements discussed throughout your essay enable you to answer
that question? What new piece of evidence needs to be added to best complete that answer?

   When considering strategies for concluding your argument, remember that not all of these strategies are appropriate
for every genre of academic discourse. For example, creating an anecdotal story that personalizes and illustrates some
small portion of your argument might be appropriate in some humanities classes, but seem out of place in a lab report.
If you have questions about appropriate strategies, ask your professors about their expectations. You can also look at the
scholarly research you have been reading. How do these scholars conclude their arguments? What models can you follow
from those writings?

   Consider the language and strategies you used in your introduction. For example, if you use a quotation as the hook in
your introduction, can you return to that quotation (or a similar quotation)? How has your argument built and changed
since you introduced this quote?

   With all this in mind, here are some strategies to consider using in your conclusion:

   Return to a quotation you've given earlier in the essay and re-analyze it as the context for your final argument.
      Using a quote from a scholar is likely the most effective, as it reminds your reader what scholarly conversations
      your essay is joining. Remember, however, that you should not simply put a quotation into your conclusion without

                                                                                                                                               Concluding Your Argument | 306
      analyzing specific words and phrases, just as you've done throughout the whole of your essay. Nor should you end
      your essay on a quotation. You want the last words of your essay to be your own.
   Describe a relevant image that illustrates some aspect of your final argument. For example, if your essay is
      making an argument about texting habits of male high school students, then describing a male high school student
      texting would be a relevant way of wrapping up your final argument.
   Give a statistic or fact that is relevant to your final argument. Again, this is a chance to place your argument
      within a scholarly discussion while lending it a scholarly quality.
   Create a call to arms. You can use the problem that you have raised in your third storey to argue that certain
      actions need to take place. Encourage your reader to take up that responsibility. Charles Justice uses this strategy
      effectively in his conclusion to "The Ultimate Communications App" --it might be useful to revisit that essay.
   Quickly and compactly explain your final argument. You don't need a fancy flourish at the end of your essay if you
      don't want; instead you can simply state your final argument, given all the analysis and scholarly research you've
      added to your initial thesis, and conclude your essay.

     After you have revised your essay, write a concluding paragraph that uses one of the above strategies and contains
     your fully complex final argument. This may mean going back to your introduction and adjusting it so that the
     strategy in your conclusion matches the one used in the introduction. When you are finished, write a different
     version of your conclusion using a different strategy. Which one do you prefer? Which one does a better job of
     situating your argument in a scholarly discussion? Which one does a better job of providing a final argument for
     your essay? Which one is most appropriate to the genre of academic discourse in which you are participating?

     one relatively uninterrupted, continuous reading of your work.

The Last Edit

Your last revisions have polished your essay and you are nearly ready to submit it. Before you do, however, you must
do one last edit for spelling, punctuation, and typographical errors. This level of editing should be the last thing you do.
In earlier stages of revision, you are changing content and sentences, adding and deleting content and quotations--it
doesn't make sense to focus on micro-issues like commas and spelling so much of the essay was still in flux. Correcting
these types of errors is important not because professors take off of points, but because every time your reader comes
across an error, it takes them out of your complex argument and interrupts the logical flow of your argument. In this way,
punctuation, grammatical and spelling errors get in the way of understanding your complex argument, and your grade
will be affected. This is also a good time to double check whether you've correctly spelled all the scholars' names that you
reference and that you have double checked your in-text citations and your Works Cited/References to ensure you have
all your sources and that they are cited correctly. Again, while this last edit may seem somewhat cosmetic, it ensures that
your reader will have no reason to be distracted from your argument.

YOU'RE DONE!

Once you've revised the digital version of your essay, print it. Do one last check: ensure that you have a title page if your
citation style requires it; ensure that your name and the page number is on each page; ensure that you have your Works
Cited /References at the end of your essay; lastly, make sure that you staple or paperclip it all together if submitting in
hard copy.

                                                       From Pixabay.

Congratulations! You are finished your essay and ready to submit! Before you submit your essay, spend just a few
moments reflecting on your writing and the progress you've made. Think back to the first writing that you did for this
course.

   In what ways do you think you've most improved?
   What do you think is the most important skill to have when writing academically?
   What do you think is the most important skill to have when reading academically?
   What skills are you most likely to carry into writing in your other courses?
   How much time did you spend writing? In what stage of writing did you spend your most time?
   How much time did you spend editing? In what stage of editing did you spend your most time?
   What would you like to improve about your writing going forward?
   What is the one thing you would recommend to a first-year university student about writing academically?
Once you've thought about these questions, make sure to take some time to relax and celebrate. You've worked incredibly
hard and made a lot of improvements! What you've done is a major accomplishment and you should celebrate it as such!

319 | Chapter Overview
Introduction to Citations

A citation is a reference to another person's work within the text of your essay. Before writing an academic essay you are
expected to read what others have written on the topic, think about it, and construct an argument of your own. When
you include a citation to another work within a paragraph of your own words and ideas, you prove to your audience that
you have done some research before formulating your argument.

   Citing other points of view on a topic positions your ideas within the scholarly conversation on a topic. When you are
quoting numbers and statistics, citations provide a way for your readers to confirm that the information is factual and can
be trusted. Whether you are asserting a unique take on a classic novel or developing an improved cooling valve for the
International Space Station, citations give your audience confidence that you have done some exploring, you have done
some thinking, and you know what you're talking about.

   Citations provide just enough details to lead your reader to the sources you used, in a standardized format. Students
are often required to include scholarly citations in their academic writing, but other types of writing can benefit from
citations as well.

   Researchers in the social sciences tend to cite scholarly articles and the APA (American Psychological Association)
style was designed for referencing secondary sources.

   Researchers in the humanities often cite a variety of source types, including archived personal letters or first-edition
works, which suits the MLA (Modern Language Association) style.

   Both of these citation styles are developed by committees and updated every few years to reflect changes in
information sources, so make sure you consult the most current manual.

                                                                                                                                                  Introduction to Citations | 320
Scholarship is a Conversation

Over time, as students and scholars write about a topic, the accumulation of writing becomes a scholarly conversation.
With each writer, new insights and discoveries are documented over time, adding different perspectives and
interpretations. In science, for example, the conversation has lead to improved technology and treatment for illness.

   Referring to other essays, studies and reports and describing how they relate to your own work gives authority to your
arguments. This is particularly important when people have different opinions about the topic you are addressing in your
writing. Citing other researchers proves that you know what you are saying is relevant, since you're placing your words in
the context of the existing literature. If the topic you are writing about is subjective in nature, your reader knows you've
consulted other research and your opinions are based on some consideration of the scholarly conversation on that topic.

   Citations help to demonstrate that your work is really your work. Informing readers where you found information helps
to distinguish between existing sources and your original thoughts. By revealing your sources, you are proving that your
work can be trusted. This is super important! Failing to cite can lead to a charge of plagiarism, which can result in a
mark of zero on the assignment, or a failing grade in the course. Read the definition of plagiarism by Ryerson's Academic
Integrity Office.

   Many readers (such as the person marking your assignment!) want to know whose work inspired your ideas. Many

321 | Scholarship is a Conversation
readers want to follow the trail of evidence you've used to support the points you've made. Citations give enough
information to make it possible for others to locate and read the sources for themselves.

   In addition to written words, your research may lead you to social media posts, personal correspondence such as email
messages, films, maps, graphs, web pages, photographs, television news reports, lectures, and audio recordings. Cite
everything you use to learn about the topic and formulate your own arguments: the texts you read, the audio you hear,
and the videos you watch. Keep track of all of the resources you use as you do research for your assignments.

                                                                                        From Pixabay.

Quote something when it's memorable, the phrasing is evocative or a "classic". You might quote also for precision and
accuracy, or when something is short.

   Paraphrase to express the situation and ideas in your own words as they relate to your argument.
   Summarize/synthesize to provide an overview of the ideas as they relate to your essay. Ideas must also be attributed,
even when you are not pointing to a specific paragraph or page.
   Scenario: Imagine yourself spending months traveling and doing research in your field of expertise. Your blog serves as
a travel journal where you upload photographs, itineraries and short essays about your field work, as you gather evidence
for a book.
   Soon after, you read an article in a newspaper about traveling that includes some of the exact sentences you wrote
on your blog, with one of your photographs. There is no mention of your name. While it is satisfying to know someone
thought so well of your work, you expect them to acknowledge that the phrasing and photography was originally your
work.
   In the music industry, using another artist's words without giving them credit leads to a copyright infringement lawsuit.
In an academic context, the charge of plagiarism can result in a mark of zero on the assignment, or a failing grade in the
course.

What is Bibliographic Information?

Bibliographic information refers to specific elements such as the author's name, the title of the thing (book,
documentary, journal article) and the date it was created. Author + Title + Date are the most common pieces of
information and they are often found on a book's title page and the back of the title page, also known as the verso. Often
the date is found on the verso.

   For example:

What is a Bibliography?

A Bibliography is a list, in alphabetical order, of all the sources consulted for a piece of writing.
   In most cases students are instructed to include a bibliography with only those sources actually cited within their

paper.
   In the APA citation style this is called a References page. View this Google doc to see a bibliography in a References list

in APA style. Check out the bibliography in this sample paper in APA style on the OWL site.
   In the MLA citation style a bibliography is referred to as a Works Cited page. View this Google doc to see the same

bibliography in a Works Cited list in MLA style. Check out a sample MLA paper at OWL Purdue
   Research tip!
   Once you have found an relevant article or book that you can use in your research, look at the bibliography. It's full of

potentially useful research that you can use.

Citation Styles

Citations are an important part of the scholarly conversation. The order of the bibliographic elements is prescribed by
the citation style, which is a convention for the sequence of information and punctuation used. People write for different
purposes and different audiences. Citation styles reflect these differences by specifying:

 1. How to structure the elements (such as date and title) within a citation and
2. All of the details that should be included in the bibliography, which goes at the end of your essay
Citation styles force researchers to standardize the content and format of their citations and references. When the title
and date are always found in the same place in every citation, research is a bit easier because the information is presented
in a consistent way. Whether you are citing print books or YouTube videos, this protocol of scholarly conversation is an
efficient way to discuss and share sources.

329 | Citation Styles
Citation Tip!

Read the assignment instructions to determine which citation style you should use. If you are allowed to choose one
for yourself, the most important thing to remember is: use one style per assignment and be consistent, do not mix and
match styles within a paper.

APA citation style

The American Psychological Association style is used primarily in the social sciences, including economics, geography,
journalism, criminology and law.

   APA reference style is based on the following:

   Each reference begins with the author's last name followed by initial(s), and the list is in alphabetical order
   Capitalize only the first letter of the first word of a title and subtitle, the first word after a colon or a dash in the

      title, and proper nouns.
   The first line of each entry in your reference list should be left justified and remaining lines indented one-half inch

      from the left margin, which is called hanging indentation.
   Italicize titles of longer works such as books and journals, but not the titles of shorter works such as journal articles

      or essays in edited collections.
   Do not italicize, underline, or put quotes around the titles of shorter works.
   APA recommends providing a Digital Object Identifier (DOI), when it is available, as opposed to the URL. Always

      check with your instructor to confirm that you should include DOIs or URLs in your bibliography.

See the full list of instructions on citing with APA at the OWL Purdue Online Writing Lab.

   http://firstmonday.org/ojs/index.php/fm/article/view/466

How to cite and reference with APA

When summarizing the facts from another writer's piece of writing, an in-text citation is used to credit the original
author. You can do this by including a short quotation from the original text within your work, or a paraphrase of the
ideas, followed by the author and year of publication.

          Despite the media's insistence that it is colourblind, Serena is most often portrayed as a symbol of black pride
       and heritage. (Schultz, 2005).
   Another option is to begin the sentence with a signal phrase that includes the author's last name followed by the date
of publication in parentheses:

          According to Schultz (2005), despite the media's insistence that it is colourblind, Serena is most often portrayed
       as a symbol of black pride and heritage.

                                                                                                                                                                    Citation Tip! | 330
   When including a direct quote, add the page numbers.
          According to Schultz (2005) "In the overwhelmingly white world of professional tennis, Serena Williams and her

       older sister Venus are frequently re-presented in the tradition of black pride and heritage" (p. 339).
   Include the full reference of the journal article in the References:

   In this APA example of in-text citing, the author's name & publication date is included as part of the sentence. The
quote is followed by the page number in parentheses (including lowercase letter p. -- which MLA does not include)

          Ruffo (2015) said his poems were a natural and spontaneous response to being moved by Morrisseau's art, and
       focused on the paintings he admired most (p. 9).

MLA Citation Style

The Modern Language Association style is used primarily in the humanities, including literature, visual arts, music and
philosophy.

   MLA reference style is based on the following principles:
   Always include these essential bits of information with specific punctuation and in this order

      Author.
         Title of source.
         Title of container,
         Other contributors,
         Version,
         Number,
         Publisher,
         Publication date,
         Location.

   Chapters and journal articles are pieces of information contained within larger containers. The larger container
      holds the smaller sections. For example, a short story may be contained in an anthology. The short story is the
      source, and the anthology is the container. Information about both the specific chapter/article and the container
      are formatted in a specific way in MLA citations.

   Capitalize each word in the titles of journal articles, books, etc. Do not capitalize initial articles (the, an),
      prepositions, or conjunctions unless one is the first word of the title or subtitle.

   Italicize titles of containers and use quotation marks around titles of shorter works within them.
   The eighth edition recommends including URLs when you cite online sources. Always check with your instructor to

      confirm that you should include DOIs or URLs in your bibliography.
Detailed instructions about each element can be found on the OWL Purdue MLA site.

333 | MLA Citation Style
How to Cite and Reference with MLA

When paraphrasing ideas or summarizing the facts in a piece of writing, parenthetical citation is used to credit the
original author. You do this by including the author's last name and the page number(s) in parentheses at the end of the
sentence:

          The media is more interested in reporting on Serena's appearance than her spectacular athletic abilities (Schultz
       338).
   Another method is to include the author's name in the sentence with the page number(s) in parentheses at the end of
the sentence.

          Schultz argues that the media is more interested in writing about Serena's appearance than her spectacular
       athletic abilities (338).
   Include the full reference of the journal article in the Works Cited list.

          Schultz, Jaime. "Reading the catsuit: Serena Williams and the production of blackness at the 2002 US Open."
       Journal of Sport and Social Issues, 29(3), 2005, pp. 338-357.
   In this MLA example of in-text citing, the author's name is used in the introductory phrase (a.k.a. signal phrase), the
page number is in parentheses and follows the sentence:

          According to Ruffo, his poems were meant to create a connection between the paintings and actual events in
       Morrisseau's life (9).
   Include the full reference in the bibliography at the end of your paper like this:

Remember!
At the university level, writing essays means entering an ongoing scholarly conversation. Throughout history scholars
have addressed the subjects you are studying in your courses and have articulated similar concerns and ideas as the ones
discussed in your classes. Engaging with existing scholarship and citing in your essay makes you part of the conversation.
Congratulations!

Document Your Research As You Go! (or, How Not
to Cry When Creating a Bibliography)

Writing an essay begins with gathering evidence -- reading, looking for themes and patterns, following leads to other
texts, and taking notes. As you read the work of other scholars and think about your approach to the topic, make it a
habit to keep track of where you found the ideas and themes that spark your interest. Always note the author, date,
and title in your notes to ensure you can find that source again. Keeping careful track also reduces errors in your final
bibliography, which is a key part of your essay. Details are important. Citations include names of people, titles, dates and
volume numbers. Formatting styles including punctuation.

   These details are easy to keep track of when you use a citation manager. Citation managers (a.k.a. reference managers)
are software programs that allow you to save and organize your citations, and quickly create bibliographies for your
assignments. Using a digital tool will save you so much time when referring back to your sources and writing your paper
and preparing your bibliography.

FOR THE INSTRUCTOR

345 | For the Instructor
Chapter 1: Time is on Your Side

   For the Instructor

     Provide your students with a short article they can analyze and submit online for evaluation. Commit some
     class time to discussing the interesting and challenging words they found and how their initial observations and
     questions about these words can lead to an interrogative and focused thesis.
     It would also be useful to assign your students the observational paragraph from the end of the chapter to take
     up in small groups during class time. This will allow for peer feedback and provide you with additional writing on
     which to give direct feedback.
     In class:

         1. Bring in an image and ask the students to analyze it using the skills detailed above. The image could be a
             piece of art or an advertisement. Have the students make multiple and miniscule observations and
             encourage them to develop the most outlandish, controversial claim they can make while making use of
             specifics from the image. All inferences and claims must be connected to some actual aspect of the image.

                              Advertising is hard to escape. Learning to analyze it is a useful skill. From Pixabay/CC0 1.0

        2. Organize students into groups of 3-5 and have them analyze an unseen text you will provide them in class.
             Give the students time to compile information using the techniques detailed in this chapter. But rather
             than simply observing what is there, ask them develop an opening sentence indicative of a challenging,

347 | Chapter 1: Time is on Your Side
        scholarly reading. Don't let students rely on phrases like "This text is about..." Encourage them to begin
        their examination into the motivations of the author. Require your students to consider why the author is
        writing, exactly what is at stake, and exactly how the author best conveys this message. Ask the students
        to produce a sentence following this format:
In "[Name of Article]," [Name of Author] uses citable textual evidence in order to feasible but controversial claim
about what this text is really doing .
Have the students share and critique their answers.
     Which claim was the most controversial?
     Which claim promises the most interesting reading?

                                                                                                                                    Chapter 1: Time is on Your Side | 348
Chapter 2: Evidence

   For the Instructor

     1. Provide your students with a short article they can analyze in an hour of class time. Organize students into
     groups of 4 or 5 and have each group work toward creating their two-storey opening. If possible, make special
     note of two openings that are contradictory but equally plausible. It is important to always reiterate to students
     that there are no "right" or "wrong" readings. Perhaps discuss ways to develop both of these contradictory
     readings into "A" level analytical papers.
     2. Consider running a midterm workshop in class. Ask students to bring their blueprints to class. Pair them up in
     a peer-review exercise. Each student should evaluate the their partner's chosen focus in the first storey and then
     rate the interest and controversy of the claim in the second storey.

349 | Chapter 2: Evidence
Chapter 3: The Full Three-Storey Thesis

   For the Instructor

     1. This is a good time to introduce more lengthy scholarly articles or long-form articles from a well-respected
     popular publications. This will give the students more complex documents on which to practice the reading
     skills and techniques outlined in the first three chapters. Additionally, it will introduce the students to scholarly
     concepts that they can then use in their argumentative essay in the second half of the semester. In our own
     courses we use a 1969 interview of Marshall McLuhan in Playboy Magazine, which has been republished on the
     Next Nature Network blog.
     2. If you plan to give students class time to prepare for the midterm, you can assign some of the early stages
     of close reading. Ask students to write a three-storey thesis statement in response to their chosen midterm
     article(s). They should bring their three-storey to class for peer assessment.

     In class:
     This week's class will likely be split into two components. In the first, if you have not done so already, have the
     students read the midterm articles, do a slow analysis of it (as outlined in Chapter 1) and build a two-storey thesis
     in response (Chapter 2). If you have already completed this in a previous week, have the students pair up and,
     using the short evaluation form embedded in this chapter, have them give each other a score for their thesis
     statements. Then have the students use this feedback to write a second draft of that two-storey thesis and, when
     finished, have their partner evaluate it again. Lastly, in line with the content of this chapter, have them add a third
     storey to their edited thesis and share with a partner. In particular, when evaluating the third storey, have the
     students look at their partner's thesis and answer whether their third storey addresses the questions from earlier
     in this chapter:

          Is the author arguing that something must be done? Why?
          Is the author offering a solution to a problem raised earlier in the text?
          Is the author warning of specific further consequences that will arise from a problem raised earlier in the

             text?
          What does the author want their reader to leave the text thinking and/or doing?

     Before meeting in class, assign your students a more lengthy scholarly or well-respected popular article. In the
     second half of the class, break the students up into groups of 4 or 5 and give each of them a small portion of
     the text to read and analyze as experts. Ask the students, in groups, to read their excerpt and provide the key
     patterns, opposites, new words found within their passage (Chapter 1). After the group has done this, ask them to
     build a two-storey thesis in response to their excerpt. Once this has been completed, have each group present
     their observations and thesis statement to the class.
     This activity will provide the opportunity for class discussion and a more theoretical lecture component to the
     class.After reading a scholarly article, students can begin talking about the complex ideas in the text and linking
     those ideas to the issues in their own lives that they are interested in writing about further. Ideally, this second
     component of class time will reiterate the close-reading and thes building skills established in the first three

                                                                                                                             Chapter 3: The Full Three-Storey Thesis | 350
     chapters of the text as well as introduce some topics and ideas that students can think and write about as part of
     the final essay in the second half of the semester.

351 | Chapter 3: The Full Three-Storey Thesis
Chapter 4: Getting From Your Thesis To Your Essay

   For the Instructor

     As you have been working towards having the students prepare for their midterm close reading, it is best that
     you have them bring in a three-storey thesis to this class (as discussed in Chapter 3). It makes sense that they
     bring in a sample three-storey thesis statement in response to the midterm articles that you have assigned. This
     particular class is a very useful one for giving specific and direct one-on-one feedback on those thesis statements
     and giving the students activities that they can do on their own or in pairs will free you to look at student thesis
     statements and give specific feedback on their writing.
     In class:
     Have the students look at the thesis statements they wrote in response to the midterm articles and evaluate
     each other's work using the evaluation form earlier in this chapter. Have the students discuss their own thesis
     statements and give their partners suggestions and feedback. Again, while they work in pairs, you can circulate
     and give specific direct feedback on their writing.
     After they have completed this, have them rewrite their thesis statements with a specific focus on the third storey.
     By the end of this activity they should have a full revised three-storey thesis statement. You could then have them
     meet with their partners again and share this new revised version, getting them to give each other feedback on
     this new version and respond to the edits that were made. Pausing to showcase exemplary student examples is a
     good way to model positive modes of writing and raise morale.
     Lastly, have them take this new full thesis statement and expand it into an essay outline, as mapped out earlier
     in this chapter. It may be useful to walk them through an example, focusing on identifying the small components
     in their thesis statements that deserve their own paragraph(s). Again, this is an opportunity to circulate around
     the class and give further individual feedback. Once they have completed their essay outline, have them resume
     working in pairs and walk their partner through the logical process of their proposed argument without looking
     at their outline. Having the students explain their arguments anew will demonstrate how well they understand
     their own thesis and the author's argument. After this, have the partners evaluate each other's essay outlines and
     give feedback on the logical flow and cohesion of their partner's argument.

                                                                                                              Chapter 4: Getting From Your Thesis To Your Essay | 352
Chapter 5: Maintaining Focus and Purpose: The Body
Paragraphs

   For the Instructor

     When our students reach this stage of the writing process in our courses we like to dedicate a class to the In-
     Class Midterm Essay Draft Exchange. We identify a "draft" as the close reading essay-in-process and we require
     each student to come to class with at least one typed double-spaced page of their essay. We ask that each student
     provide a complete introductory paragraph and at least one complete body paragraph. It is understood that this
     document is a draft, and while we ask our students to produce their best work, we let them know that their essays
     will still undergo several changes before they are ready to submit the final product.
     We remind students that an introductory paragraph must contain a three-storey thesis in which they use the
     information gathered through analysis to establish a focus, stake a claim, and explain the purpose of the proposed
     essay. For the purposes of this assignment, we ask our students to underline the first storey, italicize the second
     storey, and bold the third storey. We have discovered that this is beneficial in both the writing and review
     processes. For the student writing the thesis, the different fonts make visible the connections between the storeys
     and, most importantly, make visible which storeys need to be lengthened or shortened. If a student's introduction
     is almost entirely underlined while containing only a few bolded words, it should be obvious to that student that
     too much time is being dedicated to textual material and not enough time is being committed to establishing the
     student's particular reading. Differentiating the storeys by font is also beneficial in the review process as students
     new to this way of writing can use the visual aid when assessing the parts of a three-storey thesis.
     We put students in groups of three so each student gives and receives two sets of feedback. If time permits, we
     also like to have each group meet with the instructor for debriefing and additional feedback before they leave the
     class. We encourage students to write on each other's drafts and we also provide them with a feedback sheet with
     direct questions about various aspects of the draft:

             Introduction/Working Thesis
             1. Can you identify the writer's thesis?

                    1. What is the text-grounded focus identified in the first storey?
                    2. Does the second storey contain a controversial claim? If so, what is it?
                    3. Does the author explain the significance of his/her analysis in the third storey?
             2. Does the thesis make a claim that is unique to the text the author is analyzing? Does the author
             use general language and terminology that could be applied to almost any essay? If applicable, please
             identify the generalizing terms or phrases and suggest more (text-)specific alternatives.

353 | Chapter 5: Maintaining Focus and Purpose: The Body
Paragraphs
       3. Is the thesis clear? Do you understand exactly the sort of reading the author is proposing? Do you
       have any suggestions to help the author establish his/her thesis?

       Body Paragraph(s)
       1. Does the paragraph have a topic sentence? What is the main point or claim of the paragraph?
       2. Does the author use textual evidence and/or quotations? Too much? Not enough?
       3. Does the paragraph contain a warrant? Does the author explain adequately how the evidence
       supports the claim?

We require each student to answer each question as thoroughly as possible, and we make it clear that simple
yes/no answers are not acceptable. We typically make the In-Class Midterm Essay Draft Exchange an assignment
worth 5% of the term grade, and this tends to incentivize maximum participation. This is one of our favourite
classes of the term as students grow comfortable with sharing their work while they experience and enjoy the
benefit of the in-class writing workshop.

                                                                                    Chapter 5: Maintaining Focus and Purpose: The Body Paragraphs | 354
Chapter 6: One Last Time Before You Go: The
Conclusion and Final Review

   For the Instructor

     To help students write their conclusions, have them review the evidence they gathered but did not include in the
     thesis or body paragraphs. They should try to identify a piece of evidence that pushes their claim to its ultimate
     extension. Have them begin drafting conclusions in which they cite and analyze that evidence.
     To help students compose their final lines, ask them to consider what their focused, purposeful readings have
     revealed about the text. Then, ask them what still needs to be said before they leave their analysis of this article?
     Have some fun with creating titles for their essays. Encourage students to consider titles that reflect the approach
     they are taking in their essays. According to your taste, encourage puns, or alliteration, or other forms of clever
     wordplay. Steer them away from "Midterm" or "Essay Number One" toward titles that invest a little of their
     personality into their essay.

355 | Chapter 6: One Last Time Before You Go: The Conclusion
and Final Review
Chapter 7: Making Your Own Argument

   For the Instructor

     Part II of this textbook leads your students through the second half of the semester as they build their final essay.
     We have found it essential to stress that while the focus of the assignment shifts from analyzing someone else's
     argument to the students building their own arguments, the mechanics learned in Part I are the same as the
     mechanics in Part II. In our experience, students often repeat the assignment from Part I in their work for Part II
     and will need clarification and discussion in the shifts in purpose and scope that the assignment asks.
     Just like the close reading in Part I, it would be useful for your students to come into class with some work
     already done. Create your essay prompts and give them to the students before they come to class this week. We've
     generated some sample prompts as part of the Introduction to Part II of this textbook if you would like some
     examples.
     We recommend having your students come to class having read the chapter, chosen a prompt and having done
     a close reading of their prompt (which you could also check as homework). Additionally, if you have them think
     about, if not choose, what their central document will be, you could do some of the activities outlined in the
     chapter with their chosen central document.
     In Class
     As these are the first steps of the final project for the course, you will likely want to go over the assignment
     guidelines and the prompts with your class.
     As well, we recommend doing a number of the activities that are done within this chapter in class with your
     students and their specific central documents. In particular, you may want to spend time reaffirming what a short,
     focused central document is and helping them find one and then write a paragraph explaining why they have
     chosen it. Once you do that, have them do a close reading of that document, stressing that their two pieces of
     evidence must be specific. The A-level example used here is useful as a guide but using your students' work as a
     model is also effective.
     It would be ideal if your students could create a draft of the two-storey thesis and share it with a partner by
     the end of the class. This will also allow the students to begin thinking about and working on finding and using
     scholarly research in the coming weeks.
     In our sections of the course, this is also the time when we plan to, within the next few weeks, take the students to
     the library to do some research with a professional librarian. As such, having the students complete a first draft
     of their two-storey thesis in class will allow them to answer some of the questions from the end of this chapter for
     themselves which will then make their research more focused and relevant. If you have time, have the students
     answer the questions in class to prepare to begin moving into undertaking scholarly research:

          What words or phrases in my thesis might need further scholarly definitions?
          What types of statistics might be useful to support my argument?
          What discipline am I writing within? Who are the experts within that discipline?

                                                                                                                              Chapter 7: Making Your Own Argument | 356
          Are there other terms or words that might be useful search terms when looking for scholarly research
             about my argument?

Chapter 8: Gathering Research and Establishing
Evidence

   For the Instructor

     This would be a perfect time to contact your library to book a session with a librarian. This will give your students
     an opportunity visit your institution's library and learn about the research process. To prepare for the library visit,
     disseminate a library research assignment that helps students develop a research question or thesis statement
     and then create a research strategy using the library databases that will uncover two scholarly sources. Students
     should also be asked explain how they plan to use the two scholarly sources and cite them using an appropriate
     citation convention (MLA, APA, Chicago, etc.)

   For the Librarian

     The focus of instruction should be the hands-on activity of finding two scholarly articles. To achieve this, it
     is recommended that you adopt an online/flipped version of research instruction. Putting together an online
     resource to teach the basic research skills will give the students an opportunity to experiment with search
     practices in order to find relevant resources using library databases. They will utilize their critical checklist to
     identify scholarly sources.
     In our practice, we developed this example libguide that serves as an online tutorial to be read before coming to
     the library. During the library visit, we suggest ten or fifteen minutes to quickly go over the online modules. We
     used the free online quiz game kahoots to review the material. The rest of the class was spent searching for two
     articles and both the librarian and instructor were available for consultation and assistance..

                                                                                                     Chapter 8: Gathering Research and Establishing Evidence | 358
Chapter 9: Towards the Well-Researched Paper

   For the Instructor

     At this point in the course, your students should have chosen the subject matter of their research assignments
     and started to examine it closely. They should also have started their research. Some of the problems mentioned
     in the "Instructor" section of Ch. 7 may be more apparent by this point; students may, for instance, be treating
     the research assignment like a repeat of the close reading (choosing one article and analysing it). It's important to
     convince students that they can apply the concepts from Part I to the different type of evidence discussed in Part
     II.
     We recommend that you require your students to read the chapter before class and bring to class the three-
     storey thesis and outline they should have been developing while working through the chapter.
     In Class:
     This is a good class in which to workshop the thesis statements and outlines the students have come up with.
     Students unable or unwilling to see the flaws in their own work will more easily see it in the work of their peers.
     Group work or class-wide discussion of samples from a few students will allow students to begin revising and
     refining their thesis statements in light of the evidence they have collected. It will also allow students to recognise
     thesis statements that lean towards vagueness or summary.
     By the end of the class, students should have some idea of the future direction of their research and should have
     begun the process of refining and developing their thesis statements.

359 | Chapter 9: Towards the Well-Researched Paper
Chapter 10: Joining the Conversation: Primary
Sources, Secondary Sources, and You

   For the Instructor

     At this point in the writing process it is a good idea to once again dedicate a class to an essay draft exchange.
     Similar to the In-Class Midterm Essay Draft Exchange we detail in our "For the Instructor" section in Chapter 5,
     we identify a "draft" as the research essay-in-process and while we ask our students to put in a solid effort for
     this exercise, we remind them that among the many benefits of the In-Class Research Essay Draft Exchange is the
     receiving and implementing of feedback. It is important to remind students that their essays will undergo several
     changes before they are ready to submit the final product. In our introductory writing courses, we require each
     student to come to class with at least two typed double-spaced pages of their essay. We ask that each student
     provide a complete introductory paragraph and at least three complete body paragraphs. Once again, we ask our
     students to underline the first storey, italicize the second storey, and bold the third storey of the three-storey
     thesis.
     As we did in the previous draft exchange, we put students in groups of three so each student gives and receives
     two sets of feedback. If time permits, we also like to have each group meet with the instructor for debriefing and
     additional feedback before they leave the class. We encourage students to write on each other's drafts and we
     also provide them with a feedback sheet with direct questions about various aspects of the draft:

             Introduction/Thesis Statement
                1. Can you identify the writer's thesis? Does the introduction do more than announce the topic?
                     Paraphrase the thesis statement.
                2. Does the thesis make a claim that is unique to the subject the author is analyzing? Does the
                     author use general language and terminology that could be applied to almost any essay? If
                     applicable, please identify the generalizing terms or phrases and suggest more (subject-
                     )specific alternatives.
                3. Is the thesis clear? Do you understand exactly t
                     he sort of reading the author is proposing? Do you have any suggestions to help the author
                     establish his/her thesis?

                                                                                                 Chapter 10: Joining the Conversation: Primary Sources, Secondary
                                                                                                                                                             Sources, and You | 360
             Paragraph Structure and Coherence
                1. Does the structure of the essay make sense? Does it flow logically?
                2. Are there paragraphs that are repetitive? Is so, which ones?
                3. Are there paragraphs that need to be separated and expanded because there is too much
                     material? Which ones?
                4. Are there topic sentences that need to be revised or transitions that need to be rewritten?
                     Where? Be sure to share with your partner your editorial suggestions.

             The Central Document and Research
             Is the central document defined clearly in the introduction?
             Does the author analyze a new aspect if the central document in every paragraph? What are these new
             aspects? Are these aspects supported through primary evidence?
             Does the author stray from his/her analysis of the central document? Does s/he fall into the five
             paragraph essay form of touching on several examples? Are there places where s/he needs to get back
             on track?
             Does the author apply secondary, scholarly sources when analyzing his/her central document? What
             works? What doesn't?

     As before, we require each student to answer each question as thoroughly as possible, making it clear that
     simple yes/no answers are not acceptable, and we typically make the In-Class Research Essay Draft Exchange an
     assignment worth 5% of the term grade. As the topics for the research paper are so varied, this is an excellent
     learning opportunity or students to distinguish between introducing a topic and analyzing a topic. A student
     reader unfamiliar with a student writer's chosen central document is situated ideally to provide some useful
     feedback on what we have discovered to be one of the most challenging aspects of the first-year research paper. Is
     the author's central document clearly defined? Most importantly, is the author's analysis of the central document
     clear and constant? Does the author fall into a simple summary of the subject matter? We have found that this
     peer-to-peer exercise helps students recognize and eliminate those moments where they rely on passive relaying
     of facts and evidence. Explaining their particular reading to their peers, students simultaneously gain confidence
     in their arguments and recognize the importance of building their essays around their readings of the subject
     matter.

Chapter 11: Editing and Evolving the Thesis and
Outline

   For the Instructor

     In class, have your students bring in one of the scholarly sources that they think they may use and have them read
     it again carefully, annotating their reading. This can be done with either a hard copy or an online version. If they
     are reading an online version, ensure that they are using the annotation settings on their PDF reader to makes
     notes as they go along.
     At the end of the their reading ask them to identify:

             3 definitions of key terms the author provides in the work.
             3 statistics or number-based evidence the author uses.
             2 key quotes that may be useful to their argument.
             2 sources from the Bibliography or Works Cited that may also be useful to read.

     Once they have completed that checklist, have them imagine where each piece of information might fit within
     their essay (i.e. where might this definition fit best? At what stage of my argument?). Remind them that they don't
     have to use all the information they found, but they should at least consider it.
     Once they have a rough idea where the information might work, have them write a body paragraph incorporating
     in one of the pieces of research that adds to and clarifies their argument.
     At any point during this process, it may be helpful to have the students share with each other in small groups or
     pairs.

                                                                                                        Chapter 11: Editing and Evolving the Thesis and Outline | 362
Chapter 12: What Have I Accomplished? Conclusion
and Final Assessment

   For the Instructor

     It may be useful to pair the discussion of conclusions in this chapter with some readings containing strong
     conclusions. Give such readings to your students, either online or in-class in the weeks leading up to the final day
     of class. Pointing to one or two examples of what you consider an excellent
     conclusion would be very helpful in demonstrating the skill for the students.
     In Class:
     It is very likely that this is your last day of class. Students will be submitting their papers and you may be doing
     Final Exam preparation, if your class has a final exam. It may be helpful to take time, as a class, to reflect on the
     progress the students have made throughout the semester and have them think more specifically about their
     writing and writing process. Beginning in pairs, ask them to answer the questions from earlier in this chapter
     (feeling free, of course, to add your own):

          In what ways do you think you've most improved?
          What do you think is the most important skill to have when writing academically?
          What do you think is the most important skill to have when reading academically?
          What skills are you most likely to carry into writing in your other courses?
          How much time did you spend writing? In what stage of writing did you spend your most time?
          How much time did you spend editing? In what stage of editing did you spend your most time?
          What would you like to work on with your writing going forward?
          What is the one thing you would recommend to a first year university student about writing academically?
     While having the students answer these questions on their own and then again in class may seem on the surface
     a bit redundant, it is useful for students to hear what other students think and feel about their own writing and
     about academic writing in general. The goal of the in-class asking and answering of these questions is to build
     upon the solitary thinking the student does by asking those students to listen to and compare themselves to their
     peers. After giving time to have the students talk in pairs, come back and ask the questions again as a class and
     have the students share their own experiences in the larger group setting.

Assessment
Chapter 13: Works Cited

   For the Instructor

     Before class, prepare a set of citations in MLA and APA that have mistakes in them; also bring in the basic
     information for four or five articles that will need to be cited. Try to get a variety of sources (a webpage, a journal
     article etc)
     In class have the students get into small groups and "correct" the mistaken citations. You could even make a small
     game of this, making the groups teams that are competing against each other.
     After this, in the same groups, give them the basic information for the four or five articles and have them cite
     them correctly in MLA and then APA. Again, this could be done as a competition.

                                                                                                                                                   Chapter 13: Works Cited | 364
The Control-F List, opens new window
   The Ctrl-F is a tool meant to help you identify broad words so that you can choose more specific vocabulary in your

revision process. When applying the Ctrl-F list to your thesis, the intent is not to say that you should never use words like
"society" or "people," but rather to say that those words are so ambiguous and general that they retain very little value.
Instead, you should say what you mean! Instead of "society" or "people," you mean "2017 first year university students in
Canada." Hit "ctrl-f" and plug the following words into your essay to see how often you are using them. In particular, look
back through your thesis, and essay as a whole, and ensure that you are replacing those broad terms with language that
speaks more directly to the author's audience and the complex argument they are making.
